Her husband was Tuoba Gui's father Tuoba Shi (拓拔寔), the heir apparent of the Dai prince Tuoba Shiyijian (拓拔什翼犍). (However, for reasons why this account may have its problems, see here -- in particular, note below with regard to description of the parentage of Tuoba Gu (拓拔觚).) Dangerous Times Lady Helan was a daughter of the Helan tribal chief Helan Yegan (賀蘭野干), an important general under Tuoba Shiyijian. Because of her beauty, Tuoba Shiyijian selected her to be the wife of his son Tuoba Shi. In 371, when the general Baba Jin (拔拔斤) attempted to assassinate Tuoba Shiyijian, Tuoba Shi took the blunt of the assault personally to protect his father, and he died later that year. After Tuoba Shi's death, Heiress Apparent Helan gave birth to Tuoba Gui. In 377, after Tuoba Shiyijian was assassinated by his son Tuoba Shijun (拓拔寔君), Dai fell to Former Qin forces. Initially, she took Tuoba Gui to Helan tribe to be taken under the protection of her brother Helan Na (賀蘭訥), but later went to be under the protection of the Xiongnu chief Liu Kuren (劉庫仁). Not much was known about Lady Helan or her son for a number of years. In 384, after Former Qin had begun to collapse in light of its defeat at the Battle of Fei River, Liu Kuren tried to aid the Former Qin prince Fu Pi, but was assassinated by his own general Muyu Chang (慕輿常). His son Liu Xian (劉顯) later tried to kill Tuoba Gui, but Lady Helan heard the news and allowed her son to flee. Later, both were again at Helan tribe, when similarly her brother Helan Rangan (賀蘭染干) tried to kill Tuoba Gui, but stopped after she interceded. Seat of Power After Tuoba Gui redeclared the Dai state as its prince with Helan Na's support in 386 and later changed the state's name to Wei, Lady Helan was honored as princess dowager. In 391, when Tuoba Gui sent his younger brother and her son Tuoba Gu as a messenger to Later Yan to pay tribute, Tuoba Gu was detained by Later Yan, and it was said that she grew ill from her worries for him. She died in 396. (The problem with this account is that if Tuoba Shi had died before Tuoba Gui's death, than she could not have had an even younger son by him—but of course, she might have married another member of the Tuoba clan, perhaps Tuoba Shi's younger brother Tuoba Han (拓拔翰), for Tuoba Gu was also referred to as the younger brother of Tuoba Han's son Tuoba Yi (拓拔儀).) After Tuoba Gui declared himself emperor around the new year 399, he posthumously honored Tuoba Shi as an emperor and her as an empress.

Her mother Woizero Aselefech Wolde Hanna was the niece of Empress Taitu Bitul, consort of Emperor Menelik II of Ethiopia. Through her paternal great- grandmother, she was a member of the Imperial Solomonic dynasty of Ethiopia. Her father died while she was still very young. Yeshashework was raised in the Imperial Palace nursery alongside other children of royal blood during the reign of Menelik II, such as Lij Iyasu. Shortly after her uncle Ras Taffari Makonnen became Crown Prince and Regent of Ethiopia in 1917, Yeshashwork was given in marriage to the much older Leul Ras Gugsa Araya Selassie, Prince of Eastern Tigray, and grandson of Emperor Yohannes IV. As the wife of Leul Ras Gugsa, she was given the title of \\"Leult\\" (Princess) by Empress Zauditu, with the dignity of \\"Her Highness\\". Ras Gugsa died not long afterwards, and the widowed Princess returned to Addis Ababa from Mekele. In 1930, her uncle became Emperor Haile Selassie, and she was granted the title of Princess in her own right with the dignity of \\"Her Imperial Highness\\" as the daughter of his elder brother. Princess Yeshashework's second husband, Bitwoded Makonnen Demissew, perished at Amba Aradam while fighting the Italian invasion of 1936. The Princess accompanied the rest of the Imperial family into exile, living primarily in Jerusalem until 1941. After the restoration, Princess Yeshashework married Ras Bitwoded Makonnen Endelkachew, head of the powerful aristocratic Adisge clan. He was a veteran of the war and a fellow former exile, who became the first Prime Minister of Ethiopia. It was an unarranged love match, a rarity at that time in Ethiopian aristocratic marriages. John Spencer recounts an anecdote of the two coming into conflict over gourmant Makonnen enjoying the fine dining at the Shepherds Hotel in Cairo during the Lenten fast to the chagrin of his devout wife.Spencer, Ethiopia at Bay: A personal account of the Haile Selassie years (Algonac: Reference Publications, 1984), p. 162 Widowed for a third and final time in 1963, the Princess spent some time in seclusion in the Holy Land, and returned to take up some state duties as a member of the Imperial family, accompanying the Emperor on some foreign trips, and being part of the royal party at state functions inside the country as well. Along with other senior royal women, she often acted as an official hostess for her uncle the Emperor. She was arrested upon the seizure of power by the Derg regime 11 September 1974, and was imprisoned with the other women of the Imperial family. The Princess suffered poor health while in prison, but along with the other women was denied medical care.Spencer, Ethiopia at Bay, p. 340 and note She died a few months after her release from prison in 1982 and was buried at the church at her former estate at Reppi, just south of Addis Ababa.

The general word for ghost is hantu, of which there exist a wide variety. Some ghost concepts such as the female vampires pontianak and penanggal are shared throughout the region. While traditional belief doesn't consider all ghosts as necessarily evil, Malaysian popular culture tends to categorise them all as types of evil djinn. History Traditional ghost beliefs are rooted in prehistoric animist beliefs. However, the region has long had extensive contact with other cultures, and these have affected the form of some of the legends. Trade links with southern India and China were established several centuries BCE, in large part shaping the local culture and folklore. The Indian faiths of Hinduism and Buddhism were particularly influential in Southeast Asia. Islam was also introduced from India, and had become the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century. The Muslim beliefs overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences, rather than eradicating them altogether. One example is the festival of Mandi Safar, originally a Tamil Hindu practice where people bathe in the sea or river and perform ceremonies that purify and protect against sickness and misfortune, and which also serves to introduce marriageable young people. After the introduction of Islam it was given new meaning as a festival to celebrate the recovery of Mohammed from an illness. The ritual has long been banned in Malaysia on the grounds that it contravenes the teaching of Islam, but continues to be practised in Malaysia and Indonesia. Traditional beliefs According to traditional Malay lore, the human soul (semangat or essence) is about the size of a thumb and appears as a miniature form of the body (sarung or casing) in which it resides. Able to fly and quickly \\"flash\\" from one location to another, the soul is often compared to and addressed as if it were a bird. It temporarily leaves the person's body during sleep, trance and sickness, before departing permanently at death. When the soul leaves the body it assumes the form of a sort of homunculus, and in this form can feed on the souls of others. At death, the soul usually passes into another person, animal or plant. The spirit or ghost, usually called hantu, continues to linger and may be harmful to its survivors. An old Malay belief is that a person's ghost haunts their grave for seven days before departing. Ghosts may also return and take possession of a living person, causing madness or illness. Ghosts are generally believed to be active only at night time, especially during a full moon. One way to evade such a ghost is for all the victims to formally change their name, so that when the ghost returns it will not recognise them. Another method is to tempt the ghost with a meal. When the ghost turns into an animal such as a chicken so that it can eat, it may be killed and destroyed. Ghosts traditionally were blamed for some illnesses. To cure them, the shaman (dukun or bomoh) in a village would burn incense, recite incantations, and in some cases sacrifice an animal and wash its blood into a river to appease the ghost. Healing dances may also be performed, such as the mak yong, saba, main puteri, or the Ulek Mayang. Birth-spirits Childbirth-spirits are ghosts which are in some way related to birth or pregnancy. A significant number of them are the malignant spirits of stillborn children, while others prey on infants. All are a reflection of a formerly high infant mortality rate. Bajang A kind of familiar spirit acquired by a male who says the proper incantations over the newly buried body of a stillborn child. It takes the form of a civet or musang and may cause convulsions, unconsciousness or delirium. In exchange, its master feeds it eggs and milk. As with other spirits of this type, a bajang may turn on its master if it is neglected. Although a bajang can be made to attack any whom its master chooses, it is considered particularly dangerous to infants and young children. In former times, some children would be given \\"bajang bracelets\\" (gelang bajang) made of black silk to protect them against it, and sharp metal objects such as scissors would be placed near babies for the same purpose. Even the striations of pregnancy are somewhat jokingly said to be the scars left by a bajang's attack. Lang suir Also spelled langsuir or lang suyar, it is said to be the ghost of a woman who died while giving birth to a stillborn child which turns into a pontianak, or during pregnancy before the forty days of uncleanness have expired. The mother's grief changes her into a type of flying banshee. To prevent a pregnant woman's corpse from becoming a lang suir, glass beads are placed into the mouth, an egg is placed in each armpit, and needles are placed in the hands. The lang suir can appear as a beautiful woman with long nails (a traditional mark of beauty), ankle-length hair and dressed in green. They also have the ability to take the form of an owl with long talons. Being fond of eating fish, they usually haunt coastal areas and attack pregnant women out of jealousy. It is possible to tame a lang suir by cutting off her long nails and stuffing the hair into the hole at the back of her neck. Pontianak Also known as matianak or kuntilanak, it is the ghost of a stillborn female. To prevent this, as with its mother the lang suir, a needle is placed in each of the corpse's hands and a hen's egg under each armpit. Depicted as an ugly woman with sharp nails and a white dress, the pontianak can also take the form of a beautiful young woman or a night-bird. When she is close, she gives off a strong smell of frangipani. It is usually encountered by the roadside or under a tree, and attack men and drink their blood. The Indonesian kuntilanak, however, typically uses its bird form to attack virgin women. The bird, which makes a \\"ke-ke-ke\\" sound as it flies, may be sent through black magic to make a woman sick, the characteristic symptom being vaginal bleeding. A pontianak can be made into a good wife, by placing a nail into the hole at the nape of its neck (called Sundel Bolong). Modern popular culture often confuses the pontianak with its mother the lang suir. However, traditional myth is clear that the pontianak is the ghost of a dead baby and not a pregnant woman. A similar ghost called tiyanak exists in Philippine lore. Penanggal The penanggal is another type of female vampire attracted to the blood of newborn infants, which appears as the head of a woman from which her entrails trail, used to grasp her victim. There are several stories of her origins. One is that she was a woman who was sitting meditating in a large wooden vat used for making vinegar when she was so startled that her head jumped up from her body, pulling her entrails with it. Another has her as a normal woman during the day, whose head and entrails leave her body at night. If a baby is expected, branches from a type of thistle are placed around the doors or windows to protect the house, since her entrails will be caught by the thorns. The penanggalan is known in Thai as krasue and a similar Philippine ghost called the manananggal which preys on pregnant women with an elongated proboscis-like tongue. Toyol Often translated into English as \\"goblin\\", the toyol is actually a small child spirit invoked from a dead human fetus. Traditionally described as looking more or less like a naked or near-naked baby, modern depictions often give them green or brownish skin, large fangs, and sharp ears. The toyol may be used by its master to capture other people, or to do mischief. Because they are childlike in their thinking, valuables can be protected by scattering buttons on the floor, or leaving sweets or toys next to them, all of which will distract the toyol. It is said that the owner of a toyol may become rich, but at the expense of the health, fortune and even the lives of members of their family. Ghost as agents of shamans Shamans (known in Malay as dukun or bomoh) are said to be able to make use of spirits and demons for either benign or evil purposes. Although Western writings often compare this to the familiar spirits of English witchcraft, it actually corresponds more closely with the Japanese inugami and other types of shikigami, in that the spirits are hereditary and passed down through families. ;Polong A kind of bottled- imp, created by keeping the blood of a murder victim in a bottle and saying certain incantations over it for seven or fourteen days. The owner, who is treated as the polong's parent, must feed the spirit daily with blood from their neck. A person who has been afflicted by the polong will cry out and wildly strike at people nearby, all the while blind and deaf to their surroundings, and unconscious of what they are doing. In such cases, a bomoh would be called in to question the polong and find out who is its parent and where they are located. If the polong lies or conceals the identity of its owner, the victim will die after one or two days. ;Pelesit The pelesit is created from the tongue of a newly buried dead body whose mother was also the eldest of her siblings. Its appearance is that of a cricket and it is kept in a bottle which is buried if the owner wishes to rid herself of it. In advance of a polong's arrival, the pelesit will enter the body of whomever its mistress has told it to attack. A person who has been thus afflicted might rave about cats. The pelesit is in many ways comparable to the bajang, but whereas the bajang's owner is always male, the pelesit may only be kept by a female. It may be fed on blood from the tip of the fourth finger or, alternatively, with saffron rice. Like the polong, the pelesit can be forced to reveal the name of their owner through magical questioning. ;Hantu Raya The hantu raya (meaning \\"great ghost\\") is considered one of the most powerful of Malay ghosts. Possessing great strength, it usually takes on the appearance of its owner and carries out manual labour on their behalf. However, it is said to have a limited range, being unable to go far from its home. Other ghosts * Hantu Air (water spirits) live in large bodies of water, such as a river or lake. Some are said to be the ghosts of people who drowned, but they are generally independent spirits. If they show themselves, it is usually in the form of a floating log. They can be dangerous, and may drown or eat people. Until the 1960s, Malays in Trengganu would regularly pay respects to the sea spirits in the puja laut ceremony. * Hantu galah (pole ghost) is a very tall and thin ghost found among trees and bamboo. To make it disappear, a person simply picks up a stick or twig and breaks it. It is normally female. * Hantu tetek (nipple ghost) appears as an old woman with pendulous breasts.Hantu kopek * Hantu laut (sea spirits) are animistic water spirits who assist fishermen and sailors. Until the 1960s, Malays in Trengganu used to regularly pay respects to the sea spirits through the puja pantai or puja laut ceremony. *Jembalang tanah are earth demons, which may act dangerously if not appeased with the proper rituals. * Jenglot are doll-like vampiric creatures said to be found in the jungles. They are usually female. What are claimed to be dead jenglot are sometimes sold or exhibited, but they appear to be man- made. * Orang minyak (oily man) is a cursed man who rapes women at night. Because he is covered in oil, he's difficult to catch. * Pocong or hantu bungkus (wrapped ghost) is a ghost wrapped in a white burial shroud. When a dead person is buried, the shroud is supposed to be untied. If it remains tied at the top, the spirit is restless and the body becomes a pocong. Because they are tied at the feet, they move around by hopping in a manner similar to the Chinese jiangshi. In some depictions, they are able to fly. In popular culture In both Malaysia and Indonesia, ghosts and the supernatural have long been the popular subject of stories in television, documentaries, film, and magazines like Mastika and Tok Ngah. The 1958 black-and-white horror movie Sumpah Orang Minyak is one of many films based on the orang minyak concept. It told of a hunchback who through supernatural means becomes handsome, but turns invisible after violating his oath. The devil offers to help achieve his worldly desires, on condition that he rapes 21 girls within 7 days. Other Malay ghost films such as Pontianak and Revenge of Pontianak received tremendous response at their time of release. With the rise of the Islamisation movement, the Malaysian government suppressed production of local films involving ghosts out of concern that they would encourage superstition. However, access to foreign horror movies made such a ban futile, and these restrictions were eventually lifted with the release of Pontianak Harum Sundal Malam. The film was well-received, spawning a sequel and a follow-up TV series. Numerous other horror films followed suit but, in keeping with current religious trends, they usually portray all supernatural beings as evil, far removed from traditional beliefs. This is particularly so in documentaries and television series involving ghost hunters. In Hellboy: The Troll Witch and Others comics, Hellboy travels to Malaysia in 1958 where a village devoid of Bomoh shaman has fallen victim to a demonic penanggalan. A young guide leads him to the demon's cave, where Hellboy is met with a betrayal. 2007's Jangan Pandang Belakang (\\"Don't Look Back\\") holds the record as Malaysia's highest- grossing film. It centres around a malicious spirit which the hero had unknowingly brought to his fiancé's home after picking up a small jar found washed up at the beach. The 2010 Indonesian soft-porn horror movie Hantu Puncak Datang Bulan (The Menstruating Ghost of Puncak) caused considerable controversy at the time of its release. Telling the experiences of a group of young adults in a haunted house, it has much semi-nude sexuality, and has been condemned by conservative Muslim leaders.

This tractate begins the discussion of topics related to agriculture, the main focus of this seder (order) of the Mishnah. The tractate discusses the laws of gifts to the poor when a person harvests their field, vineyards or trees, based on commandments in the Torah. The tractate also deals with the laws of giving charity in general. The tractate is called Pe'ah because the first part of the tractate deals with the laws of Pe'ah, while the remaining part of the tractate deals with a number of other related topics. In addition to the Mishnah, a tractate Pe'ah exists in the Jerusalem Talmud (commenting on the Mishnah tractate), but not in the Babylonian Talmud. Topics This tractate discusses the gifts due to the poor when fields, vineyards or trees are harvested, and the laws of giving charity in general. Six categories of obligations are discussed in the tractate, as follows: # Pe'ah: \\"corner\\" - the portion of the crop that must be left standing for the poor, in accordance with and #\\"Leket\\": \\"gleanings\\" - ears of grain that fell from the reaper's hand or the sickle while the grain is being gathered during the harvest, as described in and ) #\\"Shich'chah\\": \\"forgotten sheaves\\" - sheaves left and forgotten in the field while the harvest is being brought to the threshing floor, as well as attached produce overlooked by the harvesters, as in #\\"Olelot\\" - immature clusters of grapes, as in and #\\"Peret\\" - grapes that fall from their clusters while being plucked from the vine, as in #\\"Ma'aser ani\\" - the tithe for the poor, every third and sixth year of the tithing cycle, as in and There are three gifts to the poor from the field: Pe'ah, Leket and Shich'chah; four gifts from the vineyard: Pe'ah, Shich'chah, Peret, and Olelot; and two from the trees: Pe'ah and Shich'chah. These gifts apply every year. In addition, in the third and sixth year of the Shmita cycle, a person is required to set aside the ma'aser ani (tithe for the poor). Structure and content The tractate consists of eight chapters and has a Gemara (rabbinical analysis of and commentary on the Mishnah) only in the Jerusalem Talmud. Chapters 1-4 deal with the obligation of Pe'ah. The end of chapter 4 and most of chapter 5 concern the laws of leket; the end of chapter 5 to the beginning of chapter 7 deals with the laws of shechicha. Chapters 7 and 8 discuss the laws of peret and olelot, followed by the laws of ma'aser ani and tzedakah (charity). Chapter eight discusses the laws of eligibility and entitlement to public charity, including tithes and agricultural gifts. It relates that Jewish communities maintained two kinds of charitable organizations: tamchuy and kuppah. One was for travelers, who were to be provided food and lodgings, including extra meals for the Sabbath. The other was the charity fund for the local poor. Both institutions were required to provide minimum quantities to the poor from funds collected by the local community. Of general interest are the first and last mishnayot in the tractate: The first mishna of tractate Pe'ah declares that there is no maximum limit to pe'ah (one can give as much of the produce in one's field to the poor as one desires once the harvest has begun), bikkurim (the first-fruits), the pilgrimage, acts of lovingkindness, and Torah study. After exhorting people to give their all to God and other people, the mishnah states that a person receives a reward in this world and in the next by honoring his father and mother, doing acts of lovingkindness, making peace between people, and that the study of Torah is equivalent to them all. Likewise, the concluding mishnah is a compilation of ethical homilies warning people against feigning poverty, improperly taking from charity and perverting justice. On the other hand, it lauds the poor person, who is eligible to be supported by charity, yet refuses public funds, working hard and living frugally. To such a person, the verse \\"Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord; and the Lord will be his trust\\" () applies. Liturgical uses The morning service in both the Ashkenazi and Sefardi liturgy begins with recital of blessings over the Torah, followed by brief selections from the Hebrew Bible, Mishna and Gemara, in accordance with a statement in the Talmud (Kiddushin 30a) that Torah learning comprises these three elements. The biblical text is the three verses of the Priestly Blessing, the Mishna is the first one from this tractate (Peah 1:1), about commandments that have no fixed measures, (including the mitzvah of Peah, and of learning Torah), and a passage from the Gemara (Shabbat 127a) about the reward for good deeds in this world and the next.

At the same time, Eddie likes making food, especially Eddie Dogs, which he preps after every game for him and his friends. Holding high expectations for him, Eddie's father wants him to win a scholarship for his baseball skills. Though Eddie likes baseball, he discovers an attraction to cooking after watching Bobby Flay on The Food Network. When the time comes for he and his friends to sign up for electives, Eddie encourages his friends that they should all sign up for computer science, as it is an easy elective. Eddie starts to question his choice however after he sees the home economics classroom. Eddie tricks his friends D.B. and Frankie into signing it so they all end up in home economics together. Eddie and his friends goof around and get into trouble frequently in class, but Eddie learns of a million dollar cook-off that can get him into a culinary institute. He signs up secretly, afraid of what his friends and family will think. Surprisingly, his mother learns of Eddie's interest in culinary arts and encourages him to go on. When Eddie's teacher announces to the class who is in the finals, everyone is shocked that Eddie actually entered and won. As a result, he is teased and humiliated relentlessly by his friends and the kids at school, as well as his brothers. Eddie starts spending more time on cooking and less on baseball. When his father learns of the cook-off, he is extremely disappointed. Eddie repeatedly switches between cooking and baseball as he struggles to decide between pleasing his father and pursuing his dream. In the process, he is laughed at and humiliated by nearly everyone, loses all of his friends except for Hannah who understands what its like not to be able to live up to a parent's expectations, and displeases his father. As it turns out, the day of the baseball finals and the day of the cook-off are the same, leaving Eddie to make the choice to please his father or follow his dreams. Eddie stops by the building where the competition is being held, only to find that his idol, Bobby Flay, is hosting. Ultimately, Eddie goes to the game for the sake of his father and friends, but cannot concentrate. Seeing the state he is in, his friends finally accept that he loves cooking and tell him to go to the cook- off and let them win on their own for once. With his friends now behind him, Eddie and his mother go to the cook-off, leaving his father stunned by his decision. He arrives an hour late and has no one to help him but he is determined to try his best. His friends watch the cook-off on a portable television in the dugout and see that Eddie is struggling as he has less time and no one to help. After hearing this, and seeing Hannah's mom finally supporting her, his father purposely gets himself kicked out of the game to go and help Eddie. Eddie is surprised by this, but his father proves to be a huge help during the cook off. Together, the two manage to complete the cook-off just in time. Eddie loses, but when confronted by Frankie, Bobby Flay says that he believes Eddie should have won. Eddie's father now supports him wholeheartedly and comforts him, telling him no matter what he does, he will support him from now on. Eddie's brothers even show up to finally support him after seeing the cook-off on TV. Eddie's team wins without him as his best friend, D.B., finally gets a hit.

It deals with the Jewish legal concept of demai, doubtfully tithed produce, and concerns the laws related to agricultural produce about which it is suspected that certain obligatory tithes have not been properly separated in accordance with requirements specified in the Torah. The tithes in question are ma'aser rishon (the first tithe, for the Levite), terumath ma'aser (the Levite's tithe to the kohen), and ma'aser sheni (the second tithe, for the owner to consume in Jerusalem) or ma'aser ani (the tithe for the poor), depending on the year of the Sabbatical year cycle. The tractate consists of seven chapters and has a Gemara only in the Jerusalem Talmud. There is a Tosefta of eight chapters for this tractate. Etymology The etymology of the word \\"demai\\" is uncertain, and it seems that the rabbis of the Talmud were unclear about it. The Amoraim of the second generation (250–290 C.E.) seem to derive it from an Aramaic question meaning \\"whether?\\" signifying \\"is this tithed or not?\\" The Jerusalem Talmud connects it to the root d-m-y, in the sense of \\"perhaps\\" as in \\"perhaps he prepared it [the tithe], perhaps he did not prepare it.\\" It is possibly a linguistic parallel to the opposite term, vadai, \\"certain.\\" Other explanations, cited by Nathan ben Jehiel, the author of the Talmudic lexicon, the Arukh (11th century C.E.) also derive the meaning from Aramaic expressions, such as din ma'i or da ma'i, meaning \\"what is this the law\\" or \\"what is this?\\" in reference to the produce that is subject to tithing. Benjamin Musaphia, the annotator of the Arukh (17th century C.E.) understands that the word originates from the Greek word demos, people, meaning produce of the am ha-aretz, the ordinary \\"people of the land\\" about whom there was doubt whether all were sufficiently knowledgeable or careful about observing the laws concerning tithes. Subject matter  This tractate concerns the laws regarding agricultural produce about which there is a doubt as to whether the rules relating to the tithes were strictly observed. This doubtfully tithed produce is known as demai. The background to the discussions of this tractate is that according to the Torah, Israelite farmers were obligated to separate three types of tithes: * Ma'aser rishon – the first tithe, which had to be given to Levites, who had not been given an allotment of tribal land and therefore depended on this produce for their sustenance () * Ma'aser sheni – the second tithe, which the owner had to consume in Jerusalem, or convert into money plus a fifth of its value and reconvert into food in Jerusalem () * Ma'aser ani – poor person's tithe, in place of the second tithe in the third and sixth year of the seven-year cycle in the sabbatical year ( and ). The Levites also had to contribute from the tithe that they received from the Israelites to the kohanim, consisting of a tenth part of the tithe they had received; it was called terumath ma'aser (offering from the tithe) or ma'aser min ha-ma'aser (tithe from the tithe) (). During the period of the Second Temple, doubt began to arise among scrupulous observers of the law (known as haverim) as to whether produce had been properly tithed when they bought from farmers who were likely to be uneducated, or unscrupulous about separating the tithes. This type of individual was known as an am ha'aretz (person of the land), someone whose trustworthiness was questionable. The am ha'aretz was not suspected of not giving terumah (gifts to the priests), because it required only a small payment comprising one-hundredth of the produce, and because terumah had a degree of sanctity that made it a severe transgression for a non-priest to eat. However, because it was doubtful whether the produce of the am ha'aretz had been tithed, the haverim who bought grain from them had to designate part of the produce as ma'aser (a tithe for the Levites or the poor) and ma'aser min ha-ma'aser (a tenth part of that tithe), albeit in a way that reduced financial loss. Of general note in this tractate are disputes between the Houses of Shammai and Hillel, the sages from Yavne, as well as material from the generation of Usha contained in this tractate. One of the earliest uses of the concept of \\"monopoly\\" in a commercial sense appears in this tractate, regarding the purchasing of agricultural goods from a dealer who has a monopoly on the produce (chapter 5; 4). The Gemara contains a few passages of Aggadah. For example, the conscientiousness of Rabbi Phinehas ben Jair regarding the laws of tithes is described along with other acts of piety for which he was well-known. Structure The tractate consists of seven chapters and 53 paragraphs (mishnayot). It has a Gemara – rabbinical analysis of and commentary on the Mishnah – only in the Jerusalem Talmud; it also has Tosefta. There is no Gemara in the Babylonian Talmud for this tractate or indeed for any of the tractates of this order of the Mishna, other than tractate Berakhot, as the laws related to agriculture that they discuss generally have no practical application outside of the Land of Israel. Demai, with its seven chapters, is an exception to the usual pattern of arranging the tractates in order according to the numbers of their chapters; it appears third in the Mishnah and Jerusalem Talmud, and in most manuscripts of the Tosefta, before tractates with more chapters. The Tosefta has a few modifications and additions. It divides Chapter 2 of the Mishna into two parts, and thus has eight chapters instead of the seven of the Mishnah. The eighth paragraph of the sixth chapter of the Mishnah corresponds to the beginning of the eighth chapter of the Tosefta. An overview of the topics of the chapters is as follows: *Chapter 1 details the cases of products that are exempt from the rules of demai such as fruit or vegetables which are hefker (unclaimed or ownerless property). *Chapter 2 lists the products to which the rules of demai apply even outside the Land of Israel if it is bought from an am ha’aretz; discusses how a person may be certified as a ne'eman (one who is deemed trustworthy with respect to tithing), or as a ḥaver who is also trusted on matters of purity; and the duty of merchants regarding tithing demai produce. *Chapter 3 considers the rules for giving or leaving demai for other people to use and specifies that a haver must not cause others to consume demai. *Chapter 4 considers the rules of eating demai produce with people who are not trustworthy, and when buying it from them is allowed. *Chapter 5 examines the rules about tithing demai produce bought from several people, and about tithing produce of one kind for produce of another kind. *Chapter 6 examines the rules of tithing produce of rented or leased land or trees, of tithing the produce of partners and heirs, of produce sold in lands bordering the Land of Israel, and of produce bought for an am ha'aretz. *Chapter 7 considers the rules for the tithing of food consumed with an am ha'aretz, rules of tithing by 'designation', and the rules concerning mixtures and regulations for the tithing of demai on urgent occasions. Commentaries Commentaries on this tractate include the following: *The Rash Sirilio is the earliest known comprehensive commentary on a large portion of the Jerusalem Talmud is that of Rabbi Shlomo Sirilio (1485–1558). In the Vilna edition of the Jerusalem Talmud it appears only for tractates Berakhot and Pe'ah; but the commentary for the entire Seder Zeraim, including tractate Demai, appears in the Mutzal Mi'Eish edition of the Jerusalem Talmud. In addition to his commentary, Rash Sirilio worked to remove mistakes made by manuscript copyists that over time had slipped into the text of the Jerusalem Talmud and his amended text of the Gemara is reproduced alongside his commentary in the Vilna and Mutzal Mi'Eish editions of the Jerusalem Talmud. *Mahara Fulda and its companion, Tosefot Maharaf, are the commentaries of Rabbi Eliyahu of Fulda, published in Amsterdam in 1710. Many later commentators refer to him only as HaMefareish (The Commentator). *Pnei Moshe, the only commentary that covers all of the Jerusalem Talmud completely was written by Rabbi Moshe Margolies, where it was first published in Amsterdam in 1775. *The Vilna Gaon also worked to correct many of the textual errors in the text of the Jerusalem Talmud and his rectifications are contained in marginal glosses published under the title Hagahot HaGra. In addition, a work known as Beurei HaGra, was written by his disciples based on his comments. Two versions of this commentary exist, based on manuscripts written by different disciples. *A commentary known as the Ridvaz on nearly all the tractates of the Jerusalem Talmud was first published in Piotrków in 1898, with its companion commentary, Tosefot HaRid, by Rabbi Yaakov Dovid Wilovsky of Slutzk and later of Safed (1845–1914). In modern times, two comprehensive works have been published: *Toldot Yitzchak and its companion Tevunah, by Rabbi Yitzchok Isaac Krasilschikov of Poltava, who wrote his commentary in the Soviet Union before he died in Moscow in 1965. The manuscript was smuggled out of Communist Russia by Rabbi Harry Bronstein, who founded Machon Mutzal MeiEish and published a new edition of Seder Zeraim of the Jerusalem Talmud, which included Rabbi Krasilschikov's work and all the major commentators published up to that time. *Sha'arei Emunoh, the commentary of Rabbi Chaim Kanievsky to the Jerusalem Talmud has been published to date on Sedarim Zeraim and Moed. It is based on lectures given by Rabbi Kanievsky and contains explanations from earlier commentators, as well as many original insights; the volume on Demai was published in Bnei Brak, Israel, in 2002. In addition to the commentaries listed to the above, commentaries specific to tractate Demai, or to the laws of demai are the following: *Kaftor VaFerach, by Rabbi Ishtori Haparchi, a disciple of the Rosh, is one of the few surviving compositions of the Rishonim concerning Seder Zeraim. Rabbi Ishtori was born in Provence in about 1280 and emigrated to the Land of Israel, where he absorbed himself in the study of the halachot applying to the Land. His work was first published in Venice in 1546. *Maharam Chaviv by Rabbi Moshe ibn Chaviv of Salonika (17th century) wrote a commentary to the Jerusalem Talmud's tractate Demai, as well as to the Jerusalem Talmud's tractates Berakhot and Peah. This commentary was also named Pnei Moshe, but to distinguish it from the more well-known commentary of that name by Moshe Margolies, it is sometimes referred to as Maharam Chaviv. Extant only as a manuscript from the time of its composition, it was first published by Machon Yerushalayim in 1994. *Pe'at HaShulchan is a work on the laws pertaining to agriculture, written by Rabbi Yisroel ben Shmuel of Shklov (1770–1839), a disciple of the Vilna Gaon and first published in Safed in 1836. It contains two sections, the basic laws, which are mostly adopted from Maimonides, and a section of broader discussion called Beis Yisrael. *Aruch Ha'Shulchan He'Atid is a compendium of halachot written by Rabbi Yechiel Michel Epstein of Novaradok (1829–1902), who also composed the standard Aruch HaShulchan. It was published posthumously in Jerusalem in 1938 and the first volume deals with the laws of Seder Zeraim. *Torat HaAretz is a work on the agricultural laws, authored by Rabbi Moshe Kliers of Tiberias, published in Jerusalem in 1928 (with a second edition published in 1972). *Mikdash David is the work of Rabbi David HaKohen Rappaport (1890–1942), a Torah scholar who perished in the Holocaust and whose work contains a section pertaining to Seder Zeraim. *Chazon Ish is a wide- ranging work by Rabbi Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz covering a good part of the Mishnah and Talmud. Chazon Ish's writings on Seder Zeraim in particular have been influential in establishing contemporary halachah in Israel regarding agricultural matters. Chazon Ish's work on Seder Zeraim, including a section on Demai, was originally published in Bnei Brak in 1958. *Chidushim U'Veurim of Rabbi Moshe Feinstein is an extensive work on the Jerusalem Talmud's tractate Demai and is published in the Machon Mutzal MeiEish edition of the Jerusalem Talmud. *Eretz HaBechirah is a multi-volume work on Seder Zeraim by Rabbi Yosef Tzvi Weiner of Jerusalem; the volume on tractate Demai was published in Jerusalem in 1998. *Emunas Eliezer is a commentary on the Mishna of tractate Demai by Rabbi Eliezer Ephraim Sherwinter, published in Fallsburg, NY in 2007. *Mishnas Avraham is a work on various tractates in Seder Zeraim by Rabbi Avraham HaLevi Stewart; the volume on Demai was published in Jerusalem in 2007. *Birkat Yisrael by Rabbi Yisrael Moshe Fried, in collaboration with others, was published in Jerusalem in 2008 as part of a volume containing a critical edition of the Jerusalem Talmud's tractate Demai with commentaries. In addition to its original comments, Birkat Yisrael cites many earlier works. *Kav VeNaki is a commentary as well as a section of insights to tractate Demai co-authored by Rabbi Yehudah Levi and Rabbi Gershon Metzger, published in Jerusalem in 2005. Works that are of assistance interpreting the many botanical references in tractate Demai include the following: * * (monograph which identifies the plant names mentioned in the commentaries of the Rishonim). * (Rabbi Yosef Kafich in his notes to Rambam's Commentary in Arabic identifies numerous species by their Latin equivalents) Historical context A rabbinic tradition (cited in Mishnah Sotah, Tosefta Sotah, and the Jerusalem Talmud in Sotah and Ma'aser Sheni) indicates that the institution of demai was in force at the time of the Hasmonean High Priest Yohanan Hyrcanus (135–104 B.C.E.). On the other hand, a Baraita in the Babylonian Talmud (Sotah 48a), describes Yohanan as the person who instituted demai upon discovering that most people only separated the priestly terumah offering and neglected the tithes. The contents of this tractate mostly reflect conditions in Judea and the Galilee during the second century C.E. and particularly the conditions in the Galilee after the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–136 C.E.). Most of the Tannaim whose opinions are recorded in this tractate are from this period. The tractate contains data about the social life and institutions of the time and the social and commercial relations between the various segments of the population, such as the chaver, the am haaretz, employers and workers, and innkeepers and their guests. The Gemara in the Jerusalem Talmud indicates that there were inspectors who distinguished between produce that was properly tithed (metukan) and the demai, and that there were also officers appointed to watch the sale of articles of food and keep the prices low. The Gemara also has considerable information about the produce of the Land of Israel. Many names of fruits and vegetables, in addition to those mentioned in the Mishnah, are cited in the Gemara, along with information about the markets and names of places inside and outside the Land of Israel.

This tractate discusses the laws of teruma, a gift of produce that an Israelite farmer was required to set aside and give to a kohen (priest). There were two kinds of terumot given to the priest: the regular heave-offering, known also as the terumah gedolah (\\"great heave-offering\\"), which the Israelites were required to give to the priest from the produce of their fields; the other was the terumat ma'aser (\\"tithe of the heave- offering\\"), namely, the gift that the Levites were required to put aside for the priests from the tithe which ordinary Israelites had been required to give to them. The laws detailed in this tractate are derived from the Torah in and , and for terumat ma'aser from . The mitzvah (commandment) applies only to produce grown in the Land of Israel and continues to be observed in the modern state of Israel. This tractate comprises eleven chapters in the Mishna and ten in the Tosefta and has fifty-nine folio pages of Gemara in the Jerusalem Talmud. Like most tractates in the order of Zeraim, there is no Babylonian Talmud for this tractate. Laws concerning terumah are also mentioned in the tractates Demai and Ma'aserot. Subject matter This tractate focuses on the laws of the gifts of produce that are to be given to a kohen (priest) as mandated by the Torah. Terumah is the first gift that must be separated from the produce and given to the priest, as prescribed in Numbers ( and ) and Deuteronomy (). The Hebrew term terumah signifies a contribution, an offering for a sacred purpose, and more literally, something lifted up (hence the antiquated English translation, heave offering). In the Torah, the commandment applied to grain, wine and oil; the Mishna extends the scope to include all produce. It also applied only in the Land of Israel, but certain lands bordering the Land of Israel, and Babylonia were later included. Since the priests and Levites were not allocated land in of the Land of Israel, they were provided for in the form of tithes given to the Levites and the terumot offerings given to the priests by both the Levites and the ordinary Israelites. The Levites were required to separate and give the priest one- tenth of the tithe that they received from the Israelite farmers and this was called terumat ma'aser (\\"offering of the tithe\\"), or ma’aser min hama’aser (tithe of the tithe). The Israelites, on the other hand, separated the terumah gedolah to be given to the priests before they separated a tenth of the produce to be given as tithe to the Levites. Both types of gifts come under the general term of terumah, which forms the theme of this tractate, but the terumah gedolah of the Israelite farmers comprises the main subject of discussion. The Torah does not specify the amount of terumah that must be given, and theoretically, even one single kernel of grain could suffice; thus the Mishna in this tractate establishes an amount, from one-fortieth to one- sixtieth of the gross product, depending on the circumstances and generosity of the individual farmer, with one-fiftieth being regarded as the average gift. The generally accepted measure is therefore one-fiftieth, and the Sages found an allusion to this amount in the term terumah as an acronym of the Aramaic words trei mi-meah (\\"two from a hundred\\") or 2%. The tractate deals with the details of many circumstances which could arise with regards to the terumah. Thus, for example, before the terumah is separated, all the produce is tevel (untithed) and forbidden to be eaten. Terumah is considered holy, and may be eaten by priests only, as prescribed in Leviticus 22:10, and must be guarded against becoming ritually unclean, lost or wasted, as interpreted from Numbers 18:8. The Mishna also considers what to do in cases where terumah became mixed with non-sacred food; if the ratio is less than one hundred times that of terumah, it determines that all of it becomes forbidden to non- priests. However, it is not necessary to give the mixture to the priest, rather it is sold to a priest at the price of terumah, which was fixed lower than ordinary produce, while deducting the value of the terumah mixed into it. If the ratio of non-sacred food exceeds one hundred-times than that of the terumah, a non-priest may eat it, after removing the quantity of the terumah that had fallen into it and giving it to the priest. Structure and content The tractate consists of eleven chapters and 101 paragraphs (mishnayot). It has a Gemara – rabbinical analysis of and commentary on the Mishnah – of 59 double-sided pages in the Jerusalem Talmud. There is a Tosefta of ten chapters for this tractate. There is no Gemara in the Babylonian Talmud for this tractate, or indeed for any of the tractates of this order of the Mishnah, other than Tractate Berakhot, as the laws related to agriculture and produce that are mostly discussed in this order generally have no practical application outside of the Land of Israel. In most editions of the Mishnah, this tractate is sixth in the order Zera'im. Maimonides, in his Commentary on the Mishnah, states that this tractate follows Shevi'it since terumah is the first gift which one separates from the produce. An overview of the topics of the chapters is as follows: * Chapter 1 discusses the categories of people who may not set aside terumah and the different cases in which terumah is considered valid even if the method by which it was selected was generally not permissible. * Chapter 2 deals with additional cases in which the terumah is valid, if the method of selecting it was unknowingly incorrect. * Chapter 3 examines when terumah had to be given twice, the authority of an owner to delegate a servant to take terumah, in what order various offerings, such as terumah and the tithe are to be given, and the procedure to be followed if someone makes a verbal error while selecting the terumah or during the consecration of a sacrifice or taking of an oath. * Chapter 4 deals with the amount of the terumah gedolah offered by the Israelite and with the terumat ma’aser of the Levite, which must be given according to measure, and situations where terumah has been mixed with other produce. * Chapter 5 continues the discussion of handling mixtures, in these cases of ritually clean and unclean produce for terumah. * Chapter 6 deals with the compensation that must be made for improperly eating or deriving benefit from terumah. * Chapter 7 concerns further cases of mixtures and cases when both the value and an additional fifth of the value had to be repaid on eating terumah. * Chapter 8 continues the topic of mixtures and introduces the subject of the wine of terumah that had been left uncovered and the dangers of poisoning, and the prohibition against intentionally defiling the terumah, along with other situations of defilement. * Chapter 9 defines the process to follow when terumah has been deliberately or unintentionally sown and rules concerning the handling of produce grown from the sowing of terumah grains or fruit. * Chapter 10 enumerates the cases in which the flavor of terumah makes other foods forbidden and other rules about which permissible foods become forbidden through the flavor acquired from prohibited foods. * Chapter 11 discusses the uses that may be made of ritually clean and unclean terumah both in solid and in liquid forms. Historical context and influence The commandment of terumah applies only to produce grown in the Land of Israel and continues to be observed in the modern state of Israel. There is debate among Jewish legal authorities as to whether the present-day Jewish religious laws detailed in this tractate are now biblically or rabbinically mandated obligations. Mishna 8:12 of this tractate is a digression from the laws of terumah but is included in this tractate because it contains a similar case to the preceding mishna about pagans intent on defilement – in the previous mishna of a commodity and in this, of a person. This mishna has become a source of Jewish law for the general principle that it is not permitted to sacrifice one individual to save other. Tosefta 7:23 of this tractate, quoted in the Jerusalem Talmud () expands the ruling of the mishna to a case where if one member of a group is not delivered to be killed, the entire group will be killed. The ruling is the same as in the mishna, that all should die rather than sacrifice one to save the others. However, if one individual was specified by the persecutors, then other factors can be considered, such as whether that individual is already subject to capital punishment for a crime they have committed. Many medieval and modern Jewish legal scholars have grappled with the practical applications of the cases mentioned in this tractate, often when facing situations involving persecution, in the Middle Ages during the Crusades, the Rintfleisch massacres or other anti-Jewish violence, and in modern times during the Holocaust. Commentaries Medieval commentaries on this tractate include the following: * Rambam, Maimonides' Commentary on the Mishnah * Rash, a commentary by Rabbi Shimshon of Sens (c. 1150–1230), printed in the Mutzal Me'esh edition of the Jerusalem Talmud, and in the Vilna edition of the Talmud printed in 1880 * Chiddushei Ha'Ritva by Rabbi Yom Tov Asevilli of Seville (c. 1260–1314), included in the Vilna edition of the Talmud * Rosh, the commentary of Rabbenu Asher (c.1250–1327), printed in the Mutzal Me'esh edition of the Jerusalem Talmud. * The Bartenura commentary on the Mishnah by Rabbi Ovadiah ben Abraham of Bertinoro (c. 1445–1515), included in the Vilna edition of the Talmud * Rash Sirilio, the comprehensive commentary on a large portion of the Jerusalem Talmud by Rabbi Solomon Sirilio (1485–1554), appears in the Mutzal Mi’Eish edition of the Jerusalem Talmud.

It discusses the types of produce liable for tithing as well as the circumstances and timing under which produce becomes obligated for tithing. In Biblical times, during each of the six years of the cycle, \\"Maaser Rishon\\" was given to Levites as 10% of an individual's crop. \\"Maaser Sheni\\" was separated in the first, second, fourth and fifth year and is 10% of the crop remaining after \\"Maaser Rishon\\". It was brought to Jerusalem to be eaten there or was redeemed upon coins which were deconsecrated upon food in Jerusalem. The final category is \\"Maaser Ani\\" that is given to the poor in the third and sixth years. Chapters The treatise is divided into five chapters (three in the Tosefta). Its contents are summarized as follows: Ch. 1: Whatever is edible, and is private property, and grows in the ground is subject to tithe. Plants that are edible while young as well as when full grown are subject to tithe before maturity (if any part of the crop is taken before maturity); but of plants that are not properly eatable before they reach a certain stage of ripeness one may eat, without separating the tithes, until they develop. The Mishnah then proceeds to designate the respective stages at which plants come under the general head of edibles and are consequently subject to tithe. As between picking for marketing and for domestic consumption a distinction is made: in the latter case one may use small quantities before bringing the mass under shelter. Ch. 2-4: Under what circumstances a chaber may eat of the produce of an am ha'aretz without first separating the ma'aser. If a laborer, hired to assist in gathering figs, stipulates with his employer that he be allowed to eat of the fruit, he may eat without regard to tithing; but if his stipulation includes one of his dependents, or if he sends one of his dependents instead, the latter will not be privileged to partake of the fruit before the tithe is properly set aside. [The laborer is by law entitled to eat of the produce he handles, as a kind of charity.]See Mishnah Bava Metzia 7:2 (Hebrew: משנה בבא מציעא ז ב) et seq.; compare Bava Metzia 92a (Hebrew/Aramaic בבא מציעא צב א) et seq. After the crop reaches the employer's enclosed premises the laborer may eat thereof only if his employer has not promised to board him. Ch. 5: Laws regarding cases in which one is required to pay tithes when he transplants vegetables; laws regarding the sale of crops to one who is suspected of non-observance; law regarding the paying of tithes in the case of vegetable fields purchased in Syria. Related topics in other tractates Ma'aser Sheni is the main topic, along with the laws of Reva'i, of the next tractate, \\"Ma'aser Sheni\\". Maaser Ani is discussed in Tractate \\"Pe'ah\\". The seventh year of the cycle is designated \\"Shemitta\\", and in that year there were no tithes given at all in the Land of Israel.

However this was never actually carried out and the Princess remains buried in a cemetery outside of Turin. Her surviving sons were raised by her father the Emperor Haile Selassie, and her line is currently represented by her grandson Sebastyanos Beyene, who lives in Abingdon, England.

Tinsley (December 31, 1945 – May 23, 2000), Hustler magazine's cartoon editor. Tinsley produced the strip for 13 years. The premise of the strip was a tongue-in-cheek take on a man, Chester, who was interested in sexually molesting women and prepubescent girls. The Chester cartoon showed many scenes in which the main character--and later on his girlfriend Hester-- tricked or attempted to trick women and prepubescent girls into sexually compromising positions. Tinsley's work was criticized by feminist groups and the National Institute of Health (NIH). Molestation charge In 1984, Tinsley was accused of molesting his 13-year-old daughter, Allison, over a period of five years. He was convicted and served 23 months of a six-year prison sentence before his conviction was overturned on the grounds that his conviction violated the First Amendment because it was based, in part, on his comic strip.

She was the wife of Leul Ras Mangasha Seyum, Prince of Tigray, son of Seyum Mangasha, and great-grandson of Emperor Yohannes IV. Her godmother was Empress Zewditu of Ethiopia.  Biography  The young Princess accompanied her mother, siblings, and grandparents into exile in 1936 upon the occupation of Ethiopia by fascist Italy. Her father Ras Desta Damtew however led the resistance forces in southern Ethiopia for some months, until he was captured by the Italians and executed in 1937. Princess Aida and her three sisters were educated at Clarenden School for Girls in north Wales. She continued her studies at Newnham College, University of Cambridge, where she studied history, matriculating in 1945.Newnham College student records, accessed 26 March 2019 Princess Aida later returned to Ethiopia and married Leul Ras Mengesha Seyoum (Prince of Tigray) in Addis Ababa, in January 1949.

In 1974, Princess Aida was seized at the palace at Mekele by revolutionary soldiers sent to arrest her husband. Ras Mangasha had escaped days earlier and would establish the Ethiopian Democratic Union (EDU) which would fight the Derg regime until the EDU fractured in 1977 between rival factions. Princess Aida however had decided to remain behind and share the fate of her grandfather, her mother, and her family. Princess Aida was among the women of the Imperial family who were incarcerated under the Derg for 14 years. Her brother Prince Rear Admiral Iskinder Desta was executed along with 62 other former officials on Friday November 23, 1974. Together with her mother Princess Tenagnework Haile Selassie, and her sisters Princesses Seble, Sophia and Hirut, were Princess Sara Gizaw, Duchess of Harar (Widow of Prince Makonnen Haile Selasssie), Princess Yeshashework Yilma (the Emperor's niece by his elder brother), Princess Ijigayehu Asfaw Wossen (daughter of the Crown Prince) and Princess Zuriashwork Gebre-Igziabiher (widow of Prince Asrate Kassa). These women were made to share a former storage room in the precincts of the notorious Akaki Prison known as \\"Alem Bekagn\\" which translates to \\"I am done with the world\\". They shared mattresses on the floor and were forced to endure the light of a single light bulb that was never turned off during their entire imprisonment. Years of campaigning by their friends and relatives as well as human rights and humanitarian organizations around the world had little effect in convincing the Derg regime to release the women of the Imperial family. The Princesses were suddenly and unexpectedly released from prison in September 1988, followed a year later by the men of the family. After their release, Princess Aida resumed her interrupted family life with her husband and children in exile. She returned to Ethiopia after the fall of the Derg and split her time between the suburbs of Washington, D.C. and Addis Ababa. She died on January 15, 2013 in Alexandria, Virginia.

Its premise was to focus on what the babies' lives would be like if they were 10 years older. It proved to be popular enough for a sequel based on it to be made. Plot When the babies were watching a science fiction oriented movie about a time-traveling machine, Angelica shows them her new \\"tapiyokie\\" (karaoke) machine. She forbids the babies to play with it, but, as with many of her toys, they do. Angelica is angry and chases the babies into a closet, with Angelica on the outside. Angelica starts counting to ten for them to come out, and Tommy suggests they go to \\"the foocher\\" (the future) so that they will be grown up enough for Angelica not to boss them around anymore. Angelica says multiple random numbers in incorrect order before reaching 10, so this gives the babies enough time to rig the karaoke machine into a time-travel device. At the exact moment Angelica reaches ten, Tommy pushes a button, and there is a swirling orange vortex, and the babies see themselves in the future (in their imaginations). They are now ten years older. The group stumbles out of the closet, and teenage Angelica demands her Emica CD back (Emica is a famous popstar that all the kids like). They want the CD to learn each song in hopes that Emica will call one of them up to sing with her. At the beginning of this part of the episode, nine-year-old Dil is shown to have an unusual personality, and Angelica states that it is because Phil and Lil dropped him on his head when he was a baby. Didi is washing dishes and Spike is now too old and overweight. Stu says that he has a disco dance on the same day that the group has their concert. Stu also states that he will wear his lucky zodiac necklace, one similar to Emica's. When the group leaves for school called Jim's Jr. High, Tommy, Dil and Angelica's grandfather and Stu and Drew's father, Lou, is now a bus driver. Angelica's friend, Samantha Shane (whom Chuckie has a crush on), tells Angelica that she is going to the Emica concert. Angelica lies that despite having the same last name, she and Tommy aren't related. She also says that she is going to wear the zodiac necklace that Emica (and Stu) wears. She needs Tommy to steal his father's necklace so she will look like she told the truth to her friend. She says that if he does so, she will introduce Samantha to Chuckie. Tommy plans to ask Stu if he can borrow the necklace for the night, but quickly realizes it is easier said than done when Stu says he cannot dance without it. Tommy makes a fake necklace (a round dog biscuit wrapped in gold foil with the zodiac sign drawing) and switches it out for the real necklace. Unexpectedly, Spike eats the decoy overnight, then mistakes the real necklace for another one and takes it. Stu finds out the next morning, and Tommy takes the blame for stealing it. Upset and reluctant to do so, Stu and Didi ground Tommy from attending the Emica concert, much to Dil's dismay, and because of this, Angelica refuses to introduce Chuckie to Samantha. The group is sitting in their old sandbox, feeling gloomy that their friend is going to miss the concert. Stu and Didi hire Susie to babysit Tommy while they are at the dance, as she is not able to attend the Emica concert. Lil finds the necklace in the sandbox, as Spike buried it there once he discovered it was not a dog biscuit like the decoy was, and they need to return the necklace to Stu. Tommy is reluctant to do so because he is not allowed to leave the house. Dil encourages Tommy to do otherwise. Susie (who is watching the same sci-fi film as the babies did at the beginning of the episode) catches them as they leave the house, stating that she knows when they are always up to something. She then eagerly goes with the gang to return the necklace. On the way, they ride their bikes by the concert, where Angelica, who is nervously facing peer pressure from Samantha, runs towards them to get the necklace. Tommy confronts Angelica and tells her that he cannot give her the necklace because he should not have agreed to their deal and that she should've introduced Samantha to Chuckie in the first place, and urges her, to tell the truth. Wanting the necklace but ultimately feeling remorse, Angelica admits to Samantha that the necklace belonged to Tommy's dad and also reveals that she and Tommy are cousins. As a way to try to make up, she introduces Chuckie to Samantha as \\"Charlie Finster, the III.\\" Samantha shares her experiences with braces to \\"Charlie,\\" as he is wearing them also, and the two are smitten with each other. As one more act of kindness, Angelica gives her ticket to Susie. They return Stu's necklace in the middle of his performance, and Stu can dance. The kids then head off to the concert, where Angelica decides to head home and let the others enjoy it. Tommy offers to give Angelica his ticket as a thanks, but as she declines, their grandfather then arrives with two tickets. One was intended for his wife, Lulu, but he gives it to Angelica because she is away on a trip. In the stadium, Emica starts to sing. She calls Tommy up to sing, but Angelica begs to be up too, and Emica agrees. After a short-lived period of getting along with singing (and flashbacks of clips from the entire gang's baby years), Angelica and Tommy start to fight over the microphone. They struggle to what seems as backstage but travel back into the closet where the episode first began (back in reality), where Angelica and the babies are fighting over the karaoke machine and end up breaking it. Angelica yells at them, saying that they have to stay away from her items for the next \\"bazillion\\" years. Tommy states he is glad that Angelica will be nicer to them in ten more years, but he spoke too soon. Angelica finds Dil's drool over her player and reaches her breaking point, and then the episode ends with Angelica chasing the babies before Chuckie asks Tommy if ten years is going to be a very long time and Angelica screams \\"Aunt Didi!\\" DVD and VHS releases The special alongside the other Rugrats episode, \\"My Fair Babies\\" and the spinoff's episodes, \\"Susie Sings the Blues\\" and \\"Coup DeVille\\" is on the 2003 DVD release, All Grown Up: Growing Up Changes Everything and the original 2001 VHS release, All Growed Up containing both \\"All Growed Up\\" and \\"My Fair Babies\\".

The westbound train was Milwaukee Road train #17, and the eastbound train was train #18. The first Columbian: 1911-1930 The Columbian in 1927. One of the last great railroad construction projects in the United States took place in the Pacific Northwest between 1906 and 1909, when the Milwaukee Road built its new line from the Midwest to Puget Sound. The new route gave the Milwaukee Road a continuous line from Chicago to Seattle/Tacoma, an asset claimed by no other single railroad. Soon, the Milwaukee began operating through freight and passenger trains on the route. Two daily Chicago - Puget Sound passenger trains were instituted on May 28, 1911—the Olympian and the Columbian. The Olympian was the premiere train on the route, with a faster schedule and more luxurious equipment; the Columbian was a secondary train, providing a more basic level of service on a slower schedule. Both trains operated throughout the 1910s and 1920s, initially surviving the bankruptcy of the Milwaukee Road in 1925. The Columbian, however, was discontinued in 1930, the victim of a downturn in rail traffic caused, in part, by the Great Depression. The Olympian continued to serve the entire Chicago - Tacoma line, and shorter-distance trains provided additional service on parts of the route. The 1947-1955 Columbian After the end of World War II, most American railway companies—including the Milwaukee Road—quickly began working to modernize their passenger services with new, lightweight streamliner equipment and faster schedules. By 1946, the Milwaukee had decided to re-equip the Olympian as a streamliner, adding it to its famed fleet of Hiawatha passenger trains. The new Olympian Hiawatha entered service on June 29, 1947, running on a significantly faster schedule with fewer stops. Simultaneously, the Columbian was resurrected to again provide secondary service on the entire Chicago - Tacoma route. The revived Columbian used the equipment and schedule of the pre-1947 Olympian. As before, the 1947 Columbian served passengers traveling shorter distances (or to smaller towns), and hauled of mail and express. Compared to the Olympian Hiawatha, the Columbian was slower, made more stops, and had fewer passenger amenities. A typical timetable (from 1951) showed that the westbound Columbian was scheduled to complete the 2227-mile Chicago-Tacoma run in 61 hours, 5 minutes. In contrast, the westbound Olympian Hiawatha traveled the same route in 46 hours, 30 minutes. An end-to-end trip on the Columbian occupied three nights and two days. The train's passenger equipment included standard and \\"tourist\\" (economy) sleeping car]s, coaches, and a diner-lounge car. The Columbian was the first train to use the Milwaukee Road's new station in Tacoma, arriving there on April 20, 1954. The revival of the Columbian proved to be short- lived. Passenger traffic on the western lines of the Milwaukee Road declined significantly in the 1950s, resulting in the discontinuance of the Columbian as a through train on January 21, 1955. At the time, the operation of interstate passenger trains was partially regulated by the states, and individual state approvals were required prior to a train's discontinuance; consequently, the end of the Columbian was piecemeal. The January 21 schedule change eliminated only the western end of the Columbian run, between Avery, Idaho and Tacoma. That spring, the train's western terminus was shifted still further east—to Marmarth, North Dakota -- and by summer trains 17 and 18 only operated as far west as Aberdeen, South Dakota. Soon, the Columbian was gone entirely.

He also played for the Los Angeles Avengers of the Arena Football League. He is a United States Marine, and has served in Iraq. On September 17, 2019, Staat, a registered Republican, announced his candidacy for Congress in California's 8th District. Football career Staat was a two-sport star in Bakersfield High School in Bakersfield, California, where he was All-Area selection. He then attended Bakersfield College, a junior college where he played offensive and defensive line for two years, while also excelling in track and field. After initially expressing interest in transferring to the University of Nebraska as a walk on, he was offered a full ride scholarship to Arizona State University as a defensive lineman. At ASU, Staat became friends with free safety Pat Tillman, and was a roommate with Tillman's brother for a semester. Staat and Tillman drank and partied hard during their college careers, and Staat initially did not understand why an NFL-bound player would require higher education.Ted Miller, From ASU to the NFL to Iraq, Staat finally graduates, ESPN.com, May 14, 2009, Accessed May 14, 2009. While playing for the Sun Devils, he won the Morris Trophy as the best defensive lineman in the Pac-10 Conference in 1997. In the 1998 NFL Draft, the Pittsburgh Steelers selected Staat with the 41st overall pick. He played three seasons in Pittsburgh, starting in eleven games in the 1999 season. He would sign with the Seattle Seahawks in 2001 but would be cut from the team following the preseason. Cut by a football team for the first time in his life, Staat began seriously considering joining the military following the September 11, 2001 attacks. However Pat Tillman, who had quit a lucrative career with the Arizona Cardinals to become a U.S. Army Ranger after the attacks, talked Staat into staying in the league for at least three more games to earn his NFL retirement benefits. In 2002 he would sign with the Oakland Raiders and was moved to offensive guard by Bill Callahan. He would be cut during the preseason, however, after Jon Gruden was traded to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Despite speculation that he would reunite with Jake Plummer on the Arizona Cardinals following an injury to defensive lineman Tom Burke, he would ultimately remain unsigned. Staat eventually earned his pension during a stint with the St. Louis Rams during the 2003 season after transitioning back to the defensive line. The following season, he joined the Los Angeles Avengers of the Arena Football League. During the season, he learned Tillman had been killed in action in Afghanistan, in what was later revealed to be a \\"friendly fire\\" incident. The loss of his friend further reduced his interest in football. He would throw his helmet during the middle of practice and storm off the field, leaving the Avengers and professional football forever. Post- football career Immediately after football, one of Staat's friends got him a job working at a Walgreens drug store. Staat, like Tillman's family, was dismayed by the United States Army's handling of the story surrounding Tillman's death; himself noting that \\"The fog around his death was thickened by lies.\\" However, after spending time deciding on his own future, he opted to follow his deceased friend and teammate's example and join the military; but instead of the Army, he joined the United States Marine Corps. Staat joined the Marine Corps in 2006. He completed his recruit training at Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego in March 2006. ”The way I look at it, we’re spreading freedom, and you have to support the troops and you have to support the war,” Staat, 29, told KITV in Honolulu. ”You can’t just tell some Marine who just lost his buddy that we supported you but not the war, because in that case you’re basically saying that Marine, his buddy, just died for nothing. We’re one team.” In March 2007, Lance Corporal Staat deployed with 1st Battalion 3rd Marines for a seven-month mission in Iraq. He was an infantry machine gunner and drove around in seven-ton armored trucks used to transport soldiers. Staat's Iraq tour was fairly quiet. His unit suffered two injuries and no one was killed in action. His opinions changed: \\"It wasn't a blood fest, like some people make it out to be. It was pretty controlled. We had a pretty good sense of security. My eyes were opened up. They [the Iraqis] were just people. I expected to see guys running around with AK-47s, shouting about Allah and shooting into the sky.\\" After returning from his tour, he started to have back, hip and heart problems. He was put on light duty and began the process of seeking a medical discharge. Reversing his previous opinion of higher education, Staat opted to return and finish his degree. He graduated from Arizona State University in 2009. He completed his master's degree and returned to his hometown of Bakersfield, where he teaches welding at Bakersfield College. In 2019, Staat announced that he would be running for Congress in the 2020 Election on the Republican Party ticket for California's 8th congressional district, but would lose in the March primary to Jay Obernolte.

Weston and Emanuel L. Wolf with Jack Grossberg as associate producer. The screenplay was written by William Bast and Walter Bernstein, adapted from the 1971 novel of the same title by Harold Robbins. The film stars Laurence Olivier, Robert Duvall, Katharine Ross, Tommy Lee Jones, Jane Alexander, Joseph Wiseman, Kathleen Beller, Edward Herrmann, Paul Ryan Rudd, and Lesley-Anne Down. The novelist reportedly considered The Betsy the \\"best movie adaptation of any of his works.\\"  Plot  A fading family- owned automobile manufacturer and its owners pin their hopes for a return to profitability on a new model named for the great-granddaughter of the firm's founder. The aging Loren Hardeman Sr. remains the titular head of a Detroit automotive conglomerate. (An obvious parallel exists between this fictional character and that of Henry Ford.) His grandson, Loren Hardeman III, now runs the company as president, but has diversified into other fields and is concerned that the auto division is not as lucrative as it once was and might even need to be eliminated. A young auto racer, Angelo Perino, has been secretly commissioned to develop a groundbreaking fuel-efficient car. He juggles romantic relationships with a British royal, Lady Bobby Ayres, and the young Betsy, who is about to turn 21 and inherit a fortune, including the new car that her great-grandfather is naming in her honor. Loren Hardeman III bitterly despises Hardeman Sr., who once carried on an affair with Loren's mother. The older Hardeman is not the man he used to be, but he is not ready to step aside forever.

It shows construction and painting of 1978 Gremlin, Pacer, and Concord models on AMC's assembly line serving as the factory of the fictitious Bethlehem Motors. For authenticity, the film's producers learned from AMC about how new cars are developed. The titular car is a slightly modified 1974 Lancia Beta coupe. The Betsy features music composed by John Barry. It was filmed at Rosecliff mansion in Newport, Rhode Island. A review by automobile industry expert Alex Taylor noted that the filmmakers did not show believable characters and realistic dialogue. Attempts by Hollywood to capture the auto industry on film, such as The Betsy, have \\"aimed at realistic drama but wound up with suds.\\" By 1978 there had been a notable increase in the construction of racquetball courts in the United States, so Petrie chose to shoot a scene in a company racquetball court during the first meeting between the characters played by Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duvall. Reception The film opened in 473 theaters and grossed a record opening weekend for Allied Artists of $2,727,084. The film earned rentals of $7.85 million in the United States and Canada. Most of the reviews of the film were negative. Chicago Tribune reviewer Gene Siskel offered a damning critique of the film: The Boston Evening Globe correspondent Michael Blowen described it as \\"a Reader's Digest condensation of a television soap opera.\\" In the New York Daily News, Rex Reed stated that \\"the temptation to compare The Betsy with the Edsel stretches from here to deadline, but this movie is so bad, so numbingly obtuse, so bloatedly pretentious and awesomely corny, no capsule put-down seems adequate. It's The Damned, set in Grosse Pointe. Or, as Tennessee Williams might drawl, it's about 'a lotta things, honey—greed, lust, vice, homosexuality, incest, suicide, murder, and puttin' on airs.'\\" The film appears in a chapter of Harry and Michael Medved's book The Golden Turkey Awards titled \\"The Worst Films Compendium from A (The Adventurers) to Z (Zontar: the Thing from Venus)\\". The Medveds wrote that \\"another Harold Robbins book bites the dust as a wretched, melodramatic film.

The Mets and Cards used as a rally cry the 2000 hit song \\"Who Let the Dogs Out?\\" by the Baha Men. This series pitted a pair of teams that were former division rivals. In the mid-1980s, the Mets and Cardinals fought it out for supremacy in the National League East over four seasons, with each team alternating division championships between 1985 and 1988 (the Cardinals in their pennant seasons of 1985 and 1987, the Mets in their championship season of and 1988; however, the Cardinals weren't serious contenders in both of those years). The Cardinals, led by manager Tony La Russa, had played through the 2000 season in relatively businesslike fashion. They had won the National League Central division, and swept the Mets' fiercest rival, Atlanta Braves, in three games in the NL Division Series, making the Mets' run to the World Series much easier. However, they were struck with several injuries to key players as the playoffs began, including slugger Mark McGwire, catcher Mike Matheny, and the sudden, unexplained wildness of rookie pitcher Rick Ankiel. The Mets, on the other hand, engaged in battle with the Braves for much of the season, eventually falling one game short of a division title. They matched up with the San Francisco Giants in the Division Series. After dropping the first game, they would rebound to win the following three games in heart-stopping fashion, including a 13th inning walk off home run from Benny Agbayani to win Game 3 and an improbable one-hit shutout by Bobby Jones to win the clinching Game 4. As noted above, the Mets thanked the Cardinals for making their run to the World Series much easier. It was the first NLCS since 1990 not to feature the Braves. MLB did not have a postseason in 1994 due to the 1994-95 Major League Baseball strike and the Braves appeared in the 1991, 1992, 1993, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999 League Championship Series. The Mets would go on to lose to the New York Yankees in the World Series in five games. Summary=St. Louis Cardinals vs. New York Mets=Game summaries=Game 1 Wednesday, October 11, 2000 at Busch Stadium (II) in St. Louis, Missouri The Mets jumped on Cardinals starter Darryl Kile right from the outset. Rookie Timo Pérez led off the game with a double into the right field corner, and following a walk to Edgardo Alfonzo, scored on a double by Mike Piazza. A Robin Ventura sacrifice fly would plate Alfonzo, and the Mets were off and running. Piazza's double resulted in one of the more memorable moments of the series. Mets coach John Stearns was wearing a microphone for Fox Sports during the games, and his screams of \\"THE MONSTER IS OUT OF THE CAGE!!\\" were broadcast to a national audience. \\"The Monster is out of the cage\\" would become a rallying cry for the Mets and Piazza throughout the series. Mets starter Mike Hampton was sharp. Over seven innings, he limited the Cardinals to six hits and no runs. At the plate, Hampton helped his own cause by singling, moving to second on a groundout, and scoring the Mets' third run on Alfonzo's RBI single in the fifth inning. The Mets would effectively put the game away in the ninth inning off of Mike James on a lead off home run by Todd Zeile and two batters later, a two-run home run by Jay Payton. In the bottom of the inning, Ray Lankford hit a leadoff double off of Armando Benitez. Two outs later, shortstop Kurt Abbott's error to first on Edgar Renteria's ground ball allowed Lankford to score and Renteria to reach first. Then Jim Edmonds singled to right and Timo Perez's errant throw to third allowed Renteria to score, but Eric Davis grounded out to end the game as the Mets' 6–2 win gave them a 1–0 series lead. Game 2 Thursday, October 12, 2000 at Busch Stadium (II) in St. Louis, Missouri The Mets once again jumped out to a first inning lead due to the wildness of Cardinals starter Rick Ankiel, who walked two and threw two wild pitches to put runners on second and third with one out. Todd Zeile's sacrifice fly scored a run and after a walk, Benny Agbayani's double scored another. The Cardinals trimmed the Mets lead to 2–1 in the second inning against starter Al Leiter. A run-scoring ground out with two on by Eli Marrero would plate Shawon Dunston. The Mets got that run back in the third when Mike Piazza hit his first home run of the series off Reames. The Cardinals knotted the game at 3–3 in the fifth inning on run-scoring doubles by Édgar Rentería and Fernando Tatís after a one-out single. With the score still tied and two out in the top of the eighth, the Mets would put together a rally to take a 5–3 lead off of Matt Morris. A long single by Alfonzo would score Timo Pérez, who singled with two outs, and following an intentional walk to Piazza, Zeile would single home Alfonzo. However, in the bottom of the inning, John Franco walked Carlos Hernandez, who moved to third on a single and scored on a wild pitch. J.D. Drew's double off of Turk Wendell tied the game again. In the top of the ninth off of Mike Timlin, after Robin Ventura reached on a Will Clark error, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt, and was pinch run for by Joe McEwing, rookie Jay Payton came through with his second game-winning hit of the postseason, nailing a single up the middle to score McEwing, as Cardinals center fielder Jim Edmonds allowed the ball to hop off the heel of his glove and roll behind him. Armando Benítez allowed a two- out walk to Jim Edmonds in the last of the ninth, but that was all the Cardinals were able to muster as the Mets took Game 2, 6–5, to take a 2–0 series lead. Game 3 Saturday, October 14, 2000 at Shea Stadium in Queens, New York The Cardinals would mark their first, and only, victory of the NLCS with an easy 8–2 victory. Jim Edmonds hit a two-run double in the top of the first inning off Mets starter Rick Reed. The Mets cut the lead to 2–1 in the bottom half on Mike Piazza's double-play after back-to-back leadoff singles put runners on first and third. In the third, with runners on first and second, Ray Lankford's RBI single and Fernando Tatis's sacrifice fly scored a run each. Next inning, three consecutive one-out singles, the last of which to Edgar Renteria scoring a run, knocked Reed out of the game. The Mets loaded the bases with no outs in the bottom of the inning, but only scored once on Jay Payton's double play. In the fifth, after a leadoff double and subsequent single, Carlos Hernandez's RBI single off of Rick White made it 6–2 Cardinals. After a sacrifice bunt, Fernando Vina's fielder's choice and Renteria's groundout scored a run each to make it 8–2 Cardinals. Cardinals starter Andy Benes pitched eight solid innings, holding the Mets to two runs and six hits, while notching five strikeouts. More importantly, he was able to give the Cardinals' weary bullpen a bit of rest and put them back in the series. Mike James in the ninth allowed a leadoff single and walk, but struck out the next three batters looking to end the game. Game 4 Sunday, October 15, 2000 at Shea Stadium in Queens, New York Both teams would come out with their hitting shoes on in this game. The Cardinals would jump out to a 2–0 lead in the top of the first inning, as Jim Edmonds hit a two-run home run off Mets Starter Bobby Jones. The lead, however, would be short-lived as the Mets would flex their offensive muscle against Darryl Kile in a record-setting display. Timo Pérez, as he had done all postseason, sparked the rally with a leadoff ground rule double in the bottom of the first. Edgardo Alfonzo followed with a double of his own, down the right field line, scoring Perez. Mike Piazza followed with a third double for the Mets, a long one-hop drive off the wall in right center. Holding on the fly, Alfonzo only made it to third, but Robin Ventura followed by ripping the Mets' fourth consecutive double, which would score both Alfonzo and Piazza, and put the Mets ahead 3–2. One out later, Benny Agbayani launched a long double off the wall in left center to score Ventura. This was the Mets' fifth double of the inning, which set a new League Championship Series record. The Mets would continue to bombard Kile and the Cardinals in the second inning. With two outs and the bases loaded, Todd Zeile would hit yet another double for the Mets, scoring two more runs. Agbayani would single home a seventh Mets run before Zeile was tagged out at home to end the inning. Will Clark's home run in the fourth cut the Mets' lead to 7–3 Kile was gone by the fourth inning, and Cardinals pitching coach Dave Duncan was ejected from the game while removing him. Kile's replacement, Mike James, would not fare much better, as Mike Piazza would launch a long home run, well over the Cardinals' bullpen out in deep left field to give the Mets an 8–3 lead after the fourth. Bobby Jones, who had thrown a magnificent one-hit shutout against the Giants in the division series, struggled while pitching with a big lead. In the fifth inning, Jones would be knocked from the game after surrendering back-to-back leadoff singles followed by an RBI double to Eric Davis, and Glendon Rusch in relief allowed a one-out sacrifice fly to Edgar Renteria and subsequent RBI single to Edmonds. However Rusch then pitched three shutout innings. The Mets would put the game away in the sixth off of Mike Timlin, thanks to two errors by Cardinals third baseman Fernando Tatís. Tatis' first error allowed Perez to reach base: despite the fact that Tatis had time, his hasty throw was low and Will Clark was unable to handle it. Tatis' second error, a bobble on a Ventura grounder with the bases loaded, would allow Mike Bordick to score. Robin Ventura's sacrifice fly then scored the Mets' last run. The Mets received strong bullpen work not only from Rusch, but also from John Franco and Armando Benítez, who threw scoreless innings in the eighth and ninth respectively, to close out the Cardinals and give the Mets a commanding 3–1 lead in the series. This game would turn controversial for LaRussa, who had been bringing injured slugger Mark McGwire off the bench to pinch hit in key situations. Afforded several opportunities with the tying runs in place, LaRussa never sent McGwire up to hit in this game, and eventually he would run out of opportunities to do so. Game 5 Monday, October 16, 2000 at Shea Stadium in Queens, New York Needing a victory to close out the series at home and avoid a trip back to St. Louis, the Mets, behind Mike Hampton, cruised to a 7–0 victory and their first National League pennant since their championship season of 1986. The Mets would once again stake themselves to an early lead, jumping on Cardinals starter Pat Hentgen in the first inning. Again it was Timo Pérez sparking the Mets, singling under the glove of Édgar Rentería, stealing second base and moving to third when catcher Carlos Hernández's throw went into center field. Edgardo Alfonzo would single home Perez. Following a walk to Mike Piazza, Robin Ventura would single home Alfonzo for the Mets' second run. The Mets would add a third run on a fielder's choice by Todd Zeile. The Mets would effectively put the game away in the fourth inning, when with two outs and the bases loaded (a situation in which Zeile found himself the previous night), Todd Zeile hit a long double off the wall in right center field, scoring three runs, giving the Mets a 6–0 lead, and resulting in raucous Mets fans making Shea Stadium literally shake. The Mets would add a final run off of Rick Ankiel when Mike Bordick drew a leadoff walk, moved to second on a groundout and scored on two wild pitches in the seventh inning. In yet another controversial move from Tony La Russa, Ankiel was inserted into the game in the bottom of the seventh. After walking Mike Bordick to start the inning, retired Hampton and Perez, before uncorking a pair of wild pitches with Edgardo Alfonzo at the plate, allowing Bordick to score the seventh and final run of the game. Ankiel would depart after walking Alfonzo. An ugly incident was averted in the bottom of the eighth inning, where with two outs and Benny Agbayani on first base, Jay Payton was hit near his left eye by a fastball from Cardinals pitcher Dave Veres. Payton immediately leapt up and charged Veres, and both benches and bullpens cleared, although Payton would be restrained by Agbayani and Bobby Valentine before the incident could escalate. Mets pitcher John Franco mugged for the fans to settle down following the incident; the crowd responded by chanting Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye at the Cardinals, and booed them off the field at the conclusion of the inning. Saying before the game that \\"I was looking to pitch the game of my life\\", Mike Hampton was nothing short of superb. In pitching a complete game shutout, Hampton allowed only three hits and one walk, and struck out eight. His efforts in this game, and in Game 1 would result in his being named MVP of the NLCS. Hampton closed out the game by getting pinch-hitter Rick Wilkins to fly out to center field. Mets center fielder Timo Pérez jumped up and down three times before making the catch, Robin Ventura hoisted Hampton in the air and a wild celebration was touched off, culminating in Mike Piazza leading the entire Mets team in a victory lap around Shea Stadium. Composite box 2000 NLCS (4–1): New York Mets over St. Louis Cardinals  Aftermath  The Mets would advance to the 2000 World Series, their first appearance in the World Series since their championship season of 1986. They would meet their crosstown rivals, the New York Yankees in the first Subway Series to take place since 1956. In five games that were as nip-and-tuck as baseball can be, the Yankees would come out on top, winning their third consecutive World Championship. The Mets would then muddle through several unsuccessful seasons, and would not return to the Postseason until 2006. Series MVP Mike Hampton would leave via free agency following the season, signing with the Colorado Rockies. Hampton's departure from New York was not well-received, as he made comments about the city's school system, and was routinely booed upon his reappearances at Shea Stadium. The Cardinals would return to the National League Championship Series in 2002, losing to the San Francisco Giants. They would return to the World Series for the first time since 1987 when they defeated the Houston Astros in the NLCS in 2004. The Cardinals would face the Mets again in the 2006 National League Championship Series, with the Redbirds defeating the Mets this time in an epic and dramatic series that ended in seven games. The only player remaining on either roster from the series in 2000 was Cardinals center fielder Jim Edmonds. There were no 2006 Mets left on the team that played in 2000.

One of the most notable features is its built-in A-GPS. The A1000 is the successor to the A925 and A920. A variant device, named the M1000, appeared in 2005 for the Japanese market, distributed by NTT DoCoMo. The M1000 has a similar spec to the A1000 but supports Wi-Fi instead of GPS/A-GPS. A1000 history The A1000 was released in Q4 2004, but was available only on contract through 3, in just a few countries (mostly Australia, Austria, Denmark, Italy, Singapore[SingTel], Sweden and the UK). Although it was presented in two colour schemes, the 3 network offered it only in the dull matte dark-grey / light gray combination. Also, the phone firmware was locked and branded for 3 and presented various limitations, like the impossibility of changing internet connectivity accounts. The phone raised interest of enthusiasts due to its advanced capabilities, and a few dedicated forums appeared. A generic, unbranded firmware became available in these forums, but presented multiple problems and was considered by many as being in fact a leaked beta version. Also, various software was developed to overcome limitations of branded firmware (Application Picker , GPRS account editor , installation of software on external memory ). When, after a whole year, the unlocked and unbranded A1000 appeared, its new firmware version made most of these applications obsolete, as it included their facilities. The phone was also available in its glossy black finish. As it was among the very first phones to use the TransFlash (now microSD) memory format as external storage, it was limited to the small capacity of these cards. As this card is perfectly compatible to Secure Digital, it didn't take long for a Transflash-to-SD adapter to appear (free registration needed). In this way, a Transflash card of any available capacity could be used in the SD Card adapter, but the phone only supports Transflash I cards. Presently, the latest available modded firmware combines the stability of the first branded firmware with the facilities and speed of the generic one, and also include some pre-installed and ready-to-install third-party freeware applications.

Further firmware releases fixed the problem (maybe starting from 51.92 * Outbox bug - If an SMS sending fails, SMS get stuck in the outbox and no more attempts are made by the System to send it again. No fixes are available for this bug. * Memory card size limitation - Although a1000 is compatible with microsd, which should allow size up to 2 GB, no users report to be able to go over 1 GB limit * AT commands incompatibility - most of standard mandatory AT commands are actually not supported, implemented or working (SMS access, phonebook access,...)

It extends the AmigaOS windowing environment (Intuition) with an object-oriented subsystem allowing a hierarchy of object classes in which every class defines a single GUI widget or interface event. BOOPSI made it easier for developers to create their own system of widgets and create standardized graphical user interfaces. Magic User Interface and ReAction are examples of complete widget toolkits built on BOOPSI. Both toolkits have become popular with Amiga software programmers to generate and maintain graphical user interfaces. The object-oriented design brings advantages such as straightforward coupling of objects with other objects. For example, a programmer may link a numerical input field and a sliding control, where if the user adjusts the sliding control the numerical value in the input field changes automatically.

These two were soon joined by drummer Milan Nový and, later, guitarist Romek Hanzlík. The group moved through several different lineups before splitting in 1987. In 2008 Wanek and Hanzlík let Uz jsme doma play 21 songs from FPB repertoire on occasional concerts. The act of playing punk rock in the early '80s in a Communist nation drew much attention to the band, but the group was also notable for integrating musical complexity and poetry into the traditional punk fold. Cited influences include The Damned and The Clash. Wanek had also soon discovered Pere Ubu and The Residents, his favorites, through illegal tape trading in Czechoslovakia; these influences became more noticeable when, in 1986, Wanek joined Nový's group Už Jsme Doma, a highly influential and still-existing avant garde punk rock band that has featured nearly every other member of FPB for a time. A 'fourth price group' was a term used in Socialist Czechoslovakia for the fourth (lowest) of four pub levels. Wanek tried to display his feeling, where his new band belongs, where it feels natural. Not in such a fancy places in \\"First or second price level\\", but in culture on the bottom - or underground. Actually the band used to use several different names due to police \\"supervising\\" - to confuse them. They used names such as FPB, Fourth Price Band, Ctvrta cenova skupina, Ctverecjed etc. Romek Hanzlík died in 2019. History=Formation and early lineups (1980) The band began when Wanek, an ambitious young composer and musician, chatted with his neighbor Růžička, an organizer of illegal concerts who'd done minor jail time for his involvement in the underground music scene. The communist Czech government at the time was very strict about which musical artists it would legally sanction and which it would deem 'anti-social' and prevent from performing. Starting a group outside of government sanctions was a complicated procedure, so the two decided to go at it together. They found drummer Milan Nový, and, needing a full band, ended up employing Nový's bandmates from his band at the time, Mikron, to form the first lineup of FPB. This lineup lasted for \\"three or four months\\",mp3.box :: mp3 and music related news and tools and played one show, before the other members of the band were intimidated by government pressure, and the band was reduced to Wanek, Nový, and Růžička. Classic lineup (1981–1985) After several months as essentially a two- piece, Wanek called up his former schoolmate Romek Hanzlík, who'd been playing in a bar band called Admirál. Hanzlík was unhappy with present setup and accepted Wanek's invitation to join FPB. This became the core lineup for the band between the years of 1981–1985. Despite the complicated logistics, the band played frequently and gained much popularity in the Czech punk scene for their sophisticated take on the frantic, melodic punk rock of the time. In 1985, Nový had co-founded a more experimental, musically omnivorous seven- piece band called Už Jsme Doma. Nový was playing saxophone in the band at the time. Wanek took an immediate liking to the group, who frequently shared illegal concert bills with FPB. In 1986, Wanek and Hanzlík were invited to join UJD, at first as guests of sort, while UJD were experiencing personnel problems. When a four-piece lineup of UJD, with Wanek and Hanzlík and sans Nový, solidified at the end of the year, Wanek and Hanzlík decided to focus on the new band and quit FPB. New configuration of group (1986–1987) Růžička opposed retiring the FPB moniker, so he and Nový put together a new FPB lineup featuring Kamil Krůta (guitar) and Radek Uhlíř (bass and vocals), both of whom were involved with the popular Czech punk band Šanov 1 and mere teenagers at the time. This incarnation, playing a mix of Wanek's FPB songs and new material, lasted for two years before dissolving. Most of people call this line-up \\"New FPB\\" to make obvious difference between Wanek's era and this new item, which was too far from former originality of \\"Old FPB\\". Reformations and subsequent activity (1990, 2008–present) In 1990, after the Velvet Revolution, Wanek, Hanzlík and Nový reunited as FPB just to record 17 songs from their 1981–85 set, which were released on the CD \\"Kdo z koho, ten toho\\", and doing one show in Lucerna Prague. The very last show of FPB was in 1993 on the privat party in pub \\"U vystřeleného oka\\" in Žižkov Prague. After the breakup of New FPB in 1987, Nový and Krůta put together a two piece group called Pseudo Pseudo that played together for a number of years. Hanzlík played in UJD from 1986–1997, before retiring from performing to work as a manager and promoter of bands, including UJD. Wanek continued to play in UJD. Nový had three stints in UJD – as the sax player from 1985–1986, the drummer from 1988–1989, and again the drummer from 1995–1996. Krůta was briefly UJD's bassist, from 1996–1997, although he never properly recorded with the band. In 2008, a concert of classic FPB material (21 songs) was performed by Wanek, Hanzlík, and the current members of UJD – bassist Pepa Červinka, drummer Tomáš Paleta, and trumpet player Adam Tomášek. This performance coincided with the release of \\"Kniha prani a stiznosti,\\" or \\"A Book of Wishes and Complaints,\\" a 3-CD set of FPB material on Malarie Records. Although this concert (called UJD and Romek Hanzlik play FPB songs) was originally intended as a one-off, the five-piece band (with Jaroslav Noga on drums) performed occasional festival gigs and other special events thereafter.

A portion of run-on can infiltrate once it reaches the area of interest. Run-on is common in arid and semi-arid areas with patchy vegetation cover and short but intense thunderstorms. In these environments, surface runoff is usually generated by a failure of rainfall to infiltrate into the ground quickly enough (this runoff is termed infiltration excess overland flow). This is more likely to occur on bare soil, with low infiltration capacity. As runoff flows downslope, it may run-on to ground with higher infiltration capacity (such as beneath vegetation) and then infiltrate.

History With a name selected from a contest hosted by New York radio station WDRE, Bash & Pop was formed in 1992 by bassist Tommy Stinson, following the breakup of his previous group The Replacements. Stinson switched to guitar, with Steve Foley (from The Replacements) on drums, his brother Kevin Foley on bass, and Steve Brantseg on guitar. The album Friday Night Is Killing Me was recorded by the band with the assistance of Benmont Tench and Mike Campbell, Wire Train's Jeff Trott as well as other musicians Greg Leisz, Brian McCloud, Phil Jones and Tommy Steel. The album was released in January 1993 through Sire/Reprise Records to mainly mixed reviews with Stewart Mason, of Allmusic, stating that \\"there are a couple of great songs here, the catchy single \\"Loose Ends\\" and the rocking \\"Fast and Hard\\", but even those two songs feel sloppily half-written, with choruses that vamp on repeatedly for far too long.

As a result, the station struggled financially and was sold in November 1993 after nearly going dark; the new owners switched programming services to the ABC/SMN \\"Hot AC\\" format and relaunched the station as WEMX (Mix 94.5). Though WEMX was better off financially, it still struggled in terms of ratings and revenue. In June 1995, WKLI/WABY(1400) owner Paul Bendat bought WEMX and that August (after five weeks of syndicated talk shows and hot adult contemporary music) changed the station's format to a simulcast of the adult standards format heard on WABY. Initially, the station had various prior commitments on weekends to clear and was forced to sign off overnights due to a programming service conflict between WABY and WCKL in Catskill. In May 1996, the station was granted a call letter change to WABY-FM. From the outset, the simulcast was wildly successful with ratings often being among the Top 5 stations (12+) in the Albany market. WKLI had always supported the WABY stations and although revenue at WABY improved, a misconception of the value of its audience due to poor sales staff never allowed it to reach its potential. A decline at WKLI coupled with the lure of money led to Bendat's days being numbered. In February 1999, Bendat sold his stations to Tele-Media, Inc., which, that Spring, replaced adult standards with satellite-fed soft gold from the ABC/SMN \\"Memories\\" network outside drivetimes (and flipped the AM side to news programming by day in April 1999). The station converted back to all-local programming after a Christmas music stunt in late 1999, as well as a flip to soft adult contemporary, which came on December 26, 1999 with the reincarnation of the K-Lite format formerly on 100.9 FM, with the WKLI calls moving to 94.5. Given its signal impairments and fierce competition from WYJB, WKLI's ratings fell to levels not seen in years and revenue barely improved compared to the standards format, though the station had some success with Delilah in the evening hours. Tele-Media left the Albany market in August 2001, with WKLI and WABY being sold to Syracuse, New York-based Galaxy Communications. The sale resulted in a format flip for WKLI to \\"Classic rock that Really Rocks\\", becoming WRCZ (94 Rock) (with former WPYX morning host Bob Mason in mornings) on October 31, 2001.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/2000s/2001/RR-2001-11-09.pdf On January 4, 2006, WRCZ and WEGQ joined together in a format flip to mainstream rock as 93.7/94.5 The Bone. At this time, WRCZ became WBOE, and WEGQ became WOOB. The station became home to Nights with Alice Cooper and NASCAR NEXTEL Cup motorsports. J. R. Gach, a holdover from 94 Rock, was the morning personality until August 2006. On February 16, 2007, the Bone format ended as the signal was cut off in the middle of \\"Ride the River\\" by Eric Clapton, as Galaxy exited the Albany market after both stations were sold to Educational Media Foundation in a fire sale. The station became an O&O; of the K-LOVE network, and took on the WYKV call letters on July 6, 2007 after four months under EMF ownership.

Ghibbelin was named Archbishop of Arles at the Council of Avignon in 1080, at which Archbishop Aicard was deposed. He was consecrated by Pope Gregory VII. However, the clergy and people of Arles preferred Aicard, a relative of the viscounts of Marseilles who had taken the side of Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor against Gregory VII. Although Ghibbelin was supported by Bertrand I, Count of Provence, he was unable to take possession of his archdiocese. He was threatened by the citizens of Arles when he approached he city, and had to renounce his claim. Ghibbelin waited many years to take his post. In 1096, when Pope Urban II toured southern France before preaching the First Crusade at the Council of Clermont, he neglected to visit Arles. After 1096 Ghibbelin was able to occupy the archdiocese during the periodic absences of Aicard; meanwhile he also directed the diocese of Avignon. He finally succeeded Aicard around 1098, when Urban II overturned the renouncement he had made under duress from the citizens of Arles in 1080. In 1105, the will of Raymond IV of Toulouse ordered his heirs to restore everything he had usurped from Ghibbelin in Arles, Argence, Fourques, Albaron, and Fos. At the end of 1107, Ghibbelin left Arles for Palestine, as papal legate for Pope Paschal II. He was sent to settle a dispute over the Patriarchate of Jerusalem. Dagobert of Pisa had been deposed as Patriarch in 1102 and replaced by Ehremar. The pope reinstated Dagobert, who then died before he could return to Palestine. The pope was now inclined to reinstate Ehremar, but King of Jerusalem, Baldwin I, objected as he regarded him as incompetent, and Ghibbelin was chosen to decide the matter. He deposed Ehremar, and at the invitation of Baldwin himself accepted the office.Steven Runciman, A History of the Crusades, Volume II, The Kingdom of Jerusalem, Cambridge University Press, 1952, pp. 83–84 He died there in December, 1112, and was succeeded by Arnulf of Chocques as Patriarch, while the archdiocese of Arles remained vacant until 1115.

It was developed by Worldweaver Ltd and published by Electronic Arts in 1997 and is available for the Windows platform. In the game's storyline, the player was exiled by the king. They begin with limited resources and a few peasants to control. After building an empire and increasing their resources, the player can challenge Dark Lord Sabellian, who attacks the surrounding area. Gameplay The game is a standard isometric 'god' style game. The player's goal is to complete one or more specific tasks on each level. This can be to collect a certain item, to kill a certain enemy or village, earn a certain amount of gold or survive for a specific duration of time. In each level the player will have to build up their village and grow the economy and population. This involves using villagers to construct buildings and creating a village where they can reproduce. The player must provide a sufficient number of houses and resources before villagers will take it upon themselves to reproduce and create more units. There are specific levels where you already have a specific village and unit count to start with and are given the specific tasks such as protecting it for a set amount of time as waves of enemies close in on the village or defeating an enemy village before time runs out. Units During each level the player controls units called villagers. They have a stage based life cycle; from birth they go to childhood to a working adult after which comes their retirement and then eventually death. There are some special tasks that can be performed by all the villagers, including children, adults and old age people of both genders. There are also certain skills or tasks that can only be done by adults. The working women are limited to farm work including milking cows, cutting the wheat for making bread and picking apples from the orchard for cider making. The working males can be given manual labour such as building structures and repairing damaged buildings. They are also the only unit that can be trained at the various guilds available in the game. Buildings Buildings provide the structure for a village in the game. Houses are the staple building for the village and are required to provide a place for the players villagers to sleep and for them to reproduce and create more villagers for the player to control. To build a structure the player selects a building from the structures menu bar at the bottom of the screen and places the blueprint of that building on any available floorspace. The building will link a pathway automatically to the closest path available and the villagers will then construct it by working on the masonry and woodwork on the blueprint. Placing buildings automatically creates paths linked to the closest available pathway. This makes pre-planning building placement important as created paths take up valuable space on the map and can prevent the player from expanding their village efficiently if that area of the map is already blocked by existing pathways. There is a building hierarchy similar to a tech tree that means before players can build and train the more advanced units and buildings, they must have built the prerequisite structures (e.g. you can only build a farm after building a bakery). Guilds and Special Units The player can train an individual male villager at a guild to turn them into a special unit. This costs a set amount of gold per unit and gives that unit new attributes or skills. Training a footman at the footmans guild provides the male with better armor and attack damage for dealing with enemies. Training a priest at a church gives the unit activatable skills such as healing the plague and toggleable skills such as burying the dead. Other guild buildings include the town tall for training tax men, archers guild for training archers, wizards guild to train wizards, knights guild to train knights and the paladins guild to train paladins. To train a paladin, you must have a knight to send to the guild. There is a limit to the number of special units each guild building can train; the footmans guild can train a maximum of 6 footmen, before they can train more the player must build another footmans guild to increase this maximum limit to 12. Villages Depending on the level, you will start you with a set of villagers and a few starter buildings. The player must build structures to advance their village, including farms, guilds and houses so that they may train special units and grow their economy and population. Deploying the villagers to perform various tasks, such as collecting water, farming and constructing the players buildings help further with building a strong economy and healthy village. Resources As well as the gold resource gained from selling the produce your villages create, the player must manage the health and happiness of their village. The health of the village is affected by the availability of food as well as how clean the village is; the more dead bodies left around from old aged villages dying - the more likely the village will catch the plague and so become an unhealthy place to live. Happiness is affected by several factors including the prices the player sets for certain produce, the tax set for when the village has trained a tax collector and the punishments set for when villagers are caught doing certain crimes. If a village is happier this affects the life span of villages meaning they age slower and take longer to go through their full life cycle. Reception Beasts and Bumpkins had a generally positive reception among reviewers. Some rated the game as low as 40/100 whilst the majority rated it as above 70/100.\\"MobyGames review list for Beasts and Bumpkins\\" The game was well known for its humor. All of the characters had a stereotypical English West Country accent. The comedy of the game has been attributed in user reviews to the villagers' sound bites, including the \\"Fancy a bit of nookie?\\" and \\"oww, yes please!\\" responses and has attributed to the entertainment value of the game.

It is the capital of Miechów County. Population is 11,852 (2004). Miechów lies on the Miechówka river, along European route E77. The area of the town is , and it has a rail station, located on the main railroad which connects Kraków with Warsaw. History In the early years of the Polish state, the area of Miechów belonged to the medieval tribe of the Vistulans. In the late 10th century, the region was taken over by the Polans. The beginning of Miechów dates back to the year 1163, when a Polish Duke of Pomerania Jaksa of the House of Griffins, who owned the village, invited monks of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre. Apart from Miechów, prince Jaksa handed two other villages to the order. The new church with a monastery was blessed by the Bishop of Kraków Gędka in 1170. Miechów took advantage of the presence of the order. The settlement expanded together with the abbey, and in 1290 prince Przemysł II granted it the town charter based on Magdeburg rights. Despite convenient location along merchant routes, Miechów grew very slowly, due to numerous wars and conflicts. In the early 14th century, the town was burned down by Prince of Masovia Bolesław, who supported Władysław Łokietek. This incident took place during the Rebellion of wójt Albert, in which the town and the abbey supported the rebels. As a result, the monks were forced to leave Poland for a few years. After their return, King Łokietek banned Germans from the post of the abbot of the monastery. In the second half of the 15th century Miechów burned several times, and in the early 16th century, it had 70 houses. In 1525 the abbey was expanded, when Chapel of Tomb of Christ was built. Pilgrims from all over Poland began to come here. Miechów had a wooden town hall in the market square. Partitions of Poland dworek), built in the 1780s In 1790, the population of Miechów was 1,300. After the Partitions of Poland, the town briefly belonged to the Habsburg Empire. Since 1815, it was part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland. It was the seat of a county in Kraków Voivodeship, and on January 16, 1816, Miechów became the capital of the voivodeship, as the city of Kraków itself did not belong to the Russian Empire. A few months later, on August 6, 1816, the capital of the province was moved to Kielce. In 1830, a modern road was completed from Warsaw to Kraków; furthermore, small enterprises were opened in Miechów. During the January Uprising (Feb. 17, 1863), Polish rebels tried to seize the town, but failed. In retribution, Russian soldiers set Miechów on fire, after which its population was reduced by 50%. In 1885 Miechów received a rail connection with Dąbrowa Górnicza and Kielce, due to a station at a nearby village of Charsznica. On August 8, 1914, soldiers of the First Cadre Company entered Miechów, on their way to Kielce. The town remained in Austrian hands until November 1918. In 1934, the government of the Second Polish Republic completed the rail line from Kraków to Tunel, which provided direct connection between Kraków and Warsaw. As a result, Miechów finally received its own train station. World War II First Wehrmacht units entered Miechów on September 6, 1939. During World War II, the town belonged to Kraków District of the General Government. Miechów was an important center of the Home Army. From the beginning of its occupation, Germans terrorized the Jewish population, robbing them of their possessions, kidnapping them for labor gangs, and one night in April 1940, breaking into homes, attacking men and raping women, and then forcing the Jews to burn holy books in a bonfire and to sing and dance around it. In March 1941, Jews were forced into a ghetto which also included Jews from some surrounding villages. They could take only what they could carry into their new residences. In August 1942, 600 sick and elderly Jews were taken to Slomniki where they were held without food and water for several days and then some were shot on the spot and dumped into open pits. Some were sent to labor camps. Others were sent to Belzec where they were murdered immediately. In September 1942, German police units surrounded the ghetto and forced Jews to a field near the train station. Jews from other nearby towns were also taken there. From the thousands assembled, 800 or so men were sent to labor camps. The rest were sent to Belzec in trains coated with lime. These actions were typical of the fate of Jews in towns and villages throughout Poland during the Holocaust. Only a few Miechów Jews survived of the 2500 who lived there at the beginning of the war. Germans retreated on January 16, 1945 so quickly, that the town was not destroyed. After the war, Miechów was transferred from Kielce Voivodeship to Kraków Voivodeship. It was the seat of a large county, with such towns, as Proszowice, Słomniki and Książ Wielki. Location Local Nature reserves include: “Lipny Dół” in vicinity of Książ Wielki, “Biała Góra” in Tunel, and “Złota Góra” in Jaksice village. Near the Old Market Square there is a zero-category historic monument – the basilica and monastery of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre Order, founded in 1163. The monastery introduced the cult of the Holy Sepulchre in Poland. St. Vit Modest and Crescence Church in Nasiechowice and a wooden temple of Mother of Church in Przesławice are also notable.Municipality and City Office in Miechów The Jewish synagogue, located at 10 Adama Mickiewicza Street was built in the early 20th century.

It is the most important pilgrimage destination in Austria and one of the most visited shrines in Europe.Zenit News In the church, a miraculous wooden image of the Virgin Mary is honored. Pope Pius X raised the sanctuary to the status of minor basilica in 1907 and then crowned the image on 8 September 1908. It is the only church named as a national shrine of all German-speaking countries. Early history The territory around Mariazell was given to the Monastery of St. Lambrecht around 1103, and the monks built a cell there in order to serve the local residents. Legends give the town's founding day as December 21, 1157, but it is first documented in 1243. A Marian altar was dedicated there in 1266. The current church building=The Basilica of the Mariä Geburt In the fourteenth century, a gothic church stood at Mariazell with a 90 m high spire and an ogive portal. In 1420 and 1474, the church was destroyed by fire. The church building was later expanded and redesigned in the Baroque style by Domenico Sciassia from 1644 to 1683. To the left and right of the gothic spire, a baroque tower was built, the nave was lengthened and widened, and a dome was added on the eastern side. The high altar, consecrated in 1704, was designed by Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach. The twelve side chapels each contain a baroque altar. The plaster stucco work of the organ gallery and the 1737 organ console was created by the Viennese sculptor Johann Wagner in 1740. In front of the main entrance are two life- sized lead statues created by Balthasar Moll in 1757. To the left stands King Ludwig I of Hungary and to the right is Heinrich, Margrave of Moravia. In 1907, the pilgrimage church was elevated to a basilica minor. The basilica has been undergoing a general restoration since 1992, which was completed in 2007http://www.basilika- mariazell.at/site/de/freundunterstuetzer/eheminitiativen. Holy image and chapel The older part of the building, built in 1690, contains the Gnadenkapelle. This chapel sits on the site of the first \\"cell\\" and holds a Late Romanesque miraculous image of the Virgin Mary - the \\"Magna Mater Austria\\" - a 48 cm tall statuette made of linden. Pilgrimage development Pilgrims were already making their way to the Marian sanctuary in the 12th century. Larger numbers of pilgrims are documented beginning around 1330, when a secular court imposed a \\"Zellfahrt\\" ('Zell journey) as atonement for its criminals. In the following years increasing numbers of pilgrims came from neighboring lands. After the Counter-Reformation, the Habsburgs made Mariazell a national sanctuary. However, in 1783, Emperor Joseph II dissolved the monastery in Mariazell, and in 1787, he completely banned pilgrimages there. After the early withdrawal of the restrictions, today around a million pilgrims visit Mariazell each year. In May 2004, the Central European Catholic Day (mitteleuropäische Katholikentag) took place there. Legends There are three basic legends about the founding of Mariazell and its development. The legend of the town's founding says that in 1157, the St. Lambrecht Monk Magnus was sent to the area of the current town as a minister. When his way was blocked by a rock, he set down the Marian figurine he had brought with him, whereby the rock broke apart and left Magnus' way clear. On a nearby bank, he settled down, placed the figurine on a tree trunk, and built a cell out of wood, which served as both his chapel and his living quarters. The second legend relates how Henry Margrave of Moravia and his wife, having been healed of severe gout through the help of Our Lady of Mariazell made a pilgrimage to that place around 1200. There they built the first stone church on the site of the wooden chapel. The third legend recounts a victorious battle of the Hungarian King Ludwig I over a numerically superior Turkish army. Out of thanks he built the gothic church and endowed it with the \\"Schatzkammerbild\\" (\\"treasury image\\") that he saw laid upon his chest in a dream. The Mariazell Basilica was recently selected as the main motif of a collectors' coin: the Austrian Mariazell Basilica commemorative coin, minted on May 9, 2007. The coin shows the facade of the basilica with its characteristic central gothic tower flanked by two baroque towers.

It was a full- body spinner with cutting claws. In two battles in series 7, in which it competed, it knocked out the arena wall, causing the match to restart. It was created by the 870 Dreghorn Squadron's Air Cadets from the Air Training Corps and was painted to resemble the RAF crest. It was named after the Eurofighter Typhoon. The team also had a three-time middleweight champion called Typhoon, a lightweight called Typhoon Thunder (Champion of Robot Wars: Extreme II) which also made Typhoon Twins with Typhoon Lightning, and a featherweight called Typhoon Cadet. Gary Cairns, the team captain, later ran a three- dimensional printing business and fought in the 2016 Robot Wars with PP3D, which reached the second round group stage in its heat. Then, it lost, ironically, to Storm 2 in the decisive battle, before losing at the same stage a year later due to control problems in its battles. Robot Wars Extreme 2=Annihilator Typhoon 2's first appearance on Robot Wars was in the annihilator from Extreme series 2, in which six robots enter the arena and one is eliminated in every round. The other five robots were Kan-Opener, Thermidor II, Major Tom, Revenge of Trouble & Strife and Raging Reality. Typhoon 2 was eliminated in the first round when eventual champion, Kan-Opener, stopped it from spinning which allowed Raging Reality to flip it and leave it immobilized. Series 7=Round 1 vs. Colossus vs. Bigger Brother vs. U.R.O. Typhoon 2's spinning weapon never really got going in this battle and Bigger Brother was left to do most of the attacking. Bigger Brother immobilized all three of its opponents but Colossus (Flipped) and U.R.O. (Immobilized by Sgt Bash) were counted out first which meant that Typhoon 2 survived and went through to round 2. Round 2 vs. Hammerhead 2 Once Typhoon 2's spinning weapon had reached full speed it charged at Hammerhead 2 and after two attempts it damaged its opponent internally causing all movement to become reduced to rotating in a circle. Two more hits rendered Hammerhead 2 completely immobilised. Round 3 vs. Iron Awe 2.1 Once again, Typhoon 2 reached full spinning speed and attacked Iron Awe 2.1 repeatedly causing major damage to its opponent, making it spin wildly, breaking its flipper and eventually making it unable to move and was immobilised. Typhoon 2 moved on to the series semi-finals. Round 4 vs. Thermidor II Typhoon 2 employed its usual tactic of avoiding its opponent to get its spinning weapon up to full speed and eventually attacked Thermidor II. One hit was all it took as the impact conked Thermidor II out on first contact. Round 5 vs. Atomic Before Typhoon 2 was able to get its weapon up to speed, Atomic spotted the danger and attempted to flip it, but Typhoon 2 did not turn over. Atomic tried once more to flip Typhoon 2 but it hit the arena grinder instead and flipped itself onto its back, unable to self-right. Typhoon 2 charged up its weapon and attacked Atomic three times causing major damage before Atomic was eventually counted out. Typhoon advanced to Round 6. Round 6 vs. X-Terminator Typhoon 2 charged its weapon up to full power before twice attacking the front of X-Terminator, causing its opponent's disc weapon to stop spinning. Typhoon 2 continued to attack and caused massive damage to X-Terminator before spinning into the arena wall and shattering it. The fight was stopped while the arena wall was fixed and resumed with Typhoon 2 being allowed to charge its weapon to full speed before the battle restarted. After the restart, Typhoon 2 hit X-Terminator once more and finally immobilised it. Typhoon 2 progressed to the final battle. Final vs. Storm II Typhoon 2 attempted to get its weapon up-to-speed and attacked Storm II, but it just glanced off the side and Storm II sustained no damage. Typhoon 2 again tried to charge up its weapon but Storm II gave chase and twice got underneath and tilted Typhoon 2, but were unable to flip it onto its side. Typhoon 2 charged up its weapon again and spun into the arena wall, damaging it for the second time. The battle restarted with Typhoon 2 again allowed to get their weapon to full speed but Storm II remained the more aggressive and continued to ram into its opponent. However, Typhoon 2 eventually managed to damage the armour of its opponent and Storm II began to lose some of its speed and power. Storm II continued to push Typhoon 2 around the arena but with seconds remaining Storm II sustained significant damage to the front and the decision went to the judges. The judges decided that Storm II won on control and aggression, but Typhoon 2 won on style and damage with damage carrying more weight in the scoring. The decision was therefore awarded to Typhoon 2, which made it the series 7 champion. This decision caused much controversy due to reports of heavy editing, allegations of corruption and a smear campaign against Storm 2 due to it being a full body hammer and a lifter to obey the rules for an active weapon. Third World Championship As champion of series 7, Typhoon 2, was entered into the World Championship event that followed. In the first round it was drawn against Tough As Nails from Holland and RawBot from Sweden. However, technical problems forced the team to withdraw from the championship before they entered the arena. The same batteries used in the heavyweight were also used in the middleweight Typhoon according to the team members of fellow UK competitors Storm 2. Due to the time constraints of the production crew only one machine could run. The team decided to defend the middleweight title for a third year.

Tisdall was fluent in several Middle Eastern languages, including Arabic, and spent much time researching the sources of Islam and the Qur'an in the original languages. He also wrote grammars for Persian, Hindustani, Punjabi and Gujarati. As an early scholar of Gujarati grammar, he defined three major varieties of Gujarati: a standard 'Hindu' dialect, a 'Parsi' dialect and a 'Muslim' dialect.A simplified grammar of the Gujarati language by William St. Clair Tisdall (1892) Clinton Bennett, in his Victorian Images of Islam, clearly paints Tisdall as a confrontationalist perpetuating a traditional Christian anti-Muslim polemic.Bennett, Clinton Victorian Images of Islam Tisdall was one of thirteen authors whose essays were compiled in The Origins of The Koran: Classic Essays on Islam’s Holy Book, a 1998 book edited by Ibn Warraq. In reviewing the compilation, religious studies professor Herbert Berg panned the inclusion of Tisdall's work as \\"not a particularly scholarly essay\\". Berg concluded \\"[i]t seems that Ibn Warraq has included some of the essays not on the basis of their scholarly value or their status as 'classics', but rather on the basis of their hostility to Islam.

It opened September 12, 1981. History The original Rensselaer and Saratoga Railroad bridge was a wood-truss covered bridge built in 1832. On May 10, 1862 it caught fire from the sparks of a passing locomotive and soon fell into the river. Parts of the burning structure, floating with the current, imperiled the steamboats and the smaller craft tied up along the wharves. The devastating wind-driven fire also consumed more than 500 buildings covering of downtown Troy. This bridge was replaced by a second wooden bridge. In 1884 a steel railroad bridge replaced the second wooden bridge. The steel bridge was really two parallel bridges owned by the Delaware and Hudson Railroad. When rail service ended in Troy on July 27, 1963, it was converted for automobile traffic. Until then the northern span was a rail bridge, and the southern span was a toll bridge for cars, trolleys, and pedestrians. It had a lift span added in 1924-25 for river shipping. This bridge failed on March 15, 1977 due to flooding caused by of heavy weekend rains, coupled with melting snows and heavy runoff. The flood-induced scour undermined the lift span pier, causing the western lift tower and roadbed span of the bridge to collapse into the Hudson River. The current Green Island Bridge (shown in the photos) was opened four-and-a-half years later on September 12, 1981. Construction costs topped $23,000,000. The bridge is a vertical lift bridge which is raised only occasionally for river traffic. The two metal-covered frames, which straddle the roadway, house the counterweights and lift mechanisms. The lift bridge joins Troy and Center Island (once known as Starbuck Island), an island in the river. There is another bridge that connects Center Island with the village of Green Island (which is no longer an island).

He was a student of composer Darius Milhaud from 1944–46, and of Gian Carlo Menotti from 1948–50. As a composer he is probably best known for his operatic trilogy of children's stories: \\"The Mother\\", \\"The Selfish Giant\\", and \\"Harrison Loved his Umbrella\\".

A notable success was achieved with his opera \\"La Grande Breteche\\" when it was commissioned for broadcast by the NBC Opera Theatre in 1957. Hollingsworth was also honored with the Rome Prize (1958),Directory of Fellows from the American Academy in Rome. the Guggenheim Fellowship (1958), and residencies at the Montalvo Center for the Arts, the MacDowell Colony, the Yaddo Arts Colony, Wolf Trap, and the Ossaba Island Project. He received commissions from the Curtis Institute, Fedora Horowitz, Meadowbrook Music festival, and the National Endowment for the Arts.

From 1963 to 1970 he composed and orchestrated for the Harkness Ballet, followed by acting as an operatic and stage director in Austria and Turkey from 1970–72. Hollingsworth was also composer-in-residence at the American Academy in Rome. His teaching and composing career from 1976 to 1993 was centered at Oakland University, where he was composer-in-residence and finally retired as Professor Emeritus. He was much appreciated and loved by his students, from whom he required an appreciation and practical mastery of counterpoint and orchestration, as exemplified in the following quote: \\"Inspiration is fine, but when you get stuck you must have craft.\\" Among composers who were his students from that time period may be counted Harold Boatrite, Mark Gottlieb, and Daniel Jencka.

The rhizomes are very similar to common ginger but lack its pungency, and instead have a raw mango flavour. They are used in making pickles in south India and chutneys in north India. The taxonomy of the species is a subject of some confusion as some authorities have considered the name C. mangga as identical while others describe it as a distinct species with C. mangga being found in southern India while C. amada is of east Indian origin. Mango-ginger is a popular spice and vegetable due to its rich flavor, which is described as sweet with subtle earthy floral and pepper overtones and similar to that of raw mango. It is a delicious addition to salads and stir fries. It is used in South Asian and Southeast Asian as well as Far East Asian cuisines.  Medicinal research  Curcuma mangga extracts have shown cytotoxic activities on the human cancer cell lines MCF-7 (a hormone-dependent breast cell line), KB (a nasopharyngeal epidermoid cell line), A549 (a lung cell line), Ca Ski (a cervical cell line), and HT-29 (a colon cell line). The extracts showed no cytotoxicity against the non-cancerous human fibroblast cell line MRC-5. It works as an antibacterial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory and an antioxidant. Ayurveda and Unani medicine have been using Curcuma Amada as a part of their herbal remedies for centuries as a starter, diuretic, laxative, expectorant, aphrodisiac and more. It is locally used and orally consumed to relieve cold and cough and bronchitis in some cases. The biological activities of mango ginger include antioxidant activity, antibacterial activity, antifungal activity, anti-inflammatory activity, platelet aggregation inhibitory activity, cytotoxicity, antiallergic activity, hypotriglyceridemic activity, brine-shrimp lethal activity, enterokinase inhibitory activity, CNS depressant and analgesic activity.

They took part in the Kurukshetra War along with Parvatas (mountaineers) and other Himalayan tribes. They are widespread in the folds and valleys of Himalayas in Nepal and Bhutan, and in the Indian states of Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal (Darjeeling), Sikkim, Assam and Tripura.  References in Mahabharata  The Kamvojas, Gandharas, Kiratas and Barbaras were mentioned together as northern tribes at (12,206). The Yavanas, the Kiratas, the Gandharvas, the Chinas, the Savaras, the Barbaras, the Sakas, the Tusharas, the Kankas, the Pathavas, the Andhras, the Madrakas, the Paundras, the Pulindas, the Ramathas, the Kamvojas were mentioned together as tribes beyond the kingdoms of Aryavarta. The Aryavarta-kings had doubts on dealing with them. (12,64)  Kiratas as a Mlechha tribe  Kiratas were mentioned along with Pulindas and Chinas, Hunas, Pahlavas, Sakas, Yavanas, Savaras, Paundras, Kanchis, Dravidas, Sinhalas and Keralas. All these tribes were described as Mlechha tribes. Here they were described as the protectors of sage Vasistha and his cow against the attack of the king Viswamitra. (1,177).  Territories of Kiratas  Kirata territories extended along the Himalayan belt of the mountain ranges. =Kiratas of diverse regions in ancient India= Numerous chiefs of the Kiratas, armed with hunting weapons and ever engaged in hunting activities, eating of fruits and roots and attired in skins (animal-skins or tree-barks), were mentioned to dwell on the northern slopes of the Himavat and on the mountain from behind which the sun rises (Arunachal Pradesh) and in the region of Karusha on the sea-coast (could be the mouths of Ganges in Bangladesh or the mouths of Sindhu in Pakistan) and on both sides of the Lohitya mountains (in eastern Assam and western Arunachal Pradesh). They were mentioned as bringing tribute to Yudhishthira during his Rajasuya sacrifice. They brought with them, loads upon loads of sandal and aloe as also black aloe, and heaps upon heaps of valuable skins and gold and perfumes, and ten thousand serving- girls of their own race, and many beautiful animals and birds of remote countries, and much gold of great splendour procured from mountains (2,51). The Kairatas (Kiratas), the Daradas, the Darvas, the Suras, the Vaiamakas, the Audumvaras, the Durvibhagas, the Kumaras, the Paradas along with the Vahlikas, the Kashmiras, the Ghorakas also were mentioned, here as bringin tributes The various tribes of Kiratas were mentioned along with the Pahlavas and the Daradas and Yavanas and Sakas and the Harahunas and Chinas and Tukharas and the Sindhavas and the Jagudas and the Ramathas and the Mundas and the inhabitants of the kingdom of women and the Tanganas and the Kekayas and the Malavas and the inhabitants of Kasmira. They were described as accepting the sway of Yudhishthira, performing various offices in his palace. (3,51) The Kiratas who were fierce in battles mostly dwelled in the vastness of the Himavat.It is believed by some scholars that they were vanquished by Karna. =Kiratas under the Himalayan kingdom called Pulinda= Pulinda king is described as the king of Kiratas also at (2,4). He is said to attend the inauguration of the new court of Pandava king Yudhishthira at Indraprastha along with many other kings of Ancient India (Bharata Varsha). His kingdom lay close to the Kailas range in Tibet. Domains of king Suvahu, the lord of the Pulindas, is mentioned as situated on the Himalayas abounding in horses and elephants, densely inhabited by the Kiratas and the Tanganas, crowded by hundreds of Pulindas, frequented by the exotic tribes, and rife with wonders. Pandavas stayed here for some time on their onward-journey to the Himalayan regions (3,140). Then all those warriors, viz the Pandavas having in due course happily lived at Badari (Badrinath, Uttarakhand), for one month, proceeded towards the realm of Suvahu, king of the Kiratas, by following the same track by which they had come. And crossing the difficult Himalayan regions, and the countries of China, Tukhara, Darada and all the climes of Kulinda, rich in heaps of jewels, those warlike men reached the capital of Suvahu (3,176). Their final destination was the source of Yamuna. Thus they could have made a circular path, from Badari (Badrinath) to Tibet and Kashmir and finally to Himachal Pradesh. =Kiratas under Paundraka Vasudeva= There was a king named Paundraka Vasudeva, who was an enemy of Vasudeva Krishna. This king used to dress like Vasudeva Krishan and mock him. He mentioned to rule over the kingdoms of Vanga (West Bengal), Pundra (north- Bangladesh) and Kiratas (2,14). The Kiratas mentioned here were those living in the vicinity of Darjeeling Himalayan region. = Kiratas under Bhagadatta = Kiratas and Chinas were mentioned as forming the army of Pragjyotisha (Assam) king Bhagadatta (5,19). This army took part in the Kurukshetra War for the sake of Kauravas and its size was one Akshouhini (a huge army unit). =Kiratas conquered by Bhima= Bhima, during his military campaign in the eastern countries to collect tribute for Pandava king Yudhishthira's Rajasuya sacrifice, conquered Kirata kings, close to the Videha Kingdom Bhima, the son of Pandu, sending forth expeditions from Videha Kingdom, conquered the seven kings of the Kiratas living about the Indra mountain (2,29). These were considered to be the Kiriatas in Nepal. =Kiratas conquered by Nakula= Nakula during his military campaign in the western countries to collect tribute for Pandava king Yudhishthira's Rajasuya sacrifice, conquered Kiratas in the western hills Nakula, the son of Pandu, then reduced to subjection the fierce Mlechchas residing on the sea coast (in Karachi area), as also the wild tribes of the Palhavas (an Iranian tribe), the Kiratas, the Yavanas and the Sakas (2,31). These Kiratas lied in the western mountains in Pakistan.  Kiratas in Kurukhsetra War  Kiratas and Chinas were part of the one Akshouhini of troops of Pragjyotisha (Assam) king Bhagadatta who joined the side of the Kauravas(5,19). Western Kiratas were mentioned along with the Sakas, and Yavanas, the Sivis and the Vasatis as marching in the huge army of Kauravas (5,198). The Sakas, the Kiratas, the Yavanas, and the Pahlavas were mentioned in a battle-array formed by the Kauravas (6,20). Similarly, they are mentioned in another battle-array formed on another day at (6,50). Words of Satyaki a Yadava chief on the side of Pandavas, during Kurukshetra War:- Those other elephants 700 in number, all cased in armour and ridden by Kiratas, and decked with ornaments, the king of the Kiratas, desirous of his life, had formerly presented to Arjuna. These were formerly employed in doing good to Yudhishthira. Behold the vicissitudes that time brings about, for these are now battling against Yudhishthira. Those elephants are ridden by Kiratas difficult of defeat in battle. They are accomplished in fighting from elephants and are all sprung from the race of Agni. Formerly, they were all vanquished in battle by Arjuna. They are now waiting for me carefully, under the orders of Duryodhana. Slaying with my shafts these Kiratas difficult of defeat in battle, I shall follow in the track of Arjuna (7,109). The Tusharas, the Yavanas, the Khasas, the Darvabhisaras, the Daradas, the Sakas, the Kamathas, the Ramathas, the Tanganas the Andhrakas (obviously not the southern Andhras), the Pulindas, the Kiratas of fierce prowess, the Mlecchas, the Mountaineers, and the races hailing from the sea-side, were all united in battle for the purpose of the Kaurava king Duryodhana. (8,73) The ruler of the Kiratas died in battle (8,5).  Arjuna's conquests after Kurukhsetra War  Countless was the fete of Kshatriyas, of kings in myriads, who fought with Arjuna on the occasion of his military campaign to collect tribute for Yudhishthira's Ashwamedha sacrifice, for having lost their kinsmen on the field of Kurukshetra. Innumerable Kiratas also and Yavanas, all excellent bowmen, and diverse tribes of Mlechechas too, who had been discomfited before (by the Pandavas on the field of Kurukshetra), and many Arya kings, possessed of soldiers and animals, encountered Arjuna in battle (14,73). He battled with the Kasis, the Angas, the Kosalas, the Kiratas, and the Tanganas (14,83) =Absence of Brahmins among Kiratas= The Mekalas, the Dravidas, the Lathas, the Paundras, the Konwasiras, the Saundikas, the Daradas, the Darvas, the Chauras, the Savaras, the Varvaras, the Kiratas, the Yavanas, Kambojas, Hunas, Sakas and numerous other tribes of Kshatriyas, have become degraded into the status of Sudras through the absence of Brahmanas.

Description Virginia bluebells have rounded and gray-green leaves, borne on stems up to tall. They are petiolate at the bottom of the flower stem and sessile at the top. Flowerbuds are pink. Flowers have five petals fused into a tube, five stamens, and a central pistil (carpel). They are borne in mid-spring in nodding spiral-shaped cymes at the end of arched stems. Flowers are usually blue, but white or pink flowers occur rarely. The stamens and stigma are spaced too far apart for self-fertilization. The flower can be pollinated by bumblebees but, due to its funnel shape bumblebees must hover, making the bumblebee a rare pollinator. Butterflies are the most common pollinators because they can easily perch on the edges and still enjoy the nectar. In early summer, each fertilized flower produces four seeds within wrinkled nuts, and the plant goes dormant till the next spring. Plants are hardy to hardiness zone 3: . In cultivation, M. virginica has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

Species Plantarum 1:135. (see External links below) The genus Pulmonaria is today restricted to 19 species in the tribe Boragineae. When Albrecht Wilhelm Roth erected the genus Mertensia in 1797, he named the Virginia bluebell as Mertensia pulmonarioides, apparently unaware that Linnaeus had already named it in his Species Plantarum.

Both seasons received a positive review with the stylized action scenes and the strong female characters' being praised, while also criticizing the somewhat repetitive nature of the plot.http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video- games/editorials/reviews/anime/6665-Anime-Review-Black-Lagoon-The-Second- Barrage ReferencesFurther reading  * External links * *Black Lagoon at Sunday GX *Funimation's Black Lagoon website * * Category:Fiction set in the 1990s Category:2002 manga Category:2006 anime television series Category:2008 Japanese novels Category:2010 anime OVAs Category:Anime series based on manga Category:Crime in anime and manga Category:Funimation Category:Gagaga Bunko Category:Geneon USA Category:Girls with guns anime and manga Category:Light novels Category:Madhouse (company) Category:Madman Entertainment anime Category:Madman Entertainment manga Category:Manga adapted into television series Category:NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan Category:Organized crime in anime and manga Category:Patricide in fiction Category:Piracy in fiction Category:Pirates in anime and manga Category:Seinen manga Category:Shogakukan franchises Category:Shogakukan manga Category:Terrorism in fiction Category:Thailand in fiction Category:Thriller anime and manga Category:Toonami Category:Viz Media manga Category:Works about the Russian Mafia ","title":"Black Lagoon"},{"id":"4418859","text":"The Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War was the central theater of military operations in the second half of the American Revolutionary War, 1778–1781. It encompassed engagements primarily in Virginia, Georgia and South Carolina. Tactics consisted of both strategic battles and guerrilla warfare. During the first three years of the conflict, 1775–1778, the largest military encounters between Continental Army and the British Army had been in the New England and Middle colonies, around the cities of Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. After the failure of the Saratoga campaign, the British Army largely abandoned operations in the north and pursued peace through subjugation in the Southern Colonies.Hibbert, C.; Rebels and Redcoats; p. 235. Before 1778, these colonies were largely dominated by Patriot-controlled governments and militias, although there was also a Continental Army presence that played a role in the 1776 defense of Charleston, the suppression of loyalist militias, and attempts to drive the British from strongly loyalist East Florida. The British began to implement their \\"Southern Strategy\\" in late 1778, in Georgia. It initially achieved success with the capture of Savannah, Georgia, which was followed in 1780 by operations in South Carolina that included the defeat of Continental forces at Charleston and Camden. At the same time France (in 1778) and Spain (in 1779) declared war on Great Britain in support of the United States. Spain captured all of British West Florida, culminating in the Siege of Pensacola in 1781. France initially offered only naval support for the first few years after its declaration of war but in 1781 sent massive numbers of soldiers to join General George Washington's army and marched into Virginia from New York. General Nathanael Greene, who took over as Continental Army commander after Camden, engaged in a strategy of avoidance and attrition against the British. The two forces fought a string of battles, most of which were tactical, though pyrrhic victories for the British Army. The high cost in casualties left it strategically weakened, while the Continental Army remained largely intact to continue fighting. This was best exemplified by the Battle of Guilford Courthouse. Several American victories, such as the Battle of Ramseur's Mill, the Battle of Cowpens, and the Battle of Kings Mountain, also served to weaken the overall British military strength. The culminating engagement, the Siege of Yorktown, ended with the surrender of British General Lord Cornwallis on October 19, 1781. It was essentially the last major battle of the Revolutionary War.Russell, David Lee; The America Revolution in the Southern Colonies; 2009. Shortly afterward, negotiations between the United States and Great Britain began, resulting in the Treaty of Paris of 1783. Early operations, 1775–1778 Detail of a 1770s map showing eastern Virginia and many of the places where conflict occurred in 1775. The map is oriented with North to the bottom and South to the top. Virginia In most colonies British officials quickly departed as the Patriots took control. In Virginia, the royal governor resisted. In the Gunpowder Incident of April 20, 1775, Lord Dunmore, the Royal Governor of Virginia, removed gunpowder stored in Williamsburg to a British warship in the James River. Dunmore saw rising unrest in the colony and was trying to deprive Virginia militia of supplies needed for insurrection. The Patriot militia, led by Patrick Henry, forced Dunmore to pay for the gunpowder. Dunmore continued to hunt for caches of military equipment and supplies in the following months, acts that were sometimes anticipated by Patriot militia, who would move supplies before his arrival.John E. Selby, The Revolution in Virginia, 1775–1783 (1988) ch. 1 Dunmore issued an emancipation proclamation in November 1775, promising freedom to runaway slaves who fought for the British. After an incident at Kemp's Landing in November where Dunmore's troops killed and captured Patriot militiamen, Patriot forces defeated Loyalist troops (which included runaway slaves Dunmore had formed into his Ethiopian Regiment) at the Battle of Great Bridge on December 9. Dunmore and his troops retreated to Royal Navy ships anchored off Norfolk; these naval forces bombarded and burned the town on January 1, 1776. Patriot forces in the town completed the destruction of the former Loyalist stronghold. Dunmore was driven from an island in Chesapeake Bay that summer, and never returned to Virginia.Selby, The Revolution in Virginia, 1775–1783 (1988) ch. 2 Georgia Georgia's royal governor, James Wright, nominally remained in power until January 1776, when the unexpected arrival of British ships near Savannah prompted the local Committee of Safety to order his arrest. Georgia Patriots and Loyalists alike believed the fleet had arrived to provide military support to the governor; it had been sent from the besieged British forces in Boston, Massachusetts to acquire rice and other provisions. Wright escaped captivity and reached the fleet. In the Battle of the Rice Boats in early March, the British successfully left Savannah with a number of merchant vessels containing the desired rice supplies. The Carolinas Sir Henry Clinton led the British land forces in the failed attack on Charleston. South Carolina's population was politically divided when the war began. The lowland communities, dominated by Charleston, sided strongly with the Patriots, while the back country held a large number of Loyalist sympathizers.Alden, pp. 199–200 By August 1775, both sides were recruiting militia companies.Cann, p. 204 In September, a Patriot militia seized Fort Johnson, Charleston's major defense works, and Governor William Campbell fled to a Royal Navy ship in the harbor.McCrady, pp. 68–69 The seizure by Loyalists of a shipment of gunpowder and ammunition intended for the Cherokee caused an escalation in tensions that led to the First Siege of Ninety Six in western South Carolina late November.Cann, pp. 207–213 Patriot recruiting was by then outstripping that of the Loyalists, and a major campaign (called the Snow Campaign due to unusually heavy snowfall) involving as many as 5,000 Patriots led by Colonel Richard Richardson succeeded in capturing or driving away most of the Loyalist leadership. Loyalists fled, either to East Florida or to the Cherokee lands. A faction of the Cherokee, known as the Chickamauga, rose up in support of the British and Loyalists in 1776. They were finally defeated by militia forces from North and South Carolina. Crucial in any British attempt to gain control of the South was the possession of a port to bring in supplies and men. To this end, the British organized an expedition to establish a strong post somewhere in the southern colonies, and sent military leaders to recruit Loyalists in North Carolina. The expedition's departure from Europe was significantly delayed, and the Loyalist force that was recruited to meet it was decisively defeated in the Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge in late February 1776. When General Henry Clinton arrived at Cape Fear, North Carolina, in May, he found conditions there unsuitable for a strong post. Scouting by the Royal Navy identified Charleston, whose defenses were unfinished and seemed vulnerable, as a more suitable location. In June 1776, Clinton and Admiral Sir Peter Parker led an assault on Fort Sullivan, which guarded the Charleston harbor. Clinton had failed to order a complete reconnaissance of the area. His 2,200 men force was landed on Long Island (adjacent to Sullivan's Island on which the fort was positioned), and they found the channel dividing the two islands too deep to ford.Bicheno, H: Rebels and Redcoats, p.158 Instead of re-embarking on his boats, he relied on the expedition's naval forces to reduce the fort, which became known after the war as Fort Moultrie. However, the firepower of the British ships was unable to make an impression on the spongy palmetto logs that formed the majority of the fort's defenses, and the bombardment failed in its objective.Hibbert, C: Rebels and Redcoats, p.106 It was a humiliating failure, and Clinton called off his campaign in the Carolinas.Kepner, F, \\"A British View of the Siege of Charleston, 1776\\", The Journal of Southern History, Vol. 11, No. 1. (Feb., 1945), p. 94 Jstor link Clinton and Parker argued after the engagement, each blaming the other for the failure of the assault. It is debated that the South was lost by this failure to take Charleston in 1776, as it left the Loyalists unsupported for three years, while allowing the port of Charleston to serve the American cause until 1780.Bicheno, H: Rebels and Redcoats, p.154, 158 Failed attempts at British East Florida Patriots in Georgia attempted several times to defeat the British garrison that was based at Saint Augustine in British East Florida. This garrison actively supported the activities of Loyalists who fled there from Georgia and other southern states, and were responsible for raiding cattle and other supplies in southern Georgia. The first attempt was organized by Charles Lee after he took command of the Southern Department, but sputtered out when he was recalled to the main army. The second attempt was organized by Georgia Governor Button Gwinnett with minimal help from the new commander of the Southern Department, Robert Howe, in 1777. This expedition also failed. Gwinnett and his militia commander, Lachlan McIntosh, could not agree on anything. Some Georgia militia companies made it into East Florida, but they were checked in the May Battle of Thomas Creek. The last expedition was in early 1778. More than 2,000 Continentals and state militia were raised for the effort, but it also failed due to issues of command between Howe and Georgia governor John Houstoun.Coleman, K: A History of Georgia, pp.77-78 A brief skirmish at Alligator Bridge in late June, combined with tropical diseases and command issues in the Patriot forces, left East Florida firmly in British hands for the war's duration. British campaign in the South=The Loyalist question In 1778, the British again turned their attention to the South, where they hoped to regain control by recruiting thousands of Loyalists. Their belief in widespread Loyalist support was based on the accounts of Loyalist exiles in London who had direct access to the British Secretary of State for America, George Germain. Keen to recover their lands and be rewarded for their loyalty to the crown, these men realized that the best way to convince the British to undertake a major operation in the South would be to exaggerate the level of potential Loyalist support. As a group, they had great influence on the British ministers in London.Ritcheson, C.; \\"Loyalist Influence on British Policy Toward the United States After the American Revolution\\"; Eighteenth-Century Studies; Vol. 7, No. 1; Autumn, 1973; p. 6. Jstor link In addition, there were strong business, trading and family ties among some Loyalists and the British in London. The British operated under the expectation that they would find substantial support for their actions, if only they liberated the right areas. While in South Carolina, Cornwallis wrote in a letter to Clinton that \\"Our assurances of attachment from our poor distressed friends in North Carolina are as strong as ever.\\"\\"Letter from Cornwallis to Clinton, August 6th 1780\\", Clinton Papers; Clements Library, University of Michigan. For the most part, this assumption was incorrect, as Cornwallis soon realized as the campaign progressed.Wickwire; Cornwallis, the American Adventure; p.315. British take Savannah Portrait of General Benjamin Lincoln; by Charles Willson Peale On April 19, 1778, three row galleys of the Georgia Navy engaged, defeated, and captured a Royal Navy brigantine, an armed British East Florida provincial sloop, and an armed brig. On December 29, 1778, a British expeditionary corps of 3,500 men from New York, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Archibald Campbell, captured Savannah, Georgia. He was joined in mid-January 1779 by Brigadier General Augustine Prevost, leading troops that marched up from Saint Augustine, taking over outposts along the way. Prevost assumed command of the forces in Georgia; and dispatched Campbell with 1,000 men toward Augusta with the goals of gaining control of that town and the recruitment of Loyalists.Morrill (1993), pp. 46–47 The remnants of the defense of Savannah had retreated to Purrysburg, South Carolina, about upriver from Savannah, where they were met by Major General Benjamin Lincoln, commander of Continental Army forces in the South. He marched most of the army from Charleston, South Carolina in a move intended to monitor and oppose Prevost. Early in February, 1779, Prevost sent a few hundred men to occupy Beaufort in a move probably intended to divert Lincoln's attention from Campbell's movements; Lincoln responded by sending General Moultrie and 300 men to drive them out. The Battle of Beaufort was largely indecisive, and both contingents eventually returned to their bases. In the meantime, Campbell had taken control of Augusta without much resistance, and Loyalists were beginning to turn out. While he enrolled more than 1,000 men over a two-week period, he was powerless to prevent the defeat of a sizable number of Loyalists by Patriot militia under Andrew Pickens in the February 14, 1779, Battle of Kettle Creek, from Augusta. This demonstrated to everyone in the area the limits of the British Army's ability to protect Loyalists. Campbell suddenly left Augusta, apparently in response to the arrival of John Ashe and more than 1,000 North Carolina militia Lincoln sent to add to the 1,000 militia that were already across the river from Augusta in South Carolina. On the way back to Savannah, Campbell turned over command of his men to Augustine Prevost's brother, Mark. The younger Prevost turned the tables on Ashe, who was following him south, surprising and very nearly destroying his force of 1,300 in the March 3 Battle of Brier Creek.Morrill (1993), pp. 48–50 =Second attack on Charleston= By April, Lincoln had been reinforced by large numbers of South Carolina militia and received additional military supplies through Dutch shipments to Charleston. He decided to move toward Augusta. Leaving 1,000 men under the command of General Moultrie at Purrysburg to monitor Augustine Prevost, he began the march north on April 23, 1779. Prevost's reaction was to lead 2,500 men from Savannah toward Purrysburg on April 29. Moultrie fell back toward Charleston rather than engaging, and Prevost was within on May 10 before he began to see resistance. Two days later he intercepted a message indicating that Lincoln, alerted to Prevost's advance, was hurrying back from Augusta to assist in the defense of Charleston. Prevost retreated to the islands southwest of Charleston, leaving an entrenched guard at Stono Ferry (near present-day Rantowles, South Carolina) to cover his retreat. When Lincoln got back to Charleston he led about 1,200 men, mostly untried militia, after Prevost. This force was repulsed by the British on June 20, 1779, in the Battle of Stono Ferry. The rear guard, having succeeded in its objective, abandoned that post a few days later.Morrill (1993), pp. 53–54 Prevost's foray against Charleston was notable for his troop's arbitrary looting and pillaging, which enraged friend and foe alike in the South Carolina low country.Wilson, p. 112 =Defense of Savannah= In October 1779, French and Continental Army forces tried to retake Savannah. Under the leadership of General Lincoln, and with the assistance of a French naval squadron commanded by Comte d'Estaing, it was a spectacular failure. The combined French-American forces suffered some 901 casualties, to the British 54.Hibbert, C.; Rebels and Redcoats; p. 246. The French Navy found Savannah's fortifications similar to those that had defied Admiral Peter Parker at Charleston in 1776. The artillery bombardment had little effect on the defenses, but unlike Charleston—where Clinton decided against attacking Fort Moultrie by land—Estaing decided to press the assault after the naval bombardment had failed.Hibbert, C.; Rebels and Redcoats; p. 245. In this assault, Count Kazimierz Pułaski, the Polish commander of American cavalry, was fatally wounded.Rodgers, T.; \\"Siege of Savannah During the American Revolutionary War\\"; Military History; March 1997; p. 6. HistoryNet resource With Savannah secured, Clinton could launch a new assault on Charleston, South Carolina, where he had failed in 1776. Lincoln moved his remaining troops to Charleston to assist in the construction of its defenses.Bicheno, H: Rebels and Redcoats, p.166 =Third attack on Charleston= Major operations in the South during 1780 Clinton moved against Charleston in 1780, blockading the harbor in March and building up about 10,000 troops in the area. His advance on the city was uncontested; the American naval commander, Commodore Abraham Whipple, scuttled five of his eight frigates in the harbor to make a boom for its defense.Bicheno, H: Rebels and Redcoats, p.171 Inside the city, General Lincoln commanded about 2,650 Continentals and 2,500 militiamen. When British colonel Banastre Tarleton cut off the city's supply lines in victories at Moncks Corner in April and Lenud's Ferry in early May,Wickwire, Cornwallis, the American Adventure, p.131 Charleston was surrounded.Hibbert, C, Rebels and Redcoats, p.266 Clinton began constructing siege lines. On March 11 he commenced the bombardment of the town.The Siege of Charleston; Journal of Captain Peter Russell, December 25, 1779, to May 2, 1780; The American Historical Review; Vol. 4, No. 3; Apr., 1899; p. 490. Jstor link On May 12, 1780, General Lincoln surrendered his 5,000 men—the largest surrender of U.S. troops until the American Civil War.Boatner; Encyclopedia of the American Revolution; p. 213. With relatively few casualties, Clinton had seized the South's biggest city and seaport, winning perhaps the greatest British victory of the war. This victory left the American military structure in the South in ruins. It was only after Nathanael Greene slipped past Cornwallis after the Battle of Guilford Courthouse in 1781 that the British finally lost this advantage in the South.Mackey, The War for America, 1964 Lord Cornwallis took command when Sir Henry Clinton sailed for New York. The remnants of the southern Continental Army began to withdraw toward North Carolina, but were pursued by Colonel Tarleton, who defeated them at the Battle of Waxhaws on May 29. Historians have debated accounts spread after the battle that Tarleton's forces had massacred many Patriots after they had surrendered. As a consequence, \\"Bloody Tarleton\\" or \\"Bloody Ban\\" became a hated name, and the phrase, \\"Tarleton's quarter\\"—referring to his reputed lack of mercy, or \\"quarter\\"—soon became a rallying cry for the Patriots. Whether or not the battle was the massacre that it was claimed, its ramifications were felt throughout the campaign. When a Loyalist militia surrendered at the end of the Battle of Kings Mountain, many of them were killed when Patriot marksmen continued to fire while shouting \\"Tarleton's Quarters!\\".Wickwire; Cornwallis, the American Adventure; p. 258, Tarleton later published an account of the war that glossed over accusations of misconduct towards American militia, and portrayed him in an unabashedly positive light.Tarleton; A History of the Campaigns of 1780 and 1781 in the Southern Provinces of North America; 1787. Cornwallis takes command After Charleston, organized American military activity in the South virtually collapsed. The states carried on their governmental functions, and the war was carried on by partisans such as Francis Marion, Thomas Sumter, William R. Davie, Andrew Pickens, and Elijah Clarke. General Clinton turned over British operations in the South to Lord Cornwallis. The Continental Congress dispatched General Horatio Gates, the victor of Saratoga, to the South with a new army, but Gates promptly suffered one of the worst defeats in U.S. military history at the Battle of Camden (August 16, 1780). Cornwallis prepared to invade North Carolina.Jim Piecuch, The Battle of Camden (2006). Cornwallis' attempts to raise Loyalists in large numbers in North Carolina were effectively crushed when Patriot militia defeated a larger force of Loyalists in the Battle of Kings Mountain on October 7, 1780. Many of the Patriot men had crossed the Appalachian Mountains from the Washington District of North Carolina to fight the British, and were so named the Overmountain Men. The British plan to raise large Loyalist armies failed—not enough Loyalists enlisted, and those who did were at high risk once the British army moved on. The defeat at Kings Mountain and the continuing harassment of his communications and supply lines by militia forces in South Carolina forced Cornwallis to withdraw and winter in South Carolina. Gates was replaced by Washington's most dependable subordinate, General Nathanael Greene. Greene assigned about 1,000 men to General Daniel Morgan, a superb tactician who crushed Tarleton's troops at the Battle of Cowpens on January 17, 1781. As after Kings Mountain, Cornwallis was later criticized for detaching part of his army without adequate support.Clinton, H.; The American Rebellion; 1783. Greene proceeded to wear down his opponents in a series of skirmishes and military movements referred to as the \\"Race to the Dan\\" (so named because the Dan River flows close to the border between North Carolina and Virginia); each encounter resulted in a tactical victory for the British but gave them no strategic advantage, while attrition took its toll.Terry Golway, Washington's General: Nathanael Greene and the Triumph of the American Revolution (2005) ch 10. Cornwallis knew that Greene had divided his forces and wanted to face either Morgan's or Greene's contingent before they could rejoin. He stripped his army of all excess baggage in an effort to keep up with the fast-moving Patriots. When Greene learned of this decision, his gleeful response was \\"Then, he is ours!\\"Morrill (1993), p. 140 Cornwallis' lack of provisions as a consequence played a role in his later difficulties. Portrait of General Nathanael Greene; by Charles Willson Peale Greene first engaged Cornwallis in the Battle of Cowan's Ford, where Greene had sent General William Lee Davidson with 900 men. When Davidson was killed in the river, the Americans retreated. Greene was weakened, but he continued his delaying tactics, fighting a dozen more skirmishes in South and North Carolina against Cornwallis' forces. About 2,000 British troops died in these engagements. Greene summed up his approach in a motto that would become famous: \\"We fight, get beat, rise, and fight again.\\" His tactics have been likened to the Fabian strategy of Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus, the Roman general who wore down the superior forces of the Carthaginian Hannibal by a slow war of attrition.Livy; ad Urbe Cond.; xii, xviii. Greene eventually felt strong enough to face Cornwallis directly—near New Garden, North Carolina (modern day Greensboro, North Carolina). Although Cornwallis was the tactical victor in the Battle of Guilford Court House, the casualties his army suffered forced him to retreat to Wilmington, North Carolina, for resupply and reinforcements.Golway, Washington's General: Nathanael Greene and the Triumph of the American Revolution (2005) pp 248-60. Major operations in the South during 1781 While Cornwallis was unable to completely destroy Greene, he recognized that most of the supplies that the American forces were relying on were coming from Virginia, a state that up to this point in the war had been relatively untouched. Against the wishes of Clinton, Cornwallis resolved to invade Virginia in the hopes that cutting the supply lines to the Carolinas would make American resistance there impossible.Cornwallis; An Answer to Sir Henry Clinton's Narrative. Note: Cornwallis wrote this pamphlet shortly after the war in explanation of his actions. This theory was supported by Lord George Germain in a series of letters that left Clinton out of the decision- making process for the Southern Army, despite his nominally being its overall commander.Cornwallis Correspondence, Public Record Office Without informing Clinton, Cornwallis marched north from Wilmington into Virginia to engage in raiding operations,Clinton, H.; The American Rebellion. Note: This lack of notification was one of Sir Henry Clinton's main arguments in his own defense in the controversy that followed the surrender at Yorktown. where he eventually met the army commanded by William Phillips and Benedict Arnold, which had engaged in raiding activities there.Franklin B. Wickwire and Mary B. Wickwire. Cornwallis and the War of Independence (1971) These raids resulted in massive destruction of tobacco fields and curing barns, as the colonists used tobacco to fund their war efforts. The British destruction of about 10,000 hogsheads of tobacco (roughly 10 million pounds) in 1780 and 1781 became known as the Tobacco War. When Cornwallis left Greensboro for Wilmington, he left the road open for Greene to begin the American reconquest of South Carolina. This he achieved by the end of June, in spite of a reverse sustained at Lord Rawdon's hands at Hobkirk's Hill (2 miles north of Camden) on April 25. From May 22 to June 19, 1781 Greene led the Siege of Ninety-Six, which he was only forced to abandon when word arrived that Rawdon was bringing troops to relieve the siege. However, the actions of Greene and militia commanders like Francis Marion drove Rawdon to eventually abandon the Ninety Six District and Camden, effectively reducing the British presence in South Carolina to the port of Charleston. Augusta, Georgia was also besieged on May 22, and fell to Patriot forces under Andrew Pickens and Harry \\"Light Horse\\" Lee on June 6, reducing the British presence in that state to the port of Savannah.George W. Kyte, \\"Strategic Blunder: Lord Cornwallis Abandons the Carolinas, 1781.\\" Historian 22.2 (1960): 129-144. Greene then gave his forces a six weeks' rest on the High Hills of the Santee River. On September 8, with 2,600 men, he engaged British forces under Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Stewart at Eutaw Springs. Americans who fell in this battle were immortalized by American author Philip Freneau in his 1781 poem \\"To the Memory of Brave Americans.\\" The battle, although tactically a draw, so weakened the British that they withdrew to Charleston, where Greene penned them in for the remaining months of the war.Bicheno; 2001. Note: Bicheno strongly emphasizes that Cornwallis' absence from the South made the American reconquest merely a matter of time. Yorktown The surrender of British troops at Yorktown; French engraving; 1781 General Washington receives Cornwallis' sword from Charles O'Hara; sculpture from the facade of the Capitol Building in Washington. Upon arrival in Virginia, Cornwallis took command of the existing British forces in the region, which had been commanded first by turncoat Benedict Arnold, and then by Major General William Phillips. Phillips, a good friend of Cornwallis, died two days before Cornwallis reached his position at Petersburg.Wickwire; Cornwallis, The American Adventure; 1970. Having marched without informing Clinton of his movements (communications between the two British commanders was by sea and extremely slow, sometimes up to three weeks), Cornwallis sent word of his northward march and set about destroying American supplies in the Chesapeake region.Benton Rain Patterson, Washington and Cornwallis: The Battle for America, 1775-1783 (2017) pp 289-300. In March 1781, in response to the threat of Arnold and Phillips, General Washington had dispatched the Marquis de Lafayette to defend Virginia. The young Frenchman had 3,200 men at his command, but British troops in the state totaled 7,200. Lafayette skirmished with Cornwallis, avoiding a decisive battle while gathering reinforcements. It was during this period that Cornwallis received orders from Clinton to choose a position on the Virginia Peninsula—referred to in contemporary letters as the \\"Williamsburg Neck\\"—and construct a fortified naval post to shelter ships of the line. In complying with this order, Cornwallis put himself at risk to become trapped. With the arrival of the French fleet under the Comte de Grasse and General Washington's combined French-American army, Cornwallis found himself cut off. When the Royal Navy fleet, under Admiral Thomas Graves, was defeated by the French at the Battle of the Chesapeake, and a French siege train arrived from Newport, Rhode Island, his position became untenable. Cornwallis surrendered to General Washington and the French commander the Comte de Rochambeau on October 19, 1781.Patterson, Washington and Cornwallis: The Battle for America, 1775-1783 (2017) pp 301-30. Cornwallis reported this disaster to Clinton in a letter that opened: > I have the mortification to inform Your Excellency that I have been forced > to give up the posts of York and Gloucester and to surrender the troops > under my command by capitulation, on the 19th instant, as prisoners of war > to the combined forces of America.Cornwallis to Clinton, 20th October, 1781, > Cornwallis Papers, Public Record Office Consequences With the surrender at Yorktown, the full participation of French forces in that battle, and the resulting loss of Cornwallis' army, the British war effort ground to a halt. The sole remaining British army of any size remaining in America was that under Sir Henry Clinton in New York. Clinton, paralyzed by the defeat, made no further action and was replaced by Guy Carleton in 1782.Wientraub; Iron Tears 2005. Such a shocking reversal in fortune, coming as it had on the back of a rare naval defeat, served to increase the shift in British popular opinion against the war. The North Ministry collapsed, a peace-oriented government took power, and no further major operation on the American continent occurred for the rest of the war. While Saratoga had started the decline of British fortunes in the Revolution, Yorktown was its death knell.Andrew Jackson O'Shaughnessy, The Men who Lost America: British Leadership, the American Revolution, and the Fate of the Empire (2014) pp 41-43, 76-78 ReferencesSources * *Bicheno, H: Rebels and Redcoats: The American Revolutionary War, London, 2003 *Boatner, Mark Mayo, III.

It is a city located in a rural, mountainous area. While most of the city consists of modern buildings, its principal monument is the 16th-century church and former monastery of San José. Formerly, its name was Taximaroa, and it was the part of the Purépecha Empire closest to the Aztec Empire. This prompted two unsuccessful Aztec invasions as well as the first Spanish incursion into Purépecha lands in 1522. For both the city and rural communities around it, forestry and furniture making are important parts of the economy, but deforestation is forcing the area to look into alternatives such as tourism to take advantage of its natural resources and cultural sites. The city San José parish Close-up of atrium cross showing the obsidian mirror Today, the city has mostly modern construction and streets, as one of Michoacán's ten principal municipalities. However, it retains some of its rural character, especially economically. The city holds an annual fair dedicated to preserved fruits and vegetables during Holy Week, featuring home-made preserves of fruits and vegetables. Foods of this type have been made in this area since the beginning of the 20th century. The city is also host to the largest furniture exposition in Michoacán, the Expo Mueble and the Expo Feria de Todos los Santos is related to Day of the Dead and All Saints Day. Its principal monument is a 16th-century church with a former monastery. It conserves its atrium and original monolithic atrium cross sculpted by indigenous hands. This cross rests on a pyramidical base with a skull and bones. It also contains the coat of arms of the Franciscan order. The pyramidical base and skulls display an indigenous influence, as does the obsidian mirror located on the cross itself which was the symbol of the god Tezcatlipoca (god with the sacrificed foot) who was worshiped by both the Aztecs and the Purépecha. The church contains two notable baptismal fonts. The larger one may have been the basin of a pre-Hispanic public fountain from the 16th century. It is decorated with small angels and stylized lions. There are also letters on the rim of the font, but they do not spell out words. Tradition says they were used to teach literacy. The smaller font is monolithic and contains the image of a small nude angel in Renaissance style but with some medieval aspects. One other important church is the Nuestra Señora del Perpetuo Socorro (Our Lady of Perpetual Succour). It is located just outside the urban center. The work was inaugurated in 1977 and takes on a red color from the brick used in its construction. It is a modern construction with geometric lines. The Casa de la Cultura (Cultural Center) of the city offers classes in dance, flower arranging, painting, textiles, computers, music and more for adults and children. The municipality Municipal Palace of Hidalgo As municipal seat, Ciudad Hidalgo is the local government for over 500 other communities in the area, which together make up a territory of 1,063.06km2. Over half of the municipal population of 110,311 (2005) lives in the city proper. The main settlement is Ciudad Hidalgo which is the center for forestry and commerce. Agostitlán, El Caracol Puente de Tierra, San Antonio Villalongin and Huajúmbaro which are all dedicated to forestry. San Matías is dedicated to agriculture and crafts, and San Bartolo Cuitareo and Jose Maria Morelos is dedicated to agriculture and forestry. As of 2005, the municipality had 155 people who spoke an indigenous language. Most indigenous are Otomi who mostly live in San Matías and San Bartolo Cuitareo. It is located in the far east of the state, 104 km from the state capital of Morelia. It borders the municipalities of Queréndaro, Zinapécuaro, Maravatío, Irimbo, Tuxpan, Jungapeo, Tuzantla, Tequicheo, Tzitzio, Indaparapeo and Charo . The city is located in a relatively flat valley surrounded by mountains. These mountains are populated with pines, oyamels, holm oak and other kinds of trees. The climate ranges from a semi moist and temperate to semi moist and semi cold with rains in the summer. Average temperature ranges from 8 to 20C and between 1000 and 1500mm per year. The municipality is part of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, with the Sierra de Mil Cumbres. Principle peaks include Del Fraile, Azul, San Andres, Ventero, Guangoche and Blanco. Rivers include Agostitlan, Chaparro, Zarco and Grande with dams called Sabaneta, Pucuato and Mata de Pinos. Fauna include coyote, foxes, skunks, opossum, hares, rabbits, raccoons, armadillos, ducks and other fowl. The Cerro San Andres is home to one of the colonies of monarch butterflies although it is not part of the Biosphere Reserve. Just outside the city proper there are caves called the Grutas de Tziranda ( means paper in Purépecha). These caves run for about 300 meters with thousands of formations in calcite, coral, calcium carbonate and plant fossils. Within the caves, about twenty species of bats reproduce. The caverns are illuminated and have speakers within playing music for visitors. The Los Azufres Park is known for its thermal waters heated by an inactive volcano. The site extends over 1319,15km2 with an altitude that varies between 2950 and 3200masl, near San Pedro Jácuaro. The springs have been attributed with medical powers since the pre Hispanic period. A number of spas have been established in the area such as Laguna Larga, San Alejo, Doña Celia, Campamento Turístical Los Azufres, Tejamaniles, and Eréndira. The tranquil waters of Laguna Larga reflect the green of the trees around them. Laguna Verde is colored by the sulfur it contains. In a number of places there are craters where mud boils. In Laguna Los Azufres the water is very hot and contains a large quantity of dissolved minerals including sulfur. There are also geysers and fresh water springs. It is not a national park but Semarnat has a project to declare it a protected area. Problems with the area include deforestation and trash. The geothermic energy of the area is used to generate electricity. There are various hotels, spas and other businesses which offer activities such as camping, cycling, rowing, swimming and hiking. Forestry and wood products are an important part of the economy for both the city and the rest of the municipality. However, deforestation has become a problem. According to municipal president Jose Luis Avila Franco, the development of tourism is important for the entity to take advantage of as is its natural resources as to lead it away from an overdependence on forestry. However, tourism only accounts for three percent of the economy currently. Industry accounts for about thirty percent of the economy and include the production of processed foods, metals, furniture and textiles. About twenty percent of the economy is based on agriculture and livestock. Crops include corn, wheat, tomatoes, fava beans, garlic, peaches, apples, quinces, capulins, maguey for pulque, avocado, apricots and sapotes. Livestock includes domestic fowl, cows, pigs, goats, horses, donkeys, mules, and bees. There are deposits of non- metallic minerals such as lime, clay, kaolin, sulfur and others. Most of the rest is accounted for by commerce. Ninety percent of commercial establishments are small and family owned. However, in 2009 and 2010, the poor economy forced the closing of dozens of small businesses in the city center alone. History The original name of the settlement and the area was Taximaroa. The origin of this name is unclear. Some sources claim some variation of this had been the name since Toltec times, but this form is from the Purépecha language. The meaning is similarly unclear. It may mean “altar of the god’s put on the road” in reference to a place where the Purépecha defeated the Aztecs. Another source says it means “place of carpenters,” but the Aztec name for the place Tlaximaloyan, means this and was probably given due to is similarity with the Purépecha name. Another source states that the name means “place of traitors.” This etymology stems from Conquest. Cristobal de Olid was on his way west to Tzintzuntzan when an Purépecha army was heading east to intercept him. Olid, along with a number of Purépecha from this area, tricked the army into an ambush and captured them. After the Conquest, the name changed to San José Taximaroa. Near the end of the 18th century, a hacienda was acquired here by Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla. This later prompted the name of the municipality to change to Villa Hidalgo Taximaroa in 1908, and then again to Ciudad Hidalgo in 1922. The first people to concentrate in this area were the Otomi, who arrived between 2,000 and 1,500 years B.C.E. They called the area “Ouesehuarape” or “place where they cut wood.” In 1401, the Purépecha conquered the area, making it the province closest to the Aztec Empire. In 1479, Axayacatl with 24,000 warriors attacked Taximaroa and burned the city. They were later expelled by the Purépecha and the town was refounded. The Aztecs attacked again under Moctezuma II in 1495 but were defeated. A ceremonial center was then erected by the Purépecha to mark the defeat of the Aztecs. In 1522, the Spanish under Cristóbal de Olid arrived here entering Purépecha lands. Olid took possession of the native settlement and had the first Mass celebrated in Purépecha territory here. Before the arrival of Nuño de Guzmán in 1529, the locals decided to abandon the settlement of Taximaroa. The Franciscans arrived to the area in 1531 to evangelize the natives and reestablished the settlement, giving it the Spanish layout it has today. In 1535, the settlement and the lands around it were granted to Gonzalo de Salazar as the Taximaroa encomienda by Hernán Cortés when he visited the area. Cortés also had a hospital built for the natives. In 1591, it became a semi- autonomous “Indian Republic” and seat for the region. Later that decade, the parish of San José was founded and the church/monastery complex begun. After Independence, in 1831, the area became the municipality of Taximaroa. The French under Coronel Clinchant attacked the town in 1864 and later the same year a group of Conservatives were shot in the church atrium. During the Mexican Revolution, federal troops attacked the town, and in 1913, rebel general Alfredo Elizondo passed through. In 1914, a battle called the Sabaeta Action (La Acción de Sabaneta) took place in which troops under Venustiano Carranza triumphed. After the Revolution, the settlement gained city status, changing its name to Ciudad Hidalgo. In 1928 and 1929, confrontations related to the Cristero War took place. Like much of the rest of the state of Michoacán, problems related to drug trafficking have stood out in the city's recent history. In 2010, the mayor of the city Jose Luis Avila Franco was arrested by federal authorities, along with a number of other mayors in the state with suspected ties to drug traffickers but later a court ruled the evidence insufficient. In the same year, the chief of municipal police was murdered along with a deputy with a note left behind indicating it was the work of drug traffickers.

(Old Turkic: , chinese: , Pinyin: xiélì kěhàn, Wade- Giles: hsieh-li k'o-han, Personal name: 阿史那咄苾, āshǐnà duōbì, a-shih-na to-pi), later Tang posthumous title Prince Huang of Guiyi (歸義荒王/归义荒王), was the last qaghan of the Eastern Turkic Khaganate.  Background  He was a son of Yami Qaghan and his Tuyuhun wife Poshi (婆施). He was raised by Tuyuhun general Külüg Tarkhan (胡祿達官).New Book of Tang, vol 215 After coming of age, he was given title Baghatur shad (莫賀咄設) and was assigned to rule eastern parts of empire.  Reign  He declared himself Illig Khagan after death of his older brother Chuluo and marrying his widow as well. He created his nephew Ashina Shibobi as Tolis Qaghan afterwards, assigning him his own former tribes. He continued his predecessors' pro-Sui politics, supporting puppet emperors.  Raids into Tang  His first contacts with Tang were very hostile. In 621, Tujue forces attacked Fenyin and Xi territories, reaching as south as Yanmen in April. As a response, Turkic ambassadors were arrested in China and vice versa. In May, khagan's forces crushed Tang forces commanded by Li Shuliang (李叔良), Gaozu's cousin who died from arrow wounds after a month. They were repelled later by Yang Shidao. Later raids were accompanied by Gao Kaidao and Yuan Junzhang (苑君璋), a general formerly under Liu Wuzhou. To stop raids, Gaozu offered khagan a tribute and a Chinese princess. Khagan accepted the proposal and both states released arrested envoys. Soon raids restarted, in 623, khagan were assisted by Gao Kaidao and Liu Heita in sieging Mayi (present-day Shuozhou, Shanxi) and capturing it. Yuan Junzhang was appointed governor of Mayi. But Mayi was soon reverted by Tujue in hopes of attaining a marriage to Tang princess. Later Liang Luoren (梁洛仁), the brother of Liang Shidu attacked with assistance from Eastern Tujue to Ling prefecture. However Li Daozong (a cousin of Taizong) was able to repel him, and further expel the khagan's nephew Ashina Yushe (阿史那郁射) from the Wuyuan (五原, in modern Yulin, Shaanxi). As raids were becoming more frequent in 624, Li Shimin stepped up to accuse Ashina Shibobi of breaking his brotherhood vows, which made Illig Khagan to grow suspect towards Shibobi. Khagan soon attempted to seek peace, sending his nephew Ashina Shibobi and his uncle Ashina Simo to negotiate. In 625, khagan attacked Ling Prefecture (靈州, roughly modern Yinchuan, Ningxia). Emperor Gaozu sent the general Zhang Jin (張瑾) to resist Tujue with Wen Yanbo serving as Zhang's secretary general. When Zhang engaged khagan, however, he suffered a major defeat, and Wen was captured. As Wen was an important official, khagan put him under interrogation and asked him about the strengths and weaknesses of the Tang state. Wen refused to answer and khagan moved him to the Yin Mountains region. In 626, just 19 days after Emperor Taizong took the throne, Shibobi and Illig were just across the Wei River from Chang'an. Emperor Taizong, accompanied by Gao Shilian and Fang Xuanling, was forced to meet Tujue across the river and personally negotiate peace terms, including tributes to Eastern Turks, before Illig withdrew.  Civil war  In 627 he attempted to levy horses from the vassal Tiele tribes after all his livestock died from a snowstorm. The Tiele revolted under a Xueyantuo coalition. Emperor Taizong of Tang wasted no time in allying with these Tiele and the Khitans in a joint attack. Illig was already facing internal dissent from the Göktürk generals jealous of the influence of Illig's Sogdian vizers. As response, khagan gave 100,000 cavalry to the command of Yukuk Shad to suppress revolts. However shad was defeated by Huige forces commanded by Pusa (菩薩) near Malie (near modern Gansu). Later, more generals of Tujue were defeated by the Xueyantuo. In 628 Kumo Xi tribes also rose in rebellion against Tujue. Eastern governor Ashina Shibobi was unsuccessful in defeating rebels, which made khagan angry and ordered him to be flogged and imprisoned for 10 days. Taizong used this opportunity to invite him to flee to Tang.  End of reign  371x371px In summer 628, when a number of Khitan tribes surrendered to Tang, Illig offered to trade Liang Shidu for the Khitan tribes, but Emperor Taizong refused stating Liang was already on verge of surrendering himself and Khitan were no Turk. Meanwhile Emperor Taizong sent his brother-in-law Chai Shao (柴紹) and the generals Xue Wanjun (薛萬均), Liu Lancheng (劉蘭成), and Liu Min (Liang's former subordinate) to pressure Shuofang. They soon defeated Eastern Tujue forces and put Shuofang under siege, and Eastern Tujue forces were unable to lift the siege. When the food supplies ran out, Liang Shidu's cousin Liang Luoren assassinated Liang Shidu and surrendered the city to Tang Around the new year 630, with Eastern Tujue in internal turmoil, khagan attacked Ashina Shibobi (阿史那什鉢苾). As a reaction Emperor Taizong commissioned Li Jing, Li Shiji, Wei Xiaojie, Li Daozong, Chai Shao (柴紹), and Xue Wanche (薛萬徹) to attack Eastern Tujue, with Li Jing in overall command. Li launched his attack in a surprise manner, from Mayi through Wuyang Range (惡陽嶺, in modern southern Hohhot, Inner Mongolia), capturing the important city of Dingxiang (定襄, in modern Hohhot). In fear, khagan retreated to Qikou (磧口, in modern Xilin Gol League, Inner Mongolia). Li Jing then sent secret messengers to persuade his associate to surrender. One of them, Kangsumi (康蘇密), took Emperor Yang's wife Empress Xiao and their grandson Yang Zhengdao (楊政道), whom Chuluo khagan had created the Prince of Sui, and surrendered to Li Jing. Khagan sent messengers to Emperor Taizong, offering to submit and to pay homage to him later, but was still considering fleeing further with his forces. Emperor Taizong sent the official Tang Jian (唐儉) as an envoy to khagan, but also ordered Li Jing to escort khagan. Li Jing, reading between the lines and believing that Emperor Taizong's order was to attack khagan, after joining forces with Li Shiji, launched the attack. They defeated and captured most of khagan's remaining forces and killed his wife, Sui's Princess Yicheng. Khagan fled further, and was soon captured by his own men Ashina Sunishi (阿史那蘇尼失) and Ashina Nishu (阿史那泥孰) who handed him over to Li Daozong and Zhang Baoxiang (張寶相). He was brought back to Chang'an to face Taizong on 29 March, 630. After listing his crimes against the Tang, Taizong spared the former Qaghan.  Later years  In his later years, former qaghan grew ill in morale. He was created a commander and appointed to be a governor of Guó Prefecture which was rich with deers 632 by Taizong, but he declined. He died in 634 and was created Prince of Guiyi (歸義王) and named Huang (荒) by Taizong posthumously. His teacher Kulug Tarkhan also reported to take his own life upon sadness. Cen Wenben was ordered to write memorial stone. His tomb is still not found.  Family  He was married to Princess Yicheng of Sui (義成公主) and a number of wives. He had at least five issues: * Ashina Dieluozhi (阿史那疊羅支) - he was captured by alongside his mother Li Jing in 630. Taizong reportedly told about him \\"filial respect for mother and father is same for every person be it Chinese or non-Chinese\\". He died single. * Ashina Yukuk (阿史那欲谷) - he was ruling prince of Tiele tribes before 627, he would later go on to be khagan of Western Wing. * Ashina Poluomen (阿史那婆羅門) - lived between 610-651. He was a general in Tang army. His tomb was found in October 2005, near Xi'an. * Ashina Tegin (阿史那特勤) \\\\- yabgu of Eastern Tujue. ** Ashina Jian (阿史那暕, 629-671) - a Tang general, Commandant of the Left Guard. *** Ashina Gande (阿史那感徳) - a Prince of Guiyi (歸義王), lived between 664-691.

An alternant determinant is the determinant of a square alternant matrix. Generally, if f_1, f_2, \\\\dots f_n are functions from a set X to a field F, and {\\\\alpha_1, \\\\alpha_2, ... \\\\alpha_m} \\\\in X, then the alternant matrix has size m \\\\times n and is defined by :M=\\\\begin{bmatrix} f_1(\\\\alpha_1) & f_2(\\\\alpha_1) & \\\\dots & f_n(\\\\alpha_1)\\\\ f_1(\\\\alpha_2) & f_2(\\\\alpha_2) & \\\\dots & f_n(\\\\alpha_2)\\\\ f_1(\\\\alpha_3) & f_2(\\\\alpha_3) & \\\\dots & f_n(\\\\alpha_3)\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots &\\\\vdots \\\\ f_1(\\\\alpha_m) & f_2(\\\\alpha_m) & \\\\dots & f_n(\\\\alpha_m)\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} or, more compactly, M_{ij} = f_j(\\\\alpha_i). (Some authors use the transpose of the above matrix.) Examples of alternant matrices include Vandermonde matrices, for which f_j(\\\\alpha)=\\\\alpha^{j-1}, and Moore matrices, for which f_j(\\\\alpha)=\\\\alpha^{q^{j-1}}. Properties * The alternant can be used to check the linear independence of the functions f_1, f_2, \\\\dots f_n in function space. For example, let f_1(x) = \\\\sin(x), f_2(x) = \\\\cos(x) and choose \\\\alpha_1 = 0, \\\\alpha_2 = \\\\pi/2. Then the alternant is the matrix \\\\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} and the alternant determinant is -1 eq 0. Therefore M is invertible and the vectors {\\\\sin(x), \\\\cos(x)} form a basis for their spanning set: in particular, \\\\sin(x) and \\\\cos(x) are linearly independent. * Linear dependence of the columns of an alternant does not imply that the functions are linearly dependent in function space. For example, let f_1(x) = \\\\sin(x), f_2(x) = \\\\cos(x) and choose \\\\alpha_1 = 0, \\\\alpha_2 = \\\\pi. Then the alternant is \\\\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\\\end{bmatrix} and the alternant determinant is 0, but we have already seen that \\\\sin(x) and \\\\cos(x) are linearly independent. * Despite this, the alternant can be used to find a linear dependence if it is already known that one exists. For example, we know from the theory of partial fractions that there are real numbers A and B for which \\\\frac{A}{x+1} + \\\\frac{B}{x+2} = \\\\frac{1}{(x+1)(x+2)}. Choosing f_1(x) = \\\\frac{1}{x+1}, f_2(x) = \\\\frac{1}{x+2}, f_3 = \\\\frac{1}{(x+1)(x+2)} and (\\\\alpha_1,\\\\alpha_2,\\\\alpha_3) = (1,2,3), we obtain the alternant \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1/2 & 1/3 & 1/6 \\\\ 1/3 & 1/4 & 1/12 \\\\ 1/4 & 1/5 & 1/20 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\sim \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix}. Therefore (1,-1,-1) is in the nullspace of the matrix: that is, f_1 - f_2 - f_3 = 0. Moving f_3 to the other side of the equation gives the partial fraction decomposition A = 1, B = -1. * If n = m and \\\\alpha_i = \\\\alpha_j for any i eq j, then the alternant determinant is zero (as a row is repeated). * If n = m and the functions f_j(x) are all polynomials, then (\\\\alpha_j - \\\\alpha_i) divides the alternant determinant for all 1 \\\\leq i < j \\\\leq n.

It is the equivalent of the human knee and is often the largest synovial joint in the animal's body. The stifle joint joins three bones: the femur, patella, and tibia. The joint consists of three smaller ones: the femoropatellar joint, medial femorotibial joint, and lateral femorotibial joint. The stifle joint consists of the femorotibial articulation (femoral and tibial condyles), femoropatellar articulation (femoral trochlea and the patella), and the proximal tibiofibular articulation. The joint is stabilized by paired collateral ligaments which act to prevent abduction/adduction at the joint, as well as paired cruciate ligaments. The cranial cruciate ligament and the caudal cruciate ligament restrict cranial and caudal translation (respectively) of the tibia on the femur. The cranial cruciate also resists over-extension and inward rotation, and is the most commonly damaged stifle ligament in dogs. 'Cushioning' of the joint is provided by two C-shaped pieces of cartilage called menisci which sit between the medial and lateral condyles of the distal femur and the tibial plateau. The main biomechanical function of the menisci is probably to divide the joint into two functional units—the 'femoromeniscal joint' for flexion/extension movements and the 'meniscotibial joint' for rotation—a function analogous to that of the disc dividing the temporomandibular (jaw) joint. The menisci also contain nerve endings which are used to assist in proprioeception. The menisci are attached via a variety of ligaments: two meniscotibial ligaments for each meniscus, the meniscofemoral from the lateral meniscus to the femur, the meniscocollateral from the medial meniscus to the medial collateral ligament, and the transverse ligament (or intermeniscal) which runs between the two menisci. There are between one and four sesamoid bones associated with the stifle joint in different species. These sesamoids assist with the smooth movement of tendon/muscle over the joint. The most well-known sesamoid bone is the patella, more commonly known as the 'knee cap'. It is located cranially to the joint and sits in the trochlear groove of the femur. It guides the patellar ligament of the quadriceps over the knee joint to its point of insertion on the tibia. Caudal to the joint, in the dog for example, are the two fabellae, which lie in the two tendons of origin of gastrocnemius. Fourth, there is often a small sesamoid bone in the tendon of origin of popliteus in many species. Humans possess only the patella. In the horse and ox, the distal part of the tendon of insertion of quadriceps ('below' the patella) is divided into three parts. An elaborate twisting movement of the patella allows the stifle to 'lock' in extension when the medial portion of the tendon is 'hooked' over the bulbous medial trochlear ridge of the distal femur. This locking mechanism enables these animals to sleep while standing up.

Most of the descriptions of Parvata kingdom in the epic refer to a mountainous country in the Himalayas. Tribes belonging to other mountainous regions in the north west, west and the east of the Indo-Gangetic Plain were also known as Parvatas, when used as a collective name. Parvatas took part in the Kurukshetra War. The epic also mentions a sage named Parvata who was a companion of sage Narada.  References in Mahabharata = Conquests of Vasudeva Krishna  Parvatas were mentioned in the list of tribes conquered by Krishna:- The Avantis, the Southerners, the Parvatas, the Daserakas, the Kasmirakas, the Aurasikas, the Pisachas, the Samudgalas, the Kamvojas, the Vatadhanas, the Cholas, the Pandyas, the Trigartas, the Malavas, the Daradas difficult of being vanquished, the Khasas arrived from diverse realms, as also the Sakas, and the Yavanas with followers, were all vanquished by Vasudeva Krishna (7:11)  In Kurukshtra War  Parvatas took part in the Kurukshetra War siding with Kauravas. In the back of the Garuda military formation made by Drona were the Kalingas, the Amvashthas, the Magadhas, the Paundras, the Madrakas, the Gandharas, the Sakunas, the Easterners, the Parvatas, and the Vasatis (7:20) Arjuna dispatched, the Yaudheyas, the Parvatas, the Madrakas, and the Malavas to the regions of the dead (7:158). The Tusharas, the Yavanas, the Khasas, the Darvabhisaras, the Daradas, the Sakas, the Kamathas, the Ramathas, the Tanganas the Andhrakas, the Pulindas, the Kiratas of fierce prowess, the Mlecchas, the Parvatas, and the races hailing from the sea-side, these all are united with the Kurus and fighting wrathfully for Duryodhana’s sake (8:73). All the Samsaptakas, the Kambojas together with the Sakas, the Mlecchas, the Parvatas, and the Yavanas, have been slain. (9:1)  Tribes mentioned by Karna  Parvatas were mentioned in the conversation of Karna and Shalya. This conversation mentions about various cultures of ancient India, with a bias towards the Vedic culture prevailed in Kuru-Panchalas The Magadhas are comprehenders of signs; the Koshalas comprehend from what they see; the Kurus and the Pancalas comprehend from a half-uttered speech; the Salwas cannot comprehend till the whole speech is uttered. The Parvatas, like the Sivis, are very stupid. The Yavanas are omniscient; the Suras are particularly so. The mlecchas are wedded to the creations of their own fancy other peoples cannot understand. The Vahikas resent beneficial counsels. The Madrakas are regarded on Earth as the dirt of every nation. (8:45)  Sage named Parvata  There was a sage named Parvata who was the companion of sage Narada, mentioned in Mahabharata and the Puranas. Both Parvata and Narada were travellers, during pre historic ages. They visited Kingdoms of Ancient India as well as other kingdoms beyond the Himalayas in Central Asia, China and West Asia. The name Parvata (meaning mountain in Sanskrit), was given to the traveller, probably because, the Vedic people saw them coming to them, after crossing the Himalaya mountains. The wife of Lord Siva, was named Parvati. The name suggests that she belonged to the tribe of Parvatas.

Life and career Hogg was born near Westconnie, Texas, and grew up on a farm. He was taught to play the guitar by his father, Frank Hogg. While still in his teens he teamed up with the slide guitarist and vocalist B. K. Turner, also known as Black Ace, and the pair travelled together, playing a circuit of turpentine and logging camps, country dance halls and juke joints around Kilgore, Tyler, Greenville and Palestine, in East Texas. In 1937, Decca Records brought Hogg and Black Ace to Chicago to record. Hogg's first record, \\"Family Trouble Blues\\" backed with \\"Kind Hearted Blues\\", was released under the name of Andrew Hogg. It was an isolated occurrence — he did not make it back into a recording studio for over a decade. By the early 1940s, Hogg was married and making a good living busking around the Deep Ellum area of Dallas, Texas. Hogg was drafted in the mid-1940s. After a brief spell with the U.S. military, he continued working in the Dallas area, where he was becoming well known. In 1947 he came to the attention of Herbert T. Rippa Sr., the head of the Dallas-based record label Bluebonnet Records, who recorded several sides with him and leased the masters to Modern Records. The first release on Modern was the Big Bill Broonzy song \\"Too Many Drivers\\". It sold well enough that Modern brought Hogg to Los Angeles to cut more sides with their team of studio musicians. These songs included his two biggest hits, \\"Long Tall Mama\\" in 1949 and another Broonzy tune, \\"Little School Girl.\\" In January 1950, \\"Little School Girl\\" reached number 5 on the Billboard Retail R&B; chart and number 9 on the Most Played Juke Box R&B; chart. His two-part \\"Penitentiary Blues\\" (1952) was a remake of the prison song \\"Ain't No More Cane on the Brazos\\". Hogg's style, influenced by Broonzy, Peetie Wheatstraw and Black Ace, was popular with record buyers in the South during the late 1940s and early 1950s. He continued to work and record until the end of the 1950s. He died in McKinney, Texas in 1960, at the age of 46. The cause of his death was seemingly not made public. Relatives and others Hogg was reputed to be a cousin of Lightnin' Hopkins and to be distantly related to Alger \\"Texas\\" Alexander, but both claims are ambiguous. Hogg's cousin John Hogg was also a blues musician; he recorded for Mercury Records in 1951. He is not to be confused with Willie \\"Smokey\\" Hogg, a musician based in New York City in the 1960s.

Hub is an industrial city and its original name was Hub Chowki because once there was a police and customs check post (which is known as chowki in Urdu), named Nakahi. After the development of factories and many other industries, the town was renamed to Hub. Hub is one of the largest industrial centres of Balochistan, and because of its proximity to Karachi, it is becoming a Commuter town of the Karachi metropolitan area.

Demographics The majority of the population is Muslim, while there is small Hindu and Christian minorities. Increased commercialization in this area has led to many social, political and hygienic problems. The worsening state of roads and streets in the area has made everyday life difficult. Roads are too busy as the area serves as a hub between Balochistan and Karachi, that is one of the main reasons behind the lack of development in this area. Presence of political parties usually lead to deteriorating law and order situations, affecting the life and commerce in many ways and eventually leading to the decline of national economy.

The important dances of the Tripuris are: * Goria Dance * Huk kaimani Dance * Lebang bumani Dance * Hojagiri Dance * Ua Bamboo dance Goria Dance The life and culture of Tripuris revolve around Jhum (slash and burn) cultivation. When the sowing of seeds at a plot of land selected for Jhum is over by middle of April, they pray to the God 'Goria' for a happy harvest. The celebrations attached to the Goria Puja continue for seven days when they seek to entertain their beloved deity with song and dance. Lebang Bumani Dance After the Goria festival is over, the Tripuris have a time to rest awaiting the monsoon. During this period, folks of charming colorful insects called 'Lebang' use to visit hill slopes in search of seeds sewn on it. The annual visit of the insects renders the tribal youths to indulge in merry-making. While the men-folk make a peculiar rhythmic sound with the help of two bamboo chips in their hand, the women folk run tottering the hill slopes to catch hold of these insects called Lebang. The rhythm of the sound made by the bamboo chips attracts the insects from their hiding places and the women in-groups catch them. With the change of time jhuming on hill slopes are gradually diminishing. But the cultural life that developed centering round the jhum delved deep into the society. It still exists in the state's hills and dales as a reminiscence of the life, which the tribal of today cherish in memory, and preserve as treasure. In both the dances Tripuris use the musical instruments like Kham (the Kokborok word for drum) made of bamboo, Sumui (flute), Sarinda, Lebang made of bamboo and bamboo cymbal.

Their language, Burushaski, has been classified as a language isolate. Although their origins are unknown, it is likely that the Burusho people \\"were indigenous to northwestern India (current day Pakistan) and were pushed into their present homeland by the movements of the Indo- Aryans who migrated to the subcontinent in 1800 B.C.  History  Prior to the modern era, the area in which most Burusho now live was part of the independent state of Chitral. The state was a hereditary monarchy, controlled by the Karur dynasty, and headed by a mir (a title usually translated as king). In 1947, it became part of Pakistan. The construction of the Karakoram Highway during the 1970s brought more extensive contact with the outside world. Many traders, preachers, tourists, and others had new access to the Burusho's homeland, and this subsequently altered the culture and local economy of the area. The Burusho are known for their love of music and dance, along with their progressive views towards education and women. Hunza Flag of Hunza. Coat of arms of Hunza A widely repeated claim of remarkable longevity of the Hunza people has been refuted as a longevity myth, citing a life expectancy of 53 years for men and 52 for women, although with a high standard deviation. There is no evidence that Hunza life expectancy is significantly above the average of poor, isolated regions of Pakistan. Claims of health and long life were almost always based solely on the statements by the local mir (king). An author who had significant and sustained contact with Burusho people, John Clark, reported that they were overall unhealthy. Clark and Lorimer reported frequent violence and starvation in Hunza. Upper Hunza, locally called Gojal, is inhabited by people whose ancestors moved up from proper Hunza to irrigate and defend the borders with China and Afghanistan. They speak a dialect called Wakhi, which is influenced by Burushahski and Pamiri languages due to the closeness and contact with these mountain communities. The Shina-speaking people live in the southern Hunza. They have come from Chilas, Gilgit, and other Shina-speaking areas of Pakistan. Jammu and Kashmir A group of 350 Burusho people also reside in the Indian union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, being mainly concentrated in Batamalu, as well as in Botraj Mohalla, which is southeast of Hari Parbat. This Burusho community is descended from two former princes of the British Indian princely states of Hunza and Nagar, who with their families, migrated to this region in the 19th century A.D. They are known as the Botraj by other ethnic groups in the state, and practice Shiite Islam. Arranged marriages are customary. Since the partition of India in 1947, the Indian Burusho community have not been in contact with the Pakistani Burusho. The Government of India has granted the Burusho community Scheduled Tribe status, as well as reservation, and therefore, \\"most members of the community are in government jobs.\\" The Burusho people of India speak Burushashki, also known as Khajuna, and their dialect, known as Jammu & Kashmir Burushashski (JKB), \\"has undergone several changes which make it systematically different from other dialects of Burushaski spoken in Pakistan\\". In addition, many Jammu & Kashmiri Burusho are multilingual, also speaking Kashmiri and Hindustani, as well as Balti and Shina to a lesser extent. Genetics A variety of Y-DNA haplogroups are seen among certain random samples of people in Hunza. Most frequent among these are R1a1 and R2a, which are associated with Indo-European peoples and the Bronze Age migration into South Asia c. 3000 BC, and probably originated in either South Asia, Central AsiaR. Spencer Wells et al., \\"The Eurasian Heartland: A continental perspective on Y-chromosome diversity,\\" Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (28 August 2001). or Iran and Caucasus. R2a, unlike its extremely rare parent R2, R1a1 and other clades of haplogroup R, is now virtually restricted to South Asia. Two other typically South Asian lineages, haplogroup H1 and haplogroup L3 (defined by SNP mutation M20) have also been observed from few samples. Other Y-DNA haplogroups reaching considerable frequencies among the Burusho are haplogroup J2, associated with the spread of agriculture in, and from, the neolithic Near East, and haplogroup C3, of Siberian origin and possibly representing the patrilineage of Genghis Khan. Present at lower frequency are haplogroups O3, an East Eurasian lineage, and Q, P, F, and G. DNA research groups the male ancestry of some of the Hunza inhabitants with speakers of Pamir languages and other mountain communities of various ethnicites, due primarily to the M124 marker (defining Y-DNA haplogroup R2a), which is present at high frequency in these populations.R. Spencer Wells et al., The Eurasian Heartland: A continental perspective on Y-chromosome diversity , Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America However, they have also an East Asian genetic contribution, suggesting that at least some of their ancestry originates north of the Himalayas.

I. Rodale wrote a book called The Healthy Hunzas in 1948 that asserted that the Hunzas, noted for their longevity and many centenarians, were long-lived because they consumed healthy organic foods, such as dried apricots and almonds, and had plenty of fresh air and exercise.Rodale, J. I. The Healthy Hunzas 1948. Emmaus PA: Rodale Press. He often mentioned them in his Prevention magazine as exemplary of the benefits of leading a healthy lifestyle. Dr. John Clark stayed among the Hunza people for 20 months and in his 1956 book Hunza - Lost Kingdom of the Himalayas writes: \\"I wish also to express my regrets to those travelers whose impressions have been contradicted by my experience. On my first trip through Hunza, I acquired almost all the misconceptions they did: The Healthy Hunzas, the Democratic Court, The Land Where There Are No Poor, and the rest—and only long-continued living in Hunza revealed the actual situations\\". Regarding the misconception about Hunza people's health, Clark also writes that most of his patients had malaria, dysentery, worms, trachoma, and other health conditions easily diagnosed and quickly treated. In his first two trips he treated 5,684 patients. The October 1953 issue of National Geographic had an article on the Hunza River Valley that inspired Carl Barks' story Tralla La.The Carl Barks Library Volume 12, page 229 A U.S. yoga instructor named Renée Taylor wrote several books in the 1960s, treating the Hunza as a long-lived and peaceful people.

She lived and wrote in French in Paris until shortly after World War II, when she came to New York in 1949 to work as a multilingual proofreader for the newly formed United Nations. Just a few years later, having realized that she would stay in the United States, she made the decision to systematically retrain herself not only to write, but to dream, think, and speak, in the language of her new soil. In the latter part of her life, she developed a method for teaching creative writing that relied wholly upon the oral and taught creative writing at several universities and in her home until her death in 2000. Ideals Molinaro's texts attempt to fulfill a Nietzschian ideal. They hinge on the belief that there is a human supra-psychology that transcends nationality, gender, psychosexual archetypes, and individual linguistic heritages. Using a vast battery of unusual and privileged literary tools, she hoped to arrive at a new set of universals by the stringent crafting of razor-sharp narratives, which come to merciless, acerbic conclusions about culture and go so far as to radically reinterpret Greek myth. Career Molinaro was a linguist and a world traveler and a woman who participated in the artistic milieus of late Modernist Paris, Abstract Expressionist and then Off-Off Broadway New York, London, Rome, Lisbon, and provincial America. She was fluent in English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Greek. Her English was slightly and delightfully accented, while German and French were her native tongues. In 1958, she was co-founder and fiction editor of Chelsea magazine. Style and themes Like Vladimir Nabokov, Molinaro was a fully realized transplanted writer. She wrote mostly about the immediate experiences and situations of her characters, who would resort to memory only as a repository of regrets and mistakes or as a grim tale of something that had to be escaped. Molinaro's novels often portrayed women with a disregard for the exigencies of their social situation: In The Autobiography of Cassandra, Priestess and Prophetess of Troy, her most blatantly feminist novel, the prophetess relates her own doom and oppression from a privileged psychic level---that of a person who is dead. What Cassandra tells is not only the story of power robbed from women but also the shoddy treatment smug civilizations inflict upon the visionary, who is often an artist. In her novel Fat Skeletons, a translator wary of serving unappreciative publishers attempts to pass her own novel off as a translation. In the Old Moon with the New Moon in Its Arms, a patrician poet of ancient Greece scandalizes her parents by offering herself as a religious sacrifice. It is a self-destructive gesture that rejects birth and family, yet reaches out to a larger kind of social and spiritual truth. Molinaro's greatest theme is the existential ability of the individual to remake herself. In her fiction, her characters fall into two types: insular, fiercely independent people whose entire identity has been self-created by the exercise of will—usually with a flouting disregard for convention or tradition—and people who are comically mired and rooted in their own pasts, a fact that usually makes them laughable, self-righteous clichés. Translations Molinaro translated many texts from French and German. In collaboration with the German expatriate Hedwig Rappolt she translated Christa Wolf's novel Kindheitsmuster (Patterns of Childhood).Discussed in: Graeme Dunphy, \\"Tracking Christa Wolf: Problembewältigung und syntaktische Präzision in der englischen und französischen Übersetzung von Kindheitsmuster\\", in Michael Neecke & Lu Jiang, Unübersetzbar? Zur Kritik der literarischen Übersetzung, Hamburg 2013, 35-60. On several of her translations, she collaborated with her close friend, the writer Bruce Benderson, who now serves as her literary executor. Molinaro also subtitled a number of films including Une femme mariée (Jean-Luc Godard, 1964) and Le Bonheur (Agnès Varda, 1965). Personal beliefs Molinaro's emphasis on the self-created individual set her against family values and procreation. She saw the family as a prison and childhood as a long period of bitter incarceration that provides no basis for true identity but is rather a powerful force that seeks to inhibit it. She believed that such a prison could be escaped by an act of the will, through clear-sightedness, linguistic prowess and the development of deep reflection. Her texts, which often employed unusual spacing between words and lines as a means to create spoken rhythms, could not have been written without her wide experience as a translator and linguist. She believed that truth could be captured in the careful crafting of language and that no human experience was beyond the power of language. Painting Molinaro was also a painter in the style of the Haitian primitives. She was deeply interested in astrology and numerology and wrote two books (The Zodiac Lovers; Life by the Numbers) on these subjects. Books=Fiction *Green Lights Are Blue.

It was created by the Managed Investments Act 1998, which made significant amendments to the prescribed interest provisions contained in the Australian Corporations Act. Overview The new arrangements replaced the relatively well known formula used in most common law jurisdictions of a two-tiered trustee/management company regime with a single responsible entity. The responsible entity holds scheme property on trust for scheme members. The responsible entity has power to appoint an agent to do anything that it is authorised to do in connection with a scheme. This may include the appointment of a custodian to hold scheme property on behalf of the responsible entity. Since November 1999 the Australian takeover scheme regulations were extended to listed schemes and the takeovers provisions and compulsory acquisitions provisions apply. A Responsible Entity has the dual role of trustee and manager of an investment scheme, and must be appointed if an investment scheme needs to be registered. It is possible to have a retail registered managed investment scheme or a wholesale registered managed investment scheme. Ownership The Responsible Entity must be an Australian public company, with certain levels of net tangible assets, depending on the value of the scheme’s assets. The Responsible Entity must hold an Australian Financial Services Licence. When acting on behalf of an investment scheme, the Responsible entity must: * Act honestly * Exercise a reasonable degree of care and diligence * Act in the best interest of members of the investment scheme * Treat all investment scheme members equally A Responsible Entity can either be owned by the same group as the fund manager, i.e. an \\"internal\\" responsible entity, or alternatively be run separate to the fund manager, i.e. an \\"external\\" responsible entity. Where the Responsible Entity is external, the Responsible Entity, on behalf of the investment scheme, typically enters into a management agreement with the fund manager. There are a number of external Responsible Entities that fund managers can engage to provide responsible entity services for a managed investment scheme, called a responsible entity for hire.

The station airs a Top 40 radio format. The programs and most of the music are presented in Spanish, while a number of English-language songs are also heard. The station is currently owned by MVS Radio. History XHTIM-FM came to air in 1990 carrying MVS's Stereorey format, and its early years were filled with major changes. It started broadcasting on 103.3 MHz, the frequency that had been made available on March 16, 1989 in the Diario Oficial de la Federación. However, XHTIM soon picked up interference complaints from KJQY in San Diego, broadcasting just up the FM dial at 103.7.Kevin Brass, \\"KUSC Files Complaint Over Mexican Station\\", Los Angeles Times February 25, 1992 In an attempt to solve its interference to KJQY, XHTIM found a new home at 91.5 MHz, beginning January 27, 1992. This triggered a complaint from another American station, KUSC in Los Angeles, a public radio and classical music outlet. At the time, KUSC had been attempting to move its transmitter to Mount Wilson, a high point near Los Angeles that is home to numerous FM and TV stations. The XHTIM allotment was short-spaced to KUSC by 23 kilometers, and XHTIM was causing interference to the classical music outlet well into the Los Angeles area. KUSC claimed XHTIM was operating illegally and called on the Federal Communications Commission to seek help from its Mexican counterpart, the Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes (SCT). The dispute between KUSC and XHTIM came to an amicable end. In 1993, KUSC was able to turn on its new transmitter.Christine Shade, \\"The New and Improved Sound of Classical Music\\", USC News 5 April 1993 On March 20, XHTIM moved to 91.7 MHz, a change that allowed XHTIM to ramp up power and cleared the interference plaguing KUSC. Later in 1993, XHTIM flipped to grupera music as \\"La Mejor.\\" In 1999 XHTIM adopted the name \\"Galaxy\\" and a classic hits format, as well as the call sign XHGLX-FM. The Galaxy format was short-lived, with MVS changing the station in 2001 to a new format, known as Exa FM. The first broadcast with the new format aired on May 5, with special guest Yahir, a popular Mexican singer-actor. The station was launched by Programming Director Isabel Gonzalez, who exited the company in May 2007.

It broadcasts at a daytime power 5,000 watts, and at nighttime, it broadcasts at 1,000 watts from a transmitter in the city's westside. WAGG is a gospel music station that targets Birmingham's African-American population. It is owned by SummitMedia, which also owns six other stations in the market, and all share studios in the Cahaba neighborhood in far southeast Birmingham. The station was assigned the WAGG call letters by the Federal Communications Commission on January 15, 1999. History of AM 610 Some generations ago, the 610 AM frequency was home to Birmingham’s third oldest radio station. That station began in 1926 as WKBC, broadcasting at 1310 AM. The original owner of the station was a local furniture company. In 1932, the station was sold to The Birmingham News, and the callsign was changed to WSGN. That callsign stood for \\"South’s Greatest Newspaper,\\" an obvious tribute to The Chicago Tribune’s WGN, whose callsign stands for \\"World’s Greatest Newspaper.\\" Throughout the 1940s, WSGN was an affiliate of the NBC Blue Network, the forerunner of the current ABC Network. Late in 1955, WSGN became the first station in Birmingham to adopt a Top 40 format. In the early days it did battle with WYDE-AM 850 and WVOK-AM 690 to lead the pack in the current hits category. Many legendary personalities worked at WSGN over the years. Perhaps the most famous alumnus of WSGN was Rick Dees, who hosted morning drive-time from 1973-1974. The dominance of WSGN was challenged in 1972 when longtime middle of the road station WBRC (the former sister television station has kept the same callsign to this present day) was sold. Its callsign was changed to WERC, and for the first time since 1965, WSGN had a serious Top 40 challenger in the market. For much of the mid-1970s, the battle between “The Big 610, WSGN” and “96-ERC” gave Birmingham and central Alabama listeners two strong choices for Top 40 music. Prior to 1977, Top 40 could be heard on two FM stations: the automated WAPI-FM 94.5 and the daytime simulcasts of WERC on WERC-FM 106.9. In 1977, Birmingham got its first live, freestanding top-40 FM when WKXX (now WBPT) made its debut, replacing the WERC-FM calls. The ratings of WSGN began to decline, and by 1981, the station had moved away from its longtime Top 40 format and began targeting adult listeners. “The Big 610” gave way to “Music 610, The Station That Grew Up with You”, and the format became adult contemporary with a heavy mix of oldies. The debut of a second FM challenger, adult contemporary-formatted WMJJ, in late 1982 signaled the beginning of the end of current hit music on WSGN. In February 1984, the station made a format switch and became known as “Real Music 610”, playing adult standards and big band music. This continued until April 26, 1985, when the owners sold the station and it became the AM simulcast partner of country station WZZK-FM (104.7). After 53 years, the call letters of WSGN were changed to WZZK-AM. This simulcast continued until 1998, when 610 AM returned to big band and adult standards with the new callsign WEZN. WAGG history Originally assigned to 1320 AM, WAGG has been an Urban Gospel station since 1982. Before then, the call letters were WENN-AM. Throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s, WENN was Birmingham's most popular station targeting African-American listeners, although it broadcast only during daylight hours with a relatively weak signal. The growing popularity of its FM sister station led station ownership to adopt the gospel format, which proved to be successful. By the end of the 1980s, WAGG was one of the highest-rated AM stations in Birmingham. In 1998, Cox Radio, who already owned WZZK-FM, WODL-FM (now WBPT) and WEZN, bought WAGG, WBHJ and WBHK. One year later, WEZN and WAGG swapped dial positions in order for WAGG to take advantage of the superior signal on 610 AM. On July 20, 2012, Cox Radio, Inc. announced the sale of WAGG and 22 other stations to Summit Media LLC for $66.25 million. The sale was consummated on May 3, 2013.https://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/59007/cox-puts-clusters- up-for-sale/https://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/80882/cox-sells-stations- in-six-markets-to-two-groups/ On October 3, 2014 WAGG began simulcasting on FM translator W271BN 102.1 FM, after sister station WENN 1320 AM temporarily went silent.102.1 Y'all Goes to Heaven On March 14, 2016 WAGG switched FM translators from W271BN 102.1 FM (which switched to a simulcast of soft adult contemporary-formatted WENN 1320 AM) to W261BX 100.1 FM Birmingham.Easy and WAGG Move in Birmingham as Summit Launches 97.3 Play ReferencesExternal links *WAGG official website  WAGG 610 AM Live * Radio/TV page of Birmingham Rewound AGG Category:Radio stations established in 1926 Category:Gospel radio stations in the United States AGG ","title":"WAGG"},{"id":"4419125","title":"Rambha (actress)"},{"id":"4419141","title":"Legal status of cocaine"},{"id":"4419158","text":"Esther Rochon in 2014 Esther Rochon (née Blackburn) (born 27 June 1948) is a Canadian science fiction writer.

He was born in Kirghizia exile into the Yalkhoi teip (clan) from the Geldagan village in Shalinsky District of the Chechen Republic. Early life He arrived in Moscow in 1974 and matriculated into Moscow State University, Faculty of Law. Along with Said-Khasan Abumuslimov (later Vice-President of Chechnya under Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev) he organized an underground committee for the liberation of Chechnya called Obshina. The committee studied books by Abdurakhman Avtorkhanov, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, and Andrei Sakharov. According to Noukhaev, Abumuslimov was responsible for politics and information while he took care of financial matters and weapons. In 1980 Nukhaev was sentenced to eight years for banditry, which he claimed were actually for political reasons. During this time he acquired the nickname “Khozha” and was considered a boss of the Chechen mafia along with Nikolay Suleimanov. By 1987 Chechen criminals had developed into a well-organized community under Nukhayev and Suleimanov, the group tried to force the most influential Russian Mafia gangs (the Lyubertsy, Solntsevo, and Balashikha) out of Moscow which allowed the Chechens to occupy the dominant position for some time.Aleksandr Zhilin, The Shadow of Chechen Crime Over Moscow, The Jamestown Foundation 1999 Activities during the Second Chechen War Soon after the start of the Second Chechen War, Nukhaev left for Baku, Azerbaijan, and financed the underground Chechen newspapers Ichkeria and Mekh-kell. In 1999 he made a public statement calling for an international commission to bring peace to Chechnya, saying Russia will never gain its objectives by military means because the Chechen people's will for self-determination is such that guerrilla warfare will continue for years. Noukhaev said the first step in the peace process should be establishment of an International Commission headed by such respected world figures as former President Jimmy Carter or former UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to oversee the freeing of illegally detained persons on both sides.John Adams Associates, December 10, 1999 It is believed by some that he also helped finance the militant groups of Ruslan Gelayev and Aslambek Abdulkhadzhiev. In 2001 Nukhaev first proposed the controversial idea (among both his allies and enemies) of splitting Chechnya into a northern Russian half and a southern de facto, but not de jure Ichkerian half. That same year Nukhaev founded the inter-teip movement Nokhchi-Latta-Islam, and politician Aleksandr Dugin was also working with him during this time. Book by Paul Klebnikov Noukhaev was the subject of a book entitled Conversation with a Barbarian: Interviews with a Chechen Field Commander on Banditry and Islam by the late American/Russian journalist Paul Klebnikov. The book is based on interviews with Noukhaev conducted by Klebnikov in Baku, Azerbaijan. In it, Noukhaev discusses his past, including his involvement in criminal activities in Moscow and creating Caucasian Common Market. He also argues for the superiority of the Chechen and Islamic clan/tribal-based social system, while Klebnikov argues for an opposite position. After Klebnikov's murder in Moscow in 2004, it was alleged that Noukhaev had ordered the killing in retaliation for his negative portrayal in this book. Several Chechens were charged with carrying out the killing on Noukhayev's orders but all were subsequently acquitted at trial. Political activities in Russia After April 2001, he became actively involved in work of Eurasia Party led by Russian nationalist Aleksandr Dugin, despite being officially wanted by police.Russian political parties and antisemitism, by SOVA Center, Moscow On June 28, 2001, he appeared on the Dugin party's press conference in Moscow to propose that Chechnya be divided into North Chechnya (the plains region within the frame of the Russian Federation) and South Chechnya (the mountain region largely independent from Russia, but still closely bonded to Russia and fiercely hostile to \\"Wahhabism\\", that is Islamic fundamentalism). Possible death in the mountains of Dagestan Khozh-Akhmed Noukhaev stayed in Azerbaijan for an extended period of time. It is from there that he edited the internet site named after him, Noukhaev.com. Since Spring 2004 no new information has come through from him. According to some sources, Noukhaev secretly arrived in Chechnya in late 2003. He supposedly convinced Ruslan Gelayev to cross Dagestan to Georgia and was with a group of Gelayev's fighters when they were surrounded in the mountains during the winter of 2004. Some of Gelayev's men were killed, some taken captive and on February 28 Gelayev himself was killed. Several sources consider that Noukhaev was killed alongside the fighters, although another version maintains that he was released. In support of the first version is the circumstantial evidence that neither Ichkeria or Mekh- Kell newspapers are being issued. There are no new book-brochures by Noukhaev about Russian-Chechen and international relations, or promoting his opinion on the future of Chechnya. These book-brochures were brought from Azerbaijan and can sometimes still be found in the markets of Grozny and Nazran.Chechen Society Newspaper No. 12, June 2005 See also *Chechen mafia *Russian mafia NotesExternal links *Materials about Nukhaev (Russian), from database anticompromat.ru by Pribylovsky *Interview with Noukhaev — Scene taken from “The Making of a New Empire” by Jos de Putter Category:1954 births Category:People from Chuy Region Category:Chechen mobsters Category:Chechen field commanders Category:Chechen politicians Category:Chechen warlords Category:Missing mobsters Category:Fugitives wanted by Russia Category:People of the Chechen wars Category:Politicians of Ichkeria Category:Possibly living people Category:Chechen businesspeople ","title":"Khozh-Ahmed Noukhayev"},{"id":"4419163","text":"Paramita was a pop rock act in the Philippines that played their own brand of music from 2005 to 2013. Paramita was made up of Marco De Leon on guitars (replacing Norman Dellosa), Alsey Cortez on bass, and Ria Bautista on drums and vocals. Paramita have released three several albums in its career. History In 2005, they released their first single \\"Hiling\\" under Vicor Records which placed them on the map. It was included in the 10-track full- length album entitled Tala. Six of the album's songs are written in English while four are in Tagalog. Their second album was self-titled Paramita which was released in 2008 under Terno Recordings. Despite being such a young band, Paramita has already been featured in several media sources, such as MTV Ink magazine, the Philippine Daily Inquirer, NU 107's In The Raw radio program and the ABS-CBN morning show Breakfast. Paramita is fast becoming one of the most solid independent acts in the scene today, enlightened by music and strengthened by a belief in their own unique talents. By 2010, they decided to go fully independent under Blaster Music (an independent music organization) and launched their third album named Liyab. Their song \\"Turbulence\\" was on NU107.7 Stairway to Seven and was no. 1 for 12 weeks on UR105.9 Underground Radio. Their songs \\"Sulyap\\" and \\"Nightingale\\" received airplay on local stations. Paramita is now with Blaster Music along with Reklamo and upcoming artists Odat, Penguin, Trapeze, and Eleyn.

The earliest kabuki performers in Japan in 1603 were women. An Italian actress was reported as early as 1565–66; see Rennert, Spanish Stage, p. 140. Thomas Coryate, in Coryate's Crudities, noted actresses in Venice in 1611; see Halliday, Shakespeare Companion, p. 22. For amateur precedents, see: Tempe Restored; The Shepherd's Paradise. Hughes was the mistress of the English Civil War general Prince Rupert of the Rhine. Women in Restoration drama Hughes became an actress during a period of great change in English drama. English drama had suffered greatly during the English Civil War and the Interregnum, being banned by the Puritan Long Parliament in 1642.Spencer, p. 314. This ban was finally lifted upon the Restoration of King Charles II. Charles was a keen theatre-goer, and promptly gave two royal patents to Sir Thomas Killigrew and Sir William Davenant. During the Renaissance women had been virtually banned from appearing as actresses on the stage, resulting in male actors in female roles. One incident occurred when a play which the King was watching suddenly stopped. When he sent servants to see what the problem was, it was found that the male who was supposed to play one of the female parts was still shaving. There were also concerns over this practice encouraging \\"unnatural vice\\", i.e. homosexuality, which reinforced Charles in his decision in 1662 to issue a royal warrant declaring that all female roles should be played only by actresses.Spencer, p. 315. Killigrew and Davenant were casting women almost immediately following the Restoration and, once women began appearing professionally on the stage in the early 1660s, they won quick acceptance. Killigrew staged an all-female-cast production of his own play The Parson's Wedding in 1664 and again in 1672. The Dorset Garden Theatre of the Duke's Company of actors, where Hughes spent a busy season in 1676. At the age of 15, Hughes made theatre history by becoming the first woman to perform on an English stage. Her first performance was on 8 December 1660, when she played the role of Desdemona in Shakespeare's play Othello, in a production by Thomas Killigrew's new King's Company at their Vere Street theatre.Halliday, Shakespeare Companion, p. 347. Some historians identify Anne Marshall as the first actress to step onto the English stage.Howe, p. 24.; Gilder, p. 166. However, there has been much analysis of the early recollections of John Downes, whose memories of the 1660s form a key part of Hughes' claim in this regard.See Highfill, Burnim and Langhans, p. 24, for an extended analysis of the various claims here. Personal life Hughes was famous for her charms as an actress; diarist Samuel Pepys considered her \\"a mighty pretty woman\\",Highfill, Burnim and Langhans, p. 24. and she was said to be \\"a great beauty, with dark ringletted hair, a fine figure, and particularly good legs\\".Spencer, p. 318. Pepys suggested that she was a lover of Sir Charles Sedley, a noted dramatist and \\"famous fop\\", in the 1660s; she was reportedly also involved with Charles II himself, if only briefly. It is believed that Hughes had an illegitimate son named Arthur, but there is no conclusive evidence of this. Prince Rupert, Duke of Cumberland, by Simon Verelst Most famously, however, Hughes became associated with Prince Rupert, Duke of Cumberland (sometimes known as \\"Rupert of the Rhine\\"), as his lover. Rupert fell in love with her in the late 1660s, although Hughes appears to have held out reciprocating his attentions with the aim of negotiating a suitable settlement. Prince Rupert was one of the most senior members of the royal family at court, and Hughes rapidly received advancement through his patronage; she became a member of the King's Company by 1669, giving her status and immunity from arrest for debt, and was painted four times by Sir Peter Lely, the foremost court artist of the day.Spencer, p. 318; Highfill, Burnim and Langhans, p. 26. Despite being encouraged to do so, Rupert did not formally marry Hughes, but acknowledged their daughter, Ruperta (later Howe), born in 1673.Spencer, p. 319. Hughes lived an expensive lifestyle during the 1670s, enjoying gambling and jewels; Rupert gave her at least £20,000 worth of jewellery during their relationship, including several items from the Palatinate royal collection.Spencer, pp. 320, 367. The two appear to have been close – Prince Rupert's older brother, Charles Louis, Elector Palatine, once sounded out Rupert as to his willingness to return to the Rhineland and marry appropriately, but his suggestion was rejected. Hughes continued to act even after Ruperta's birth, returning to the stage in 1676 with the prestigious Duke's Company at the Dorset Garden Theatre, near the Strand in London. The next year Rupert established Hughes in a \\"grand building\\" worth £25,000 that he bought in Hammersmith from Sir Nicholas Crispe. Prince Rupert died in 1682, leaving most of his estate, worth some £12,000, equally to Hughes and Ruperta.Spencer, p. 366. Hughes had an \\"uncomfortable widowhood\\" without Rupert's support, allegedly not helped by her continued gambling.Highfill, Burnim and Langhans, p. 26. Presents from Rupert such as Elizabeth of Bohemia's earrings were sold to the Duchess of Marlborough, whilst a pearl necklace given by Rupert's father to Hughes was sold to fellow actress Nell Gwyn. Hughes sold the house in Hammersmith to two London merchants, Timothy Lannoy and George Treadwell; ultimately it was purchased by the Margrave of Brandenburg-Anspach and became known as Brandenburg (or Brandenburgh) House. Her daughter, Ruperta, ultimately married Emanuel Scrope Howe, future MP and English general. Hughes died in 1719.Highfill, Burnim and Langhans, p. 24; Spencer, p. 367. Professional careers A 1672 portrait of Margaret Hughes by Sir Peter Lely. Hughes certainly played Desdemona in the performance of Othello seen by Samuel Pepys on 6 February 1669. She also played: * St. Catherine in John Dryden's Tyrannick Love * Panura in John Fletcher's The Island Princess. She probably played: * Theodocia in Dryden's An Evening's Love * Angellina in James Shirley's The Sisters. Hughes left the stage for Prince Rupert in 1669 or 1670. In 1676 she emerged from retirement for one busy year with the Duke's Company. For that company, she played: * Octavia in Edward Ravenscroft's The Wrangling Lovers * Gerana in Elkanah Settle's Pastor Fido * Mirva in Elkanah Settle's Ibrahim * Mrs. Moneylove in Thomas Rawlins's Tom Essence * Charmion in Sir Charles Sedley's Antony and Cleopatra * Valeria in Aphra Behn's The Rover * Leonora in Thomas Porter's The French Conjurer * Cordelia in Thomas d'Urfey's A Fond Husband.Wilson, p. 149. In popular culture A one-act play about Margaret Hughes, entitled The First Actress, was performed in 1911, at the Kingsway Theatre in London, by a group of suffragette actresses who called themselves the Pioneer Players. Ellen Terry played Nell Gwyn in this production. Jeffrey Hatcher wrote a play about Edward Kynaston entitled Compleat Female Stage Beauty (2000), and later adapted his play for the 2004 film Stage Beauty, directed by Richard Eyre and starring Claire Danes as Hughes. Hughes's first stage appearance is also discussed in the 2015 play Nell Gwynn, but she remains an offstage character. Hughes is the main character of Diana Norman's historical novel The Vizard Mask (1994). She is depicted as a stuttering American Puritan, Penitence Hurd, who becomes a successful Restoration actress.

Le Guin, Frank Herbert, Harlan Ellison and Theodore Sturgeon whilst attending the Clarion Workshop. He wrote several episodes for television series like Star Trek: The Animated Series, the 1984 Transformers cartoon and the 1987 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon. Early life Wise began experimenting with animation and live-action film at the age of seven, under the tutelage of several artists and experimental filmmakers, including Len Lye, Francis Lee, and Stan VanDerBeek. Wise created dozens of brief animations using cut-outs, scratch- on-film techniques, as well as conventional cel animation. In 1963, at the age of eight, Wise released a compilation of his experiments, titled \\"Short Circuit\\". Distributed by the Filmmakers' Cooperative, \\"Short Circuit\\" was shown throughout the world, won several awards, and was the U.S. entry in the \\"Child & the World\\" festival in Czechoslovakia. Writing in the Village Voice, filmmaker and critic Jonas Mekas called Wise \\"the Mozart of Cinema.\\"Movie Journal, April 18, 1963. By the time he was nine, he was lecturing on filmmaking at universities and film societies (including Washington & Lee and the University of Maryland at Baltimore), and appeared on numerous television shows, including I've Got a Secret with Steve Allen as host. Career=Star Trek: The Animated Series At the age of sixteen, Wise abandoned film-making for writing, determined to become a professional science fiction writer. The following year Wise sold several SF short stories to various anthologies. This led directly to his first television writing job, an episode of Filmation's animated Star Trek series entitled \\"How Sharper Than a Serpent's Tooth,\\" written in collaboration with Russell L. Bates. The series as a whole won the only Emmy any Star Trek series has won in a non-technical category, for best children's production. Buck Rogers, Wonder Woman, He-Man and Mighty Orbots After a successful stint of live action work, writing for Glen A. Larson's Buck Rogers (the \\"Space Vampire\\" episode) and the Lynda Carter series Wonder Woman, Wise returned to animation in the 1980s, collaborating on many of the animated endeavours of that period such as He-Man and Mighty Orbots. Transformers Wise also wrote Transformers episodes during the second and fourth seasons, including the Optimus Prime origin story \\"War Dawn\\", the comedy chase format of \\"Kremzeek\\", and the final three episodes of the original G1 series \\"The Rebirth\\", which Wise was forced to edit from five parts to three due to diminishing popularity of the franchise. During this period Wise also wrote scripts for Jem and My Little Pony. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles In 1987, Wise was given the call to develop and write a five-part animated television pilot based on an independent comic, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Wise helped change the darker toned black and white Mirage title into a fun, bright, cheerful animated show. Wise left after the ninth season, writing and story editing over 100 episodes. Disney and Batman: The Animated Series Wise next worked on Disney's Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers, and Mighty Ducks cartoons, and also wrote three episodes for Batman: The Animated Series, \\"The Clock King,\\" \\"The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne\\" (based on Steve Englehart's comic book story), and the origin story of The Riddler, \\"If You're So Smart, Why Aren't you Rich?\\". Other animated series and live-action projects He wrote the Battletoads animated pilot episode, as well as the two-part pilot for C.O.P.S., \\"The Case of C.O.P.S. File 1.\\" He wrote some episodes of Defenders of The Earth. He wrote and story- edited such comic-based series as Cadillacs and Dinosaurs and Jim Lee's WildC.A.T.S. He also developed, story-edited, and wrote most of the 26 episodes of Disney TV's Mighty Ducks: The Animated Series. During this period he also wrote and produced the live-action film Beastmaster III: The Eye of Braxus, and was the first writer/story-editor on an animated interpretation of Zorro. He even wrote an episode of Corn & Peg an original series not based on existing property. Go! Media Entertainment He was CEO of the multi-media company Go! Media Entertainment from 2005 - 2010. Go! Media Entertainment consisted of the publishing imprint Go! Comi, and the digital entertainment division oPlay. Other work He wrote the final episode of the fourth series of the Doctor Who-related Gallifrey audio drama series for UK-based Big Finish Productions. In 2019, David was announced as part of the team developing a television series based on the life of decorated dog hero Sergeant Stubby, serving as a prequel to the 2018 animated feature film Sgt.

Intrinsically linked to the Daytona 500, the museum primarily focused on exhibits related to NASCAR. The attraction also included exhibits related to the Daytona 200 motorcycle race, the 24 Hours of Daytona, as well as the Daytona Beach & Road Course. The attraction opened in 1996. In 2005, the site was one of the finalists to host the NASCAR Hall of Fame. After losing the hall of fame bid, due to high operating costs and low attendance, parent company International Speedway Corporation announced on November 6, 2010 that the attraction would no longer be open to the public but would be available only for private functions.Daytona 500 Experience closing After being closed to the public for four years, it was announced in 2014 that the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America would relocate to the site. The new expanded and refurbished museum opened in February 2017. History Through 1995, Daytona International Speedway featured a modest two-story visitors’ center outside of the oval's fourth turn. The first floor of the visitors' center housed the ticket office and a small sampling of racing memorabilia; the second floor was home to a wall of photographs of previous Daytona 500 winners. The Speedway also offered track tours on open-air trams. In mid- to late-1995, the visitors center was closed and a new destination-style, interactive museum was designed to take its place. The attraction opened in July 1996 during the 1996 Pepsi 400 using the name Daytona USA. (It should not be confused with the arcade game of the same name, though the game is featured in the attraction's arcade.) The attraction was awarded the Themed Entertainment Association's Thea Award of Outstanding Achievement in September 1997. The attraction was expanded by in July 2001. The renovation added two motion simulators: an IWERKS motion simulator ride called Daytona Dream Laps and the full-motion simulator Acceleration Alley. A third simulator, Toyota Tundra's Thunder Road, was added in 2003. Daytona USA celebrated its tenth anniversary in 2006 by adding the Daytona 500 Champion's Walk of Fame to the walkway in front of the building.DAYTONA USA Puts Finishing Touches On Daytona 500 Champion's Walk Of Fame - Daytona USA On July 1, 2007, Daytona USA was renamed the Daytona 500 Experience. Exhibits The attraction boasted several exhibit areas, simulators and interactive displays. Some of these remain active for private functions, however the IMAX presentation will no longer be shown. * The Coca-Cola IMAX Theater, home to NASCAR 3D: The IMAX Experience, a full-length 3D feature film released in 2004. During special events the theater was also used to show other movies: during Speedweeks 2007, the theater showed Dale, a movie about the life of NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt,DAYTONA USA To Show The Documentary \\"Dale\\" During Speedweeks - Daytona USA and the theater showed 24x24: Wide Open With Jeff Gordon in July 2007. * Acceleration Alley, a Full Motion Racing Simulator where guests sit in 80%-scale models of NASCAR stockcars and race against other guests and AI computer competitors. * Dream Laps, an Iwerks motion simulator in which guests follow the events of a NASCAR raceday. * Chevy 16-Second Pit Stop Challenge, where guests are able to test their skills as a pit crew member and compete with the Daytona 500 Experience's own Pit Crew, who practice daily. * Goodyear Heritage Museum, which focuses on the people who have raced at Daytona Beach from the land speed record holders to stockcars racing at the Daytona Beach Road Course to stockcars racing at Daytona International Speedway. The Champion's Walk of Fame, a Hollywood-esque concrete walk paying homage to winners of the Daytona 500 since the attraction opened in 1996, is just outside the building, as are statues of NASCAR great Dale Earnhardt and NASCAR founder Bill France, Jr. and his wife Anne. Also on display inside the attraction are the NASCAR championship trophy and the Harley J. Earl Trophy, which is awarded to the winner of the Daytona 500. The Daytona 500 Experience also once housed an arcade that featured many racing-themed arcade games, one of which was Sega's wildly popular Daytona USA, with which the attraction formerly shared its name with. The Daytona 500 Experience also hosted fan forums during race time and was home to the Richard Petty Driving Experience from April through October. During Bike Week and Biketoberfest, the Daytona 500 Experience was transformed into D5X, an air conditioned haven for bikers featuring live bands, food and motorcycle exhibits. The two different Speedway Tours that the attraction featured are still offered by the speedway with some modifications: the 30-minute general admission tour and a new, 60-minute All- Access tour that is available to the public for a higher fee and covers more ground. Daytona 500 connection Dale Jarrett's 2000 Daytona 500 winning car on display at Daytona 500 Experience, taken January 2001 Since 1997, the winning car from the Daytona 500 is impounded and displayed for the next twelve months at the Daytona 500 Experience. It is a popular but controversial display, and a highlight exhibit of the museum. All winners are contractually required to surrender their winning car and all its parts, in uncleaned, complete, and unaltered condition, as explicitly specified on the race entry form. This practice is often criticized by participants because it prevents the team from driving the car (clearly a successful chassis) in the other races during the season. They argued it potentially put them at a competitive disadvantage during the rest of the NASCAR season, most notably at the other restrictor plate races. Only twice since this display arrangement was adopted in 1997 was the winner of the Daytona 500 able to take a different car, as required, and gone on to win the next restrictor plate race (Talladega): Jeff Gordon in 2005 and Jimmie Johnson in 2006. By the time the car is returned, approximately 364 days after the victory, it is usually considered obsolete and a write-off. The morning after the race the winning car is inducted into the museum during the Champion's Breakfast ceremony. In some years, the driver's helmet, driving suit, and/or other race-used paraphernalia are also included for display. The driver also has the honor of unveiling the logo for next year's Daytona 500.

The highway starts at U.S. Route 6 (US 6, known as the Long Mountain Parkway) in Woodbury, and heads to the northeast, ending at an intersection with US 9W and NY 218 in the community of Highlands. It does not pass through any notable populated areas as most of the land around it is protected either as state parkland or US military reservation. However, it receives much traffic as the major route between the United States Military Academy at West Point and the New York State Thruway (Interstate 87 or I-87). What is now NY 293 was originally designated as part of NY 37 in the mid-1920s. All of NY 37 became part of a realigned US 6 in 1928. US 6 was rerouted again to bypass West Point to the south. Its former routing through the academy grounds became NY 293\\\\. Route description alt=A two-lane road descending the right side of a wooded valley under a blue sky with minimal clouds NY 293 begins at a junction with US 6 in Woodbury less than east of the Thruway, in Harriman State Park. From there it travels in a roughly east-northeast direction between the Harriman properties and the vast USMA reservation, most of which is only selectively open to the public. NY 293's next major junction also serves as its northern terminus, at US 9W in Highlands. NY 218 ends its concurrency with US 9W there and takes over the roadway that continues east beyond the underpass. West Point's Washington Gate is a short distance past the intersection. NY 293 is concurrent with US 6 Truck for its entire route. The Long Path hiking trail follows in the woods closely alongside NY 293 near its southern terminus. Since truck traffic cannot use US 6, truck drivers may use NY 293 to reach US 9W. History NY 293 at its northern junction with US 9W and NY 218 in Highlands What is now NY 293 was originally designated as part of NY 37, an east–west highway extending from Monroe to the Connecticut state line near Brewster over most of modern US 6, in the mid-1920's. In 1927, the first route log of the U.S. Highway System published by AASHO placed US 6 on what is now US 209 from Port Jervis to Kingston within New York. At the time, the US 6 designation ended in Kingston and resumed at the Connecticut state line in Danbury. The gap in the designation was eliminated in 1928 when US 6 was realigned east of Port Jervis to follow most of its modern alignment; however, from Woodbury to the Bear Mountain Bridge, US 6 followed what had been NY 37 from Central Valley to Highlands and overlapped with US 9W south from Highlands to the bridge. US 6 was realigned to bypass West Point to the south while its former routing through the academy grounds was re-designated as NY 293.

The Justice Lords were brought into DC Comics' canonical Multiverse with The Multiversity Guidebook #1 by Grant Morrison in 2015. Their world is situated on Earth-50 of DC's Multiverse. Television appearances The Justice Lords are an alternate Justice League from a parallel Earth whose roster resembles the original DC animated universe Justice League—an alternate Batman, Green Lantern, Hawkgirl, Martian Manhunter, Superman, and Wonder Woman—with the exception of The Flash, because the Flash from their universe is dead. Their world diverges from that of the world of the Justice League; their Lex Luthor is elected the President of the United States, kills the alternate Flash, and establishes policies resulting in the country's \\"being on the brink of a war that could destroy the whole planet\\" according to Superman. The alternate Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman try and stop the war, storming the White House and confronting Luthor (who threatens nuclear war). When Luthor tells the alternate Superman no matter how many times Superman sends him to prison, he would find a way back to power, Superman kills Luthor with heat vision and decides he likes this new form of \\"justice\\". The other Lords also lose faith in humanity. Two years later, the Justice Lords seize the world's governments, and begin ruling with an iron fist. Using their satellite base for surveillance, they suppress free speech, outlaw elections, impose curfews, and eliminate crime by lobotomizing criminals and supervillains. Lord Superman has also imposed severe restrictions on his girlfriend Lois Lane's way of life, forbidding her from making phone calls, having unauthorized guests, or leaving her home. Although they justify their behavior as \\"temporary\\" and for the good of the people, it is tyranny to the Justice League. \\"A Better World\\" The Justice Lords discover their counterparts when Lord Batman finds the League during an experiment which allowed him to view the alternate universe, as well as be transported there. Bored with own their world, the Lords decide to \\"assist\\" their counterparts by ridding the League's world of crime just as they did theirs, and trick the League into going to the alternate Earth. When the League arrives, they are imprisoned and rendered unconscious. They are later transferred to cells designed to neutralize their powers (except Hawkgirl, who is injured trying to escape), and Lord Batman stays behind to keep watch over them. When the rest of the Lords arrive on mainstream Earth (masquerading as its true heroes) they meet Doomsday, a monstrous fighter who challenges Earth's mightiest combatants and goes on a rampage. The Lords (especially Lord Superman, who predicts that the Lords will win over the earthlings with their \\"justice\\") are happy to fight him. After a hard fight, Lord Superman lobotomizes Doomsday with his heat vision (to the surprise of reporter Lois Lane). Luthor, who knows the real Superman's character, deduces that the Lords are not the League. The League escapes from the holding facility when the Flash accelerates his heartbeat to make Lord Batman think that he has flatlined. Lord Batman opens the Flash's cell door, is quickly locked in the cell by the Flash and the League escapes. Most go to Arkham Asylum to retrieve Hawkgirl, although Batman goes to the Batcave to get the dimensional transporter. There Batman and Lord Batman fight, and Batman convinces Lord Batman that the Lords' methods are wrong, after sarcastically saying if \\"Mom and Dad\\" were alive, they'd be \\"so proud\\" of what Lord Batman has done to his world (to the point of having a man arrested for complaining about the food quality and incorrect calculation of cost at a restaurant). Lord Batman saves the League from the alternate Earth's security forces and sends them back to their reality. On mainstream Earth, Superman approaches Lex Luthor for help against the Lords, who agrees in exchange for a presidential pardon. The League distracts the Lords long enough for Luthor to use a power disruptor to strip them of their powers. The Lords are arrested and sent back to their Earth, and Luthor expresses his intention to enter politics. Long-term effects The Lords' proposed alterations of mainstream Earth have repercussions in the first two seasons of Justice League Unlimited. The events of \\"A Better World\\" aid Amanda Waller's crusade against the destructive capabilities of the metahuman population if the government left it unchecked. When Waller is confronted by Batman, she reveals simulations that show what would happen if the League went rogue; each time, the government was defeated. Project Cadmus, established to counter Superman if he went rogue (as shown in the Superman: The Animated Series two-part episode \\"Legacy\\"), then called \\"Project: Achilles\\", expanded its threat list to the entire Justice League. Mistrust increased within the League; Batman and the Question fear that what happened to the Lords' Earth would happen to theirs when Luthor nearly wins the presidency, and the Question tries to kill Luthor. The League's apparent degeneration (including the public's shock at Doomsday's lobotomization from an image of a hero they trust, and Superman's fight against Captain Marvel that resulted from Cadmus and Luthor setting up Superman, and all through a mere act of him jumping to conclusions) cast it into an increasingly bad light. However, it successfully recruits the populist, astute Green Arrow as its political conscience; he puts the role of Cadmus in perspective for the League, preventing it from succumbing to the temptation that created the Lords. Luthor hacks the Justice League Watchtower to attack Cadmus headquarters, causing extensive collateral damage. The public turns against it, and so the League decommissions the Watchtower and surrenders as a good-faith gesture (except for Batman, who wants to clear the League's name himself). Cadmus, however, decides to retaliate, sending Galatea (a clone of Supergirl) and an army of genetically engineered metahumans to destroy the Watchtower and kill the rest of the League on board. Fortunately the League subdue the clones and Supergirl renders the rogue Galatea catatonic. When Batman finally convinces Waller Luthor is responsible for the attack, they confront him in his Lexcorp offices, only to be beaten back by Lex, demonstrating unnatural speed and strength. The rest of the League arrives to save them, learning that Superman's old enemy Brainiac (last seen in a battle with Darkseid) had been hiding in Luthor's body for many years. \\"Divided We Fall\\" Brainiac, resident in Luthor, creates duplicate androids of the Lords in the Justice League Unlimited episode \\"Divided We Fall\\". He adds an android duplicate of the Flash, in a costume nearly identical to that of comic-book villain Zoom, to distract the League from his (and Luthor's) goal of universal domination. The androids fight the League, playing on its worst fears: Superman becoming a Justice Lord, Green Lantern and Hawkgirl's failed relationship and her pariah status on Earth and Thanagar. Only Flash seemed the most unaffected by his replica's taunts due to his overly optimistic nature, and the androids were quickly destroyed, though the group of androids was merely a delaying tactic on the part of the Brainiac/Luthor entity. The growing fear that the League might become the Lords reaches a climax in this episode, when the Flash exceeds his maximum speed (vanishing into the Speed Force) to destroy the link between Brainiac and Luthor. With Flash supposedly dead, and Luthor at his mercy, Superman is put in exactly the same position as his Justice Lord counterpart, but resists the temptation and proclaims that he was his own person & not a Justice Lord. J'onn then senses Flash's presence, and the League successfully pulls him back from the Speed Force before he can vanish completely, saving his life and avoiding the path of the Justice Lords. Realizing they have estranged themselves from those they are trying to protect and still fearful of the future, Superman announces the complete dissolution of the Justice League, but Green Arrow challenges him, saying the Justice League was bigger than any individual and would continue without the original seven, and Superman changes his mind. The League establishes an embassy on Earth as a secondary Watchtower, and maintains a closer relationship with governments and law enforcement. Comic books=Batman Beyond right In Batman Beyond, the effects of Lex Luthor's power disruptor are temporary. When the Lords’ powers are restored, Lords Martian Manhunter, Green Lantern and Hawkgirl refuse to choose sides in the conflict between Lord Superman and Lord Batman (as Lord Batman had eventually managed to convince the three of them that the Justice Lords' methods are wrong) and leave Earth in disgust. Lord Superman marries Lady Wonder Woman during their war against Lord Batman and his benevolent followers. When the League returns to the Lords’ world to help Lord Batman, the League's Wonder Woman and Lord Batman fall in love; she remains in the Lords’ world and marries him. The League's Batman is heartbroken; he and Wonder Woman were attracted to each other, but he thought a romantic relationship in the team would cause trouble. Decades later, Lord Batman dies fighting the other Lords; the world remains under their tyranny, with wars between Lord Superman and Lord Batman's followers. Although the League's Wonder Woman returns to mainstream Earth, Superman and Batman's successor Terry McGinnis are suspicious; their Wonder Woman and her Lady counterpart are identical, and they think this Wonder Woman may be Lord Superman's wife working as a spy. McGinnis travels to the Lords' world, and learns about Lord Batman's death. The comics introduce parallel-universe versions of Terry McGinnis and Dick Grayson. In this world, Lord McGinnis never meets Bruce Wayne (and never becomes Batman); Lord Grayson is an officer on the Justice Lords' task force, despite being Lord Batman's partner decades before. Lord Superman arrives on the League's world with his followers—including the Justice-Lord versions of Warhawk, Aquagirl (Mareena), Micron, Captain Marvel, the Flash (Danica Williams), and Curare—telling the Justice League that Wonder Woman is his wife.Batman Beyond Universe #9 (April 2014) Years after Wonder Woman's marriage to Lord Batman, her Lady counterpart lures her husband out of hiding and murders him; Wonder Woman kills Lady Wonder Woman in retaliation for her husband's death and marries Lord Superman, conceiving their son Zod so their followers will declare a truce. However, their marriage is a sham; Zod is conceived from the genetic engineering of his parents' DNA with technology from Krypton, Themyscira and Project Cadmus. After Lord Superman discovers that Terry McGinnis has traveled to his universe, he returns to his world to confront him and his counterpart. McGinnis discovers a Batsuit, more advanced than his own, made by Lord Batman to counter Lord Superman's powers. McGinnis dons the Batsuit to battle Lord Superman, with his counterpart as a witness.Batman Beyond Universe #10 (May 2014) The first fight ends with Terry faking his death (with the Batsuit) when Lord Superman uses heat vision. Terry later discovers that the suit is powered by synthetic kryptonite, with which Lord Batman planned to defeat Lord Superman. When Lord Superman returns to the League's world, he fights Superman, Bruce Wayne and Wonder Woman in the Batcave and Zod arrives to help his mother.Batman Beyond Universe #11 (June 2014) Terry defeats Lord Superman when the fight spreads to Gotham's downtown area, while the rest of the League defeat the rest of the Justice Lords. Superman sends Lord Superman to the Phantom Zone, where he meets Superman's old enemy Jax-Ur and begins to make plans with him at Jax-Ur's suggestion. Seeing the Lords' world finally at peace, Wonder Woman returns to the Justice League and Wayne Manor. Bruce Wayne plans to build another synthetic kryptonite Batsuit, in case Lord Superman escapes. As McGinnis and Dick Grayson upgrade McGinnis' Batsuit based on Lord Batman's design, their counterparts repair Lord Batman's Batsuit (which McGinnis returned); Grayson intends to groom McGinnis' counterpart as the new Batman for the Justice Lords' world.Batman Beyond Universe #12 (July 2014) Mainstream comics= In the Multiversity series, Grant Morrison listed the Justice Lords as resident on Earth-50 of the New 52's DC Multiverse, placing it within DC comics continuity as well as that of the DC Animated Universe The Multiversity Guidebook: January 2015 To date, this has not been elaborated into a story arc. In the pages of \\"Dark Nights: Death Metal,\\" the Justice Lords are among the Multiverse characters that have sided with Perpetua.Dark Nights: Death Metal: Multiverse's End (2020). DC Comics. Members * Superman (voiced by George Newbern) - Leader of the Justice Lords, who breaks into the White House and kills President Luthor after Luthor kills Flash. He and the other Lords then impose their version of justice on the world. Superman lobotomizes the villains (including The Joker, Poison Ivy, Two-Face, Doomsday and Ventriloquist), despite opposition from Lois Lane. He and the other Lords capture the Justice League and plan to take over their Earth. Responding to Lex Luthor's escape from prison, he leads the others into a trap in which Luthor is the Justice League's Martian Manhunter. Superman defeats Flash, and is willing to kill him when Luthor blasts him with an energy disruptor. * Batman (voiced by Kevin Conroy) - He and the Lords rule the world with an iron fist. Unlike the others, Batman is morally ambiguous; while he does not join in their escapades, he is unperturbed by them. Batman discovers the Justice League, captures them with the other Lords and takes over their world. When Batman remains behind to guard the League, the Flash accelerated his heart rate until he seemed to flatline. Although Batman is alerted, the Flash overpowers him and locks him up. He escapes and battles League Batman in the Batcave; though he initially convinces League Batman to side with him (noting that in his world, \\"no eight-year-old child will ever lose his parents because of some punk with a gun\\"), witnessing a man being arrested for simply complaining about a restaurant bill (despite him apologizing and willing to pay later) makes him realize that the League's cause is just. League Batman convinces him to help the League return to their world. * Wonder Woman (voiced by Susan Eisenberg) - Helps Superman defeat and lobotomize Doomsday. She is defeated by her counterpart when Luthor blasts her with an energy disruptor. * J'onn Jonnz (voiced by Carl Lumbly) - When the Lords discover the Justice League, he leads them into a trap and helps in the fight against Doomsday. He is defeated by his League counterpart (Martian Manhunter), aided by Luthor and his energy disruptor. * Green Lantern (voiced by Phil LaMarr) - Unlike his League counterpart, he maintains his relationship with Hawkgirl and is bitter over Flash's death. * Hawkgirl (voiced by Maria Canals-Barrera) - She maintains her relationship with John Stewart. * The Flash - When Luthor becomes president, he sends the army after the Flash and kills him on television with a double-barreled shotgun. Hawkgirl and Green Lantern are bitter about his death. He is voiced by Michael Rosenbaum. Toys The Justice Lords were released in the Justice League Unlimited toyline in three 3-pack collector sets. The first set featured Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. A reviewer wrote that although they do not stand up on their own, they \\"represent one of the most popular episodes of the entire Justice League series\\".REVIEW: JUSTICE LEAGUE UNLIMITED JUSTICE LORDS 3-PACK: By Thomas Wheeler The next pack contained Martian Manhunter, Green Lantern and the Flash. The final set contained Hawkgirl and the Brainiac versions of Superman and Batman. In 2012 Treehouse Kids released its Heroics line of collectable figurines, which includes Justice Lords Superman as a chase figure. Inspiration and parallels According to the DVD commentary on the second part of \\"A Better World\\", although the Justice Lords began as a Crime Syndicate of America story the writers decided that a story about a rogue Justice League had more story potential as the Crime Syndicate was simply evil. The episode is similar to a Dan Jurgens Justice League America story, \\"Destiny's Hand\\". In that story, the Atom dreams about the original Justice League becoming oppressive rulers of the world. Doctor Destiny tries to make this \\"dream universe\\" absorb the mainstream reality, and the modern Justice League fights the \\"evil\\" old Justice League. The alternate universe presented in Injustice: Gods Among Us also shared much similarity to the Justice Lords, in that a parallel version of the Justice League, save for Batman, became oppressive rulers of the world after Superman was tricked by the Joker into killing Lois Lane, their unborn child, and destroying Metropolis with a nuclear bomb, for which Superman kills the Joker in retaliation, leading to his descent to tyranny. The alternative Batman, who had formed an underground Resistance movement to combat Superman's methods, brings in the mainstream version of the Justice League to combat Superman and his forces. Notable differences from the Justice Lords include Flash (who, in this continuity, is Barry Allen) being alive and fighting on Superman's side (before he realises how far the \\"heroes\\" have fallen and defects), Martian Manhunter was killed during the prequel comics fighting for Batman and Green Lantern Hal Jordan now a member of the Sinestro Corps as he fights for Superman, while John Stewart is killed along with most of the Corps. The premise of a Justice League-type super-team establishing a totalitarian state for what they see as the good of humanity was explored in Marvel Comics' original Squadron Supreme miniseries, its recent reworking of that story, in Wildstorm's The Authority and the \\"Titans Tomorrow\\" storyline of the Teen Titans comic book. The idea of metahumans taking control of humans, and of Superman leading them to make a better world, is also developed in the Elseworlds mini-series Kingdom Come. According to Bruce Timm's DVD commentary, Batman was to form Outsiders as a counter-superteam of the Lords but the idea was discarded. In the Avengers Annual #2, the Avengers are sent to an alternate world by an early version of Kang; the original Avengers take over the world and imprison other super- beings, allegedly for their own good. The idea of altering criminals to prevent them from returning to crime was also part of the DC Comics mini- series Identity Crisis (albeit using magic and primarily intended to protect the heroes' secret identities) and in Marvel Comics' original Squadron Supreme miniseries.

The differences in spelling correspond both with regional differences and with different senses of the word. For example, in the case of flat, rotational data storage media the convention is that the spelling disk is used for magnetic storage (e.g. hard disks) while disc is used for optical storage (e.g. compact discs, better known as CDs). When there is no clear convention, the spelling disk is more popular in American English, while the spelling disc is more popular in British English. Disk The earlier word is disk, which came into the English language in the middle of the 17th century. In the 19th century, disk became the conventional spelling for audio recordings made on a flat plate, such as the gramophone record. Early BBC technicians differentiated between disks (in-house transcription records) and discs (the colloquial term for commercial gramophone records, or what the BBC dubbed CGRs). UK vs. US By the 20th century, the \\"k\\" spelling was more popular in the United States, while the \\"c\\" variant was preferred in the UK. In the 1950s, when the American company IBM pioneered the first hard disk drive storage devices, it used the \\"k\\" spelling. Consequently, in computer terminology today it is common for the \\"k\\" word to refer mainly to magnetic storage devices (particularly in British English, where the term disk is sometimes regarded as a contraction of diskette, a much later word and actually a diminutive of disk). Computer discs Some latter-day competitors to IBM prefer the c-spelling. In 1979, the Dutch company Philips, along with Sony, developed and trademarked the compact disc using the \\"c\\" spelling. The \\"c\\" spelling is now used consistently for optical media such as the compact disc and similar technologies. Medical editing The words disc and disk can appear frequently in medical journals and textbooks, especially those in ophthalmology and orthopedics, and thus style guides often foster consistency by giving rules for which contexts take which spelling. AMA style for this topic is used by many publications. AMA says, \\"For ophthalmologic terms, use disc (eg, optic disc); for other anatomical terms, use disk (eg, lumbar disk). In discussions related to computers, use disk (eg, floppy disk, disk drive, diskette) (exceptions: compact disc, videodisc).\\" Sports Disc sports, or disc games, are a category of activities which involve throwing and/or catching a flying disc. Participants of disc sports consistently use the \\"c\\" spelling when describing the sports equipment used in these activities, which includes team sports such as ultimate or individual sports such as disc golf.

It was a centrepoint of the first settlements in the grasslands lying south of Kamloops, and today is used for recreation and as a water storage site to provide irrigation and water flows to fisheries downstream in the Nicola River. The lake is important in the history of the local Nicola people as the location of one of their major communities, Nicola Lake Indian Reserve No. 1, which lies on its eastern shore and is the home of the Upper Nicola Indian Band. Many of the band work for the Douglas Lake Cattle Company, aka the Douglas Lake Ranch, whose headquarters are also adjacent to the lake.  Geography  Located at an elevation of 628 metres above sea level, Nicola Lake is a widening of the Nicola River system as it flows from the plateau south of Kamloops and northwest of the Nicola Rocks Valley. It is approximately 22 kilometres in length and has a general northeast-to-southwest lay, curving along its length. The lake has a mean depth of approximately 24 metres, with a maximum of 55 metres. The Nicola Valley is narrow and mountainous, generating substantial winds that have given the lake a good reputation among sailors and windsurfers. The lake is a short drive from Merritt on provincial Highway 5A, formerly the main route into the B.C. Interior but replaced in the 1980s by the Coquihalla Highway system. This highway runs along the southeast/east side of the lake, through the communities of Quilchena and Nicola. The Nicola River flows into the lake just north of Quilchena, and exits through the Nicola Dam at the south end, just north of Nicola.  Recreational Use  Being roughly three hours from Vancouver and in a temperate climate that sees warm weather for much of the year (despite a severe high-country winter), Nicola Lake has become popular among those looking for recreation. Monck Provincial Park is located on the shores of the lake, at a site used in centuries past as a First Nations village (depressions, known as quiggly holes, from the local type of indigenous pit house, are still evident). Camping, boating, and swimming are available at the park. Nicola Lake is a popular location for fishing as well, with rainbow trout and Kokanee the main species sought by fishermen. Burbot also populate the lake. Burbot must be released when caught by fishermen in Nicola Lake. The winds that blow through its narrow valley have made Nicola Lake a destination for sailors and windsurfers. The Kamloops Sailing Association operates a facility at Quilchena that was originally constructed for the 1993 Canada Games sailing events, and today provides a location for club members and guests to sail, as well as lessons for new sailors. A pullout along Highway 5A is a popular launch site for windsurfers taking advantage of the wind. It was dedicated as a memorial to a local windsurfer several years ago.  Water Concerns  As part of the Nicola watershed locally and the Thompson River basin on a wider scale, Nicola Lake is a link in British Columbia's salmon life cycle. Because of generally declining water levels in the Interior, the lake, controlled by the dam at its outflow, provides necessary flows through the summer for vulnerable coho salmon and other species downstream. Some organizations have expressed concern about the water flows, and there is ongoing discussion about management of the dam, completion of the dam project (dredging of the inflow area being a key concern) as well as water supplies in the entire watershed.

Its fossils have been found in the Arundel Formation, which has been dated through palynomorphs to the Albian about 112 million years ago. Adults are estimated to have been more than 9 m (30 ft) high and 15 to 18 m (50 to 60 ft) long. Discovery and species Plate XIII from Cretaceous Reptiles of the United States, showing teeth of Astrodon on the bottom left Two dinosaur teeth were received in late November 1858 by chemist Philip Thomas Tyson from John D. Latchford. They had been found in Latchford's open iron ore pit in the Arundel Formation at Swampoodle near Muirkirk in Prince George's County, Maryland. Tyson let them be studied by the dentist Christopher Johnston, professor at the Baltimore Dental College, who cut one tooth in half and thereby discovered a characteristic star-formed cross-section. Johnston named Astrodon in 1859. However, he did not attach a specific epithet, so Joseph Leidy is credited with naming Astrodon johnstoni (the type species) in 1865, with as holotype specimen YPM 798. If Johnston had attached a specific epithet, it would have been the second dinosaur species identified in the United States. Johnston incorrectly stated that the site of the discovery had been an iron mine near the town of Bladensburg. In 1888, O. C. Marsh named some bones from the Arundel found near Muirkirk, Maryland Pleurocoelus nanus and P. altus. However, in 1903 John Bell Hatcher, taking into account the similarity of the teeth of Astrodon johnstoni and the teeth from the Arundel Formation referred to Pleurocoelus nanus, argued that the latter represents the same species as the former and that the name Astrodon therefore had priority. In 1921 Charles W. Gilmore agreed that the genus Pleurocoelus is a junior synonym of Astrodon, but at the same time kept P. nanus and P. altus as separate species of Astrodon. Other species at one time assigned to the genus include Astrodon valdensisW.E. Swinton, 1936, \\"The dinosaurs of the Isle of Wight\\", Proceedings of the Geologists' Association 47(3): 204–220 and Astrodon pussilus.Lapparent, A. F. de, & Zbyszewski, G., 1957, Les Dinosauriens du Portugal, Mémoires des Services Geologiques du Portugal. Nouvelle série, numéro 2, 63 pp In 1962 R. F. Kingham assigned Brachiosaurus, including all its species, to Astrodon as a subgenus.Kingham, R. F., 1962, \\"Studies of the sauropod dinosaur Astrodon Leidy\\", Proceedings of the Washington Junior Academy of Sciences, 1: 38–44 Carpenter and Tidwell (2005) accepted Hatcher's argument that there is only one species of sauropod dinosaur known from the Arundel Formation and that Astrodon johnstoni is the senior synonym of Pleurocoelus nanus (as well as P. altus) in the first in-depth description of this dinosaur. The majority of the bones of Astrodon are of juveniles, and Carpenter and Tidwell considered the two species named by Marsh, P. nanus and P. altus, as different growth stages of Astrodon johnstoni. However, other authors did not find the argument in favor of the synonymization of Astrodon and Pleurocoelus so convincing. According to Peter Rose (2007) it has not been demonstrated that either the teeth of Astrodon johnstoni or those attributed to Pleurocoelus are \\"morphologically diagnostic among titanosauriforms\\", which limits their utility when it comes to distinguishing them from the teeth of other taxa. The type series of Pleurocoelus nanus and P. altus (four vertebrae and two hindlimbs bones, respectively) cannot be directly compared to the teeth from the type series of Astrodon, so any comparison has to be conducted based on the referred specimens of Pleurocoelus. These, however, are all isolated bones from the Arundel Formation, which themselves were referred to Pleurocoelus only based \\"on proximity of the localities and the size of the bones\\". Rose concludes that, as Astrodon is not based on the diagnostic material, \\"new discoveries should not be aligned with that genus\\" and that \\"the argument to synonymize the two taxa, Astrodon and Pleurocoelus, seems unfounded\\". The type material of Pleurocoelus may not be diagnostic as well, according to the author. Vertebrae of P. nanus A similar argument was made by Michael D. d'Emic (2013). The author did not find any diagnostic features of the type material of Astrodon johnstoni, Pleurocoelus nanus and P. altus and considered the three taxa to be nomina dubia; according to the author there is no direct evidence that any sauropod bones from the Arundel Formation other than their type series can be referred to these taxa. D’Emic also stated that the exact provenance of the bones from the type series of Pleurocoelus nanus is uncertain and thus \\"these bones could represent a chimera of individuals or taxa\\". The author also commented on the diagnosis of Astrodon johnstoni proposed by Carpenter and Tidwell (which was based on all of the sauropod material from the Arundel Formation, not only on the teeth from the type series); he claimed that most of the supposed autapomorphies of this taxon \\"are indistinguishable compared to other sauropods such as Camarasaurus (...) and/or are related to the juvenile nature of the material\\". Paleoecology=Habitat The Arundel Formation of Maryland has been dated through palynomorphs to the Albian stage of the Early Cretaceous period, about 112 million years ago. This formation is part of the Potomac Group that includes formations not only in Maryland but also in parts of Washington D. C., Delaware and Virginia. The Arundel Formation was deposited on the edge of the expanding Atlantic Ocean basin. The region preserved in this formation was a broad, and generally flat plain with several streams running across it, probably similar to the modern day coastal regions of Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana and Mississippi. Fossil material assigned to Astrodon has also been found in two Oklahoma localities of the Antlers Formation, which stretches from southwest Arkansas through southeastern Oklahoma and into northeastern Texas.P. Larkin. 1910. The occurrence of a sauropod dinosaur in the Trinity Cretaceous of Oklahoma. Journal of Geology 17:93–98R. L. Cifelli. 1997. Oklahoma Geology Notes 57(1):4–17 This geological formation has not been dated radiometrically. Scientists have used biostratigraphic data and the fact that it shares several of the same genera as the Trinity Group of Texas, to surmise that this formation was laid down during the Albian stage of the Early Cretaceous Period, approximately 110 mya.Wedel, M. J., and Cifelli, R. L. 2005. Sauroposeidon: Oklahoma’s native giant. Oklahoma Geology Notes 65 (2):40–57. The Papo Seco Formation of the Lusitanian Basin in Portugal also provided Astrodon fossils. Paleofauna Skeleton of a juvenile in Maryland In what is now Maryland, Astrodon shared its paleoenvironment with dinosaurs such as coelurosaurians, the ankylosaurian Priconodon crassus, the nodosaurid Propanoplosaurus marylandicus, a possible basal ceratopsian, and potentially the ornithopod Tenontosaurus. The fossil evidence points to the presence of the poorly known theropods Dryptosaurus medius, Capitalsaurus potens and Coelurus gracilis, and the well known large theropod Acrocanthosaurus atokensis, which likely were the apex predators in this region. Other vertebrates are not as well known from the formation, but include freshwater sharks, lungfish, at least three genera of turtles including Glyptops caelatus and the crocodilian Goniopholis affinis. Evidence has shown that the multituberculate early mammal Argillomys marylandensis was also present.R. L. Cifelli, C. L. Gordon, and T. R. Lipka. 2013. New multituberculate mammal from the Early Cretaceous of eastern North America. Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences 50(3):315–323 Trace fossils included theropod tracks known as Eubrontes and others assigned to the ichnogenus Pteraichinus belonging to a pterosaur, which demonstrate that these animals were present in abundance.A. Bibbins. 1895. Notes on the paleontology of the Potomac Formation. The Johns Hopkins University Circulars 15(121):17–20 The plant life known from this area included trees preserved as silicified wood, cycads like Dioonites, Ginkgo, the ground plant Selaginella and the giant redwood conifer Sequoia. In prehistoric Oklahoma, Astrodon lived alongside other dinosaurs, such as the sauropod Sauroposeidon proteles, the dromaeosaurid Deinonychus and the carnosaur Acrocanthosaurus atokensis.Weishampel, David B.; Barrett, Paul M.; Coria, Rodolfo A.; Le Loeuff, Jean; Xu Xing; Zhao Xijin; Sahni, Ashok; Gomani, Elizabeth, M.P.; and Noto, Christopher R.

Oklahoma Geological Survey Bulletin 146: 1–27. The most common dinosaur in the paleoenvironment preserved in the Antlers Formation is the ornithopod Tenontosaurus. Other vertebrates present at the time of Astrodon included the amphibian Albanerpeton arthridion, the reptiles Atokasaurus metarsiodon and Ptilotodon wilsoni, the crurotarsan reptile Bernissartia, the cartilaginous fish Hybodus buderi and Lissodus anitae, the ray-finned fish Gyronchus dumblei, the crocodilian Goniopholis, and the turtles Glyptops and Naomichelys.Nydam, R.

The mayor is Alexis Fenner. History Plaster Rock’s first settlers were Hezekiah Day and his two brothers, who arrived in 1881. Plaster Rock was incorporated as the Village of Plaster Rock on November 9, 1966. Hezekiah Day gave Plaster Rock its name based on the hill on the other side of the Tobique River – the rock is made up of gypsum, or plaster. The second settlers, Mr. & Mrs. Henry Ridgewell, arrived in 1882. The third settler was a gentleman named David Roulston and his family. Primarily English, the town is historically a logging and lumbering community. Known as the Gateway to Mount Carleton Provincial Park, the community is the source of business, commerce, banking, grocery shopping, and religious and sport gatherings for the surrounding hamlets and homes of the Tobique River region. The Tobique River, which has its source Nictau Lake at Mt. Carleton Provincial Park, flows through the tiny communities of Nictau, Riley Brook, Oxbow, Plaster Rock, Arthurette, Red Rapids, and empties into the Saint John River above Perth-Andover. The Tobique First Nations Reserve is located where the Tobique and Saint John Rivers come together. The town has 6 churches, namely a Catholic Church, an Anglican Church, a Free-will Baptist Church, a United Baptist Church, a United Church of Canada, and a Pentecostal Church. The average congregation is 20-45 members of the first 5 churches, with the Pentecost church being an exception with a congregation of approximately 400 members, who are in part from the village of Plaster Rock, but mostly from the surrounding region of Victoria County. The Pentecostal Church also has its own private school, the only other school in the village aside from the village\`s Public Junior and High Schools. The World Pond Hockey Championship has been held every year in Plaster Rock since 2002 Plaster Rock is home of the World Pond Hockey Championships, which take place annually in February on Roulston Lake, featuring 120 teams from around the world. In 2016 Wayne Gretzky attended the event and Budweiser introduced its 20-metre goal-light as it began its trek across Canada and eventually to the North Pole.

The BCLR operates in the Millis and the Dartmouth - Westport - New Bedford area, they also used to operate in Bellingham, Needham, and Cape Cod (before getting sold to the state). In addition to moving freight for its customers, Bay Colony also performs AAR-certified repairs on rolling stock and contract track construction projects for other railroads. It has a sister railroad, the Seminole Gulf Railway, which is based out of Fort Myers, Florida. History The Bay Colony railroad was chartered on March 31, 1977, with the intent of taking over freight service on former New Haven lines from Conrail, which was planning to abandon service. The lines were purchased by the state government, and Bay Colony took over all freight operations on the lines on June 12, 1982 with a 25-year contract. The contract for the railroad lines owned by the State of Massachusetts administered by the Executive Office of Transportation (EOT), which included the Cape Cod main expired on December 31, 2007. It was awarded to a new company, the Massachusetts Coastal Railroad, which took over on January 1, 2008. At that time the Bay Colony ceased operation on those lines, but continues in other areas of the state.  Millis, MA Line  When the Millis GAF Plant in Millis, MA closed, the Bay Colony Railroad took a new contract from Tresca Bros Cement shortly after. Fly ash cars from Dragon Cement in Maine were delivered periodically, usually in the summer months to a section of track near Island Rd. in Millis.

It was one of the last known nodosaurids, living during the Late Cretaceous in what is now North America; fossils have been located in Alberta, Canada, and Texas, United States. Discovery The first fossil was found in 1917 by Charles M. Sternberg in Quarry 8, near Little Sandhill Creek. The type species Panoplosaurus mirus was named by Lawrence M. Lambe in 1919. The generic name is derived from Greek pan, \\"completely\\" and hoplon, \\"armour\\". The specific name means \\"wondrous\\" in Latin.Lambe, L.M., 1919, \\"Description of a new genus and species (Panoplosaurus mirus) of an armoured dinosaur from the Belly River Beds of Alberta\\", Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada, series 3 13: 39-50 Depiction of megaherbivores in the Dinosaur Park Formation, Panoplosaurus on the far right This holotype, CMN 2759, was discovered in the Dinosaur Park Formation dating from the late middle Campanian, 76 million years ago. It consists of the complete skull with lower jaws, the cervical vertebrae, some dorsal vertebrae and some ribs. Part of the bony armour scutes or osteoderms were preserved.

It was heavily armoured, even by the standards of other nodosaurs, probably with traverse bands of studded plates covering its back and tail, although the tail likely lacked the club found in ankylosaurids. Larger paired ovals of bony armour covered the neck, shoulders and front limbs. These ovals were keeled, possessing a prominent curved ridge on the outer surface. Spikes on the shoulder, that some other nodosaurids featured, were absent. The armour on the head was fused into a compact helmet- like shield; these plates had a lumpy surface. Also bony cheek scutes were present.Carpenter, K. 1990. \\"Ankylosaur systematics: example using Panoplosaurus and Edmontonia (Ankylosauria: Nodosauridae):, In: Carpenter, K. & Currie, P. J. (eds) Dinosaur Systematics: Approaches and Perspectives. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, pp. 281-298 The skull was short and wide at the back. The head of the holotype specimen is particularly rounded; the other two skulls are longer and flatter, perhaps reflecting age or gender differences. The animal had a relatively narrow snout, perhaps to aid in rooting about for low growing plants to eat and indicating a selective diet of highly nutritious food. Although the coracoid was slender and not fused to the scapula, the forelegs were particularly heavy, and had attachments for large muscles, which may suggest that the animal would have been surprisingly maneuverable in life, possibly being able to make defensive charges like a modern rhinoceros. The hand perhaps had only three fingers. The pelvis was attached to four sacral vertebrae with short sacral ribs. Classification Originally assigned to the Ankylosauridae, Panoplosaurus is today considered a member of the Nodosauridae as a close relative of Edmontonia from the same formation. In 1971 Walter Coombs even referred the species of Edmontonia to a subgenus within Panoplosaurus, creating a Panoplosaurus (Edmontonia) longiceps and a Panoplosaurus (Edmontonia) rugosidens but this has found no lasting acceptance.

Career The original members of Delta 5, Julz Sale (vocals/guitar), Ros Allen (bass) and Bethan Peters (bass), formed the band \\"on a lark\\", but soon became a part of the thriving Leeds post-punk scene, and later added Kelvin Knight on drums and Alan Riggs on guitar. Combining feminist politics with a two-bass funk-punk sound (much in the style of another, more famous Leeds band, Gang of Four), they released their debut single in 1979, \\"Mind Your Own Business\\". This song was later covered by Chicks on Speed, Le Shok, R. Stevie Moore, Pigface and Dum Dum Girls. Bethan Peters went on to play on Fun Boy Three's second album, Waiting. The members of Delta 5 were also important figures in the Rock Against Racism movement, and were the subject of a highly publicized assault at the hands of a right-wing group affiliated with rival movement Rock Against Communism. After the release of second single \\"You\\", the band went on a successful tour of the US, and soon thereafter left Rough Trade for Charisma Records imprint Pre. They recorded their debut album, See the Whirl, which suffered from overly clean production, and received low marks both critically and commercially. Due to the failure of the album, the group disbanded. A cover of \\"You\\" (with Japanese lyrics, and renamed \\"Saboten\\" (Cactus)) was recorded by Shonen Knife and released on the band's 1982 debut Minna Tanoshiku. In 2006, Kill Rock Stars released a compilation of early Delta 5 material called Singles & Sessions 1979-1981, capitalizing on the re- emerging popularity of post-punk bands such as Gang of Four and Wire. The set included unreleased material, along with BBC radio sessions and live cuts.

Typically it is known simply as the crowned eagle which leads to potential confusion with the African Stephanoaetus coronatus. Due to its rarity, not much is known about its biology or population.Canal, David, Séverine Roques, Juan J. Negro, and José H. Sarasola. 2017. “Population Genetics of the Endangered Crowned Solitary Eagle (Buteogallus Coronatus) in South America.” Conservation Genetics 18 (1): 235–40. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10592-016-0878-6.  Description  The Chaco eagle is a large raptor with a mostly dull and silvery grey body plumage. Its short black tail has a broad white medial band as well as a white tip and both its cere and legs are yellow.Christie, David A., Philip Burton, James Ferguson-Lees, David Mead, Kim Franklin, and Philip Burton. 2001. Raptors of the World. London, UNITED KINGDOM: Bloomsbury Publishing Plc. http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/mcgill/detail.action?docID=727353. As its name indicates, the Crowned Solitary Eagle has a crest of darker grey feathers.Do, Eric. 2020. “Chaco Eagle (Buteogallus Coronatus).” Birds of the World, March. https://birdsoftheworld.org/bow/species/croeag1/cur/introduction. The juvenile also has a crest but its colour dark brown, except for it creamy head and underbody which are both have grey streaks. It is one of the largest raptors in the Neotropics and normally weighs around 3 kg. Its total length can reach 73-79cm and it has a wingspan of 170-183 cm.  Taxonomy  Buteogallus coronatus is monotypic, meaning that there are no subspecies. Vieillot first named it Harpyia coronata in 1817. It was subsequently reclassified by Lafresnave in 1842 under the Harpyphaliatus genus and was renamed Harpyhaliatus coronatus. At the time, the Solitary Eagle (Buteogallus solitarius) was considered to be a subspecies of Harpyhaliatus coronatus until phylogenetic analyses of their DNA showed that they are, in fact, sister species. These analyses also indicated that another species, the Great Black Hawk (Buteogallus anthracinus), is also a sister species. They were all reclassified under the Buteogallus genus.  Habitat and Distribution = Distribution  This bird is endemic to the Americas and can be found in eastern and central South America. It is present in southern and central Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay and its range extends to Northern Patagonia in Argentina.Sarasola, José Hernán. 2018. “Nesting of the Endangered Chaco Eagle (Buteogallus Coronatus) on a Human-Made Structure.” Journal of Raptor Research 52 (1): 108–11. https://doi.org/10.3356/JRR-17-20.1. The status of the Chaco Eagle is uncertain in Uruguay, where it hasn’t been seen in decades and is believed to be extinct. It has been extirpated from portions of its historical range and is found in very low density throughout its range,Barbar, Facundo. 2016. “Direct Persecution of Crowned Eagles (Buteogallus Coronatus) in Argentina: A New Call for Their Conservation.” Journal of Raptor Research 50 (1): 115–20. https://doi.org/10.3356/rapt-50-01-115-120.1. making it one of the rarest and most threatened raptors in the Neotropical region. Only 250-999 mature individuals are left, while the total individual count of the species reaches 375-1499 birds.  Habitat  The Chaco Eagle can be found in semi open habitats such as open mixed grasslands, brushlands, savannahs, marshes and open woodlands. Also, the presence of large trees in the habitat is very important for the Chaco eagle since they are used for nesting.  Threats  The Chaco Eagle is considered endangered. Its population is declining, a trend that is most likely due to human activities. The Chaco Eagle populations are affected by many threats, including habitat degradation, collisions with human structures and persecution. An example of the latter would be in Argentina, where Chaco Eagles are still killed due to the belief that they attack livestock. Between 1999 and 2014, 30 Chaco Eagles were brought to a rehabilitation center after they had been shot to protect livestock.Madden, Kristin K., Genevieve C. Rozhon, and James F. Dwyer. 2019. “Conservation Letter: Raptor Persecution.” Journal of Raptor Research 53 (2): 230–33. https://doi.org/10.3356/JRR-18-37. For such a small population, this can have a great impact on the species’ chances at survival. This persecution attracted the attention of conservation groups, which lead to the creation of a national plan of plan of conservation for the Chaco Eagle in Argentina, the only country to do so so far. Another important factor is the electrocution of Chaco Eagles by power poles, which also has a sizeable impact on their populations. This is also a common problem that unfortunately affects many raptors.Sarasola, José H., Maximiliano A. Galmes, and Bryan D. Watts. 2020. “Electrocution on Power Lines Is an Important Threat for the Endangered Chaco Eagle (Buteogallus Coronatus) in Argentina.” Journal of Raptor Research 54 (2): 166–71. https://doi.org/10.3356/0892-1016-54.2.166.  Behavior  Often seen in solitary pairs or small groups of three, the Chaco Eagle is a tame crepuscular species that forages during early hours.  Vocalization  The Chaco Eagle can be recognized by its very powerful and shrill whistling call that can be heard 2 km away.  Diet  Its diet consists mostly of small to medium size mammals. It primarily preys on armadillos and skunks, but feeds on possums and rodents as well. Normally, this raptor kills or hunts its prey, but some individuals have been seen eating dead deer and sheep and roadkill. Lizards, snakes and turtles also make up a smaller part of their diet. Chaco Eagles still-hunt from perches.  Reproduction  The Crowned Solitary Eagle is a monogamous species. Between August and October, a single white egg with grey spots is laid on a platform-like nest of sticks and leaves. The nest is constructed on the tallest trees of breeding territories, 10-13m above ground. Some eagles have been seen nesting on human made buildings in area where no trees were available. The egg hatches around 45 days after it was laid (November-December). The female stays near its offspring from the moment the egg is laid until the chick is old enough to be left alone for short periods of time. The male continuously brings food to the nest, while the female joins the hunting when the chick hatches and grows a bit.Galmes, Maximiliano A., José H. Sarasola, Juan Manuel Grande, and F. Hernán Vargas. 2018. “Parental Care of the Endangered Chaco Eagle (Buteogallus Coronatus) in Central Argentina.” Journal of Raptor Research 52 (3): 316–25. https://doi.org/10.3356/JRR-16-82.1. The offspring will stay in the nest for 65-70 days. Not much is known concerning the age of breeding, but it is estimated that they do not breed before they reach 3-5 years of age.

César Galarza in 2016. Concert of Verde 70 Verde70 (Green70) is a music group from Quito, Ecuador. Verde70 started in 1999 with band members Dario Castro (vocals and guitar) David Arízaga (drums) and Diego Saa (backup vocals and bass guitar). The group achieved widespread fame across the country, in 2000, when they released Alegre Depresion, their first album, which made a breakthrough in the Ecuador's music scene. For Ruta Melancolia, their second album, Cesar Galarza joined the group (guitar). Their best time, they remember, was in 2004. In that year, they were the first Ecuadorian band invited to the Grammy Awards as well as touring throughout the country. It was precisely in those years when 'Verde' could not be missing from the most important schools of Quito and also marked the generations that were born in the 80s and 90s and, at that time, were between 15 and 20 years old. They disbanded in 2008. Dario Castro and David Arizaga pursued a solo careers and Diego Saa relocated to Florida and formed the group La Gente Naranja (The Orange People). In 2012, in mid- October, the band returns to the ring, Verde 70, one of the main and most recognized groups of the Ecuadorian music scene, confirms its return for this year. Recharged with all the energy and Rock and Roll that always characterized them, César Galarza (Guitarist-producer) and Darío Castro (Composer-vocalist) decided to return together again to the stages and present their most recent musical proposal. Bastián Napolitano (drums) and Christian Dreyer (bass and choruses) are the new talents that will be presented later this year, as the brand new official members of the band. After finishing the \\"Seguimos Verdes\\" tour, Christian Dreyer leaves the band for personal projects, and the initial bassist Diego Saa is reinstated. Verde70 is considered as one of the most influential and successful groups in the history of Ecuador. Discography and highlights * Alegre Depresión (Jolly Depression 2000) List of songs 1\\\\.

He is a former bench coach for the Seattle Mariners and a former first baseman in Major League Baseball. He played for two different major league teams in his career: the California Angels () and Colorado Rockies (). He also played for two teams in Japan: the Seibu Lions (–) and the Hiroshima Toyo Carp (). At 24, he was player of the year with the Seibu Lions, hitting 38 home runs and driving in 90 runs for the 1988 Japan Champions. Biography Van Burkleo attended Canoga Park High School and Chatsworth High School. He signed a minor league contract for $30,000 with the Milwaukee Brewers in 1981. He was released in 1984 and signed a contract with the Angels' minor league system. He was blocked by Wally Joyner for most of his first stint with the Angels. Van Burkleo's Angels contract was bought by the Seibu Lions of Nippon Professional Baseball in 1987. He was traded to the Hiroshima Toyo Carp in 1991 for cash considerations. Upon returning to the United States for the 1992 season, he signed with the Angels again, then played for the Rockies for two seasons, and in 1996 returned to the Angels for his last playing season. In 1997, he began his coaching career with the High Desert Mavericks, an Arizona Diamondbacks affiliate. In 2001, he found himself working for the Angels again, as the minor league hitting coordinator. He left the Angels at the end of the 2006 season. For the 2007–2008 seasons, Van Burkleo was the hitting coach for the Oakland Athletics. In 2009, he was signed by the Mariners to be the bench coach to manager Don Wakamatsu. The following year, he was hired by the Astros to be the minor league hitting coordinator. On August 19, 2012, Van Burkleo was named the interim hitting coach for the Houston Astros. He was named hitting coach of the Cleveland Indians on October 31, 2012, beginning with the 2013 season.

Career Van Landingham's rookie season of 1994 was his best, when he posted an 8–2 record with a 3.54 ERA and finished seventh in the balloting for the Rookie of the Year Award. His 1995 season was similar, but as a full-time starting pitcher in 1996 he posted a 9–14 record with a 5.40 ERA. After similar results in the first half of 1997, the Giants released him. He was known as \\"William Van Launching Pad\\" due to his propensity to give up home runs.https://sayhey.wordpress.com/2007/04/17/the-most-beleaguered-san- francisco-giants/ Van Landingham played his final Major League Baseball game on July 27, 1997. After being affiliated with the Angels, Expos, and Brewers in the minor leagues, he moved to Athens, Georgia, to live with his family. Name length Van Landingham was widely considered to have set the record for longest surname in the history of Major League Baseball, at 13 or 14 characters (depending on whether one counts the space), though his record has since been tied or broken (again, depending on the reckoning of the space) by Jarrod Saltalamacchia. When Van Landingham pitched to Todd Hollandsworth in 1995, the two set a record for longest combined pitcher-batter name length (since at least 1957) at 26 letters.Arnold, Bill, Beyond the Box Score, MLB.com.

The show, based on a toy line by Galoob, ran for two seasons, in syndication in the US and Europe. 26 episodes were produced. The program centers on a coalition known as the Dragonators (a combination of \\"dragon\\" and \\"aviators\\"), a set of humans who ride on dragon-back in search-and-rescue operations. David Perlmutter's Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows calls Dragon Flyz \\"a very transparent ad for a toy line, much like some of the other productions the Abrams/Gentile Studio was involved in at this time (see Happy Ness: The Secret of the Loch and Van-Pires for other examples.\\" Storyline Set in the 41st century, after an event called \\"The Cataclysm\\", the series depicts the adventures of dragon-riders either human or of a reptilian, gargoyle-like race, at war for control of the Earth. The battle occurs above a largely inhospitable landscape, either volcanic or barren; rivers of lava flow freely over the surface, inhabited by animals adapted to the unusual environment. The remaining human population dwells in an air-borne city known as \\"Airlandis\\", from which dragonators regularly travel to the surface to retrieve the fuel of its operation: the oviform purple crystals known as \\"Amber\\" (usually obtained from lava pools, or directly from the ground). The nature of \\"The Cataclysm\\" is never mentioned, though in the opening sequence the surface is depicted as a post-apocalyptic scene, implying nuclear warfare. Earth's inhabitants, ecosystems, and species have been exterminated, save those sheltered in an \\"Oasis\\". The skies immediately above the surface are ravaged by continuous lightning storms, dangerous air currents, and acidic clouds, known as the \\"Warp Winds\\", through which the only safe passages are the hollow mountains known as \\"Wind Pits\\". Any pockets of life, where any of the planet's former species dwell in relative safety, are known as \\"Oases\\". One such \\"Oasis\\" is discovered by protagonists Z'neth and Apex, whereupon Z'neth challenges Dreadwing to a duel for its ownership. Impatient, Dreadwing causes his dragon mount, Blackheart, to set the Oasis ablaze. At the end of the episode, Apex is seen carrying a birds' nest, with a few eggs, on the saddle of her Dragon. Airlandis is an airborne city (see Laputa) golden in color. Five large \\"bio-spheres\\" hover in its centre, each simulating a different natural habitat and thus preserving the species rescued from the Cataclysm. The city's most important region is its \\"power core\\", operated by the engineer Orac, who requires a regular supply of Amber. Additionally Airlandis has a runway for the Dragonators, a Dragon aviary (where the Dragons reside when not needed to fly), a Council Chamber (where matters of government are negotiated), a Control Room (known as \\"Skywatch\\", where a team of uniformed men maintain the city's systems and monitor the skies), and a prison. Dialogue implies that the populace seek a residence on the surface untouched by the Cataclysm. It is shown in one episode that some humans escaped the Cataclysm aboard a space station, on which the protagonists' mother now resides. Characters All the main characters, good or evil, ride dragon mounts into battle, but have the ability to fly short distances themselves. The Dragonators make use of a technology whereby dragonfly-like wings (known as \\"Exo-wings\\") emerge from the back-plate of their armor; whereas Dreadwing and his minions the Dramen literally 'sprout' membraneous wings from their shoulders. Both types of wing vanish after the immediate flight's conclusion. The Dragonators' chief weapon is the \\"Wind Jammer\\": a wrist-mounted weapon that fires blue energy bolts; whereas Dreadwing and his minions wield glove-like cannons which launch balls or streams of lava. All four protagonists' names are associated with height or elevation. HumansZ'neth= *Callsign: Dragonator One *Hair Colour: White *Armor Color: Cerulean *Dragon Steed: Riptor The leader of the Dragonators, and the eldest of the four siblings, Z'neth (pronounced \\"zenith\\", meaning \\"directly above\\") is characterised by honour and integrity. =Summit= *Callsign: Dragonator Two *Hair Colour: Bleached Blonde *Armor Color: Forest Green *Dragon Steed: Sky-Fury, called \\"Fury\\" for short The second-eldest sibling amongst the four. Summit is known for his various witty remarks, quick anger, and preference for physical strength in trouble. His name means \\"the highest point of a mountain\\". =Apex= *Callsign: Dragonator Three *Hair Colour: Orange *Armor Color: Silver *Dragon Steed: Blazewind, called \\"Blaze\\" for short Apex is the third-oldest sibling, and the only female. She prefers negotiation to conflict, and is primarily known for her telepathic abilities by which she can communicate with dragons, and even partially manipulate half-dragons, such as Dramen, into doing her bidding. When using her powers, her eyes, and those of her subject, glow a silvery colour. Her name means \\"the uppermost tip of a triangle\\". =Peak= *Callsign: Dragonator Four *Hair Colour: Blond *Armor Color: Orange/Purple *Dragon Steed: Wingstorm, called \\"Storm\\" for short Peak is the youngest, and the most reckless, of the siblings. He enjoys stunt- flying on dragon-back, which lands him in trouble, and is quite egoistical and mischievous. His name indicates \\"the top\\", as of a mountain or hill. =Amod= *Callsign: Dragonator Five *Hair Colour: Blonde *Armor Color: Brown *Dragon Steed: Titan Amod is another member of the Dragon Flyz, and a close friend of Peak's. He is skilled in battle, but initially disrespectful to dragons until convinced to behave otherwise. =Zarkan= *Callsign: Dragonator Six *Hair Colour: Brown *Armor Color: Black *Dragon Steed: Thunder Zarkan is a soldier of the Dragon Flyz, and loyal to the leading characters. =Nora= *Callsign: Dragonator Nine *Hair Colour: Orange *Armor Color: Light Blue *Dragon Steed: Unnamed Nora is the second female Dragonator in Airlandis, and the object of Peak's romantic interest. She fights alongside the other Dragonators with her own Dragon. =Aaron= *Hair Colour: White *Armor Colour: Red Aaron is the father of the four protagonists, and frequently acts as their advisor. He cannot use his legs and therefore is unable to walk, and instead hovers above the floor. This levitation is implied to be controlled by his staff, which carries an Amber crystal. He is the strongest advocate, on Airlandis' ruling council, for the search for a terrestrial refuge. =Orac= Orac is an engineer who maintains Airlandis' power generator. Grumpy in disposition, he is always seen wearing his uniform and gloves. =Councillor Joshua= A ranking member of Airlandis' governing parliament, wherein he often takes opposition to Aaron's position. Although his intentions are for the good of the populace, his impatience ultimately leads him to place Summit in prison, permitting Dreadwing control of the city. He is sometimes considered analogous to the Biblical Joshua. MutantsDreadwing= *Skin Colour: Red *Dragon Steed: Blackheart Dreadwing is the chief antagonist of the story, established in a mechanized cave complex known as \\"Warnado\\" (possibly a portmanteau of the English \\"war\\" and \\"tornado\\"). He appears akin to the Biblical Satan in his villainous character, gargoyle-like appearance, and inhospitable living environment. Supporting this, he is once called a 'Fallen Angel', and once misquotes Dante Alighieri's introduction to Hell: 'Abandon all hope, ye who enter here'. =Nocturna= *Skin Colour: Cyan *Dragon Steed: Unnamed Nocturna is Dreadwing's second-in-command; her defining trait is service to Dreadwing in return for a domain of her own. When Dreadwing offers her the Oasis, in exchange for her continued loyalty, she accepts and is angered when Dreadwing destroys it. Her Dragon is unnamed, but resembles her in colour, and bears a crest similar to that on Nocturna's head. Seems to have a bit of a crush on Z'neth, to the point where she will let them go or even side with them on rare occasion. =Fryte= *Skin Colour: brown *Dragon Steed: Skunk Fryte is a hunchbacked servant of Dreadwing, and unquestioningly loyal to his master. As with Nocturna, his Dragon mount bears resemblance to its rider. =Gangryn= A mutant scientist who serves Dreadwing. He is ambitious, but aged and bent, and will quickly change allegiances for his own sake. =The Gremwings= Gremwings (a portmanteau of \\"gremlin\\" and \\"wings\\") are bipedal, insect-like creatures known for their definitive screeching and disproportionately large mouths, and are distinguished by an impressive physical strength. They serve Dreadwing in vast hordes. Variations of this character include a monocular, batlike species which serves Dreadwing as a collector of information, and a similar species which feed on blood. =The Dramen= *Skin Colour: Purple/Grey *Dragon Steed: Unnamed The Dramen (portmanteau of \\"dragon\\" and \\"men\\") are large, gargoyle-like humanoids that 'sprout' wings from their bodies on demand. Dreadwing's Dramen are sometimes seen supporting Dreadwing and his lieutenants on dragon-back. =Dram= *Callsign: None *Skin Colour: Orange/Brown *Armor Color: Dark Brown *Dragon Steed: Titan Dram is a Dramen raised by Aaron when his village was mysteriously destroyed, whose loyalty to them has caused other Dramen to name him a 'traitor', much to his resentment. His dragon Titan has made only a few appearances; Dram prefers to fly on his own wings, though he never seems to have trouble keeping up with his comrades. Dram's name is a shortened version of 'Dramen', though he shares it with an archaic unit of measurement. =Vydak= Vydak makes two appearances throughout the series. He is the tribal leader of a clan of brown-skinned Dark Dramen who destroyed Dram's village and killed his family, and later enslaved another clan. When he is first seen, Dreadwing is attempting an alliance, but fails when Dram attempts to rescue the enslaved villagers. In his second appearance, his warriors are seen meeting with Dreadwing's army in a canyon before their attack on Airlandis, each leader plotting to betray the other. Dragons There are three varieties of dragons shown in the series. The first and most common are the Airlandian/Wild dragons. They have smooth-skinned, slightly serpentine bodies; long, slender necks and tails; needle-like teeth; and pterosaur-like wings on which they can walk (often in the absence of forelegs). Individuals are distinguishable by colouration and head shape. The second type is a large-bodied, stocky, four-legged breed with very short necks, ridden by Fryte, Kreigo, and Nocturna. The third breed, represented solely by Blackheart, has features of both previous breeds, is unusually large, and has the ability to consume lava and consequently breathe fire. All dragons are extremely intelligent and seem to understand everything said to them. They are always loyal to their riders, even when the affairs thereof do not apparently concern them. Airlandian dragons live, when not on duty, in a vast, hangarlike station consisting of nesting areas and a somewhat terraformed environment including a lake. On duty, they are exceedingly disciplined, so that under no circumstances do they abandon their riders. =Riptor= Rider: Z'Neth Riptor is the most powerful Arlandian dragon, and is considered the dragons' leader, as evidenced by his larger nesting area, collar, and crest armor. He is blue, with a nasal horn and two large crests. Riptor has a personal rivalry with Blackheart, and is one of only two dragons (and the only Airlandian dragon) able to contend with him. =Sky Fury= Rider: Summit A green female with two brown horns. Sky Fury, called \\"Fury\\" for short, is the only female mount among the protagonists' steeds, and has no hesitation in taking action uncommanded. =Fury's Cub= Rider: Unknown A small, green dragon born early in the series. His sire is unidentified. While still an egg, he was captured by Nocturna, sent by Dreadwing to capture dragons' eggs for a genetic experiment performed by Gangryn, with the effect that when he hatched, he was able to project a paralyzing blast. Dreadwing attempted to use this ability as a weapon, but failed when Sky Fury persuaded the hatchling to join her. A strong familial loyalty formed thereafter between Fury and her son. =Wing Storm= Rider: Peak A young, steel-grey dragon, having a spiky head and a long mouth fringed by what may be either points of flesh or protuberant fangs. Both Wing Storm and Peak are reckless, though \\"Storm\\" is the more cautious of the two. =Blazewind= Rider: Apex A white, black-maned dragon. Blazewind is closer to his rider than most by virtue of Apex's ability to communicate telepathically. =Blackheart= Rider: Dreadwing A massive four-legged, long-necked, red-scaled dragon with the ability to consume lava, which he expels as fire or a gaseous incandescence. The only dragon usually his equal is Riptor; but he is once beaten by the leader of a pack of Wild Dragons (Who was slightly larger and like Blackheart, able to breath fire). Episode guide The first three episodes were released as a stand-alone movie titled Dragon Flyz: The Legend Begins on December 3, 1996. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%\\" - ! style=\\"background:#689CCF;\\" Episode ! style=\\"background:#689CCF;\\" Title ! style=\\"background:#689CCF;\\" Written by } Toy line There are two sets of Dragon Flyz toys released by Galoob. One set consists of the central characters in various costumes, equipped with rotating wings that enable them to fly, a launching device shaped as a dragon, and a DVD. The second set does not have the DVD, and the launcher does not look like a dragon. Variations include lone riders; lone dragons that fly by flapping their own wings; and figures that illuminate when launched. Most of the rider figures carry firearm-like weapons. Galoob released a similar toy design aimed at girls, called Sky Dancers.

He introduced the term \\"clinical psychology\\" and is often credited with founding the field that it describes. Witmer created the world's first \\"psychological clinic\\" at the University of Pennsylvania in 1896, including the first journal of clinical psychology and the first clinical hospital school in 1907. Witmer contributed to numerous branches of psychology including school psychology. He contributed to the field of special education. Little is known about Witmer's life. He is described as an introverted and private person. Early life Witmer was born in Philadelphia on June 28, 1867. He was born David L. Witmer Jr., but at age 50 he changed his name to Lightner. Witmer was born to a devout Catholic mother and father: David Lightner, a Germantown pharmacist who graduated from a Philadelphia College in 1862; and Katherine Huchel, about whom little is known. He was the eldest of four children, followed by Albert Ferree, Lilly Evelyn and Paul DeLancey. Later in life Witmer became a faculty member at the University of Pennsylvania. Ferree obtained his physiology doctorate from the University of Pennsylvania, Lilly Evelyn received her bacteriology medical degree in Berlin, and Paul DeLancey obtained a doctoral degree in Pharmacy. By the end of 1905, Witmer and his siblings had all become doctors in a range of disciplines. Education As a young man, Witmer wanted a better future and a better world after the social problems he saw as a result of the Civil War. In 1880, Witmer and his brother Ferree enrolled in the Prep School “Episcopal Academy of Philadelphia”, one of the best schools in America at the time. Witmer showed his intelligence and reasoning ability at Prep School. Witmer and two other boys were told to build a canoe, each having everything they needed to complete their task. His two schoolmates were arguing over who would build the canoe first, but Witmer thought and told the other children, \\"I wish to finish last as I will learn from others' mistakes and build the best canoe.\\" He graduated with high honors at age 17. In 1884, Witmer enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania to study art, but after a couple of years he transferred to the Finance and Economy department where he obtained a Bachelor's degree in 1888 aged 20. During his freshman year, he was chosen as the class president and earned a reputation as an outstanding student. After a stint as a teacher, Witmer decided to return to the University of Pennsylvania for his graduate studies in political science. Rugby Academy During the fall of 1888, Witmer was offered a job as an instructor at Rugby Academy, a male secondary school. He taught History and English. While he was teaching at the academy, Witmer noticed that a 14-year-old student who wished to go to college had extreme difficulties in differentiating sounds, as well as other speech problems that might today be called dyslexia. Witmer decided to help him to correct his problem; the child progressed satisfactorily and was able to continue studying, eventually enrolling at the University of Pennsylvania. This success made Witmer believe that children with learning difficulties could satisfactorily engage in education with support, dedication and special education. The following year, Witmer decided to attend graduate school at the University of Pennsylvania and was accepted into the Philosophy department. He intended to study law and to work towards an advanced degree in political science. Career James McKeen Cattell and the Experimental Psychological Lab While at Pennsylvania he was introduced to experimental psychologist James McKeen Cattell, who inspired him to begin studying in the emerging field of psychology. George Fullerton, a member of The University brought Cattell to join the faculty of the University. At this time, Cattell was known as one of the best-trained psychologists, educated by influential psychologist, Wilhelm Maximilian Wundt. Witmer accepted Fullerton's offer to become Cattell's assistant. He decided to resign from the Rugby Academy and attend graduate school at the University of Pennsylvania. Witmer and Cattell worked together to found an experimental psychology lab with the purpose of studying individual differences by examining a range of subjects. Witmer's main lab tasks were to gather data on individual differences in reaction times. Through these he gained knowledge of psychological experiments. While at the lab, Witmer published a manual that explained how experimental psychology should be properly conducted. Witmer intended to get his doctoral degree under Cattell's supervision, but Cattell suddenly left the university (effectively abandoning his students and laboratory), to obtain a higher paying position at Columbia University. Witmer also left in search of a new teacher. Under Wundt's Supervision Cattell helped Witmer to get a job as assistant to Wilhelm Wundt at the University of Leipzig in 1891, also taking classes with Oswald Kulpe and Ludwig Strumpel. Historians have found no letters written by him to colleagues while under Wundt's supervision. However, it is said that while Witmer was Wundt's assistant, they had several disagreements. One of those disputes was that Witmer desired to continue working on the study of reaction times he had previously started with James Cattell, but Wundt insisted that they should study the aesthetic value of different visual forms, and other branches of psychology such as educational psychology and developmental psychology. Witmer obtained his doctoral diploma in 1892 from Wundt. Return to Pennsylvania In 1892, Witmer left Germany and returned to the University of Pennsylvania, becoming the Director of The Laboratory of Psychology. He was interested in teaching Child Psychology and taught several different courses. He also began conducting research on individual differences in sensory- perceptual variables and presented papers in experimental psychology. In 1896, he taught public school teachers at the University. During March of that year, a special case was brought before him: a 14-year-old student was having extreme difficulties learning to spell, yet was quite able and excelled in other subjects. This case offered a special challenge to Witmer, and was in line with his developing view that psychology should be of practical benefit. He soon began remedial work with the youth. Needing a workspace, Witmer established the first psychological clinic, at the University. During 1896, he presented a plan of organization for practical work in psychology to the American Psychological Association, in which he used and explained the term \\"Clinical Psychology\\" for the first time. In 1902, he started advising graduate students and published a laboratory manual. He married Emma Repplier, a prominent graduate from the Agnes Irwin School, in 1904. She was a writer who worked for the American Philosophical Society, to which both she and Witmer belonged. In 1908, he established and staffed a small private residential school near Wallingford, Pennsylvania, an institution dedicated to the care and treatment of retarded and troubled children. Later, he established a similar, but larger facility in Devon, Pennsylvania. He founded the world's first speech clinic in 1914. American Psychological Association By 1896, Witmer, Stanley Hall, William James and Cattell decided to become members of a new association for psychology professionals, during a meeting of the American Psychological Association (APA). Witmer and other experimental colleagues proposed that the APA should accept only psychological papers, be separated from the American Philosophical Association, and have a better selection process for choosing new members. These proposals caused disagreements among APA members, because many of the current members did not want the field to separate from philosophy. Their proposals were ignored, so Witmer attempted to start a new society with Hall, exclusively for experimental psychologists, but Hall refused. In 1904 Edward B. Titchener accepted Witmer's proposal to separate Psychology from Philosophy, and decided to abandon the APA society and help Witmer create a society solely for experimental psychologists. Witmer told Titchener that the association should be only for men, and that women should be excluded, because they were too emotional when talking about scientific issues. He eventually changed his attitude, and decided to teach female students; accepted women to work at his clinic, and later appointed a woman to manage it. Witmer wrote and published articles to the APA. In one article, \\"The Organization of Practical Work in Psychology\\", he expressed his desire to assist children academically and described a plan for organised education. He proposed that schools should become more involved with their students' classes and grades, that schools should have better educational equipment, and that faculty members should receive teaching reflecting psychological findings. First psychological clinic Witmer opened the first Psychological Clinic at the University of Pennsylvania in 1896, with the purpose of studying children who had either learning or behavior problems. Witmer's main participants were children who attended public schools from Philadelphia and surrounding areas, and who were brought to the clinic by their teachers or parents. Witmer's clinic was appreciated by many, as it proactively employed psychology. In the clinic, Witmer regularly dealt with issues such as speech difficulties, sleep disturbances, behavioral problems, hyperactivity and refusal to stay in school. Every child was given a complete mental and physical examination, which often ruled out physiological symptoms. His method of improving children with psychological problems involved breaking down information to a level that they could understand. He would focus on particular problems and work with the child in that area, often improving several areas at once. In 1907 Witmer founded the journal The Psychological Clinic. In its first issue, he published the article \\"Clinical Psychology\\", which explained its definition in the following way: > Although clinical psychology is clearly related to medicine, it is quite as > closely related to sociology and pedagogy... An abundance of material for > scientific study fails to be utilized, because the interest of psychologists > is elsewhere engaged, and those in constant touch with the actual phenomena > do not possess the training necessary to make the experience and observation > of scientific value...I have borrowed the word \\"clinical\\" from medicine, > because it is the term I can find to indicate the character of the method > which I deem necessary for this work. Witmer's \\"Clinical Psychology\\" was published and got a lot of attention, because it dealt with the study of individual children. In his article, Witmer presented the idea that all kinds of children (smart or mentally retarded) could reach their full potential with help. He included definitions of retardation using two different terms: \\"physiological retardation\\" referred to individuals who had not acquired a normal development for their chronological ages, whereas the other term, \\"pedagogical retardation\\", referred to children who did not develop their full capacities when they reached adulthood. In the first issue of The Psychological Clinic, he criticized some of his colleagues and their departments because they had rejected ideas he proposed to the American Psychological Association. In 1908, in a later issue of his journal, he criticized William James for what he felt was his unscientific attitude, calling James \\"the spoiled child of American Psychology\\". Witmer always defended his ideas and beliefs, even if it seemed that he did not care about other points of view. This and other disagreements caused Witmer to lose the friendship of his colleagues, who decided not to attend Witmer's meetings. Witmer also attacked Harvard University for using the theory of introspection and teaching psychology incorrectly, since Witmer also refused the idea theory introspection and did not care much for pure experimental psychology. He also criticized \\"Intelligence Tests\\" and encouraged his students not to trust them, because he thought those tests only gave a measure of the individual's efficiency, nothing else. He thought that people should not be referred to as normal or abnormal due to the results of such tests, as one could then say that an individual was \\"normal\\" or \\"abnormal\\", depending on if, for example, he or she knew how write and read properly. Another of Witmer's studies involved apes. He compared them with children, and taught them how to articulate some elements of spoken language, but their efforts to learn were not successful. However, one day Witmer attended a performance, and noticed that a monkey was able to do some things human beings could do, such as reading and writing, after being instructed to do such things. Witmer's studies of individual behavior extended to gifted children. In 1900 in his The Restoration of Children of the Slums described Witmer's beliefs that criminal behavior was not hereditary. Instead, he thought criminal behavior was caused due to environmental facts. In 1911 Witmer supported a bill in the state of Pennsylvania to sterilize severely retarded people, with the purpose of minimizing their offspring. In 1912 he traveled to Italy to study pedagogical methods with special children. Clinical psychology In his 1896 APA paper, cited to be the first instance of his use and explanation of the term \\"Clinical Psychology,\\" Witmer outlined four main goals for his new discipline. Firstly, it was to focus on the investigation of mental and moral retardation by means of statistical and clinical methods. Secondly, clinical psychology as a discipline was to establish more psychological clinics and hospitals specifically for children suffering from retardation or physical defects that inhibit academic progress. The discipline was to focus on the creation of opportunities for those in other disciplines, such as teaching, medicine and social work to observe and work with retarded and normal children. Witmer's fourth goal was to train more psychologist to become expert in working with mentally and/or morally retarded clients. In this same paper, Witmer outlined the main concern of clinical psychology: that the discipline focus on active clinical intervention for the purpose of the restoration and treatment of mentally or morally disabled individuals. According to Witmer, for clinical psychology to actually be of any worth, it needed to help and improve clients' mental health and well-being. As clinical psychology was the first discipline in psychology that attempted to apply the principles of scientific psychology to diagnostic and remedial work, it required its own techniques and procedures. Clinical psychology's original methodologies were highly practical and problem-oriented, and were developed solely by Witmer. His early work used a hands-on approach to observation and interviews, emphasizing one-on-one interaction between client and clinician. Additionally, emphasis was placed on the ability of the clinician to be able to work with their clients in a professional, yet personal way. Witmer highlighted the concept of treating each client as an individual, and not simply as a physical manifestation of their problem or a phenomenon to be observed and explained. He emphasized researching each client's personal background history, as he held that it would allow clinicians to better and more fully understand their situation. He was one of the first psychologists to accept that a client's problems could have environmental as well as hereditary factors, and because of this, he emphasized the importance that treatment should not end with returning the client into the environment from which their physical, mental, or moral problem originated unless something had been done to change it. Although the treatment programs Witmer created for clinical psychology were systematic, they were constantly revised and implemented new treatment methods as the client improved or problems arose. Treatment involved weekly visits to the clinic to ould continue until either the problem was resolved, or the client, or the client's parent/guardian, decided to end it. Witmer's treatment programs were not limited to the clinic in which they took place; he emphasized the importance of ongoing remediation in between treatment sessions and after treatment had officially ended. To this end Witmer made a point to provide direct advice and consultation to both the client and their caregivers on their living environment and other aspects of their lives in order to improve their problems or disabilities. Many of Witmer's original methodologies still exist in modern-day clinical psychology. Other contributions Witmer was responsible for major advancements in the field of school psychology and was cited as the founder of this discipline. Witmer was the first psychologist to undertake and focus, on the treatment of those with mental, physical or moral handicaps with the goal of improving their deficits. He ensured that the treatment of children suffering from a deficit impairing their academic success would be a major focus of clinical psychology when he made one of the discipline's main goals the creation of psychological clinics and hospitals to treat impaired children. Witmer was the first psychologist to realize teachers' integral role and began offering classes at his clinic for teachers. He opened up his clinic to those in medicine and social work and gave them the opportunity to observe and work with normal and impaired children. This allowed those who interacted with children a chance to work with them in a therapeutic environment. By mixing normal and handicapped children, Witmer gave these professionals the chance to directly observe the differences between the two groups for themselves. He offered these professionals courses that demonstrated how to practically apply his clinical methods. This helped the other disciplines to see the importance of working with disabled children. Final days By 1917, Witmer joined the Red Cross. His main task was to help to rehabilitate homeless people who were war victims. When he went to the United States in 1920, his mother died, followed a few years later by Titchener, and he stopped publishing. By 1930, the University of Pennsylvania presented him with a volume called Clinical Psychology: Studies in Honor of Lightner Witmer. On July 19, 1956, at age 89, Witmer died at the hospital in Bryn Mawr from heart failure. Legacy Witmer gained little recognition outside of clinical psychology and is little talked about. Several factors are claimed to have contributed to this perception. One had to do with Witmer's personality. Within his field he was vicious, argumentative and blunt, regardless of his opponent. Witmer's targets included the American Psychological Association, mon-experimentalists, psychology as a discipline, and his colleagues. A second factor was that many of his theories were not empirically testable. Although Witmer was a major advocate for scientific procedures, he often presented his theories as facts, rather than hypotheses. He then often failed to provide methods for testing his theories. Many of his principles, methods and ideas are basically congruent with later developments in his field, but were far from the mainstream when he offered them. At his official address in 1897, his ideas for clinical psychology produced only a few raised eyebrows. Witmer was highly critical of many popular trends in psychology and society during his career. For example, he directly opposed popular education methods of his time, which focused on mass instruction. Witmer argued that education required personalization and a focus on students as individuals. He was highly critical of intelligence tests, which he claimed measured efficiency, rather than intelligence. He saw intelligence as having both hereditary and environmental components.

Krapp (1887, New York City, - 1973, Florida) was a theatre architect and designer in the early part of the twentieth century. Krapp was an apprentice with the Herts & Tallant firm until 1915. Between 1912 and 1916 Krapp began working directly with the Shubert brothers and eventually would become their primary architect. He also designed theatres for the Chanin brothers. Almost half of the current Broadway theatres were designed by Krapp, including the Lyceum, Shubert, Booth, New Amsterdam and Longacre Theatres. Krapp was well known for his ability to use his building space to its fullest potential. For the Majestic Theatre, Krapp incorporated stadium seating into the plans for the orchestra level, creating better sightlines and allowing for the creation of larger lounge and lobby areas. He designed the Ambassador Theatre on a completely diagonal plan to fit it into a small space. Krapp was responsible for completely renovating the Winter Garden Theatre and the Helen Hayes Theatre in the 1920s. He also designed the Hotel Edison, the Lincoln Hotel (now the Row NYC Hotel), and numerous other buildings. Although the stock market crash of 1929 brought an end to the theatre building boom, Krapp remained with the Shuberts until 1963, supervising the maintenance and renovations of the existing venues. He also experimented with inventing; one of the tools he created was patented and used by the U.S. Air Force. He died in Florida in 1973.

It is owned by SummitMedia. It airs a hot adult contemporary format. It shares studios with six other sister stations in the Cahaba neighborhood in far southeast Birmingham, and the transmitter is based atop Red Mountain. History As of 2020, 97.3 is the newest full-powered station to sign on in the Birmingham market. WEDA, then licensed to Homewood, signed on with a CHR format on November 2, 1998, calling itself \\"Hot 97.3\\".http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1998/RR-1998-11-06.pdf Birmingham had not had a CHR station since WAPI-FM (now WJOX-FM) changed formats in 1994, and the owners were hoping to fill that niche. However, WQEN, a CHR station licensed to Gadsden, began broadcasting from a tower closer to Birmingham earlier in the year and was more successful than WEDA. In 1999, Cox Radio purchased WEDA from the local investors who owned the station, changed the call letters to WRLR, and changed the format to active rock. The new on-air name of the station was \\"Real Rock 97.3\\". Initially, the station was moderately successful. However, a weak signal (initially, the station broadcast at 640 watts ERP) and competition from modern rock/alternative station WRAX caused WRLR to become one of the lowest rated FM stations in Birmingham. In October 2001, sister station WODL (Oldies 106.9) unexpectedly changed its format to all 1980s music and became known as WBPT, \\"106-9 the Point\\". Cox moved the oldies format and call letters to 97.3, and the station became known as \\"Oldies 97.3\\". Once again, the weak signal of 97.3 proved to be a hindrance to the station’s success. Also, the popularity of oldies stations focusing on music from the 1960s began to decline. In June 2004, the power of the station increased from 640 watts to 6,400 watts and the station's city of license was changed from Homewood to Gardendale. In July of that year, the station changed its emphasis from oldies to music strictly from the 1970s. Core artists of the station known as \\"70s Hit Radio, 97-3 WODL\\" included Chicago, the Doobie Brothers, Alice Cooper, Grand Funk Railroad, Barry Manilow, Earth, Wind and Fire, James Taylor and other 1970s Top 40 artists. After less than three months as a 1970s oldies station, the station once again changed formats to hot country in September 2004, placing it in competition with co-owned country station WZZK-FM and cross-town rival WDXB. The station was assigned the WNCB call letters by the Federal Communications Commission on October 19, 2004. From the time of the format switch until March 11, 2010, the station was known on the air as \\"New Country 97.3\\". On that date, it was rebranded as \\"97.3 The Buck\\". On August 30, 2011, at 2 PM, WNCB changed their format to sports, branded as \\"97.3 The Zone\\". Two days later, on September 1, 2011, the station changed its call letters to WZNN, reflecting their new on-air name. On October 17, 2011, WZNN began simulcasting all of its local programming (6-9 AM & 12-2 PM) on WTXK in Montgomery. The station dropped its affiliation with Yahoo! Sports Radio on August 20, 2012 to become the new affiliate in the Birmingham market for ESPN Radio. At that time, the station modified its branding to \\"ESPN Radio 97.3 the Zone\\". On that same day, the station signed on their HD2 subchannel, carrying the former old-school hip-hop/R&B; format of WENN-AM 1320, which remained on translator W270BW (102.1 FM). The station became infamous for their public courting of Paul Finebaum, who was working for rival WJOX up until January 21, 2013. The Zone then hired WJOX's former program director, Ryan Haney, before Citadel (WJOX's parent company) brought a lawsuit that kept him away from WZNN. Haney returned to WJOX in March 2013. On July 20, 2012, Cox Radio, Inc. announced the sale of WZNN and 22 other stations to Summit Media LLC for $66.25 million. The sale was consummated on May 3, 2013. On February 11, 2013, the station pulled the plug on its specialty programming, including \\"Eyes on Auburn\\", \\"Tider Insider\\", and \\"The Midnight Meltdown\\", for unknown reasons. On April 2, 2013, Fourth Quarter hosts Max Howell and Tim Melton of \\"The 4th Quarter\\" resigned from the station because they were asked by the program director to be \\"more controversial\\". Max Howell posted on his Facebook that \\"I'm not willing to do that kind of show . . . it's not my style and never has been.\\" On May 6, 2013, the station cancelled the popular late morning Straight Talk show featuring Matt Coulter and former Alabama head basketball coach Wimp Sanderson. This was the first major programming change after the station's sale to Summit Media became final on May 3, 2013. Other shows at the time included the \\"Smashmouth Radio Network\\" with Kevin Scarbinsky and Scott Griffin in morning drive, \\"The Sports Czars\\" with Speedy, Greg and Helmsey at midday, The Sports Zone with Matt Coulter and Kip Keefer in afternoon drive, and the Eli and Stan Show with Eli Gold and Stan White. On June 25, 2013, the Birmingham News reported that the station would drop sports talk for an unannounced format on June 28. On that day, at 2 PM, the station began stunting with Hawaiian music, branded as \\"97.3 Hula FM\\". At midnight on July 4, the stunting switched to patriotic music, branded as \\"The Pledge\\". At 12:45 AM on July 5, the station shifted to adult hits, branded as \\"Y'all 97.3\\". However, \\"Y'all\\" was considered to be another form of stunting, as the station aired little to no on-air imaging, as well as a very short playlist that was repeated every couple of hours. The \\"stunt\\" lasted nearly 4 1/2 months, although the playlist expanded significantly. On November 15, 2013, WZNN began simulcasting on WENN 1320 AM as \\"102.1 Y'all FM\\" (with translator W271BN 102.1 FM), which resulted in the discontinuation of the \\"Power\\" old school hip- hop/R&B; format after nearly two years. The \\"Y'all\\" adult hits format moved to WENN and W271BN on November 21, when WZNN switched to a permanent soft adult contemporary format, branded as \\"Easy 97.3\\". It adopted the call sign WEZZ-FM on November 26, 2013. On October 24, 2014, WEZZ and rival WMJJ flipped to Christmas music within minutes of each other. WEZZ became the third station in the United States to flip to Christmas music during the 2014 holiday season, following WMJJ and WEZW in New Jersey.

Adaptive partitioning, or AP, allows the real-time system designer to request that a percentage of processing resources be reserved for a particular partition (group of threads and/or processes making up a subsystem). The operating system's priority- driven pre-emptive scheduler will behave in the same way that a non-AP system would until the system is overloaded (i.e. system-wide there is more computation to perform than the processor is capable of sustaining over the long term). During overload, the AP scheduler enforces hard limits on total run-time for the subsystems within a partition, as dictated by the allocated percentage of processor bandwidth for the particular partition. If the system is not overloaded, a partition that is allocated (for example) 10% of the processor bandwidth, can, in fact, use more than 10%, as it will borrow from the spare budget of other partitions (but will be required to pay it back later). This is very useful for the non real-time subsystems that experience variable load, since these subsystems can make use of spare budget from hard real-time partitions in order to make more forward progress than they would in a fixed partition scheduler such as ARINC-653, but without impacting the hard real-time subsystems' deadlines. QNX Neutrino 6.3.2 and newer versions have this feature.

Commandos from the National Security Guard (NSG) rescued all 141 hostages of the Indian Airlines Boeing 737, on the ground at Amritsar airport. The lone hijacker, Mohammed Yousuf Shah, was killed within 5 minutes of commandos entering the plane, before he could react and harm any of the hostages. The rescue was code-named Operation Ashwamedh.  Hijacking  Indian Airlines Flight IC427 departed Delhi at 13:57 for Srinagar with 6 crew members and 135 passengers on board. During the flight, a passenger, who first identified himself as Syed Salauddin, claimed that he was carrying pistols and a hand grenade, and asked the plane to be flown to Kabul. At 14:43, the Delhi Air Traffic Control received a message that the plane had been hijacked and was heading for Kabul in Afghanistan. The Lahore Air Traffic Control refused to permit the plane to enter the Pakistani airspace, and the flight returned to India after circling over Lahore. Eventually, the plane landed at Amritsar in India at 15:20. The hijacker demanded refueling, and again asked for the plane to be flown to Kabul. The Crisis Management Group (CMG) at the Cabinet Secretariat of India and the Central Committee at Delhi Airport responded to the situation. The Deputy Commissioner and the Senior Superintendent of Police of the Amritsar district were sent to the airport to negotiate with the hijacker. At 18:00, the Director General of Punjab Police arrived in Amrtisar, and took charge of the negotiation process. However, the hijacker remained adamant on his demand, and even fired a warning shot which pierced through the body of the aircraft. NSG operation The negotiations with the hijacker were done by a member of the CMG a former DGCA and current revenue secretary of India from the Cabinet secretariat. The negotiations continued the whole day long and the hijacker insisted on the aircraft being flown to Pakistan. The negotiator spoke to Pakistan DGCA and they refused entry to the aircraft. The hijacker's request for the aircraft to be flown back to Delhi was also rejected. In the meanwhile, the CMG had moved a crack NSG team from Delhi to Amritsar and positioned it strategically. After the hijacker fired a shot, the negotiator warned the hijacker of dire consequences and asked him to surrender which he refused. The CMG then informed the PM that the aircraft would be stormed. The negotiator then issued the order to the NSG to storm the aircraft and take down the hijacker. The hijacker was surprised by the sudden entry of the commandos into the plane. Before he could react he was taken down. The operation ended in five minutes, at 01:05, without any casualty or injury to any hostage or further damage to the aircraft.  Aftermath  The hijacker, later identified as Jalaluddin alias Mohammed Yunus Shah, was handed over the local police. He succumbed to the pistol shot while being shifted to a hospital. Two loaded 9 mm pistols were recovered from him. The Indian authorities claimed that the hijacker was a member of Hizbul Mujahideen, but the group denied responsibility.

The project to construct the Mittlerer Ring as an autobahn was not carried out, instead the Bundesstraße 2R now covers most of the planned A 999 trajectory. History The urban development plan of 1963 provided for a ring road around Munich. This is referred to in the text only as outer trunk road ring, on the attached map, however, it is shown as a motorway ring. The planned motorway ring was planned much narrower than the later realized Federal Highway 99 and should run almost entirely on Munich city. Only in the south, the ring should be outside the city limits, the local course is therefore not specified in the urban development plan. According to the urban development plan, the ring on Munich's urban area should have the following course: from the BAB Salzburg (today A 8) around the planned relief settlement Perlach, along the peace promenade, west of Munich Riem and in the arc around Johanneskirchen over the Leintalerbrücke to the Nuremberg Motorway (today A 9), from there a bit north over Heidemannstraße and Rathenaustraße north on Fasaneriesee over to a part of a planned motorway ring in Allach and Langwied (Munich), already started before the Second World War, on the already existing Langwieder shamrock Crossing with the BAB Stuttgart (today A 8), continue to Aubing and the planned relief settlement Freiham along the city limits.

Biography  Woizero Wolete was thus the sister of Leul Ras Mengesha Seyoum. She was first married to the much older Dejazmach Gebre Selassie Baria Gebir of Adwa, CBE, Nibure Id of Axum by whom she had a son, Dejazmach Zewde Gebreselassie. She was widowed not long after the birth of her son. She then married Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen in 1931. The marriage of Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen and Crown Princess Wolete Israel was part of Emperor Haile Selassie's efforts at forging closer bonds between the western Tigrean branch of the Imperial family and his own Shewan branch. At the same time that Princess Wolete Israel married the Crown Prince, her cousin (and her father's rival for primacy in Tigray), Dejazmach Haile Selassie Gugsa of the eastern Tigrean branch of the Imperial dynasty was married to the Emperor's daughter Princess Zenebework. It was hoped that these marriages would ensure closer bonds between the two rival princely houses of Tigray with the Emperor's family. Princess Wolete Israel and Prince Asfaw Wossen had a daughter, Princess Ijigayehu. The Crown Prince and Crown Princess separated during their exile from Ethiopia between 1936 and 1941, and the Princess left England where the Imperial family had taken refuge during the Italian occupation. She went with her children to Egypt where she remained for the duration of the exile. The Crown Prince and Crown Princess divorced in 1941, and the Princess never married again. Princess Wolete Israel was a devout member of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, and apparently a talented artist who liked to paint religious paintings and icons. Her grandson, Lij Isaac Fikre Selassie is a noted artist who credits his grandmother as one of his artistic inspirations. The Princess lived quietly in Addis Ababa and the town of Adama during the rule of the Derg. She was the only princess not placed under arrest during their rule.

He founded the Frommer's brand of travel guides. Frommer was born in Jefferson City, Missouri, and moved to Brooklyn, New York when he was 14. He graduated from New York University in 1950 with a political science degree, and graduated with honors from Yale Law School, where he was an editor of the Yale Law Journal, in 1953. Frommer was drafted into the United States Army during the Korean War. Rather than being sent to Korea, he was sent to Europe because of his linguistic abilities. In 1955, while serving in Germany, Frommer wrote and self-published a guidebook called The GI's Guide to Traveling In Europe. It sold out its first print run. In 1957 Frommer followed up with a civilian version called Europe on 5 Dollars a Day, which covered major European urban destinations. It also sold out its first run of 5,000 copies. In 1962, Frommer founded tour operator $5-a-Day Tours, Inc. He left the practice of law in 1962 to pursue his travel business, Arthur Frommer International, Inc., of which he was chairman and president until 1981. Frommer's writing was not restricted to travel. He wrote The Bible and the Public Schools, published in 1963, a defense of that year's Supreme Court decision banning compulsory Bible reading in public schools. He authored the book \\"Goldwater From A to Z\\", published in 1964, an argument against Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater in the 1964 United States presidential election. In 1969, Frommer built a hotel in Amsterdam, now known as the Hotel Mercure Amsterdam Arthur Frommer, and part of the Accor group. Frommer sold the travel guide book business to Simon & Schuster in 1977, it changed hands a few times, and Frommer eventually reacquired the rights. In the 1980s, he published Frommer's New World of Travel, which advocated alternative vacation styles, and founded Budget Travel magazine, which he sold to Newsweek. He briefly ventured into general bargain shopping in 2005-2006 with the quarterly magazine Arthur Frommer's Smart Shopping. He writes a travel column syndicated through King Features Syndicate.

A student of Karl Straube, Max Reger's close friend and acknowledged premier performer of his works, Fleischer was a member of the late romantic school of organ playing. Many of his students have become great performers and teachers worldwide. Fletcher's father acquiesced to his son's desire to attend the conservatory on the condition that he complete a PhD in musicology at the university, which would allow him to teach, should the performing career prove to provide too little as an income. Fleischer graduated from the Leipzig Conservatory in 1934. For organists, this was the finest school in Germany. Karl Straube invited him to come back as his teaching colleague and intended successor three years after Fleischer graduated. At the age of 25, Fleischer was the youngest professor at the Conservatory. Despite his position, Fleischer was called up for service in the German army in WW II. Serving in the signal corps of the German army in Russia, much of his time was spent at a typewriter, fortunate, given his lack of skill with a rifle. In December 1941 a transport vehicle in which he was riding overturned. Fleischer suffered injuries that required the complete amputation of the fourth finger and half of the fifth of his left hand. Although he maintained his church position, playing with right hand and pedal, he believed his career was over. However, in 1945 while reading proofs from C.F. Peters at the piano with Karl Straube for a new edition of Bach's organ works, Straube noticed that it might be possible for Fleischer to return to a performing career. He urged him to begin practicing again. After the war, Fleischer re-taught himself to play the organ with his remaining fingers. He played his first complete recital after the injury in July 1945. He was one of those instrumental in reestablishing the organ program in postwar DDR. Fleischer prepared a collection of pieces by a variety of composers, early and modern that were easy enough for amateurs to play in church services under the title, 73 leichte Choralvorspiele. The anthology was published by F.E.C. Leuckart, Munich. After Fleischer emigrated to the United States, at the instigation of Edward Klammer, he produced a version for American Lutherans under the title The Parish Organist, and published by Concordia Publishing House, St Louis, Mo. In the United States, first he was organist and professor of music at Valparaiso University. Subsequently, he was at the University of Chicago, and then at the University of Minnesota. While still a professor at the University of Minnesota, Fleischer took on the role of organist at The First Unitarian Society in Minneapolis. He stated that he was probably the only Unitarian, Marxist organist in the Twin Cities who was also a direct descendant of Martin Luther. While in Germany his careful preparation of scores for performance resulted in many carefully hand-copied editions ranging from Praetorius through the Bach Kunst der Fuge to the large works of Max Reger. Some of these performing editions were later published by Concordia Publishing House. This pains-taking attention to detail, when shared with students, allowed many to play works that would otherwise have been beyond their technical abilities. The majority of these scores and other papers are now in the library at Dr Martin Luther College in New Ulm, Minnesota and the library of the Hochschule für Musik at the University of Leipzig.

In her career she passed through five successive owners, managers and names. Alfhem is her fourth name and the one by which she is most widely known. In 1954 the CIA was engineering a coup d'état in Guatemala to replace the elected civilian government of President Jacobo Arbenz with a military dictator, Colonel Carlos Castillo. Since 1951 the US had withheld arms supplies to the Guatemalan government, and in 1953 the US blocked Guatemalan government attempts to buy arms from Canada, Germany and Rhodesia. In the spring of 1954 Guatemala bought 2,000 tons of arms and ammunition from the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and used Alfhem to ship them to Puerto Barrios, Guatemala. The US regarded Alfhems success in evading US sea and air patrols to deliver the munitions as a setback. However, it did not prevent the CIA from executing Operation PBSuccess against Guatemala. Owners and names The ship was launched as Guldborg by the Odense Staalskibsværft A/S in Odense, Denmark for Dampskibsselsk Dannebrog of Copenhagen and completed in February 1930. In 1933 she was sold to Norwegian owners who renamed her Höegh Trader and placed her under the management of Leif Höegh & Co. In 1936 she was sold again, this time to Skibs A/S \\"Gausdal\\" of Odense who renamed her Gausdal. In 1953 she was sold to a Swedish company, Ångbåts AB Bohusländska kusten, who named her Alfhem and registered her in Uddevalla. In 1960 she was sold again to new owners, who renamed her Antonos V. Arms to Guatemala In Spring 1954 Alfhem loaded her Czech weapons cargo in the Baltic port of Szczecin in Poland. She then took a zig-zag course first towards Dakar in French West Africa (now Senegal), then across the Atlantic towards Curaçao in the Dutch West Indies, later re-directed to Puerto Cortés, Honduras. Finally a radio message to her Master revealed her true destination to be Puerto Barrios in Guatemala. She docked at Puerto Barrios, northeast of Guatemala City, on 15 May 1954. In an attempt to conceal her use for the arms shipment to Guatemala, the Czechoslovak government had paid for a \\"straw charter\\" of the vessel via a British firm, E.E. Dean, of London. According to a US State Department document, Dean served \\"as a dummy in the transaction, holding a ‘straw charter’ in order to justify transfer of Czech sterling funds to Sweden.\\" According to both the UK and the US Embassy in London, Dean did not hold control over the charter, but rather an \\"agent for Czekofracht, the state transport monopoly\\". Another deception was the falsification of the ship's bill of lading which declared that the cargo was composed entirely of items such as shovels, nails, machine tools, laboratory glass, etc., rather than the estimated 2,000 tons of weaponry and munitions that were its principal components. Alfhem delivered 2,000 tons of arms and ammunition, more than all Central America had received in the previous 30 years. According to the 1954 Time magazine account, the weapons allegedly worth $10 million, were thought to be from Czechoslovakia's famous Škoda munitions works and were believed to be primarily rifles, automatic arms, mortars and light artillery. Described in the ship's manifest as \\"steel rods, optical glass and laboratory supplies\\", the weapons were packed in 15,000 cases. Under the supervision of the country’s Defense Minister, the weapons were unloaded from Alfhem and loaded onto freight cars on the-US controlled International Railways of Central America (IRCA) for shipment to the capital away. Protected by armed guards, the weapons made their way to their destination. Rebel and US reaction Anti-government rebels tried to stop the arms shipment by dynamiting a railway trestle just as the munitions train crossed. However, a downpour of rain drenched the fuses and the dynamite did not detonate as planned. A gun battle followed in which one government soldier and one rebel were killed. The CIA's chief of clandestine operations, Frank Wisner, was annoyed that the U.S. Navy failed to intercept Alfhem — that is, \\"until he realized that the shipment of... weaponry was just the excuse the United States needed to intervene.\\" The US Joint Chiefs of Staff held an emergency session to discuss whether or not to deploy US troops to Honduras to assist if the country were attacked by Guatemala. The 21 May 1954 minutes from the Pentagon meeting illustrate how the then US Army chief of staff, Gen. Matthew Ridgway opposed this plan and recommended instead that Nicaraguan Gen. Anastasio Somoza García's national guard be sent to Guatemala. One state Department official objected, noting that Somoza had told US diplomats that his own armed forces were simply an internal police force and therefore \\"incompetent.\\" to carry out an armed intervention in another country. On 24 May the US Navy's Caribbean Sea Frontier launched Operation HARDROCK BAKER: air and sea patrols in the Gulf of Honduras, ostensibly \\"to protect Honduras from invasion and to control arms shipments to Guatemala.\\" The US \\"began airlifting arms to Nicaragua and Honduras, to restore the balance of power.\\" By 3 June, the US had airlifted weapons to Honduras. By 18 June, the US called for a complete arms embargo against Guatemala. US fear of further arms shipments to Guatemala remained high, and to disastrous effect. On the morning of 27 June 1954 a CIA-operated P-38M Lightning flying over Puerto San José destroyed the British cargo ship with napalm bombs, because the CIA officer in local command of the insurgent \\"Liberation Air Force\\" believed she was unloading weapons.

As a founder of Dokkyo UniversityEarly life Nishi was born in Tsuwano Domain of Iwami Province (present day Tsuwano city, Shimane Prefecture) as the son of a samurai physician who practiced Chinese medicine. In 1853, after studying Confucianism at his domain school and in Osaka, Nishi was sent to Edo to study rangaku, with the goal of becoming an interpreter for conducting business with the outside world via Dutch traders based at Dejima in Nagasaki, his duties also included the translation of European books into Japanese for review by a select group of government officials within the Tokugawa bakufu. In 1854 Nishi, as well as several fellow Japanese intellectuals of the time, denounced the Japanese feudal system and their samurai status in favor of a pursuit of Western studies, as these intellectuals believed that the Japanese feudal system was incompatible with Western studies. Nishi was then appointed by the government as a Yogakusha or specialist scholar of Western learning. Aside from Nishi, the Yogakusha included Fukuzawa Yukichi, Mori Arinori, and Nakamura Masanao, who were all schooled in kangaku, a kind of traditional Chinese learning. Later, in 1857, Nishi was appointed a professor at the Bansho Shirabesho. With increasing foreign pressure on Japan to end its national isolation policy, in 1862 the Shogunate decided to send Nishi and Tsuda Mamichi to the Netherlands to learn western concepts of political science, constitutional law, and economics. They departed in 1863 with a Dutch physician Dr. J. L. C. Pompe van Meerdervoort, who had set up the first teaching hospital for western medicine in Nagasaki. The two Japanese students were put in the care of Professor Simon Vissering, who taught Political Economy, Statistics and Diplomatic History at the University of Leyden. They developed a genuine friendship with Vissering who was conscious of the long- standing friendship between Japan and the Netherlands. He felt that the students' desire for knowledge would make them likely future participants in Japan's modernization. Vissering, a member of La Vertu Lodge No, 7, Leyden introduced them to Freemasonry, of which they became the first Japanese adherents on October 20, 1864.Australian National Library: MS 6681, Papers of Harold S. Williams (1898-1987) §42, Freemasonry Meiji philosopher Nishi returned to Japan in 1865, and was an active participant in the Meiji Restoration. He promoted contact with the West and Western intellectualism because he feared that in the long run, a domestic resistance to modernization and change in relation to contact with the West would be more destructive to Japan than any plausible repercussions of contact with the West. While abroad, Nishi became enthralled with Western philosophy and discerned that this intellectual pursuit subsisted at the foundation of Western civilization, and thus upon his return, he aimed to spread the Western Philosophy he came into contact with in order to help bridge the intellectual gap between the East and the West. Nishi brought back to Japan the philosophies of positivism, utilitarianism and empiricism, which he transmitted through his writing, lectures and participation in Mori Arinori's Meirokusha, and contributed numerous articles to its journal. Through Nishi’s transmissions, positivism was able to thrive in Meiji Japan because it gave the Japanese people a chance for stabilization and understanding in a society and culture that was undergoing rapid revolutionary change. To Nishi, positivism was the Western counterpart to Eastern practical studies (jitsugaku), with an emphasis on a hierarchy of knowledge similar to that of Confucianism. Nishi’s translations of utilitarianism were also taken to well during the restoration period because utilitarianism promotes the social over the individual, which is a concept that is easily reconcilable with a Confucian-trained mind in Meiji Japan. Utilitarianism also assisted Japanese modernization because Nishi and others have applied it to the justification of an industrial and commercial economy. As for empiricism, Nishi and the rest of the Yogakusha intellectuals became leading figures in the Meiji Enlightenment (bummei kaika, i.e. \\"civilization and enlightenment\\" ), in which they promoted empiricism and practical studies instead of abstract reasoning in order for each person to attain an understanding of truth. In 1868, Nishi translated and published \\"International Law\\". He also published an encyclopedia, The Hyakugaku Renkan, patterned after the French encyclopedia of Auguste Comte, while promoting the teachings of John Stuart Mill. Nishi’s encyclopedia essentially classified and categorized the intellectual realm of Western civilization, including topics such as literature, natural sciences, mathematics, theology, and politics. One of Nishi’s most significant topics in his encyclopedia was the importance of the study of history, as he believed history was an objective, scholarly discipline that was necessary for the understanding of all human relations and interactions. In this way, learning should not just be for learning’s sake, as it does not serve a greater purpose if it is just to learn. This argument stood in direct contradiction to the Confucian denial of the study of history as a progress of human events. Subsequently, the most distinguished topic of Nishi’s encyclopedia is his elaboration on philosophy. Nishi split the study philosophy into numerous subtopics, citing logic as the most important. He rejected the deductive method traditionally used by Confucian scholars in favor of inductive logic as a more scientific way of learning. In 1873, Nishi helped to found Japan’s first scholarly society for solely academics (and not politics) known as the Meiji Six Society. The goals of this society were to educate and enlighten the people because they believed Japan needed an enlightened populace in order to understand and live up to its political and moral responsibilities of modernization and restoration. Nishi felt that if the new state were to become enlightened as it should be, there would be no more conflict between political and scholarly obligations within the Meiji Six Society, and within Japanese society in general. Nishi was unique in this society in that he maintained a view of Japanese modernization in which he reconciled traditional Confucianism with Western Philosophy and pragmatism together in order to ascertain the correct path for Japan to take. In his Hyakuichi-Shinron, published in 1874, he went so far as to reject Confucian ethics altogether as no longer appropriate for Japan, but was careful not to reject Japanese heritage. This publication was an original piece of Nishi scholarship that dealt with two main topics: the separation of politics and morals, and the distinction between human and physical principles. In regards to the first topic, Nishi felt that the later Confucians who presumed that self-cultivation was all that was necessary for ruling society were wrong, but that the original Confucians who proclaimed that the morality taught had practical application in society were right. What is more is that Nishi portrayed Confucius as a teacher of politics with a sideline of morality. Nishi attempted to sever the philosophical connection between morality and politics because he thought that although they obtained the same objective – to better people’s lives – they used different methods to obtain this objective, stemming from his belief that rightness was at the base of law, whereas goodness was at the base of morality. To Nishi, morality is an omnipresent thing existing within every human activity, but law is strictly limited to its defined aspects of human relations. Though morality must rely on the law within politics to keep order, it is morality, rather than the law, that will eventually penetrate and shape the people’s minds and values. Nishi concludes this first topic with the idea that when it comes to civilization, politics is the machinery and morality is the lubricant that is responsible for keeping the machinery running and intact. In the second topic, Nishi determines, for the first time in the East, the relationship and differences between human principles and physical principles. He discerns that physical principles and laws are a priori prerequisites for the existence of society, whereas human principles and laws are a posteriori devices derived from these physical principles and laws. Because human principles are a posteriori, they have infinite possibilities of distinctions and greater flexibility in premonitions. Nishi considers morality and law to be human principles; however, that does not mean that he deems morality man-made; rather, there are feelings (not unlike the Mencian Sprouts) that exist in all humans, and it is up to human will to act upon those feelings of morality that are constant in human nature. What Nishi’s discernment led to was the first expression in the East that human society was not, in fact, a product of the invariable structure of the universe. In this way, Nishi opened up room for humans to divert the inevitability of the social hierarchy. In Jinsei Sampo Setsu (1875) he urged all Japanese to seek the goals of health, knowledge and wealth, or what he called the “three treasures,\\"in place of Confucian subservience and frugality. In order for society to maintain a balance of these three treasures, Nishi felt that individuals should not disrespect others’ treasures, and that individuals should assist others in acquiring their treasures, thus, if the three treasures were honored and preserved, all of society would be independent and free. Moreover, Nishi thought that the Japanese government should be responsible for promoting the pursuit of these three treasures in society as well, and in turn, the political and national strengthening within the Meiji Enlightenment would not require Western rule or governmental tactics. Nishi promoted that if policy were structured based on enhancing general happiness through an equal balance of domestic enforcement of law, diplomacy and military defense of society, encouragement of industry and finance, and obtainment of the state’s own three treasures, this would be the key to good government. Meiji bureaucrat While working at the Ministry of Military Affairs, Nishi helped in drafting the Conscription Ordinance of 1873, which introduced universal conscription and laid the foundation for the Imperial Japanese Army. In his lectures to the military, he emphasized discipline and obedience over seniority and hierarchy. These ideals found their way into the subsequent Imperial Rescript to Soldiers and Sailors in 1882. In 1879 Nishi was made the head of the Tokyo Academy, and by 1882 was a member of the Genrōin. He became a member of the House of Peers of the Diet of Japan after the 1890 Japanese general election. He was ennobled with the title of danshaku (baron) in the kazoku peerage system. His grave is at Aoyama Cemetery in Tokyo. Legacy Nishi Amane Nishi Amane is considered to be the father of Western philosophy in Japan. Nishi was a tireless advocate of Western civilization as a role model for Japan's modernization, stressing the need to evolve without losing the Japanese character. He was responsible for using classical Chinese terminology to translate and/or transmit common terms used in Western Philosophy into Eastern dialect, and many of these philosophical words are currently in use today.Marra, Michael F. (2002). By using classical Chinese terminology, that is, something of cultural importance and tradition to Meiji Japan, Nishi was able to generate enthusiasm for reform, as traditional Chinese characters were seen by the Eastern population as a notion of authority. Furthermore, it is the nature of Chinese characters to be combined in various ways to form neologisms, as the characters often obtain multiple meanings and are capable of interchangeability. The most notable term that Nishi was responsible for is the term (in Japan, or zhéxué in China), which he coined in 1873, taken from the characters meaning \\"wisdom\\" and \\"learning\\". Tetsugaku is the first known recording of an Eastern term representing the notion of philosophy, which Nishi referred to as “the study of human nature and the principles of things.”;). Nishi originally used , or \\"(the science of) seeking clarity\\", as opposed to the classical Chinese term , which means \\"to seek wisdom\\" Raud, Rein. (2014). \\"What is Japanese about Japanese Philosophy?\\" In Rethinking “Japanese Studies, ed.by Mayuko Sano and Liu Jianhui. Kyoto: Nichibunken. (xīxián, in Chinese, more specifically means “learning to become a wise and knowledgeable person.”) Though Nishi felt that Confucius for the East was comparable to Socrates for the West, in creating this term tetsugaku, Nishi was actually attempting to separate the notion of Western philosophy from the notion of Eastern thought, as he believed the two to entail two different things. Moreover, Nishi did not concur that philosophy even existed in the East, as he studied philosophy solely in the context of the Western style. However, regardless of Nishi’s personal beliefs on the definition of “philosophy”, it is still because of him that China and Japan have even been able to engage in the discourse of “philosophy.” In Hyakugaku Renkan, Nishi concluded that because the discourse of philosophy is innately concerned with addressing and attacking theories of past writers and philosophers in order to portray new discoveries, the field of philosophy is constantly being made over. Under this light, Nishi opens up the possibility of vast Eastern participation in the discourse of philosophy, regardless of whether or not Eastern thought can be reconciled with Western Philosophy. During his time, Nishi concurred that although the West was superior in the realm of philosophy, the East still had the means to become better equipped in philosophy, as he professed that philosophy was essential for making the East intellectually modernized. He was honored on a 10-yen commemorative postage stamp in Japan in 1952.

Loop recorded three albums, the last of which, A Gilded Eternity (1990), made the UK Albums Chart. Following the band's breakup, Hampson formed the experimental project Main with Scott Dawson. Music career After Loop disbanded, Hampson formed the more experimental Main with fellow Loop member Scott Dowson, releasing several albums and EPs on Beggars Banquet Records. Although a strong signature in the early material of Main, the guitar was slowly eroded from the stable sounds Hampson and Dowson produced, together with field recordings and other electro-acoustic sounds. When Dowson left the line-up in 1996, Main became a solo project for Hampson, who then abandoned the guitar altogether, feeling he had taken the instrument to such extremes that there was no longer any scope to create with it. Between 1999-2003, he formed the electroacoustic duo Comae with Janek Schaefer touring in Europe, US, Japan, and released their self titled album on Rhiz Records. He deactivated Main as a project in 2006, in an attempt to free himself of the restraints of critical and fan-based reviews, that still mentioned the guitar as the focal point of the material, even though he had not used it in many years. He was quoted in interviews as saying the guitar was a chain around his neck, and he was unhappy to be still so strongly associated with it. Preferring to now explore other avenues of sound and its diffusion, especially multichannel systems for live performances, Hampson was invited by the Groupe de Recherches Musicales (GRM) in Paris to compose and perform on many occasions. He has also been associated with like-minded organisations and institutes around the world, exploring intricacies in sound composition.

Previously called Saint Bernard College, it closed its doors as a college in 1979. However, today the institution is a preparatory school with 160 or so students with 60 or so rooming on the large farm based religious community of Benedictine monks. History Saint Bernard College had been conferring degrees since 1893 as a college preparatory school. Between 1948 and 1953, the Board of Trustees worked on expanding the institution to four-year-college status; the first class graduated in 1955. Saint Bernard College then received its accreditation as a senior college the next year from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and operated until 1979. It served the secondary-educational needs of hundreds in the baby- boom generation. Many students arriving from the Greater Philadelphia area, New Jersey, Michigan, Georgia, New York state, Knoxville,TN finding this rural college ideal for their college experience. The college preparatory program was disbanded in 1962 and St Bernard college was formed. Some of its history in the 1960s included a Judo team nationally ranked against some of the largest universities in the USA. The varsity basketball teams were excellent with star players from as far north as Michigan. In 1968 the team, prior to the current third-point line, won the Alabama state championship with a score over 120 points with the Dolan brothers and the team leader scorer Paul Lyons, he later became a New York Hall of Fame Coaches Assoc. member. Noteworthy, in the late sixties a very popular student,Chick Loftus, from the Philadelphia, Pa area, he 'walked on' as one of the few non-scholarship players on that great 1968 champion team. The Judo team founder, a student Larry Ventura, while holding a non-black belt only, the rank of Second degree Brown belt encouraged many young students with his master of the art of judo followed his ideals and love of Kodakan Judo. In the fall of 1967 Robert (Bob) Bennett, Brown belt, one of the many students from the Greater Philadelphia, PA area replaced founder Ventura as the Head Instructor and Captain of the 1968 Judo Team. The golf team was ranked nationally in the NAIA Men's Championship in 1971. The soccer teams of the 1960s were highly competitive with varsity players, such as Manny Martinese, Kevin Kelly (New Jersey), Larry Lenzi and additionally, the soccer team gained national ranking in NAIA especially after recruiting Neil O'Donoghue in 1972 who later went on to play football for Auburn University and in the NFL. Several books have been penned in telling true history of this small Alabama college include the full true story of the 1968 Basketball championship teams as well as fictional works, currently in the editing stage,such as,\\" We Boys, We Saints, We Men\\" and a college reunion- oriented short story entitled \\" We Are Saints Still\\" both co-author by Bob Bennett SBC'68, both loosely based on the 1960/70 students and their campus lives. Changing its name once again, Southern Benedictine College officially closed on May 13, 1979. St. Bernard Preparatory School was reopened in 1984 on the Southern Benedictine campus and currently has a very promising private high school and seminarian. The prep school received its accreditation in 1995. References * St. Bernard Preparatory School: A History. St. Bernard Preparatory School. Accessed June 9, 2006.

The most distinguishing feature is the upturned snout, used for digging in sandy soils. The color pattern is extremely variable. It can be red, green, orange, brown, gray to black, or any combination thereof depending on locality. They can be blotched, checkered, or patternless. The belly tends to be a solid gray, yellow, or cream-colored. In this species the underside of the tail is lighter than the belly.Conant, R. 1975.

Venom Although H. platirhinos is rear-fanged, it is often considered nonvenomous because it is not harmful to humans. Heterodon means \\"different tooth\\", which refers to the enlarged teeth at the rear of the upper jaw. These teeth inject a mild amphibian-specific venom into prey.

Conservation status This species is classified as Least Concern (LC) on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (Year assessed: 2007). However, it is a species of increasing conservation concern, especially in the northeastern part of its range.NEPARC. 2010. Northeast amphibian and reptile species of regional responsibility and conservation concern. Northeast Partners in Amphibian and Reptile Conservation (NEPARC) Publication 2010-1. Of the five states in the northeast U.S. where the eastern hognose snake occurs, it currently has \\"listed\\" conservation status in four (Connecticut, New Hampshire, New York, and Rhode Island). Noted declines are believed to be the result of direct anthropogenic pressures including habitat loss and fragmentation, road mortality, environmental degradation, and intentional killing.Gibbons, J.W., Scott, D.E., Ryan, T.J., Buhlmann, K.A., Tuberville, T.D., Metts, B.S., Greene, J.L., Mills, T., Leiden, Y., Poppy, S., and C.T. Winne. 2000. The global decline of reptiles, déjà vu amphibians. BioScience 50: 653-666. Defensive behavior When threatened, the neck is flattened and the head is raised off the ground, not unlike a cobra. They also hiss and will strike, but they do not attempt to bite. The result can be likened to a high speed head-butt. If this threat display does not work to deter a would-be predator, a hognose snake will often roll onto its back and play dead, going so far as to emit a foul musk from its cloaca and let its tongue hang out of its mouth. Feeding The Eastern hognose snake feeds extensively on amphibians, and has a particular fondness for toads. This snake has resistance to the toxins toads secrete. This immunity is thought to come from enlarged adrenal glands which secrete large amounts of hormones to counteract the toads' powerful skin poisons. At the rear of each upper jaw, they have greatly enlarged teeth, which are neither hollow nor grooved, with which they puncture and deflate toads to be able to swallow them whole.Smith, H.M., and E.D.

Captivity Eastern hognose snakes are occasionally available in the exotic pet trade, but due to their specific dietary requirements, they are not as readily available as other species. Generally, they refuse feeder rodents unless they are scented with amphibians. In Canada, Eastern hognose snakes are considered to be a species-at-risk (COSEWIC designation: Threatened), and consequently capture or harassment of these animals, including their captive trade, is illegal. These snakes live for approximately 12 years. They shed their skin periodically to grow and develop. Reproduction Eastern hognose snakes mate in April and May. The females, which lay 8 - 40 eggs (average about 25) in June or early July, do not take care of the eggs or young. The eggs, which measure about , hatch after about 60 days, from late July to September. The hatchlings are long.Schmidt, K.P., and D.D. Davis. 1941.

The restaurant stands on Calea Victoriei at the corner of Edgar Quinet Street, across from the Hotel Capitol and diagonally across from the Cercul Militar Naţional.  The restaurant, confectionery, and coffee house  In 1852, Anton and Vasile Capșa founded the first confectionery shop on Calea Victoriei, somewhat north of the present Casa Capșa, which was founded by their younger brother Grigore Capșa (1841-1902) in 1868. Anton and Vasile had financed Grigore through four years of courses at the renowned Boissier in Paris, where he turned down an opportunity to become the supplier for the French Imperial Court.Mioara Ioniță, cited at The Capşa Coffee House on Radio Romania International. Accessed March 17, 2006. The French-inspired confectionery of Casa Capșa soon established a continent-wide reputation. The business expanded in 1881 to a full-service restaurant, at a time when quality restaurants along Western European lines were still quite a rarity in Romania. In December 1916, during World War I, following the Battle of Bucharest and the occupation of the city by the Central Powers, the restaurant was requisitioned by troops of the Kingdom of Bulgaria's army. Reportedly, these left the place in a deplorable condition for an extended period of time.

Tudor Arghezi referred to it as an \\"Academy\\"; one could make a literary reputation by reading one's texts there.

When the Romanian Communist Party took power in 1948, they closed Casa Capșa. The restaurant operated during most of the communist era as the \\"Bucharest Restaurant\\", regaining the Capșa name in 1984.

The pogrom took place during the early stages of the Karabakh movement. On February 27, 1988, mobs of ethnic Azerbaijanis formed into groups and attacked and killed Armenians on the streets and in their apartments; widespread looting and a general lack of concern from police officers allowed the violence to continue for three days. On February 28, a small contingent of Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) troops entered the city and unsuccessfully attempted to quell the rioting. More professional military units entered with tanks and armored personnel vehicles one day later. Government forces imposed a state of martial law and curfew and brought the crisis to an end. The official death toll released by the Prosecutor General of the USSR (tallies were compiled based on lists of named victims) was 32 people (26 Armenians and 6 Azerbaijanis), although other estimates reach up into the hundreds of victims. The violence in Sumgait was unexpected and was widely covered in the Western press. It was greeted with general astonishment in Armenia and the rest of the Soviet Union since ethnic feuds in the country had been largely suppressed by the government, which had promoted policies such as proletarian internationalism, fraternity of peoples, and socialist patriotism to avert such conflicts. The massacre, together with the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, presented a major challenge to the reforms being implemented by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Gorbachev was later criticized for his perceived slowness in reacting to the crisis. Because of the scale of atrocities against the Armenians as an ethnic group the pogrom was immediately linked to the Armenian Genocide of 1915 in the Armenian national consciousness. A number of international and Soviet sources also describes the events as genocide of the Armenian population.Glasnost: : Vol. 2, Issue 1, Center for Democracy (New York, N.Y.) – 1990, p. 62, cit. 'The massacre of Armenians in Sumgait, the heinous murders in Tbilisi—these killings are examples of genocide directed by the Soviet regime against its own people.', an announcement by USSR Journalists' UnionTime of change: an insider's view of Russia's transformation, Roy Medvedev, Giulietto Chiesa – 1991 – p. 209 The Sumgait pogrom is commemorated every year on February 28 in Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh, and among the Armenian diaspora. Background Sumgait (Sumqayit) is located about 30 kilometers (approximately ) northwest of Azerbaijan's capital Baku, near the Caspian Sea. The city of Sumgait is located near the coast of the Caspian Sea, only thirty kilometers north of the capital Baku. It had been renovated in the 1960s and had become a leading industrial city, second after Baku by its industrial importance, with oil refineries and petrochemical plants built during that era. Its population in the 1960s stood at 60,000, but by the late 1980s it had swollen to over 223,000 (with an Armenian population of about 17,000), and overcrowding among other social problems plagued the city. While there was a high rate of unemployment and poverty among the Azerbaijani residents, the Armenians comprised mainly the working and educated sector of the town's population. The political and economic reforms that General Secretary Gorbachev had initiated in 1985 saw a marked decentralization of Soviet authority. Armenians, in both Armenia proper and Nagorno-Karabakh, viewed Gorbachev's reform program as an opportunity to unite the two entities together. On February 20, 1988, tens of thousands of Armenians gathered to demonstrate in Stepanakert's Lenin (now Renaissance) Square to demand that the region be joined to Armenia. On the same day, the Supreme Soviet of Nagorno- Karabakh voted to join the Armenian SSR, a move staunchly opposed by the Soviet Azerbaijani authorities. Gorbachev rejected these claims, invoking Article 78 of the Soviet Constitution, which stated that republics' borders could not be altered without their prior consent. The vote by the Council and the subsequent protests were condemned also by the state-run Soviet media; however, they resonated more loudly among Azerbaijanis. As journalist Thomas de Waal wrote in his 2003 book on the conflict, after the appeal of the Council \\"the slow descent into armed conflict began on the first day.\\" Rallies and fuelling of anti-Armenian sentiments A map of Sumgait shows a section of the city's apartment districts, notable landmarks, and main streets. The rallies in Armenia were countered by demonstrations in Baku, during which time strong anti-Armenian sentiments were voiced by citizens and officials alike. One such statement came on February 14, 1988, when the head of the department of Central Committee of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan Asadov, declared \\"a hundred thousand Azerbaijanis are ready to storm Artsakh (Karabakh) at any time and organize a slaughter there.\\" According to Adam Schiff, in the days leading up to the massacre, a leader of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan, Hidayat Orujov, warned Armenians in Sumgait: \\"If you do not stop campaigning for the unification of Nagorno Karabakh with Armenia, if you don't sober up, 100,000 Azeris from neighboring districts will break into your houses, torch your apartments, rape your women, and kill your children.\\". This however was later denied by Orujov himself who in his interview stated that not only he had never publicly made any statements aimed at igniting inter-ethnic conflict, but also he was not present in Sumgait and was not holding any political role at the time. On February 26 several minor rallies were held at Lenin Square in Sumgait. Explicit calls for violence against Armenians and for their expulsion from Azerbaijan were heard and the crowds were agitated by news of Azerbaijani refugees who had fled Armenia (from the towns Kapan and Masis). Certain individuals told stories of murders and violence purportedly carried out by Armenians against the Azerbaijanis. Soviet authorities would later cast these individuals as agents provocateur. One individual, according to the Soviet press, was later revealed not to be a resident of Kapan, as he had claimed, but a criminal with a prior arrest record. Zardusht Alizadeh, who was active in the social and political life of Azerbaijan from 1988–1989 and was one of the founders of Azerbaijani Popular Front, visited Sumgait ten days after the pogrom and met with the workers from the aluminum factory, and reported that locals said that people from out of town had been inciting the violence. Baku's local Party leader Fuad Musayev, who was called back to Baku because of the unrest, stated in the interview given to Thomas de Waal, \\"Someone was provoking them, propaganda work was going on.\\"Thomas De Waal Ch. 2, p. 31 The demonstrations in the Lenin Square were concluded with strong anti-Armenian sentiments. During the demonstrations there were apparent threats and accusations against the Armenians for distorting the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan. The Armenians were also blamed for being much better-off than most of the Azerbaijanis in Sumgait. Slogans such as \\"Death to Armenians!\\" and \\"Armenians get out of our city\\" were being voiced.Krivopuskov V. V. Мятежный Карабах. Из дневника офицера МВД СССР. Издание второе, дополненное. — М.: Голос-Пресс, 2007. — 384 с. Ил. Newspaper «НОВОЕ ВРЕМЯ» N9 21 89 There were also many public figures attending the rallies, among them the head of public school No: 25, an actress of the Arablinski theatre, Azerbaijani poet Khydyr Alovlu (a strong supporter of Heydar Aliyev) and others, who called for Armenians to be expelled from Azerbaijan or killed. Almost each speech was concluded with the slogan \\"Death to Armenians!\\". Since the speakers used microphones these calls were heard not only in the square but also in the nearby streets. Efforts to calm the crowd were made by Azerbaijani figures such as secretary of the city party committee Bayramova and poet Bakhtiyar Vahabzadeh, who addressed the crowd atop a platform. V. Huseinov, the director of the Institute of Political Education in Azerbaijan, also attempted to calm them by assuring them that Karabakh would remain within the republic and that the refugees stories were false. He in turn was heckled with insults and forced to step down.Rost, Yuri. The Armenian Tragedy: An Eye-Witness Account of Human Conflict and Natural Disaster in Armenia and Azerbaijan. New York: St. Martin's Press, 1990, p. 27. . Jahangir Muslimzade, Sumgait's first secretary, spoke to the crowd, and told them to allow Armenians to leave of their own accord. But according to witnesses, this message served to agitate the crowd. Shortly after his speech, at around 6:30 pm, Muslimzade was handed a flag of the Azerbaijan SSR and soon found himself leading the crowd. According to Muslimzade, he was attempting to lead the crowd away from the Armenian district and toward the sea, but many Armenians saw this act as implicating him as a leader of the riot. The crowd, in any case, dispersed and several groups made for the Armenian district. Radio broadcast Another factor that may have ignited the violence was an announcement of the murder of two Azerbaijanis. On February 27, Soviet Deputy Federal Procurator, Aleksandr Katusev, announced on Baku Radio and Central Television, that two Azerbaijani youths, Bakhtiyar Guliyev and Ali Hajiyev, were killed in a clash between Armenians and Azerbaijanis near Agdam several days earlier One of the youths was killed by an Azerbaijani police officer, but Katusev neglected to mention that and would later receive a stinging rebuke for revealing the nationalities of the young men. The secretive nature the Soviet Union was still attempting to shake off led many Azerbaijanis to believe that there was something more nefarious to Katusev's report than he let on. Pogrom and atrocities Most of the weapons during the attacks were sharpened metal objects said to be produced in the city's industrial plants. The pogrom of the Armenian population of Sumgait started on the evening of February 27, one week after the appeal of the Council of People's Deputies to unify Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia and according to many sources was a direct response to the Council's decision.Cox and Eibner. \\"Ethnic Cleansing in Progress: War in Nagorno Karabakh\\" Zurich: Institute for Religious Minorities in the Islamic World, 1993 . The perpetrators targeted the victims based solely on ethnicity — being Armenian was the only criterion.De Waal \\"Black Garden\\"Session of Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, February 29, 1988. \\"Sumgait: Evidence given by witnesses and relatives of victims of pogroms\\".

Cobbles were brought into the city to block and limit access and exit from the town; the perpetrators had previously obtained the list of addresses of the Armenian residents of the city.Excerpt from the indictment in the criminal case 18/60233 on charges of Ahmad Imani ogly Ahmаdov, Ilham Azat ogly Ismailov and Yavar Giyas ogly Jafarov. Moscow, Nov. 1988, The Supreme Court of USSR. \\"I reckon they knew the addresses of the Armenians in advance. I came to this conclusion because the pogrom-makers were entering precisely the buildings were Armenians lived. In reality, they knew all the addresses, they were acting unmistakably. And all that was not out of hooligan intentions, that was an action specifically against the Armenian people, against Armenians. Not against Russians or other nations, but against Armenians. They were looking particularly for Armenians...\\" Warnings by Azerbaijanis sympathetic to their Armenian neighbors instructed them to leave their lights on the night of the 27th; those who shut them off would be assumed to be Armenian. According to several Armenian witnesses and Soviet military personnel, alcohol and anasha, a term referring to narcotics, were brought in trucks and distributed to the crowds, although such accounts were not reported in the media. According to de Waal, the fact that the attackers were armed with homemade weapons that would have taken some time and effort to manufacture suggests a certain level of planning. Violence broke on the evening of February 27. The attacking groups were of varying age groups. While the main participants were adult males and even some women, there were also young students who took part in vandalizing and looting appliances, shoes, and clothing from the Armenians' homes.Rodina. No. 4, 1994, pp. 82–90. The mobs entered the apartment buildings and sought out Armenians where they lived. Some took shelter among their Azerbaijani and Russian neighbors, who also risked being attacked by the mobs. Others turned on the television to watch Azerbaijani music concerts and raised the volume to give the effect that they were in fact Azerbaijanis. The pogrom was marked by atrocities and savagery. As Waal describes it, \\"The roving gangs committed acts of horrific savagery. Several victims were so badly mutilated by axes that their bodies could not be identified.\\" Numerous acts of gang rape and sexual abuse were committed, taking place in both the apartments and publicly on the city streets. An account of one such act that was also corroborated by witnesses described how a crowd stripped naked an Armenian woman and dragged her through the streets. Rumors circulating that Armenian women in hospital maternity wards had their fetuses disemboweled were later said to have been false.Lee, Gary. \\"Eerie Silence Hangs Over Soviet City .\\" Washington Post. September 4, 1988. p. A33. Retrieved July 31, 2006. In the midst of the attacks, many Armenians sought to defend themselves and improvised by nailing their doors shut and arming themselves with axes, and in some instances a number of intruding rioters were killed. Calls to ambulance services were handled late or in many cases, unheeded completely. There was no intervention on the part of the police to stop the perpetrators.Sumgait: testimony of eyewitnesses. video: 01.13. \\"I personally saw the local police was standing there, doing nothing, as if it were there to help the rioters.

It was not the first day of the pogroms\\".in Russian Zardusht Ali-Zade. Azerbaijani Elit and Masses in the period of collapse of the USSR (article-memoir on turbulent times). As mentioned by De Waal, \\"Another factor, which seems to have been a necessary condition for ethnic violence to begin, came into play: the local police did nothing. It later transpired that the local police force was overwhelmingly composed of Azerbaijanis and had only one professional Armenian officer.\\"De Waal. Black Garden, p. 33 The weekly Moskovskiye Novosti later reported that eight of the city's twenty ambulances had been destroyed by the mobs. Looting was prevalent and many attackers discussed among themselves on who would take possession of what after they had broken into the apartments. In some cases, televisions were stolen, along with other appliances and household goods; many apartments were vandalized and set on fire. The lives of many Armenians were protected and saved by their Azerbaijani friends, neighbors or even strangers, who, at the risk of their own lives, let the Armenians hide in their houses or be escorted in their cars out of the city. According to Armenian witnesses, when Soviet troops went door-to-door searching for survivors, they managed to collect thousands of Armenians who had been hiding in Azeri households.Miller, Donald E. and Lorna Touryan Miller. Armenia: Portraits of Survival and Hope. Berkeley: University of California Press; pp. 46–47. Government reaction Military police escorting Armenian civilians out of the town The Soviet government's reaction to the protests was initially slow. Authorities were reluctant to send military units to impose martial law into town.\\"Soviets Impose Curfew After Riots .\\" Newsday. March 2, 1988 p. 13. Retrieved December 30, 2006. The spirit of glasnost had seen the Soviet Union more tolerant in responding to such politically-charged issues. However, Soviet officials in Azerbaijan, some of whom were witnessing the attacks, appealed to Kremlin leaders to dispatch Soviet troops to Sumgait. In a Soviet Politburo session on the third day of the rioting (February 29), Gorbachev and his senior cabinet conferred on several subjects before discussing the events of Sumgait. When the issue was finally raised, Gorbachev voiced his opposition to the proposal of sending in troops but cabinet members Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and Defense Minister Dmitry Yazov, fearing an escalation of violence, persuaded him otherwise. Meanwhile, on the previous day, two battalions from the MVD, troops mainly equipped with truncheons and riot gear (those troops who were armed with firearms were armed with blanks and not given the permission to open fire), arrived in Sumgait in buses and armored personnel carriers. As they moved in to secure the town, the soldiers found themselves as targets of the mob. In what became a startling sight for the city's residents, the soldiers were attacked and maimed with the improvised steel objects. Their armored vehicles were flipped over and in some cases disabled by molotov cocktails, as the troops found themselves in complete disarray. By February 29, the situation had worsened to the point where authorities were forced to call in more professional and heavily armed troops, who were given the right to use deadly force. A contingent made up of elements of the Felix Dzerzhinsky Division of the Internal Troops; a company of Marines from the Caspian Sea Naval Flotilla; troops from Dagestan; an assault landing brigade; military police; and the 137th Parachute Regiment of the Airborne Forces from Ryazan – a military force of nearly 10,000 men under the overall command of a Lieutenant General Krayev – made its way to Sumgait. Tanks were brought in and ordered to cordon off the city. Andrei Shilkov, a Russian journalist for the periodical Glasnost, counted at least 47 tanks and reported also seeing troops wearing bulletproof vests patrolling the town, an implication that firearms were present and used during the rioting.Bortin, Mary Ellen. \\"Witness Tells of Aftermath of Bloody Armenian Riots .\\" Seattle Times. March 11, 1988. p. B1. Retrieved September 15, 2006. A curfew was imposed from 8 pm to 7 am as skirmishes between troops and rioters continued. Krayev ordered troops to rescue Armenians left in their apartments. By the evening of the 29th, martial law was imposed and troops in buses and personnel carriers were patrolling the streets of Sumgait. Under heavily armed guard, civilian buses and APCs transported Armenian residents to the Samed Vurgun Cultural Facility (known as the SK) in the city's main square. The SK building was designed to accommodate several hundred people, though as many as several thousand eventually found shelter there. Aftermath By March 1, Soviet troops had effectively quelled the rioting. Investigations were slated to begin immediately; however, waste disposal trucks cleaned much of the debris on the streets before they arrived.Lyday, Corbin. \\"A Commitment to Truth Telling: Behind the Scenes in Soviet Armenia.\\" 1988 (Typewritten), p. 28.

The Soviet media did not initially report the event and remained largely silent, broadcasting instead news related to foreign affairs while the media in Sumgait spoke only on local issues unrelated to the massacre. The Soviet government was initially hesitant to admit that violence had taken place; however, when it did, it was quick to downplay the scale of the event, describing the rioting that had occurred as that perpetrated by \\"hooligans.\\" TASS reported of \\"rampage and violence\\" taking place in Sumgait on March 1, which was provoked on the part of a \\"group of hooligans\\" who engaged in various criminal acts. Western journalists were denied access to visit the town by Soviet authorities. On April 28, 1988, images of the pogrom were broadcast in a 90-minute documentary by Soviet journalist Genrikh Borovik. Borovik criticized the media blackout imposed by the Soviet government, claiming that it ran against Gorbachev's aims of greater openness under glasnost.\\"Soviet TV surprise: Ethnic strife shown; Program rips news blackout, defends glasnost .\\" Chicago Sun-Times. April 28, 1988. p. 36. Retrieved December 31, 2006. Eduard Shevardnadze later remarked on the failure to report the massacre in Sumgait as a failure of glasnost itself: \\"the old mechanisms kicked in, simplifying, distorting or just eliminating the truth about [this event].\\"Shevardnadze, Eduard. The Future Belongs to Freedom. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1991, pp. 176–177. . Criminal proceedings Soviet authorities arrested 400 men in connection to the massacre and prepared criminal charges for 84 (82 Azerbaijanis, one Russian, and one Armenian). Taleh Ismailov, a pipe-fitter from one of Sumgait's industrial plants, was charged with premeditated murder and was the first to be tried by the Soviet Supreme Court in Moscow in May 1988. By October 1988, nine men had been sentenced, including Ismailov, who was sentenced to 15 years in prison with a further 33 on trial. Other sentences were more harsh: Ahmad Ahmadov was found guilty and sentenced to be shot by a firing squad for leading a mob and taking part in the murder of seven people.\\"Soviet Riot Leader Sentenced to Death .\\" The Washington Post. November 20, 1988. Retrieved April 19, 2007. However, 90 of those who were tried were set free after a relatively short time as they were sentenced for hooliganism, rather than for murder and violence. There were many who expressed their dissatisfaction with the way the trials were organized and conducted. Soviet historian and dissident Roy Medvedev questioned the trials: \\"Who knows why, but the court examined the Sumgait events by subdividing them into single episodes and not as a programmatic act of genocide.\\"Medvedev. Time of Change, p. 209. Most Armenians and Azerbaijanis were also dissatisfied with the trials. Armenians complained that the true instigators of the pogrom were never caught whereas Azerbaijanis stated the sentences were too harsh and were upset with the fact that the trials were not held in Azerbaijan. Some Azerbaijanis even went on to campaign for the \\"freedom for the heroes of Sumgait.\\" Indeed, many of the perpetrators of the pogrom gained titles of national heroes and/or high positions in the government, where they still serve today.Hidayat Orujev for instance went on to serve as Azerbaijan's State Advisor for Ethnic Policy and is currently serving as the Chairman of State Committee for Work with Religious Organizations of Azerbaijan Republic. Reactions A memorial dedicated to the victims of the pogrom in Stepanakert, Nagorno-Karabakh In Armenia and Karabakh The pogrom was immediately linked to the Armenian Genocide of 1915 in the Armenian national consciousness. On the Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day on April 24, 1988 a khachkar (cross stone) dedicated to the pogrom victims was planted at the Armenian Genocide memorial at Tsitsernakaberd. February 28 was designated as a public holiday in Armenia in 2005. It is officially known as \\"The Day of Memory of the Victims of Massacres in Azerbaijani SSR and Protection of the Rights of the Deported Armenian Population\\". International In July 1988, within months of the Sumgait massacre, the United States Senate unanimously passed Amendment 2690 to the Fiscal Year 1989 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill (H.R. 4782), concerning the Karabakh conflict, which called on the Soviet government to \\"respect the legitimate aspirations of the Armenian people …\\" and noted that \\"dozens of Armenians have been killed and hundreds injured during the recent unrests…\\"SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 4, March 1, 2013 On July 7, 1988, the European Parliament passed a resolution condemning the violence against Armenians in Azerbaijan.RESOLUTION on the situation in Soviet Armenia.

Source: Official journal of the European Communities, No. C 94/117, o C 235/106, 07 July 1988 On July 27, 1990, 130 leading academics and human rights advocates wrote \\"An Open Letter to International Public Opinion on Anti-Armenian Pogroms in the Soviet Union\\" published in the New York Times. The letter, which was signed by professors from Johns Hopkins, Princeton, Berkeley, UCLA, Wesleyan University, University of Paris IV Sorbonne and other universities, urged the international community to take action to protect the Armenian community in Azerbaijan. Conspiracy theories against Azerbaijan Several conspiracy theories spawned in the wake of the pogrom alternatively attributed to the KGB, the CIA, and the Armenians themselves. \\"Armenian provocation\\" As early as mid-1988 Bill Keller wrote in the New York Times that \\"It is accepted wisdom among Sumgait's Azerbaijani majority that the riots Feb. 27, 28 and 29 were deliberately contrived by Armenian extremists in order to discredit Azerbaijan in the battle for the world's sympathy.\\" Historian and head of the Azerbaijani Academy of Sciences Ziya Bunyadov, whom Thomas de Waal calls \\"Azerbaijan's foremost Armenophobe\\", claimed that the massacre had been instigated by the Armenians to cast a negative light upon Azerbaijan. In an article that appeared in the Azerbaijani journal Elm, Bunyadov claimed that Armenians had organized the pogroms: \\"The Sumgait tragedy was carefully prepared by Armenian nationalists... Several hours after it began, Armenian photographers and TV journalists secretly entered the city where they awaited in readiness.\\" Buniyatov, Ziya. \\"Concerning the events in Karabakh and Sumgait.\\" Elm. No. 19, May 13, 1989, p. 175. Excerpts of this text can be found in Levon Chorbajian; Patrick Donabedian; Claude Mutafian. The Caucasian Knot: The History and Geopolitics of Nagorno-Karabagh. London: Zed Books, 1994, pp. 188–189. . Bunyadov's thesis was hinged on the fact that Sumgait Armenians had withdrawn more than one million rubles from their savings before the attacks. To support his thesis, he had also drawn attention to the fact that one of the participants in the riots and killings was Eduard Grigorian, a man of mixed Russian-Armenian lineage who had three previous criminal convictions and pretended to be Azerbaijani. Grigorian was a factory worker who took part in gang rapes and mass attacks and was subsequently sentenced to 12 years for his role in the massacres. Grigorian had been brought up in Sumgait by his Russian mother following the early death of his Armenian father, and his ethnic identity is considered irrelevant since he appropriately fit the profile of a \\"pogromshchik, a thuggish young man, of indeterminate nationality with a criminal past, seeking violence for its own sake.\\" This view has since gained wider currency in all of Azerbaijan today, where it is still euphemistically referred to in the media and by government officials as the \\"Sumgait events\\" (Sumqayıt hadisələri).See, for example, Jamil Babayeva, \\"Armenia's provocation: Sumgayit events . AzerNews.\\" February 28, 2014; \\"Sumgait's events committed by special services and Armenian diaspora .\\" Trend. February 27, 2014. By 2018 the conspiracy theory was adopted by the government for the first time, according to journalist Shahin Rzayev. An investigation by the Prosecutor General's Office stated that \\"Armenians living in Sumgayit tried to provocatively burn down their homes and property and blame Azerbaijanis.\\" According to their investigation a \\"diversion group\\" of 20-25 people who \\"weren’t residents of Sumgayit and were speaking in Armenian among themselves\\" instigated the attacks. Other According to CPSU Politburo member Alexander Yakovlev, the Sumgait pogrom was arranged by KGB agents provocateurs to \\"justify the importance of the Soviet secret services\\". George Soros wrote in a 1989 article in the New York Review of Books: \\"It is not far-fetched to speculate that the first pogroms against Armenians in Azerbaijan were instigated by the notorious local mafia, which is controlled by the KGB official G.A. Alieev [Heydar Aliyev], in order to create a situation in which Gorbachev would lose, no matter what he did.\\" Two authors commented in 2004, \\"Although that possibility cannot be ruled out, hard evidence is still lacking.\\" American analyst Paul A. Goble suggested in a 2015 interview with the Armenian service of Voice of America that the pogrom was perpetrated by a \\"group of Azerbaijani criminals by the provocation of the KGB.\\" Davud Imanov, an Azerbaijani filmmaker, expanded on this theory in a series of films called the Echo of Sumgait where he accused Armenians, Russians and Americans of conspiring together against Azerbaijan and claiming that Karabakh movement was a plot organized by the CIA.

Biography Irwin Edman was born in New York City to Jewish parents. He grew up in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, adjacent to Columbia University, with which he was to be affiliated his entire adult life. Edman spent his high-school years at Townsend Harris Hall, a New York high school for superior pupils. He then attended Columbia University, where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa and earned his bachelor's degree in 1917, and his Ph.D. in 1920. During his student years at Columbia he was a member of the Boar's Head Society. He became a professor of philosophy at Columbia, and during the course of his career he rose to serve as head of the philosophy department. He also served as a visiting lecturer at Oxford University, Amherst College, the University of California, and Harvard and Wesleyan Universities. In 1945 the United States Department of State and the Brazilian government sponsored a series of lectures he gave in Rio de Janeiro. Edman was known for the “charm and clarity” of his writing, and for being an open-minded critic. He was a popular professor and served as a mentor to undergraduate students, notably Pulitzer Prize-winning author Herman Wouk (Columbia class of 1934), who dedicated his first novel to Edman.

Definitions and background In a British colonial context, anti-Hinduism began with Macaulayism in India, the policy of introducing the English education system to British colonies. Anti-Hindu stereotypes were promulgated during the British Raj by several Indophobes in South Asia as a means to aggrandize sectarian divisions in Indian society, part of the divide and rule strategy employed by the British. According to Jeffery D. Long, Hinduphobia is \\"[a]version to Hindus or to Hinduism; cultural bias, possibly ethnically motivated, against Hindus, Hinduism, or both,\\" noting that this term was introduced by Rajiv Malhotra. Malhotra inspired individuals in the Indian diaspora, who have begun to protest that Western scholars \\"distort their religion and perpetuate negative stereotypes\\",'  Examples of anti-Hindu sentiments  The passage to the permanent Durga mandap at Chattalpalli was being dug up to prevent the Hindus from entering the area. The Indian Caste System, a social stratification system in South Asia which has been criticized for its discriminatory problems, is often seen as a uniquely 'Hindu' issue rather than a cultural one. This is a common stereotype, as some adherents of other religions such as Islam, Sikhism and Christianity have kept the practice of caste segregation in India (for details, see Caste system among South Asian Muslims). Christian missionaries denigrate selected features of Hindu practice—most notably image worship, sati, and child marriage (the first two were also criticized by Muslims).. Anti-Hindu bigotry is also rampant in certain sections of Muslim communities in India and Pakistan, often equating Hindus with pagan Meccans who waged war on Muhammed. According to the religious dialogue activist P. N. Benjamin, some Christian evangelists denigrate Hindu gods and consider Hindu rituals barbaric, and such attitudes have caused tensions between religious communities. Akbaruddin Owaisi, a leader of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen party in Hyderabad, has been charged several times for hate speeches denigrating Hindu gods and inciting violence against Hindus. Owaisi had mocked Hindu cremation by saying \\"when you (Hindus) die, you become air after burning and go astray.\\" Owaisi had talked in derogatory terms about heritage places of India including Ayodhya, Ajanta Caves, and Ellora Caves. A Muslim preacher apologised for insulting Hinduism in 2014, after an uproar. Hindus have historically been, and continue to be, considered Kafirs by some MuslimsElliot and Dowson, Tarikh-i Mubarak-Shahi, The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians – The Muhammadan Period, Vol 4, Trubner London, p. 273Elliot and Dowson, Tabakat-i-Nasiri, The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians – The Muhammadan Period, Vol 2, Trubner London, pp. 347–67Elliot and Dowson, Tarikh-i Mubarak-Shahi, The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians – The Muhammadan Period, Vol 4, Trubner London, pp. 68–69 and Heathen by some Christians Hinduphobia in academia is also prevalent. A Rutgers University historian, Audrey Truschke, falsely cited Robert Goldman's translation of the Hindu epic Ramayana to disparage Hindu God Rama. Goldman clarified that the Twitter post did not align with his translation, condemning Truschke's interpretation as 'disturbing'. In an article critiquing Wendy Doniger's \\"The Hindus an Alternative History\\", scholar Jakob de Roover argues that although the current discourse on Indian society and Hinduism is deeply flawed, it's mainstream in the educational system and media in the West. He faults western academia for engaging in eurocentic orientalist discourse, drawing on christian critiques of religion to transform India into a deficient culture.  Historical instances of anti-Hindu views = Under Muslim rulers in India  Under the reign of Muhammad bin Tughlaq, the Muslim cleric Ziauddin Barrani wrote several works, such as the Fatwa-i-Jahandari, which gave him a reputation as a \\"fanatical protagonist of Islam\\"Das, Arbind, Arthashastra of Kautilya and Fatwa-i-Jahandari of Ziauddin Barrani:an analysis, Pratibha Publications, Delhi 1996, pp. 138–139 and wrote that there should be \\"an all- out struggle against Hinduism\\", advocating a militant and dogmatic religiosity.Verma, V.P, Ancient and Medieval Indian Political Thought, Lakshmi Narasan Aggarwal Educational Publications, Agra 1986 pp. 218–220 He developed a system of religious elitism to that effect. Historian Hayavadana C. Rao wrote about Tippu in his encyclopaedic work on the History of Mysore. He asserted that Tippu's \\"religious fanaticism and the excesses committed in the name of religion, both in Mysore and in the provinces, stand condemned for all time. His bigotry, indeed, was so great that it precluded all ideas of toleration\\". He further asserts that the acts of Tippu that were constructive towards Hindus were largely political and ostentatious rather than an indication of genuine tolerance. He also corresponded with the Sringeri Shankaracharya – expressing grief and indignation at a raid by Pindari horsemen, which killed many and plundered the monastery of its valuable possessions,Mohibbul Hasan The History of Tipu Sultan (Delhi) 1971 pp 359 patronised the Melkote temple (which has gold and silver vessels with inscriptions indicating that they were presented by the Sultan), for which a Kannada decree was issued that the Shrivaishnava (Hindu sectary) invocatory verses there should be recited in the traditional form. Tipu Sultan also presented four silver cups to the Lakshmikanta Temple at KalaleB.A. Saletare \\"Tipu Sultan as Defender of the Hindu Dharma\\" in Habib (Ed.)

Biography of Tipu Sultan. Cal-Info. http://www.tipusultan.org/script1.htm . Retrieved 17 October 2006 The Sringeri Sharada Peetham has in its safe possession some 24 letters written by the Sultan, who also sent a silver palanquin and a pair of silver chauris to the Sarada Temple as well. Tipu sent a letter on 19 January 1790 to the Governor of Bekal, Budruz Zuman Khan. It says: Although the attitudes of Muslim ruler Tippu Sultan have been criticized as being anti-Hindu by Indian historians, left-wing historians note that he had an egalitarian attitude towards Hindus and was harsh towards them only when politically expedient.Kate Brittlebank Tipu Sultan's Search for Legitimacy: Islam and Kingship in a Hindu domain (Delhi: Oxford University Press) 1997 Irfan Habib and Mohibbul Hasan argue that these early British authors had a strong vested interest in presenting Tippu Sultan as a tyrant from whom the British had \\"liberated\\" Mysore.Irfan Habib \\"War and Peace. Tippu Sultan's Account of the last Phase of the Second War with the English, 1783-4\\" State and Diplomacy Under Tipu Sultan (Delhi) 2001 p. 5; Mohibbul Hasan writes \\"The reasons why Tipu was reviled are not far to seek. Englishmen were prejudiced against him because they regarded him as their most formidable rival and an inveterate enemy, and because, unlike other Indian rulers, he refused to become a tributary of the English Company. Many of the atrocities of which he has been accused were allegedly fabricated either by persons embittered and angry on account of the defeats which they had sustained at his hands, or by the prisoners of war who had suffered punishments which they thought they did not deserve. He was also misrepresented by those who were anxious to justify the wars of aggression which the Company's Government had waged against him. Moreover, his achievements were belittled and his character blackened in order that the people of Mysore might forget him and rally round the Raja, thus helping in the consolidation of the new regime\\" The History of Tipu Sultan (Delhi) 1971 p. 368 This assessment is echoed by Brittlebank in her recent work.Brittlebank Tipu Sultan's search for legitimacy pp. 10–12. On p. 2 she writes \\"it is perhaps ironic that the aggressive Hinduism of some members of the Indian Community in the 1990s should draw upon an image of Tipu which, as we shall see, was initially constructed by the Subcontinent's colonizers.\\"  Goa Inquisition  The Goa Inquisition was a colonial era Portuguese institution established by the Roman Catholic Holy Office between the 16th- and 19th-century to stop and punish heresy against Christianity in South Asia. The institution persecuted Hindus through the colonial era Portuguese government and Jesuit clergy in Portuguese India. It was established in 1560, briefly suppressed from 1774 to 1778, continued thereafter and finally abolished in 1820. The Inquisition punished those who had converted to Catholicism, but were suspected by Jesuit clergy of practising their previous religion in secret. Predominantly, the persecuted were accused of crypto-Hinduism.Salomon, H. P 2001 pp. 345–7  During the British Raj  During British rule of the Indian subcontinent, several evangelical Christian missionaries spread anti-Hindu propaganda as a means to convert Hindus to Christianity. Examples include missionaries like Abbe J.A. Dubois, who wrote \\"Once the devadasis' temple duties are over, they open their cells of infamy, and frequently convert the temple itself into a stew. A religion more shameful or indecent has never existed amongst a civilized people.\\"Hinduism Today  Sep 1993 In Charles Grant's highly influential \\"Observations on the ...Asiatic subjects of Great Britain\\" (1796),Grant, Charles. (1796) Observations on the state of society among the Asiatic subjects of Great Britain, particularly with respect to morals; and on the means of improving it, written chiefly in the year 1792. Grant criticized the Orientalists for being too respectful to Indian culture and religion. His work tried to determine the Hindu's \\"true place in the moral scale\\", and he alleged that the Hindus are \\"a people exceedingly depraved\\". Vivekanand in his speech at Parliament of the World's Religions in 1893 criticise the missionaries.  In South Asia = Afghanistan  The extremist Taliban regime in Afghanistan, which enforced strict sharia (Islamic law), announced plans to require all Hindus (and Sikhs) to wear identifying badges in public in May 2001, part of the Taliban's campaign to segregate and repress \\"un-Islamic and idolatrous segments\\" of Afghan society.Taliban to mark Afghan Hindus, CNN (22 May 2001).Taliban to Require Identity Badges for Non-Muslims, PBS NewsHour, PBS (22 May 2001). At the time, about 500 Hindus and 2,000 Sikhs remained in Afghanistan.Luke Harding, Taliban defends Hindu badges plan, The Guardian (23 May 2001). The anti-Hindu decree was seen as being reminiscent of the Nazi law which required all Jews to wear identifying yellow badges.Jack Kelley, Taliban: Hindus must wear identity labels, USA Today (22 May 2001). The order prompted international outrage, and it was denounced by the Indian and U.S. governments, as well as by Abraham Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League. Following international pressure, the Taliban regime dropped the badge plans in June 2001.Taliban drop badge policy for Hindus, United Press International (27 June 2001). Religious persecution, discrimination and forced conversion of Hindus has caused Afghanistan's Hindu population to dwindle. Sikhs and Hindus are continuing to flee from Afghanistan in July 2020.  Bangladesh  In Bangladesh political leaders frequently fall back on \\"Hindu bashing\\" in an attempt to appeal to extremist sentiment and stir up communal passions.Print Article - Wanted: Some Hindu spine In one of the most notorious utterances of a mainstream Bangladeshi figure, the then Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, while leader of the opposition in 1996, declared that the country was at risk of hearing \\"uludhhwani\\" (a Bengali Hindu custom involving women's ululation) from mosques, replacing the azaan (Muslim call to prayer). Even the supposedly secular Bangladesh Awami League is not immune from this kind of scare- mongering. The current prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, was alleged to have accused Bangladeshi Hindu leaders in New York of having divided loyalties with \\"one foot in India and one in Bangladesh\\". Successive events such as this have contributed to a feeling of tremendous insecurity among the Hindu minority.A Bleak Future for Bangladesh Hindu's , hinduismtoday.com The fundamentalists and right-wing parties such as the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and Jatiya Party often portray Hindus as being sympathetic to India, making accusations of dual loyalty and allegations of transferring economic resources to India, contributing to a widespread perception that Bangladeshi Hindus are disloyal to the state. Also, the right wing parties claim the Hindus to be backing the Awami League. As widely documented in international media, Bangladesh authorities have had to increase security to enable Bangladeshi Hindus to worship freelySecurity fears for Hindu festival, BBC following widespread attacks on places of worship and devotees. On 28 February 2013, the International Crimes Tribunal sentenced Delwar Hossain Sayeedi, the Vice President of the Jamaat-e-Islami to death for the war crimes committed during the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War. Following the sentence, activists of Jamaat-e-Islami and its student wing Islami Chhatra Shibir attacked the Hindus in different parts of the country. Hindu properties were looted, Hindu houses were burnt into ashes and Hindu temples were desecrated and set on fire. While the government has held the Jamaat-e-Islami responsible for the attacks on the minorities, the Jamaat-e-Islami leadership has denied any involvement. The minority leaders have protested the attacks and appealed for justice. The Supreme Court of Bangladesh has directed the law enforcement to start suo motu investigation into the attacks. US Ambassador to Bangladesh express concern about attack of Jamaat on Bengali Hindu community. The violence included the looting of Hindu properties and businesses, the burning of Hindu homes, rape of Hindu women and desecration and destruction of Hindu temples. According to community leaders, more than 50 Hindu temples and 1,500 Hindu homes were destroyed in 20 districts. On 5 May 2014, A mob of almost 3,000 attacked Hindu households and a temple in eastern Bangladesh after two youths from the community allegedly insulted the Islamic prophet, Muhammad on Facebook.  Pakistan  In Pakistan, anti-Hindu sentiments and beliefs are widely held among many sections of the population. There is a general stereotype against Hindus in Pakistan. Hindus are regarded as \\"miserly\\".Why are the Jews ‘kanjoos’? —Khaled Ahmed's Review of the Urdu press,Daily times (Pakistan) Also, Hindus are often regarded as \\"Kaffirs\\" (lit. \\"unbelievers\\") and blamed for \\"causing all the problems in Pakistan\\". Islamic fundamentalist groups operating within Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan have broadcast or disseminated anti-Hindu propaganda among the masses,Military drops leaflets in Waziristan , jang.com.pk referring to Hindus as \\"Hanood\\" ('Hindu' is singular and Hanood is plural form in Urdu) blaming them for \\"collaborating with the foreigners\\" against the people of the region. At the time of Pakistan's creation the 'hostage theory' had been espoused. According to this theory the Hindu minority in Pakistan was to be given a fair deal in Pakistan in order to ensure the protection of the Muslim minority in India. However, Khawaja Nazimuddin, the 2nd Prime Minister of Pakistan stated: \\"I do not agree that religion is a private affair of the individual nor do I agree that in an Islamic state every citizen has identical rights, no matter what his caste, creed or faith be\\". Separate electorates for Hindus and Christians were established in 1985—a policy which was originally proposed by Islamist leader Abul A'la Maududi. Christian and Hindu leaders complained that they felt excluded from the county's political process, but the policy had strong support from Islamists. The Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal (MMA), a coalition of Islamist political parties in Pakistan, calls for the increased Islamization of the government and society, specifically taking an anti-Hindu stance. The MMA leads the opposition in the national assembly, held a majority in the NWFP Provincial Assembly, and was part of the ruling coalition in Balochistan. However, some members of the MMA made efforts to eliminate their rhetoric against Hindus.International Religious Freedom Report 2006 Published by the US Department of State The public school curriculum in Pakistan was Islamized during the 1980s. The government of Pakistan claims to undertake a major revision to eliminate such teachings and to remove Islamic teaching from secular subjects. The bias in Pakistani textbooks was also documented by Y. Rosser (2003). She wrote that The bias in Pakistani textbooks was studied by Rubina Saigol, K. K. Aziz, I. A. Rahman, Mubarak Ali, A. H. Nayyar, Ahmed Saleem, Y. Rosser and others. A study by Nayyar & Salim (2003) that was conducted with 30 experts of Pakistan's education system, found that the textbooks contain statements that seek to create hate against Hindus. There was also an emphasis on Jihad, Shahadat, wars and military heroes. The study reported that the textbooks also had a lot of gender-biased stereotypes. Some of the problems in Pakistani textbooks cited in the report were: A more recent textbook which was published in Pakistan and titled \\"A Short History of Pakistan\\" edited by Ishtiaq Hussain Qureshi has been heavily criticized by academic peer-reviewers for anti-Hindu biases and prejudices that are consistent with Pakistani nationalism, where Hindus are portrayed as \\"villains\\" and Muslims as \\"victims\\" living under the \\"disastrous Hindu rule\\" and \\"betraying the Muslims to the British\\", characterizations that academic reviewers found \\"disquieting\\" and having a \\"warped subjectivity\\".Lehmann, F., 1968, Pacific Affairs, University of British Columbia, pp. 644–645Calkins, P.

Nevertheless, the colonial era laws and the first constitution for Fiji, granted special rights to native Fijians. These laws relegated Hindus as unequal citizens of Fiji with unequal human rights. For example, it denied them property rights, such as the ability to buy or own land. Hindus and other Indo-Fijians have since then not enjoyed equal human rights as other Fijians. They can only work as tenant farmers for Fijian landlords.Vasil, R. K. (1972) 'Communalism and constitution-making in Fiji', in Pacific Affairs 45 (1 & 2):21-41 The difference in human rights has been a continuing source of conflict between \\"native\\" Fijians and Indo-Fijians, with native Fijians believing Fiji to be their ancestral land that only they can own, and Indo-Fijians demanding equal rights for all human beings. Beyond land ownership, Hindus have been persecuted in the Fijian communal structure. Spike Boydell states, \\"the British introduced the divisive and unworkable system of communal representation and communal electoral rolls. Thus, different communities were represented by their own kind. This still extends to schooling in a prevailing quasi apartheid educational system.\\"Spike Boydell (2001), Philosophical Perceptions of Pacific Property - Land as a Communal Asset in Fiji Department of Land Management and Development, School of Social and Economic Development, University of the South Pacific During the late 1990s, Fiji witnessed a series of riots by radical native Fijians against Hindus (and other Indo-Fijians). In the spring of 2000, the democratically elected Fijian government led by Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry, who was a Hindu, was held hostage by a group headed by George Speight. They demanded a segregated state exclusively for the native Fijians, thereby legally abolishing any human rights the Hindu inhabitants have.

They worked on the sugarcane, rice, cocoa, and coffee estates. The indentured laborers primarily came from the Bhojpuri region and the Awadhi region of the Hindi Belt in North India. A significant minority also came from South India and very few came from the Punjab, Maharashtra, Kumaon, Garhwal, Haryana, Jammu, Kashmir, Gujarat, Kutch, Odisha, and Bengal regions. A majority of the laborers were Hindu. Unlike the African slaves who they succeeded, the Indians were able to keep their culture and traditions. This led to many Hindu immigrants passing on the faith and despite efforts by Christian missionaries to convert them many continued to practice Hinduism. Today, Hinduism is the second largest religion in Trinidad and Tobago and the largest religion of the Indian population in Trinidad and Tobago. Although they were allowed to continue their religion they were met with contempt or indifference by the non-Hindu residents of the country. The Hindu and Muslim clashes that occurred in South Asia continued to occur in Trinidad and Tobago during the days of indentureship and especially while in the Partition of India was going on back in South Asia. During indentureship and even in the beginning after independence from the British, Hindus were treated as second class citizens. The Hindus in Trinidad and Tobago struggled during the early days after independence and even before during British colonial times over the granting of adult franchise, a Hindu marriage act, Hindu schools, cremation ordinance, the right to Diwali as a public holiday, and others. Many of these rights were later granted, due to the efforts of Adrian Cola Rienzi (Krishna Deonarine Tiwari) and the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the major Hindu organization in Trinidad and Tobago led by Bhadase Sagan Maraj. The Temple in the Sea, an iconic Hindu temple in Trinidad and Tobago has its history rooted in the faith of Hinduism. It was originally built by an indentured laborer from British India named Sewdass Sadhu, who actually had built the first temple on property belonging to the estate owners and the temple had to be torn down and he was jailed. After that, he built a second temple out into the sea which became known as the Temple in the Sea. During the Black Power Revolution after independence in the 1960s-1970s many Hindu were targeted and attacked, and riots had broken out. These attacks, the poverty that affected many Hindus, and the status of being treated as second-class citizens led to many Hindu Trinidadians to migrate to the United Kingdom, United States, and Canada. After independence the Hindus were marginalized by the African-based People's National Movement (PNM). The opposing party, the People's Democratic Party (PDP) led by Bhadase Sagan Maraj, later turning into the Democratic Labour Party (DLP) led by Rudranath Capildeo, then finally turning into the present-day United National Congress (UNC) party led by Basdeo Panday and Kamla Persad-Bissessar, was portrayed as a Hindu party and an Indian party and tactics were used against them. Hindus were described as a \\"recalcitrant and hostile minority\\", by Prime Minister Eric Williams. Hindus were alienated by such communal groups. The support of the PNM government to Christian Afro- Trinidadian and Tobagonian and Creole art forms such as Carnival and Christmas, while their public rejection and ridicule of Hindu art forms, was a particular source of contention for the Hindus. The displacement of PNM from power in 1985 would improve the circumstances. There has been persistent discontent among the Hindus with their marginalization. Many groups portray Hindus as \\"clannish, backward and miserly\\". During the General Elections of 1986, the absence of the Bhagavad Gita and the Quran at polling stations for required oath-taking was interpreted as a gross insult to Hindus and Muslims. The absence of any Hindu religious texts at the official residence of the President of Trinidad and Tobago during the swearing in of the new Government in 1986 was perceived as another insult to the minority communities since they were represented in the government. The national education system and curriculum have been repeatedly accused of such majority-oriented symbolism. The use of discernibly oriented prayers at Government schools, the non- representation of Hinduism in approved school textbooks, and the lack of emphasis on Hindu religious observance evoked deep resentment from the Hindu community. Intensified protests over the course of the 1980s led to an improvement in the state's attitudes towards Hindus.Trinidad and Tobago International Religious Freedom Report 2002.

He also claimed that South Asians \\"bring their culture, their country and any problems they might have, with them\\" and that this was not a problem within the black community \\"because we’ve shared a religion and in many cases a language\\".https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/conservative-london- candidate-mayor-shaun-bailey-hindu-muslim-festival-crime-a8566341.html In the pamphlet, Bailey confused the Hindu religion with the Hindi language: \\"You don’t know what to do. You bring your children to school and they learn far more about Diwali than Christmas. I speak to the people who are from Brent and they’ve been having Hindi (sic) days off.\\" The Conservative Party Deputy Chairman, James Cleverly, defended Bailey and insisted that he was being misunderstood, and he implied that black boys were drifting into crime as a result of learning more about other faiths rather than learning about \\"their own Christian culture\\". However, the anti-racism Hope Not Hate campaign group called Bailey's comments \\"grotesque\\".  United States  By the late 19th century, fear had already begun to spread in North America with regard to Chinese immigrants who supplied cheap labor to lay railroad tracks, mostly in California and elsewhere in the West Coast. In the xenophobic jargon which was common at that time, ordinary workers, newspapers, and politicians uniformly opposed this \\"Yellow Peril\\". The common cause to eradicate Asians from the workforce gave rise to the Asiatic Exclusion League. When the fledgling Indian community which was mostly made up of Punjabi Sikhs settled in California, the xenophobia was expanded in order to combat not only the East Asian Yellow Peril, but now the immigrants from British India, the Turban Tide, equally referred to as the Hindoo Invasion (sic).Chan Sucheng, Asian Americans: An Interpretive History, Twayne 1991\\"Shut the gate to the Hindoo invasion\\", San Francisco examiner, 6 June 1910Closed Borders and Mass Deportations: The Lessons of the Barred Zone Act by Alicia J. Campi The rise of the Indian American community in the United States has triggered some isolated attacks on them, as has been the case with many minority groups in the United States. Attacks which specifically target Hindus in the United States stem from what is often referred to as the \\"racialization of religion\\" among Americans, a process that begins when certain phenotypical features which are associated with a group and attached to race in popular discourse become associated with a particular religion or religions. The racialization of Hinduism in American perception has led Americans to perceive Hindus as belonging to a separate group and this contributes to prejudices against them.Joshi, Khyati, The Racialization of Hinduism, Islam, and Sikhism in the United States, Equity & Excellence in Education, Volume 39, Number 3, August 2006, pp. 211–226(16) In 2019, Swaminarayan Temple in Kentucky was vandalised by miscreants. They sprayed black paint on the deity and sprayed 'Jesus is the only God’ on the walls. The Christian cross was also spray painted on various walls.https://www.hindupost.in/world/another-hindu-temple-vandalised-in-usa- jesus-is-the-only-god-graffiti- painted/https://www.timesnownews.com/international/article/hindu-temple- vandalised-with-hate-speech-in-us-hateful-words-written-on-walls/357400 In April 2015, a Hindu temple in north Texas was vandalised when nasty images were spray-painted on its walls. In February 2015, Hindu temples in Kent and the Seattle Metropolitan area were also vandalised.https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/hindu-temple- vandalised-in-us/article26136111.ecehttps://in.news.yahoo.com/amphtml/us- hindu-temple-vandalized-kentucky-062710369.html In July 2019, a Hindu Priest who was dressed in his religious attire was physically beaten in Queens, New York, two blocks from Shiv Shakti Peeth Temple in Glen Oaks by Sergio Gouveia. A Senator and New York State Attorney General have called it a hate crime because \\"If someone is targeted because of religious robe and couple of blocks from temple where he resides it is difficult to believe this was random.\\" Yet, the New York police have not registered it as a hate crime. = Pat Robertson = In addition, anti-Hindu views have been expressed which are specifically based on misperceptions of the religion of Hinduism as well as mistaken racial perceptions. In the United States Pat Robertson has denounced Hinduism as \\"demonic,\\" believing that when Hindus \\"feel any sort of inspiration, whether it's by a river or under a tree, on top of a hill, they figure that some God or spirit is responsible for that. And so they'll worship that tree, they'll worship that hill or they'll worship anything.\\"The 700 Club, 23 March 2006. His remarks were widely condemned and disputed by Indian Americans and members of many non-partisan advocacy groups. Evangelical leader Albert Mohler defended Robertson's remarks, saying \\"any belief system, any world view, whether it's Zen Buddhism or Hinduism or dialectical materialism for that matter, Marxism, that keeps persons captive and keeps them from coming to faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, yes, is a demonstration of satanic power.\\"The O'Reilly Factor, Fox News Channel. 17 March 2006. = U.S. Congress = In July, 2007, The United States Senate conducted its morning prayer services with a Hindu prayer, a historical first. During the service, three disruptors, named Ante Nedlko Pavkovic, Katherine Lynn Pavkovic and Christen Renee Sugar, from the Fundamentalist Christian activist group Operation Save America protested by arguing that the Hindu prayer was \\"an abomination\\", and they also claimed that they were \\"Christians and Patriots\\". They were swiftly arrested and charged with disrupting Congress. The event generated a storm of protest by Christian right groups in the country, with the American Family Association (AFA) opposing the prayer and carrying out a campaign to lobby senators to protest against it.Michelle Boorstein, Hindu Groups Ask '08 Hopefuls to Criticize Protest, Washington Post (27 July 2007).A Prayer and Protest, Las Vegas Sun (13 July 2007). Their representative attacked the proceedings as \\"gross idolatry\\". The AFA sent an \\"Action Alert\\" to its members in which it asked them to e-mail, write letters, or call their Senators and ask them to oppose the Hindu prayer, stating that it is \\"seeking the invocation of a non- monotheistic god.\\"\\"Hindu Prayer in Senate Disrupted.\\" Associated Press (published on NBC News). 2007-06-12. Retrieved on 2007-06-15 The \\"alert\\" stated that \\"since Hindus worship multiple gods, the prayer will be completely outside the American paradigm, flying in the face of the American motto One Nation Under God.\\"\\"Hindu to open Senate with prayer AFA Action Alert, July 10, 2007\\" The convocation by Zed was in fact disrupted by three protesters in the gallery reportedly shouting \\"this is an abomination\\" and other complaints. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said the protest \\"shows the intolerance of many religious right activists. They say they want more religion in the public square, but it's clear they mean only their religion.\\" = California Textbook Controversy = A controversy in the US state of California concerning the portrayal of Hinduism in history textbooks began in 2005. The protest was led by Vedic Foundation (VF) and the American Hindu Education Foundation (HEF) by complaining to the California's Curriculum Commission, saying the coverage in sixth grade history textbooks of Indian history and Hinduism was biased against Hinduism; and points of contention includes a textbook's portrayal of the caste system, the Indo-Aryan migration theory, and the status of women in Indian society as the main features of Hinduism. The California Department of Education (CDE) initially sought to resolve the controversy by appointing Shiva Bajpai, Professor Emeritus at California State University Northridge, as a one-man committee to review revisions proposed by the groups. Michael Witzel and others revisited the proposed changed on behalf of the State Board of Education and suggested reverting some of the approved changes. In early 2006, the Hindu American Foundation sued the State Board over matters of process; the case was settled in 2009. = Dotbusters = The Dotbusters was a hate group in Jersey City, New Jersey that attacked and threatened Indians in the fall of 1987. The name originates from the bindi traditionally worn by Hindu women and girls on their forehead. In July 1987, they had a letter published in the Jersey Journal stating that they would take any means necessary to drive the Indians out of Jersey City: > I'm writing about your article during july [sic] about the abuse of Indian > People. Well I'm here to state the other side. I hate them, if you had to > live near them you would also. We are an organization called dot busters. We > have been around for 2 years. We will go to any extreme to get Indians to > move out of Jersey City. If I'm walking down the street and I see a Hindu > and the setting is right, I will hit him or her.

G. Daily, Dean Cameron, Harris Yulin and Richard Lynch. It was produced by Gale Anne Hurd. The plot follows a woman who awakens from a thirteen-year-long coma and finds herself being stalked by the ghost of a cult leader who led a mass suicide by fire that she survived as a child. Bad Dreams was released on April 8, 1988, and grossed $9.8 million at the box office on a budget of $4.5 million. The film has developed a small cult following among genre fans. However, it was criticized by horror fans and critics alike because of its similarities to A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), even taking into account that Jennifer Rubin was a supporting actress in A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987). Plot In 1975, a cult called Unity Fields commits mass suicide by fire at the behest of its psychopathic leader, Franklin Harris. Only one young woman named Cynthia, a child at the time of the fire, refuses to commit suicide and barely survives the burning of the house where Unity Fields' cultists lived. Nevertheless, she lies in a coma for thirteen years. After awakening in a hospital, Cynthia is plagued by horrific flashbacks of her childhood at Unity Fields, and is forced to attend experimental group therapy sessions for borderline personality disorder at the facility, led by Dr. Alex Karmen. Karmen is not sure that Cynthia belongs inside the group's dynamic, but his peer and mentor, Dr. Berrisford, convinces him to help Cynthia to gradually accostume to urban life in a world that has changed a lot in thirteen years. Eventually, Alex sympathizes with Cynthia's story and tries to help her overcome her fears and feelings of estrangement. Cynthia is disturbed by a vision she has of Harris drowning Lana, another patient, in a baptismal ceremony; moments later, Lana is found drowned in a swimming pool. Cynthia's visions become more vivid, and Harris begins to appear to her with his flesh burnt. When her roommate, Miriam, is discharged from the hospital, Cynthia has a vision of Harris in the elevator with her; however, the doors close before she is able to warn her. Miriam is found dead on the sidewalk in front of the hospital, having leapt from a window in what appears to be a suicide. Alex reassures Cynthia that she is not to blame for the deaths, but she is frequently visited by visions of Harris, who claims to have killed his friends and pressures Cynthia to commit suicide, saying that the only way to stop anyone from dying is to take her own life and join him in and Unity Fields' victims in the afterlife. A male and female patient who are lovers are later killed by the blades of an industrial fan in the utility room of the hospital, which Cynthia also attributes to Harris. She believes Harris has come back from his death to kill those around her. Ralph, a troubled masochist patient with tendency for violent outbursts, becomes enamored with Cynthia; founding himself on the edge after the deaths of his fellow members in the group, knocks down a policeman who was watching him, and goes to talk to Cynthia, who was spending the night with Dr. Karmen in order to feel safe. When he is distracted, Ralph and Cynthia take an elevator to the basement of the hospital. There, during an apparent episode of psicosis and violence, he commits suicide by stabbing himself multiple times in the abdomen. Awakening from sedation after the incident, Cynthia finds Harris sitting in her room, calling her his \\"love child,\\" and urging her to commit suicide. Shortly after, Harris apparently visits Gilda (a clairvoyant patient who asked Cynthia to fight the person who is haunting her, and to stay alive) in her room. Instead of allowing him to kill her, she drinks formaldehyde she stole from a supply room, effectively killing herself. Meanwhile, Dr. Karmen discovers his corrupt peer, Dr. Berrisford, has intentionally laced the therapy group's drugs with psychogenic substances, in the hope that it will effectively make the patients suicidal, and thus corroborate Berrisford's research. Alex realizes that Cynthia's suicide is the ultimate goal for Berrisford, so he orders the nurses to call the police and Detective Wasserman, who was investigating what happened at Unity Fields before the suicides began. Alex confronts Cynthia, insisting her visions of Harris are not real. He is surprised by Berrisford from behind, who knocks him out and takes Cynthia with him. Dr. Karmen wakes up and pulls the hospital's emergency alarm, which elicits chaos. Cynthia goes to the rooftop, where Alex finds her standing on the ledge, with Berrisford at his side, encouraging her to jump. She leaps from the building, but before hitting the ground below, awakens back at the house in which the Unity Fields members committed suicide. There, she is confronted by Harris, who welcomes her; however, it is only a vision, and she awakens to Alex holding her by the arm as they both dangle over the ledge. Berrisford, knowing that Dr. Karmen has discovered his plot, stabs Alex's hand and attempts to push him to his death as well. His attempt is thwarted by the arrival of the police and Wasserman, who help Alex and Cynthia to climb back. Berrisford uses the distraction to grab one of the cops revolver, and readily insists that Dr. Karmen is responsible for altering the patients' medication and the suicides. Alex explains the police that things are the other way around and shows how Berrisford stabbed his hand. Knowing that all of his schemes have failed, Berrisford pulls the stolen revolver and pretends to commit suicide, but quickly points the gun towards Alex. Before he shoots, Cynthia finally confront his fear of Harris, realizing that Berrisford is a totally different person, and reacts by charging and pushing him over the ledge to his death. The authorities retire from the rooftop. While being comforted there by Dr. Karmen, Cynthia has another brief vision of Harris climbing back from the edge of the building and trying to grab her, which scares her for a second. Alex shakes Cynthia and reassures her that her nightmares are over and there is nothing to fear anymore. She calms down and they both tightly embrace one another. CastProduction Bad Dreams was shot on location in Los Angeles, California over a period of eight weeks, with production beginning on October 26, 1987, and concluding in mid-December. Shooting locations included the California Medical Center and California Medical Building in Los Angeles; Lakeview Hospital in Lake View Terrace; and the Brentwood Veterans Hospital. The budget for the production was $4.5 million. Release=Box office The film was released theatrically in the United States by 20th Century Fox on April 8, 1988. It grossed $9,797,098 at the U.S. box office. Critical response Bad Dreams received mixed-to-negative reviews from critics. It holds a rating of 33% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 15 reviews. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a half-star out of four, writing: \\"I praise the production only to suggest that these people should be better employed in worthier projects. It is not surprising to see a violent teenage film exploiting the lowest common denominator and preaching a message of nihilism and despair. It is not surprising to see the latest special-effect technology supplying lingering closeups of burnt flesh and other horrors. What is surprising, I suppose, is that nice people would want to wade in this sewer.\\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times gave the film a middling review, calling it a \\"a breezy, bloody kind of amalgam of The Breakfast Club and A Nightmare on Elm Street... It doesn't make a tremendous amount of sense, plot- wise, and it's instantly forgettable. However, it's amusing for as long as it lasts. Also, for a film of this genre, it has a cast of unusually good actors.\\" Home media The film was released on DVD in the United States by Anchor Bay Entertainment in 2006. This version is out of print. The film was later released by Scream Factory along with Visiting Hours, first as a double feature DVD on September 13, 2011 and then a similar Blu-ray release followed on February 18, 2014.

It appears on the album The Final Cut. The track is the only one on the album featuring the lead vocals of David Gilmour, found in the verses, with Roger Waters singing the refrains and interludes, and was the only single released from the album. It reached No. 30 in the UK Singles Chart. Meaning The lyrics, written by Roger Waters, deal with war (particularly the Falklands War) and criticism of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, as well as general criticisms of the greed and corruption that Waters saw as dangers to society. It also shows the corruptible and fruitless labour of post-war America, Europe and Japan. The wording is such that it mainly tells of the changing of global trade and that a new leader is emerging in the consumer goods industry such as Japan. Despite the political content of the album and the specific references in other songs to public figures of the time, the \\"John\\" of the title is not intended to refer to any particular person named John. It is being used in the British colloquial sense as a placeholder name, where \\"John\\" can be employed in the same way as \\"mate\\", \\"pal\\", \\"buddy\\", or \\"Guv\\" to refer to anyone to whom one is speaking, particularly if the speaker does not know their name. At the time, this usage of \\"John\\" as a general means of address to others would have been particularly associated with blue-collar workers, who were the people being most strongly affected by the changes to manufacturing and trade referred to in the song. Music video In The Final Cut Video EP for the song depicts a Japanese boy walking through a factory searching for a soldier. The child is confronted by factory workers playing cards and geisha girls before he falls to his death from a scaffold and is discovered by a World War II veteran (played by Alex McAvoy, who also played the schoolteacher in Pink Floyd — The Wall). The video was directed by Waters' then brother-in-law, Willie Christie. Composition It is the only track on the album not to feature exclusively Waters on lead vocals. Unlike the majority of other tracks on The Final Cut, \\"Not Now John\\" takes an upbeat, driving, tempo — and hard rock style — for much of its duration. Gilmour and Waters split vocals duties, similar to the song \\"Comfortably Numb\\" from The Wall, and they represent different \\"characters\\" or points of view — Gilmour is the self-serving ignorant layperson while Waters is the intellectual, responsible observer of the world's woes.[ Not Now John, Pink Floyd], Allmusic. \\"Not Now John\\" is notable for being one of the few Pink Floyd tracks to feature strong profanity, as the word \\"fuck\\" occurs in the album version of the song seven times: six times as part of the phrase \\"fuck all that\\", and near the end of the song. Single \\"Not Now John\\" was released as a single on 3 May 1983. The words \\"fuck all that\\" were overdubbed as \\"stuff all that\\" by Gilmour, Waters, and the female backing singers, while the \\"Where's-the-bar?\\" lyric is sung in Italian, Greek and French, as the single fades out before the English iteration. \\"The Hero's Return\\" was released as the B-side, featuring an additional verse not included on the album. A 12\\" single was released in the UK, featuring the two 7\\" tracks on side 1 and the album version of \\"Not Now John\\" on side 2. The single hit number 30 in the UK and number seven on the US Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. # \\"Not Now John\\" (single version) — 4:12 # \\"The Hero's Return (Parts I and II)\\" — 4:02 # \\"Not Now John\\" (album version) — 4:56 (12\\" single only) Reception In a review for The Final Cut on release, Kurt Loder of Rolling Stone described \\"Not Now John\\" as \\"one of the most ferocious performances Pink Floyd has ever put on record.\\" In a retrospective review of The Final Cut, Rachel Mann of The Quietus described \\"Not Now John\\" as \\"fun, but musically crass and obvious,\\" further saying \\"this is Surrey Blues rock as vapid as the views it seeks to satirize.\\" Personnel ;Pink Floyd *Roger Waters – co-lead vocals, bass guitar, twelve-string guitar, tape effects, synthesizer *David Gilmour – vocals, electric guitar *Nick Mason – drums ;Additional musicians: *Andy Bown – Hammond organ *Doreen Chanter – backing vocals (call and response) *Irene Chanter – backing vocals (call and response) ReferencesExternal links * Category:Pink Floyd songs Category:1983 singles Category:Hard rock songs Category:Multilingual songs Category:Protest songs Category:Songs about nuclear war and weapons Category:Songs written by Roger Waters Category:Song recordings produced by Roger Waters Category:1983 songs he:Not Now John ","title":"Not Now John"},{"id":"4419788","text":"Quenby Fung () (13 July, 1965 – 23 February, 2020), born Fung Yan Yan () was a novelist in Hong Kong focused on writing Chinese children's literature for early teens.

He is an alumnus of Loyola Marymount University where he was a standout for the Lions' baseball team. New York Mets Donnels was drafted out of college in the first round (24th overall pick) of the Major League Baseball Draft. He spent the next few years ascending through the Mets minor league affiliates. On May 7, , Donnels made his Major League Baseball debut for the Mets, recording an RBI of Tim Belcher in his debut. Over the course of his rookie year, Donnels played in 37 games, compiling a .225 batting average. Donnels spent only limited time with the Mets in the season. He appeared in 45 games, but struggled considerably, putting together a .174 batting average. At the conclusion of the 1992 season, the Mets failed to protect Donnels, and he was chosen by the Florida Marlins as the 67th pick of the 1992 expansion draft. Only a month later, the Marlins placed Donnels on waivers. Houston Astros Almost immediately after being placed on waivers by Florida, Donnels was signed to a contract by the Houston Astros. It was with the Astros in the season that Donnels appeared in the most games of any season throughout his career. He appeared in 88 games, playing the primary backup to third baseman Ken Caminiti. Donnels pieced together a .257 batting average and hit the first two home runs of his major league career. He continued this role for the season. In , after appearing in 19 games with Houston, the Astros sent Donnels to the Boston Red Sox as part of a conditional deal. Astros rookie Phil Nevin made the team, thus making Donnels expendable. Japan Although Donnels finished the 1995 season with the Red Sox, appearing in 40 more games, his career collapsed after the season. He was released at the season's end, and failed to draw interest from another major league club. Donnels was signed by the Kintetsu Buffaloes for the season. He then played three seasons for the Orix Blue Wave from -. Los Angeles Dodgers On February 8, 2000, days before spring training for the 2000 season began, Donnels was invited to attend the spring camp for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Considering he had not seen major league action in four years, Donnels had an outstanding spring, and surprised many by not being cut like many veterans in his position are every year. Although he saw limited action in 2000, only appearing in 27 games, Donnels compiled a respectable .294 batting average with four home runs. The season saw Donnels appear in 66 games for the Dodgers, continuing as one of the primary pinch hitters off the bench. He became a free agent at the end of the season. End of career When Donnels' contract with the Dodgers expired at the end of the 2001 season, the Arizona Diamondbacks offered Donnels a contract and more money. He went on to play the season with Arizona, hitting .238 with 3 home runs in 74 games. He was traded to the Chicago Cubs at the beginning of the season, but did not see any playing time. Five weeks later, the Florida Marlins purchased Donnels' contract from the Cubs. Donnels remained in the Marlins minor league system until the end of the season when he was released. On March 8, 2004, Donnels signed a free agent contract with the Colorado Rockies. Nearing forty years of age, Donnels played out the season for the Rockies Triple-A affiliate, the Colorado Springs Sky Sox, then retired.

Miller and starring Tina Majorino about a child's encounter with a seal. It is an adaptation of the book A Seal Called Andre, which in turn was based on a true story. It was shot in Vancouver and Mississippi. Plot In 1962 a seal drowns in a fishing net cast by financially struggling fisherman Billy Baker, much to his fury. He and the other local fishermen discuss shooting the seals as a way to improve their flagging fishing season. Toni Whitney, a seven-year- old girl, and her Rockport, Maine family subsequently adopt the seal's orphaned newborn pup, naming it Andre. The vet doesn't hold out much hope, but Toni incites him to survive, with the promise that she will be his best friend forever, and that she will always take care of him. After several failed attempts to get him to take a bottle, Toni's father, Harry, the harbor master, constructs an \\"artificial mother\\" for him out of wetsuit material, a bucket, and two feeding bottles, which he finally accepts, ensuring his survival. As Andre grows up, Toni forms an inseparable bond with him, even taking him to school for show and tell, with the help of Harry and the permission of her teacher. He becomes attached to the Whitneys, and especially to Toni. He lives in the harbor, learns tricks, and attracts a huge local following of fans. The irony of his success as an entertainer further angers Billy, who becomes increasingly jealous of Andre's and the Whitneys' success and esteem within the village. Relations between Harry and Billy deteriorate rapidly. Meanwhile, Billy's son, Mark, and Toni's sister, Paula, become romantically involved, increasing tension between Paula and Harry over Andre. Mark and Billy have a strained relationship as it is. Under pressure from his family and the locals, Harry reluctantly makes the decision to release Andre into the wild once he is weaned, but reconsiders and does not go through with it when he encounters the body of a seal covered in bullet holes at the place where he had planned to release him. In his first winter, Andre escapes the confines of the barn, and the water home that Harry built for him when the harbor froze over. He cuts himself badly, leaving a trail of blood which the Whitneys discover upon realizing that he is missing, and remains gone for the winter. However, he returns in spring, physically weak but unchanged in character, and recovers quickly from his ordeal. As Andre gets older, he continues to be scapegoat for the local fishermen, and for Paula, as he takes up more and more of Harry's time and affections. He misses her performance (which he told her he would not miss for the world) in the local Miss Liberty beauty pageant, because he has to protect Andre from a drunken Billy, who is trying to kill him with a pitchfork. Harry's relations with his son, Steve, fade into the background as he comes down harshly on him for minor transgressions, and fails to keep up with what is going on in his life. When Paula and Mark are discovered smoking in the shed when Andre exits it in a fit of coughing, Harry permanently bans Mark's presence on the Whitneys' grounds, and his and Paula's relationship. Paula decides she is leaving home, raging that Harry doesn't care about her, and that she hates him, to the anger and deep concern of her mother, Thalice. Mark tells her he knows a way to make Andre go away so that he'll never come back. Harry's job also suffers. He fails to call meetings, never checks moorings, and his relations with the fishermen become ever more strained. He also attracts the ongoing attention of the federal government, who send their inspector, Jack Adams, to inform him that he is violating the law by keeping a wild animal in captivity, as a pet. He insists that Andre is there by his own choice, but that it's too dangerous in the wild during winter. Jack pays two visits to the Whitneys' home, increasingly emphatic that Harry faces court and even jail if he does not give Andre up. However, Andre is teaching him about the intelligence and abilities of seals, and despite the risks, he is determined that nothing will put an end to this learning curve. At one point Andre saves his life when he is underwater checking a mooring, which turns out to be entangled in an active explosive. Eventually, Thalice manages to impress upon Harry the high cost of continuing his relations with Andre in the setup that they have, and he agrees to call Jack, so that he can relocate Andre to the aquarium in Boston, where he will be safe, cared for, and have plenty of company. However, before he can tell Toni, the telephone rings, and she goes down to the harbor. There she discovers that Paula and Mark have taken Andre, commandeered a boat, and are heading out to sea as dark clouds gather. Steve is charged with keeping an eye on Toni while their parents investigate, but he is engrossed in a TV program, and does not notice her slip out and launch the dinghy onto an increasingly choppy sea. On their boat, Mark attempts to shoot Andre, reasoning that he is a problem for the fishermen, but Paula finally realizes that she cares about Andre and doesn't want him to be harmed. She tries to stop Mark from shooting him, but the gun fires. Andre jumps overboard, but Paula, not seeing this, assumes his body has fallen in. Very upset and angry at Mark, she demands to be taken home. Harry and Thalice, having been informed by Toni that Paula and Mark had taken Andre, meet them on the shore. Steve, in a panic, arrives and tells Thalice that Toni has disappeared, as has the dinghy. She calls the coast guard, as the rain starts to fall, and visibility begins to deteriorate. Out at sea, Toni is struggling to maintain control of the dinghy in the face of the storm and a strong outward tide-rush. The dinghy is being tossed on huge waves, in opaque rain, and is heading towards some jagged rocks. She loses both oars, and, panicking, calls out for help. Andre, who turns out to be unharmed, swims to her rescue, pulling her away from the rocks by the dinghy's mooring rope. He then alerts Billy and Harry in their boat, leading them to Toni's location. Before she can be rescued, a large wave capsizes the dinghy. Mark, who came with Billy and Harry, jumps overboard, swims out to her, and Billy throws them both a lifebelt, pulling them to safety. Billy tells Mark that he is proud of him, while Harry comforts Toni in the back of the boat, and Andre swims away, exultant at her safety. Once back on shore, Toni is distraught to find Jack levering a caged Andre onto a transport vehicle. Harry explains to her that Andre is going to live in the aquarium in Boston, where he will be safe and cared for in ways they can't. Annie Potts, an aquarium worker, tells Toni they will take good care of him, that they will love having him there, and that she will get to visit him whenever she wants. She reluctantly accepts the notion, and tells Andre that she loves him and will visit him all the time. As summer comes around, Billy and Mark's relationship improves. Harry repairs relations with his family, and having been offered a research job in marine mammal protection, steps down as harbor master, nominating Billy to take his place. Toni comes to the realization that Andre would be happier in the wild, being a wild animal, and he is subsequently released. The Whitneys do not expect to see him again, and Toni wonders if he is making new friends with the wild seals. Multiple alleged sightings of Andre are reported, until a friend of the Whitneys spots him nearby, and informs them that he is on his way. The entire town of Rockport flocks to the harbor to watch him returning home to his family. The film ends with an adult Toni narrating that his life became legend after he made his first trip home, that he spent every winter at the aquarium, and every spring he was released to swim home to Rockport. She narrates that by the time he was twenty-four years old he could hardly see, but still made his final trip home, and that in all her past and future, she'll never have a better friend than him.

The location, approximate dates, first names, ages and occupations of the real family members are all preserved, although two of the Goodridge children, Carol and Susan, are not depicted in the film. Andre really did perform tricks for people down at the harbour, becoming a celebrity. He was free to come and go from the home to the sea as he pleased, though he had a floating pound and an old bathtub in the family's barn. Billy Baker is a composite character, drawing together a minority of fishermen who used seals as scapegoats for poor catches. The book tells of one such fisherman, named only as he within the text, who became angry with Andre, and who wanted to shoot him, but was quickly talked out of it. Andre really was nursed with an \\"artificial mother\\", of the kind depicted in the film, and he did go missing in his first winter, returning in the spring. The storm scene appears to have been added for cinematic and plot reasons, as do many of the subplots and supporting characters. The case really was investigated by the federals in conjunction with a law which prohibited the keeping of wild animals - but this happened later in Andre's life than the film depicts, and the case was quickly dropped on the grounds that Andre had been kept before the law came into play; that is, it was demonstrably his own intention to come home and to remain with the family. During the closing credits, shots from original 16mm films of the real Andre are shown. He, who spent every winter in the New England Aquarium in Boston, entertained tourists in Rockport every summer, having swum up there upon his release each spring, until his death in the spring of 1986.\\"Andre the celebrity seal dies\\", The New Mexican (Santa Fe). July 21, 1986. pA-3 In the film, Andre is not played by an actual seal, but rather by a sea lion named Tory. Two others named Kalika and PJ were also featured in it. It features the Vancouver Aquarium in Stanley Park.

The story ran across at least one issue of most WildStorm titles at the time and several independent one- shots. The story tied into many events happening in the WildStorm universe and, unlike many major crossovers of the time, Fire From Heaven had a lasting impact on many of the characters involved. History The crossover was one of the biggest ever in comics, but had its share of problems; for example, delayed issues caused the planned reading order to change almost monthly, so much that the finalé, planned to take place in Fire from Heaven #2, had to take place in Deathblow #28. Also, mandated participation in the crossover meant that many writers had to stop their own storylines to follow the storyline of the crossover. This had the side effect that none of the issues involved were self-contained and readers had to buy the whole crossover to understand the story, even with short recaps in each issue.  Plot  The story dealt with the coming of Damocles (an alternate reality version of Dr. Tsung), an insane villain from another universe. On Earth, Damocles' opponent from his homeworld had been reborn as the superhero Sigma. Damocles was assisted in his quest by the Sword (an alternate reality version of Union), a group of alien bounty hunters, including One-Eyed Jack, Jade, Rake, Hardball and Tode, the fake Kaizen Gamorra and Miles Craven. Most of the story took place on the island-state Gamorra, with a finale on the moon that involved most of Earth's superheroes. Consequences * Deathblow sacrificed himself to defeat the main villain of the event, Damocles. * Miles Craven, head of International Operations and a major villain in the Wildstorm Universe, died. * Kaizen Gamorra, another major villain, was unmasked as an imposter and killed. The real Kaizen Gamorra would be restored as ruler of Gamorra and would prove to be even more of a villain. * DV8 was sent on its first mission. * Gen¹³ member Caitlin Fairchild was reunited with her father. *Burnout found out his father was John Lynch. * Grifter rejoined the WildC.A.T.s. Spartan recovered memories of his life as Kherubim Lord and member of Team One. * Union came out of retirement, leading into a new series for the hero. * Stormwatch member Flashpoint was revealed to be a traitor to the team and was killed. * The origin of the Gen-Factor was revealed: Sigma. The Gen-Factor was the source of superhuman powers for many characters in the Wildstorm Universe, including Team 7, Gen 12, Gen¹³ and DV8. * Cyberjack, the long-running member of Backlash's supporting cast, died during the incident. * Backlash discovered that he had a son, Aries.

While some creations depicted the massacres during the refugee migration, others concentrated on the aftermath of the partition in terms of difficulties faced by the refugees in both side of the border. Even now, more than 60 years after the partition, works of fiction and films are made that relate to the events of partition. Literature describing the human cost of independence and partition comprises Khushwant Singh's Train to Pakistan (1956), several short stories such as Toba Tek Singh (1955) by Saadat Hassan Manto, Urdu poems such as Subh-e-Azadi (Freedom's Dawn, 1947) by Faiz Ahmad Faiz, Bhisham Sahni's Tamas (1974), Manohar Malgonkar's A Bend in the Ganges (1965), and Bapsi Sidhwa's Ice-Candy Man (1988), among others. Salman Rushdie's novel Midnight's Children (1980), which won the Booker Prize and the Booker of Bookers, weaved its narrative based on the children born with magical abilities on midnight of 14 August 1947. Freedom at Midnight (1975) is a non-fiction work by Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre that chronicled the events surrounding the first Independence Day celebrations in 1947. There is a paucity of films related to the independence and partition. Early films relating to the circumstances of the independence, partition and the aftermath include Nemai Ghosh's Chinnamul (1950), Dharmputra (1961), Ritwik Ghatak's Meghe Dhaka Tara (1960), Komal Gandhar (1961), Subarnarekha (1962); later films include Garm Hava (1973) and Tamas (1987). From the late 1990s onwards, more films on this theme were made, including several mainstream films, such as Earth (1998), Train to Pakistan (1998) (based on the aforementioned book), Hey Ram (2000), Gadar: Ek Prem Katha (2001), Pinjar (2003), Partition (2007) and Madrasapattinam (2010),. The biopics Gandhi (1982), Jinnah (1998) and Sardar (1993) also feature independence and partition as significant events in their screenplay. Some of the books and films are discussed here.

Train to Pakistan This saga by Khushwant Singh was first published in 1956. Singh's version of the Partition is a social one, providing human accounts in a diverse, detailed character base where each person has unique points of view, pointing out that everyone is equally at fault and that placing blame was irrelevant. Interwoven with this point are the subtle questions of morality which Singh asks through his characters, such as whether or not the bad needs to be recognized to promote the good, and what constitutes a good deed.

Komal Gandhar (E Flat) Directed by Ritwik Ghatak Komal Gandhar (1961), the protagonists suffer from the same anguish: the separation from their home, on the other side of the border. Dharmputra It was first Hindi film to depict the partition of India, and Hindu fundamentalism, Dharmputra (1961) directed by Yash Chopra, two years after he made his debut with Dhool Ka Phool (1959), steeped in Nehruvian secularism, wherein a Muslim brings up an 'illegitimate' Hindu child and featured classic song, Tu Hindu banega na Musalman banega, insaan ki aulaad hai, insaan banega, the theme was reverse in this film as herein a Hindu family brings an illegitimate Muslim child, who grows up to become a Hindu fundamentalist.

It was almost entirely finished by 1931, but its opening was delayed until Thursday, September 24,Doors Of Finest Theater Of Size To Be Opened To Patrons Tonight 1936 because of the Great Depression. In 1936 dollars, its construction cost was a grand $200,000 (). The Smithsonian rates the Washoe as a national treasure due to the lavish interior. April 30, 1982, the Washoe was listed on the United States National Register of Historic Places for architectural significance. General interior view of the theater, 1979 The interior design and furnishingsWashoe Theater - AnacondaWashoe TheaterHistorical America-Washoe Theater were done by Hollywood theater designer Nat Smythe. The exterior doors are etched glass. Each joint and trim work is carved in complicated relief patterns with much use of ornamental ironwork. Use of copper is especially prevalent, as Anaconda was a company town for the Anaconda Copper Mining Company. Silver and gold leaf supplement the accent work. Carved rams heads line the walls. Every flat surface, including the domed ceiling, is a painted mural done by Colville Smythe. The silk curtain is a piece of art in itself, though seldom seen. Its age presents a problem for curators who are afraid that taking it down, even to try and restore it, would cause it to fall apart. It has a painting of deer stags. The theater was also designed to have near perfect acoustics. The delay in opening allowed the sound system to be re-designed as a showcase for Western Electric's newest innovation \\"Mirrophonic Sound\\". Recorded sound with films was itself a relatively new innovation, so the creation of a high-fidelity audio system was quite remarkable for 1936. History The site of the Washoe Theater was the site of two previous theaters in Anaconda. The Margaret Theater existed on the site since near the founding of the town. It was re- modeled in 1927 at a cost of $60,000 and renamed the Sundial Theater only to burn down in 1929. The first movie to play in the Washoe was a Western, The Texas Rangers starring Fred MacMurray as a Texas Ranger. The Washoe still operates as a movie theater today.

The tractate discusses the topics related to the Jewish holiday of Passover, and the Passover sacrifice, both called \\"Pesach\\" in Hebrew. The tractate deals with the laws of matza (unleavened bread) and maror (bitter herbs), the prohibitions against owning or consuming chametz (leaven) on the festival, the details of the Paschal lamb that used to be offered at the Temple in Jerusalem, the order of the feast on the first evening of the holiday known as the Passover seder, and the laws of the supplemental \\"Second Pesach\\". Two reasons are given for the name of the tractate Pesachim being in the plural: either because the tractate originally comprised two parts, one dealing with the Passover sacrifice, and the second with the other aspects of the holiday, before they were combined into a single tractate named Pesachim during the Geonic period (by 1040 CE), or, because the tractate deals with the two occasions for offering the Passover sacrifice, namely, the 14th of the month of Nisan on the eve of the holiday, and one month later, the \\"second Pesach\\" on the 14th of Iyar for those who were unable to offer the sacrifice on the original date. The basis for the laws included in this tractate are derived from the Torah, largely from the Book of Exodus, in , , and , as well as , and , and . The tractate consists of ten chapters and has a Gemara – rabbinical analysis of and commentary on the Mishnah – in both the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmud. There is also a Tosefta for this tractate. Apart from the Passover sacrifice, the Jewish religious laws derived from this tractate regarding Passover have continued to be observed, with minor variations according the interpretations of later halakhic authorities, by traditional Jewish communities since ancient times until the present. The observances include the prohibitions on eating, benefiting from or possessing any leaven, and the sale or search for and removal of leaven from the house before Passover; the practices of the Seder night, including eating matza and bitter herbs, drinking four cups of wine, and reciting the Haggadah recalling the Exodus from Egypt; as well as the observances of the entire holiday, including the eating of matza and the recitation of the Hallel prayer. Etymology The name of the tractate Pesachim is the Hebrew plural of the name of the Passover festival Pesach, and there are two explanations given for this: Firstly, the tractate contains two distinct parts, which were originally separate, until combined into a single tractate during the Geonic period (by 1040 CE). Until then, the tractate was divided into two parts called Pesaḥ Rishon (\\"First Passover\\" or \\"Passover I\\") and Pesaḥ Sheni (\\"Second Passover\\" or \\"Passover II\\"). After the two parts were combined, the tractate was called Pesachim, in the plural. One part, now comprising chapters one to four and chapter ten, addresses the laws of Passover that apply always and everywhere, such as the removal of chametz from the home, the eating of matzah, and the Seder on Passover night. The second part, now chapters five to nine, concern the laws of how the Passover sacrifice was offered and eaten at the Temple in Jerusalem while it existed. This part is more relevant thematically to Seder Kodashim, the order of the Mishna concerned mainly with the sacrificial offerings in the Temple. In the only surviving manuscript that contains the complete text of the Babylonian Talmud, known as the Munich Codex, the current tenth chapter appears as the fourth, so that the chapters concerning the practical observances of the festival follow one another consecutively. The early medieval Jewish commentators, known as the Rishonim, also refer to the first part of the tractate as \\"Pesach Rishon\\", and the second part about the sacrifices as \\"Pesach Sheni\\". The Meiri (1249–1315) states clearly in his introduction to the tractate that during the immediately preceding Geonic period, Pesachim was divided into two tractates. This distinction is also marked explicitly in the Vilna edition in the Hadran at the end of the fourth chapter () and ninth chapter () of the tractate. A second reason given for the plural name of the tractate is that there are, in fact, two Passovers: the \\"second Pesach\\" on the 14th of Iyar was instituted a month after Passover for those who were unable to offer the Passover sacrifice on the eve of the holiday on 14th of the month of Nisan, in accordance with . Accordingly, the title of the tractate in the plural recognizes this, although the Mishnah almost entirely concerns the first or \\"Great\\" Passover. Chapters Pesahim is divided into 10 chapters: # אור לארבעה עשר (Or Le'Arba'ah Asar) # כל שעה (Kol Sha'ah) # אלו עוברין (Ellu Overin) # מקום שנהגו (Makom Shennahagu) # תמיד נשחט (Tamid Nishchat) # אלו דברים (Ellu Devarim) # כיצד צולין (Keytzad Tzolin) # האשה (Ha'Ishah) # מה שהיה (Mah SheHayah) # ערבי פסחים (Arvei Fesachim) References Category:Oral Torah ","title":"Pesachim"},{"id":"4419888","text":"Imbabura is an inactive stratovolcano in northern Ecuador. Although it has not erupted for at least 14,000 years, it is not thought to be extinct. Imbabura is intermittently capped with snow and has no permanent glaciers. Covered in volcanic ash, the slopes of Imbabura are especially fertile. In addition to cloud forests, which are found across the northern Andes to an altitude of 3000 m, the land around Imbabura is extensively farmed. Maize, sugarcane, and beans are all staple crops of the region. Cattle are also an important commodity, and much of the land on and around Imbabura, especially the high- altitude meadows above the tree line, is used for grazing.  Geography and geology  Imbabura is a volcano in the southern Ring of Fire. As the Nazca Plate is subducted beneath the South American Plate, the former melts with exposure to the hotter asthenosphere. This melted rock, which is less dense than the crust above it, rises to the surface. The result is an arc of volcanoes, which includes Imbabura, 100–300 km away from the subduction zone. Imbabura is the product of Strombolian Eruptions, which, in comparison to Plinian Eruptions, are relatively low-intensity and low volume. They are generally characterized by the ejection of cinders, lapilli, and lava bombs, as well as the accumulation of dark tephra around the volcanic vent. This forms a cinder cone. Imbabura’s cone is relatively exposed from erosion and easy to identify. In fact, the mountain is a complex of cinder cones with varying heights. Many of them are named, including el Cubilche, Azaya (or Huarmi Imbabura), Pangaladera, Cunrru, Artezón, Zapallo Loma, Angaraloma, and Araque. Imbabura was active during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene epochs, for the last time approximately 14,000 years ago. Future pyroclastic flows from any of Imbabura’s cones could pose a serious threat, however. From the Azaya cone, which faces West, pyroclastic flows could hit the San Pablo lake at the base of the mountain and generate devastating waves; from the Artesón cone, which faces north, pyroclastic flows could strike the city of Ibarra, with a population of nearly 300,000. For this reason, Imbabura remains closely monitored by volcanologists. Imbabura Volcano seen from San Pablo del Lago  Cultural importance  As the dominant geographic feature of the area, Imbabura is of significant importance to the local culture, which involves a spiritual relationship with the land. The mountain is sometimes personified locally as Taita Imbabura, or \\"Papa\\" Imbabura. In fact, Imbabura is considered the sacred protector of the region. One of boulders ejected by Imbabura's last eruption, which landed nearby in Peguche, was revered as Achilly Pachacamac, the supreme god, by pre-Incan peoples. According to local legend, Mojanda and Imbabura each hurled stones across the valley; but Imbabura, who is often characterized as a womanizer, was weakened by his amorous affairs, and his rock fell short. The stone has been carved into the shape of a face. It is said that Imbabura fought with Mojanda to win the love of Cotacachi, who became his wife. When Cotacachi is snowcapped in the morning, it is said that Imbabura has been with her during the night. Building upon these legends, some of the smaller peaks nearby, especially Yanahurca (or Wawa Imbabura) north of Cotacachi, are called the offspring of the two. When it rains in Otavalo and surrounding areas, it is also said that Imbabura is \\"peeing\\" in the valley. On a western slope, an area of loose earth perfectly resembles a heart. This area, known as the \\"heart of the mountain\\" is much beloved by residents and appears in local art depicting the volcano. The area is said to be enchanted, as no human nor animal has been capable of scaling or hiking across the area. Climbing Imbabura is most frequently climbed from the town of La Esperanza or where the road ends about 4 km above it in the village of Chirihuasi. From Chirihuasi, the altitude gain is approximately . The route follows a ridge and reaches the false northern summit before contouring around the crater to the true summit.

Early life He was born in Poltava, Russia (now Ukraine). With prospects for a Jew in Czarist Russia exceedingly bleak, he ran away twice (once reaching Germany), before emigrating for good at the age of eighteen. He went first to Liverpool, where he worked as a dock hand,\\"Interesting Westerners\\" (April 1920) Sunset, Vol. 44, No. 4, p. 49 then to America, arriving in New York City in January 1899. Military career Drebin enlisted on June 27, 1899 in the 14th Infantry Regiment and was shipped to the Philippines (acquired by the U.S. as a result of its victory in the Spanish–American War) to help put down a native insurrection led by Emilio Aguinaldo. He quickly distinguished himself in battle. Later, he participated in the rescue of westerners besieged in Beijing during the Boxer Rebellion. Mustered out in 1902, he took a succession of unsatisfactory jobs, including an attempt to fight for the Japanese in the Russo-Japanese War, before reenlisting in 1904. This time, he was stationed at Fort Bliss. It was here that he was trained how to use a machine gun, a skill for which he became well-known (and would need in later years). He made friends in nearby El Paso, Texas before his second army hitch ended in 1907. Together with two other soldiers of fortune and machine gun experts, Tracy Richardson and Emil Lewis Holmdahl, Drebin's wanderings then took him to Central America. He worked as a security guard in the Panama Canal Zone. After several unsuccessful business ventures, he was recruited to fight for various liberation movements in Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Mexico. It was in Guatemala that he suffered his only combat wound – a shot in the rear. In the Mexican Revolution, Drebin joined the forces of Francisco Madero as a machine gunner. After Madero's murder in 1913, Drebin worked for Felix A. Sommerfeld in El Paso, smuggled arms to Pancho Villa's forces, and went on sabotage missions in Mexico for Sommerfeld's secret service.Heribert von Feilitzsch, Felix A. Sommerfeld: Spymaster in Mexico, 1908 to 1914, Henselstone Verlag LLC, Amissville, Virginia, 2012, p. 186 When the latter made his infamous raid on Columbus, New Mexico on March 9, 1916, killing some civilians, Drebin joined the Punitive Expedition sent by an outraged America to bring his former comrade-in-arms to justice. Drebin served as a scout and became good friends with the expedition's commander, General John Pershing. The Americans were never able to catch the elusive Villa, and the fiasco eventually came to an end in 1917. In early 1917, Drebin (then 39) married 19-year-old Helen Spence. They soon had a baby daughter. However, America's entry into World War I eventually lured him back into the Army, enlisting in the 141st Infantry Regiment of the 36th Infantry Division. En route to the fighting in France, he received word that his child had died. Drebin once again distinguished himself in combat. For his bravery at St. Etienne in October 1918, Sergeant Dreben was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the Croix de guerre and the Médaille militaire, the highest French honor. General Pershing, now commander of the American Expeditionary Force, called him \\"the finest soldier and one of the bravest men I ever know .\\" Post-war life After the end of the war, Drebin returned to El Paso, where he divorced his wife because of her infidelity in his absence. The war hero then settled down and started a successful insurance business. In 1921, Drebin received another honor; he was selected by General Pershing to be one of the honorary pallbearers (along with another World War I hero, Alvin York) for the burial of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery on November 11. In the same year, Drebin and some others were recruited by El Paso police to illegally extradite an escaped prisoner, Phil Alguin, who had murdered Los Angeles Police Detective Sergeant John J. Fitzgerald. The men set up a false medical office in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico advertising the removal of tattoos. The plan was that when Alguin came in for treatment, they would apply anesthetic, then drive him to El Paso. However, Alguin was not rendered fully unconscious and was able to cry for help. Drebin and the others were arrested, but were released from prison after three days due to pressure from the United States. In 1923, he married for the second time, this time to Meade Andrews. She convinced him to move to California for a fresh start. On March 15, 1925, Drebin died when a nurse accidentally injected him with the wrong substance. Newspapers all over the country, including the New York Times and the El Paso Times, paid tribute to him. Famed columnist Damon Runyon wrote a eulogy, and the Texas legislature adjourned for a day in his honor. He is buried in Glendale, California's Grand View Memorial Park Cemetery.

The red arrows show the flow of the material, the blue ones the movement of the piston and the white arrows show, how the air is sucked out underneath the disposable follower plate A follower plate pump is a device to pump highly viscous material directly from barrels. So it sometimes is called a barrel follower plate pump. It is applied in food manufacturing, resin dispensing, gluing and so on.  The principle  If an ordinary intake socket is lowered into highly viscous material, the material will flow so slowly, that after short time, the pump will soak up air, because the socket is not fully covered by the material anymore. To avoid that, a plate, closing tight to the wall of the barrel by a soft sealing lip, is put on top of the material in the barrel. This plate is lowered slowly so that the material rises through a hole in the center of the plate into the intake socket. The pumped amount and the amount lifted through the plate have to be precisely the same. This must be ensured by appropriate control of the follower plate. In such a device a scooping piston pump or an eccentric screw pump can be used for pumping the stiff paste. Fundamental problems  To get rid of enclosed air when changing barrels, quite some material has to be pressed out of the barrel, causing a significant amount of waste. The follower plate can be lowered too fast in such a way, that material is squeezed out at the side instead of being raised in the center. Hardened material on the edge of the sealing lip of the follower plate can be carried into the material, causing waste of produced parts or process breakdown.

Educated at the Pratt Institute, he worked primarily in the romance and superhero genres of comics, with forays into many other subjects. Biography=Early life (1918–1945) Rosenberger was born and grew up in the Richmond Hill neighborhood of Queens. During early childhood, he was bedridden for two years with scarlet fever. It was during this time he began to draw. His father, a printer, encouraged John's artistic ambitions, and recruited him to help at the print shop. John continued to draw, and took inspiration from such artists as Norman Rockwell, Alex Raymond, Hal Foster, and Milton Caniff. In 1938, Rosenberger enrolled in night classes at the Pratt Institute, where he met and started a romantic relationship with Marguerite \\"Peggy\\" Chapellier. Peggy was a fellow student as well as the daughter of prominent art dealer George Chapellier. During their time at Pratt, John was painting houses and Peggy worked for Western Publishing as a comics colorist. The two continued to see each other as they took classes through 1941, and were married on May 27, 1942. Soon after the marriage, John was drafted into the Army, compelling the couple to relocate to Washington, D.C. There, John taught at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers School at Fort Belvoir, and was editor of the military magazine The Specialist, to which he contributed pin-ups and other illustrations. In 1943 John was sent overseas for the remainder of the war, working on the construction of an oil pipeline in the China Burma India Theater. The Rosenbergers' first son John was born while he was away. After the war, the Rosenbergers moved into a new house in Jackson Heights, Queens, and John took a job at his father-in-law's gallery, eventually becoming manager. Chapellier Galleries was located next to the Whitney Museum, and dealt in American art, endorsing such painters as William Merritt Chase, Robert Henri and Frank Duveneck. Meanwhile, Rosenberger painted portraits and spent evenings and free time preparing samples of his art and looking for publishers. Early comics career (1946–1960) Rosenberger had done a bit of work for Dell Comics before the war. He started comics work again in 1946, and by 1949 he was working entirely freelance. He had left his job at the gallery in April 1948, and was soon working on crime, western, adventure, and romance stories for several different publishers. Robert Bernstein was a writer Rosenberger met while drawing for Brevity, Inc., a company which produced industrial, political, and educational comics in booklet form. The pair pitched an original serial newspaper strip called Sands of the South Seas a couple of years later. The proposal resulted in the publication of one issue of a comic book (retitled Sands of the South Pacific) by Toby Press. Future newspaper strip pitches were less successful, with both Christopher Crown (1959) and Chris Cross (1965) rejected by the syndicates, but the two would become frequent creative collaborators on other projects. Other work came for Rosenberger in the form of painted covers for paperback book publishers. With his background in oil painting, this kind of work was less stressful than comics jobs, which proved to be a great pressure for him. Indeed, Rosenberger suffered a nervous breakdown in 1952, after which the family temporarily moved to a small town in Connecticut. He soon resumed working on the paperback covers, but was hesitant in going back to work for comics. His reentry into regular comics work was facilitated by friendly encouragement from Richard E. Hughes, editor for the American Comics Group (ACG). After about a year in Connecticut, in which the Rosenbergers went deep into debt, John signed on for work with ACG and the family moved to Levittown, Long Island, close to their new good friends the Hugheses. While there was some work from Dell-affiliated Custom Comics (which produced educational pamphlets), work with Brevity, Inc. ended when its owner unexpectedly died in 1953. There was a dispute over royalties and a failed attempt by Rosenberger and Bernstein to buy the company, but nothing came of it, leaving ACG as Rosenberger's biggest account for the mid- to late-1950s. He covered all genres for ACG, and worked in all the company's titles in some part through the mid-1960s, including Adventures into the Unknown, Forbidden Worlds, Unknown Worlds, and Romantic Adventures, all of which had managed to survive the implementation of the Comics Code Authority in 1954. Superheroes and Romance (1960–1975) A page of Rosenberger's work on a Lois Lane cover story in The Superman Family #166 (Aug.–Sept. 1974). On September 6, 1960, Rosenberger started an account with Archie Publications, and soon began work on the Simon & Kirby-created title The Fly for the Archie Adventure Series. Rosenberger then teamed with Robert Bernstein to create the Jaguar in a similar mold. He served as a regular artist on several other titles for the Adventure Series before the group segued into the campy Mighty Comics. Other projects Rosenberger worked on with Archie included the first issue of a short-lived iteration of The Shadow, written by Jerry Siegel, and some work penciling Archie stories. In late 1966 he stopped all his work with Archie Publications. Meanwhile, Rosenberger had been working for National (now DC Comics) since 1963 on romance stories. His style suited the still-popular genre in that he kept up-to-date with fashionable hair and clothing styles. Also, he always drew women as ideal beauties and his leading men were all handsome. In 1965 he drew his first superhero story for DC. It was a Supergirl and Wonder Woman story for The Brave and the Bold #63 titled \\"The Revolt of the Super Chicks!\\", and it was an appropriate subject for Rosenberger's expertise. Cartoonist Fred Hembeck has noted that Rosenberger's superhero work showed his background in the romance genre, with \\"luscious babes\\" and a unique proficiency in rendering \\"expressions of impotent bewildered befuddlement\\" on the faces of male protagonists. Rosenberger continued with romance work for DC in comic books such as Falling in Love, Girls' Love Stories, Girls' Romances, Secret Hearts, and Young Romance, but the genre's popularity was quickly waning. Around 1972–1974, Rosenberger was regularly working on various features for DC titles such as Strange Sports Stories, The Superman Family, Wonder Woman, and World's Finest Comics, and with such characters as Zatanna and Lois Lane. He and Robert Kanigher co-created Lady Cop in 1975. That character appeared in the fourth season of the Arrow TV series in 2015 and was portrayed by Rutina Wesley. In 1974, Rosenberger stopped work on DC projects for unknown reasons. He started penciling for Sy Barry, the regular artist for The Phantom newspaper strip, whose eyesight was beginning to fail him. He continued with this task on-and-off for about a year. Sickness and death (1976–1977) Rosenberger suffered a heart attack on April 22, 1976, and took about two months off to recover. In August he was diagnosed with cancer, and he died on January 24, 1977, at the age of 58. His last work was for Wonder Woman #217 (April–May 1975), for which he would pencil only the first four pages before taking ill. Subsequently, this issue was redrawn completely by Dick Dillin. The Rosenberger pages were later published in The Amazing World of DC Comics #15 (Aug. 1977).The Amazing World of DC Comics #15 at the Grand Comics Database Bibliography Comics work (interior pencil art) includes: Archie Comics *Adventures of The Fly #11–28 (1961–1963) *Adventures of The Jaguar #1–15 (1961–1963) *Adventures of Young Dr. Masters #1–2 (1964) *Betty and Me #3 (1966) DC Comics *The Amazing World of DC Comics #15 (featuring the unpublished pencils of Wonder Woman #217; this story would be re-drawn by artist Dick Dillin) (1977) *The Brave and the Bold (Supergirl and Wonder Woman) #63 (1965) *Date with Debbi #4, 7, 16 (1969–1970) *Falling in Love #70, 76, 80, 94, 97–102, 104–105, 107–109, 115 (1964–1970) *1st Issue Special (Lady Cop) #4 (1975) *Girls' Love Stories #112–114, 119, 132, 134–135, 137, 139–140, 142, 144, 146–152, 158, 161, 168–170, 172–175 (1965–1973) *Girls' Romances #131–136, 142–143, 146, 148, 151, 159 (1968–1971) *Secret Hearts #90, 111–114, 116, 118–110, 124, 130, 134, 138–140, 145, 148 (1963–1970) *Strange Sports Stories #4–6 (1974) *Supergirl (Zatanna) #1; (Supergirl) #5 (1972–1973) *The Superman Family (Lois Lane) #166, 169; (Supergirl) #168 (1974–1975) *Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane #122–137 (1972–1974) *The Unexpected #177 (1977) *Wonder Woman #215–216 (1974–1975) *Young Love #67–68, 104 (1968–1974) *Young Romance #152, 158, 160–161, 163, 166–167, 173–175, 197–198 (1968–1974) Marvel Comics *Adventures into Terror #31 (1954) *Adventures into Weird Worlds #22–23 (1953) *Journey into Unknown Worlds #16–17, 27 (1953–1954) *Where Monsters Dwell #28 (1974) ReferencesExternal links * * John Rosenberger at Mike's Amazing World of Comics Further reading * Category:1918 births Category:1977 deaths Category:20th-century American artists Category:American army personnel of World War II Category:American comics artists Category:American comic strip cartoonists Category:American painters Category:Archie Comics Category:Artists from New York City Category:DC Comics people Category:Deaths from cancer Category:Golden Age comics creators Category:People from Levittown, New York Category:People from Richmond Hill, Queens Category:Pratt Institute alumni Category:Silver Age comics creators Category:United States Army soldiers ","title":"John Rosenberger"},{"id":"4419932","text":"Yevamot (יבמות, \\"Brother's Widow\\") is a tractate of the Talmud that deals with, among other concepts, the laws of Yibbum (loosely translated in English as levirate marriage), and, briefly, with conversion to Judaism.

This law only applies to paternal brothers, i.e., brothers by the same father; whether they have the same mother or different mothers is irrelevant. The deceased's widow(s) is forbidden to marry anyone else while waiting for one of the brothers to marry her, or release to her by performing a ceremony known as Chalitza. In any case where Yibbum applies, Chalitza may be performed as an alternative. There are numerous cases discussed in this tractate where Yibbum does not apply, and therefore Chalitza does not apply either.

It is the most western publicly accessible area in Hawaii, although the privately owned island of Niihau is further west. The park is miles away from the town of Kekaha, and it can only be reached via a poorly marked, dirt sugarcane road, making a four- wheel drive vehicle preferable. The beach is several miles long, yet only the area known as \\"Queen's Pond\\" offers safe swimming. Location The park is located at the western end of Kauai and has many miles of shoreline that averages about 300 feet from the barrier dunes to the surf line. Sand dunes along the beach can reach heights nearing 100 feet. Driving on the beach is permitted, but obtaining a tow truck would be expensive. The only road to the park is dirt, with many ruts and potholes, and is difficult to access by non-4WD vehicles. The park is located to the north of the Pacific Missile Range Facility and Barking Sands beach. The beach is flanked to the north by the Na Pali Coast mountain ridges. On the east side park is adjacent to the field used for agriculture, that is in turn adjacent to the mountain ridge. Mountains are so close that at night park visitors can hear goats bleating on this ridge. Road access is west from the town of Kekaha. A good local map will be needed. Facilities The park has running cold water, flush toilets, simple semi-private showers and a few pavilions. Visitors to the park should bring additional water, food, an umbrella or other shade apparatus and all supplies they feel they need. Nothing is available for purchase anywhere in the park. There is no medical facility or lifeguard available. Most of the year, especially during the Hawaiian Summer (March to October) the sun is extremely intense and there is no place to find shade. Activities Except for the usual water-related activities the park is officially open to campers. Swimming is safe only at the Queens Pond, located toward the southern end of the park. This is a wild beach. The shore is unprotected from the open ocean. The usual surfing, snorkeling, etc. are not safe activities along this beach. The beach drops off rapidly to deep water and rip currents along the shore are very strong, especially in the winter months. History and mythology This beach is said to have a strong basis in Hawaiian mythology. Unofficially, Polihale has been incorrectly translated in many instances as the \\"House of the Po\\", where Po is the Hawaiian afterworld. By this account, spirits are said to travel to the coastal plain adjacent to the beach, and stay in the temple, known as the heiau. From there, they would climb the cliffs to the north, jump off into the sea to get to the mythical Po. The story further indicates that this belief was so strong that all the homes built in the vicinity of Polihale would have had no east facing doors, so that no traveling spirit could become trapped within. The foregoing story, however, offers an erroneous translation of the place name. The name \\"Polihale\\" literally translates as \\"House Bosom\\".Pukui, Mary Kawena, Elbert, Samuel H., and Mookini, Esther T. Mookini. Place Names of Hawaii: Revised & Expanded Edition. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1974. The root Po refers to the original night/darkness from which creation is manifested. Po in this case is the \\"source\\"; poli, is literally \\"bosom\\" or \\"breast\\", revealing the word's root in the concept of \\"source of life\\". \\"Polihale\\" should not be literally translated as \\"bosom house\\", but \\"house bosom\\". A sea lettuce called pahapaha grows in the waters near Polihale. A wreath made from pahapaha can fade and dry out, but when soaked in water, it will revive to its original freshness. Only the pahapaha from Polihale does this. According to mythology, Na-maka-o-Kaha'i, sister of Pele and Goddess of the Ocean, blessed Polihale's pahapaha with this special quality. Visitors once took home wreaths made from pahapaha from Polihale to prove they had indeed been there. Road to Polihale The ridge enclosing ‘Ohai‘ula Valley as seen from the road to Polihale In December 2008 flooding damaged facilities and closed the access road. With the park site closed and fearing the economic impact, numerous local residents and businesses volunteered to repair the road on their own rather than wait for the government to take action. The cost had been estimated at $4 million, an amount that the Department of Land and Natural Resources did not have budgeted, with repair time estimated at one to two years. On March 23, 2009, local volunteer residents and private businesses began repairing the road on their own and completed the job eight days later.Island DIY: Kauai residents don't wait for state to repair road - http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/04/09/hawaii.volunteers.repair/index.html As of March 25, 2011 the road to the park prefers a 4-wheel drive vehicle but a car is passable to the parking area. If it rains the road will be impassible to non-4wd.

It is the fifth volume of the order of Nezikin. Makkot deals primarily with laws of the Jewish courts (beis din) and the punishments which they may administer, and may be regarded as a continuation of tractate Sanhedrin, of which it originally formed part. In its scope of application are the topics of: *The false witnesses (Edim Zomemim) *The exile in a city of refuge. (Aray Miklat) *The lashes administered by the court. (Makkot) The third chapter of tractate Makkot enumerates 59 offenses, each entailing lashes. Of these, three are marital sins of priests; four, prohibited inter- marriages; seven, sexual relations of an incestuous nature; eight, violations of dietary laws; twelve, various violations of the negative precepts; twenty- five, abuses of Levitical laws and vows. When the offense has been persisted in, the punishment depends on the number of forewarnings (see Hatra'ah). The Mishnah gives 39 as the maximum number of stripes the court may impose for any one misdemeanor; but the convict must be examined as to his physical ability to endure the full count without endangering his life. The convict is bound in bent position to a post, and the public executioner administers the punishment with a leather strap while one of the judges recites appropriate Scriptural verses (Deut. 28:58-59; 29:8; Psalm 78:38). Anyone guilty of a sin which is punished by Kareth (\\"excision\\") may be cleared by flagellation. The author of this midrash, Ḥanina b.

In the Mishnah, this is the tenth and last tractate in Nezikin; in the Babylonian Talmud the ninth tractate; in the Jerusalem Talmud the eighth. It consists of three chapters in the Mishnah and two in the Tosefta. The tractate mainly discusses laws pertaining to erroneous rulings by a Jewish court, as well as unwitting actions performed by leading authorities of the Jewish people, and the sacrificial offering, or korban, that might be brought as a consequence of these actions. Holman National Sin Offering Mishnah Mishnah-D- Nezikin2-Vilna The Mishnah of Horayot is the final work of Nezikin. Horayot contains three chapters. There are twenty paragraphs of Mishna, or twenty mishnayot, within the three chapters. These chapters deal with the verses in the Torah () that specify different procedures for the sin offering brought by a private individual, an anointed priest, a nasi, and an entire community. The \\"community's\\" offering () is understood to be that brought when the community has followed an erroneous ruling by the higher court. In addition to the discussion in Leviticus 4, the Torah also mentions community offerings in (). The sages understand the second passage in Numbers to be referencing the specific sin of unintentional idolatry committed by the congregation. Chapter 1 - Sacrifice for unintentional sins Maimonides sums up the conditions necessary for the bringing of such a sacrifice, found in the first and second chapters, as follows:Maimonides, Introduction to commentary on the mishnah of Horayot (1) the head of the Sanhedrin and all its members must have been present when the decision was rendered; (2) every one of them must have been fully qualified to serve as a member of that body; (3) the decision must have been passed by a unanimous vote; (4) the error must concern a Biblical law; (5) at least a majority of the people must have followed the decision in practice; (6) those who followed the decision in practice must have been unaware of the mistake, and must have supposed that they were acting in accordance with law; (7) the error must have been due merely to ignorance of a matter of detail, and not to ignorance of the existence of the whole Biblical law in question. Unless these conditions are present, every one of those who has acted in accordance with the erroneous enactment must bring an individual offering. Chapter 2 - The unintentional sins of the High Priest and King The anointed priest who had interpreted some Biblical law erroneously, and acted accordingly, was required to bring a special sacrifice. The same conditions that governed the case of an erroneous ruling of the court with regard to the practice of the community governed also the erroneous decision of the anointed priest with regard to his own practice. The laws regarding the special sacrifice of the nasi are also discussed in this chapter. Chapter 3 - Precedence In the cases of the anointed priest and the nasi, whose tenure of office is temporary, a question might arise as to the kind of sacrifice they must bring for sins committed before entering their offices, or after leaving them. If the sin was committed before they assumed office, they were both regarded as private individuals. If the sin was committed after they left their offices, the nasi was regarded as an individual, while the status of the anointed priest was unchanged. After the Mishnah has defined the term \\"anointed priest\\" and determined his position in the Temple, it enters upon a discussion of matters of priority — as between man and woman in cases of charity, or as regards the return of a lost object. It then enumerates the various castes among the Jews and their order of priority with regard to the calling up to read the Law, etc. — priests, Levites, Israelites, illegitimates, Nethinim (the alleged descendants of the Gibeonites), proselytes, and freed slaves. However, this priority is overridden by one's level of scholarship or piety: \\"This is only when all other things are equal, but in the case of an ignorant priest and a scholar who is an illegitimate, the latter must precede the priest in all honors.\\"  Talmud  Tractate Horayot in the Babylonian Talmud consists of only fourteen pages. It is the shortest tractate of gemara in the Babylonian Talmud, from among all the tractates of gemara that comprehensively cover the Mishnah in their respective tractates. In many editions it is printed together with tractate Avodah Zarah. The gemara is mainly devoted to the interpretation of the laws of the Mishnah dealing with sacrifices for unintentional sin, with a few aggadic digressions in the third chapter. The commentary attributed to Rashi is more profuse here than in other parts of the Talmud. There is reason to believe that this commentary attributed to Rashi on Horayot was actually composed by the school of Rabbeinu Gershom.See Y.N. Epstein \\"The Commentary on Horayot Attributed to Rashi\\" [in Hebrew] Tabiz 1942 pp. 218-225. The Tosafot published in the Vilna Edition Shas extend only to the first two chapters, the style and method, mainly of an interpretative nature, being very different from those of the tosafot to other books. In the Vilna edition, besides the commentary of Rabbeinu Hananel, there is a commentary called Tosafot HaRosh, attributed to Asher ben Jehiel.  Chapter 1 of Babylonian Talmud Horayot  The first chapter of the Babylonian Talmud tractate Horayot deals with controversies regarding mistaken rulings of the court. The first Mishnah in Horayot discusses the authority of the sages and the responsibility to act autonomously and not follow a misguided ruling. A sage who is expert in halakha and knows that the court was mistaken in its ruling, should not follow a misguided ruling of the court and perform a forbidden action. This applies to an individual who has great understanding of halakha. However, an individual who is not an expert and does not know that the court's ruling is indeed misguided would be exempt from punishment, were he to transgress a commandment through following the court's incorrect ruling.T.B. Horayot 2a From this first Mishnah and talmudic discussion that follows the conclusion is drawn that individuals who are expert in halakha are obligated to weigh their internal truth and autonomous decision before acting on halakhic matters. As one modern writer notes, the \\"inner truth\\" of halakha takes precedence over a court's instructions, especially when the court's instructions require one to transgress halakha. The Mishna calls for experts on halakha to be independent in reaching halakhic conclusions. Ben-David, Yitzchak, \\"Rabbinical Authority vs Personal Responsibility in Religious Zionism\\" in Etzah Laderech, p.17. (Published by Kibbutz Hadati and Ne'emanei Torah Va'Avodah:2010). The gemara rules that each tribe in Israel is considered as a congregation, after the verse \\"And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation.\\" However, the bull that atones for the communal transgression is only brought when the majority of tribes or majority of Israel population err and follow a mistaken ruling. Twelve bulls are offered at the Temple for a sin of the entire people, but if it is a sin of idol worship then twelve bulls and twelve goats are sacrificed.T.B. Hor. 5b-6a The gemara proceeds to further limit the cases in which a court would bring a bull that atones for communal transgression. The only times when the bull is offered to atone for communal transgression is when the entire congregation sinned based on court ruling on a detail of mitzvah prohibited in the Torah; i.e., no bull would be brought if the court annulled an entire negative prohibition and the congregation blindly followed them. Likewise, no bull atoning for communal transgression would be brought if the court ruled on a matter that is so obvious that even the most straightforward reading of the Hebrew Bible would lead one to realize that the court is mistaken. In the language of the Talmud, if the matter is such that even the Sadducees acknowledge it is a prohibited mitzvah in the Torah, no bull would be brought in such a case of communal transgression following a court's unwitting ruling.T.B. Hor. 4a  Chapter 2 of Babylonian Talmud Horayot  The title of chapter two is \\"the Rulings of the Annointed Priest.\\" Chapter two deals principally with the sin offerings that are brought by the High Priest and the king, who is called the Nasi in Lev. 4:22-23. The question arises whether the sacrifices that are brought by the High Priest and the king are due to their unwitting actions as in the case of the people at large, or as a result of mistaken rulings, similar to the court's responsibility. The gemara decides that the High Priest brings the sacrifice only after he rules and then acts on that mistaken ruling in error. The gemara also discusses whether the High Priest and king bring the sliding scale offering, or a provisional guilt offering.  Placement in the Order Nezikin  The topics of Horayot, relating largely to sacrificial offerings, may seemingly have fit well within the Order of Kodashim (holies). In fact, Maimonides codifies the laws of Horayot in his Mishneh Torah in Sefer Korbanot, Hilkhot Shegagot or under the laws of Unintentional Sacrificial Offerings. Maimonides explains the reason that the compilers of the Mishnah decided on placing Horayot last in the Order of Nezikin was because after they dealt with torts and the laws of capital punishment, and then with ethics in Pirkei Avot the sages felt it necessary to include a section on mistaken rulings. Maimonides writes that we are all human and have the capacity for sin, and even the greatest of judges may issue mistaken rulings.

While it is included in the Seder Kodashim, it mainly discusses non- consecrated things and things used as the ordinary human food, particularly meats; it is therefore sometimes called \\"Shehitat Hullin\\" (\\"Slaughtering of Non-Consecrated Animals\\"). It comprises twelve chapters, dealing with the laws for the slaughtering of animals and birds for meat for ordinary as opposed to sacred use, with other rules relating to the eating of meat, and with the dietary laws in general. The rules prescribed for kosher slaughtering, known as Shechita, include five things which must be avoided: there must be no delay; no pressure may be exerted on the knife's moving backwards and forwards; the knife must not be allowed to slip beyond a certain area of throat; there must be no thrusting of the knife under the skin or between the gullet and windpipe; the gullet or windpipe must not be torn out of position in the course of slaughtering. Mishnah The contents of the Mishnah's twelve chapters may be summarized as follows: # When, and by whom, an animal must be killed to be ritually fit for food; the instrument with which the killing must be done; the space within which the incision must be made, and the exceeding of which renders the animal \\"terefah.\\" Incidentally, it discusses the differences between shechitah and melikah (pinching off the heads of birds brought as sacrifices; see , ), and the various degrees in which different vessels are susceptible to impurity. # The organs that must be severed: in quadrupeds, the trachea and the gullet, or the greater part of each, must be cut through; in fowls, cutting through one of these organs, or the greater part of one, suffices. In both cases the jugular vein must be severed. Rules as to the character of the incision follow. Then comes a series of rules regarding animals killed in honor of foreign deities or of deified natural objects: regarding the localities where the formal killing of an animal might create a suspicion of idolatry; regarding the prohibition against using as ordinary food the flesh of animals killed for sacred purposes. # Animals injured by disease, accident, or animal attack. The Mishnah enumerates eighteen diseases and injuries which render an animal terefah, including perforations of the lungs or of the small intestines, and fractures of the spine or of the ribs. It also cites diseases and injuries that do not render the animal terefah, and concludes by listing the signs of kosher animals. # Embryos, living or dead, found in a slaughtered female animal; on the Caesarian section. # The prohibition against slaughtering an animal and its offspring on the same day. If both animals have been consecrated and killed within the Temple precincts, the animal first killed may be used, but not the second; the killer of the second is subject to kareth (cutting off, excision). If neither animal has been consecrated and both have been killed beyond the sacred precincts, the flesh of both may be used for food; but the killer of the second is subject to lashes. To prevent an unwitting violation of this prohibition, the cattle-dealer is required to notify the purchaser of the sale of the mother or the offspring for the meat-market. This notice must be given whenever meat is in greater demand than usual, as on the eve of a festival. # The duty to cover the blood of ritually killed wild animals or birds (), and the material with which it should be covered. This applies only to the blood of animals which, after being slaughtered, are found to be kosher, and only when the killing has been done on legitimate ground. # The prohibition against eating the Gid hanasheh, which is always and everywhere in force, and which extends to consecrated and unconsecrated animals, and to the live young found in a slaughtered mother. # The prohibition against mixing milk and meat; \\"meat\\" includes any animal flesh except fish and locust. As a rabbinic addition, meat and milk should not be placed near each other on the dining- table. # Carcasses and reptiles that communicate impurity by contact; pieces from different parts of a \\"nebelah\\" (piece of carrion) are considered as one piece, and if they are collectively of sufficient bulk they render impure any food with which they come in contact. For example, a piece of skin and a piece of bone or sinew, if together equaling an olive in size, render food otherwise pure to be impure. # The parts of every ritually killed animal which the layman must give to the priest (Foreleg, cheeks and maw), and the rules concerning injured animals that should be presented to the priest or should be redeemed. # The duty of surrendering to the priest the first-fruit of the sheep-shearing (); the differences between this duty and that treated in the preceding chapter; the number of sheep one must possess before this law comes into force; the circumstances under which one is exempt. # The law of Shiluach haken. This law applies only when the mother bird is actually in the nest with her young, and when the birds are nesting in the open, where they can easily escape. Non-kosher birds and \\"Herodian\\" birds (=birds produced by mating different species, said to have been practised by Herod) are not included in this law. Tosefta The Tosefta and the Mishnah correspond in the first seven chapters. Chapter 8 Tosefta corresponds to chapters 8-9 Mishnah; chapter 9 to chapter 10; and 10 to 11-12. On the other hand, the Tosefta is more prolix than its older sister compilation, and sometimes cites episodes from the lives of great men in connection with the subject-matter. Thus, speaking of the forbidding of meat prepared for idolatrous purposes, it quotes the reports of Eleazar b. Dama's last illness and alleged apostasy (see Ben Dama; Eliezer Ben Hyrcanus). Talmud The Mishnah of Hullin is but rarely cited in the Jerusalem Talmud; in fact, only 15 of the 75 mishnayot from the treatise are quoted in the entire Jerusalem Talmud. This is not so in the Babylonian Gemara, which discusses and explains every section of the Mishnah and also much of the Tosefta. It affords a clear insight into the main object of the provisions of this treatise—the prevention of cruelty and pain, and the draining of every drop of blood from the body in order to render the flesh wholesome. An example of the humanitarian motive of this treatise. Samuel of Nehardea established the following rule: \\"When the tabach [butcher] is not familiar with the regulations concerning shechitah, one must not eat anything slaughtered by him\\". Samuel summed up the laws of shechita in the following five mishnaic words: \\"shehiyyah\\" (delaying), \\"derasah\\" (chopping), \\"chaladah\\" (sticking the knife in under the veins), \\"hagramah\\" (cutting in another than the proper part of the animal), and \\"ikkur\\" (tearing; Hullin 1:2; 2:3,4), against all of which one must guard himself.Hullin 9a; see shechita; compare Rabbinowicz, \\"Médecine du Talmud,\\" Introduction As in other tractates, halakhic discussions are interspersed with instructive and entertaining aggadot. In a statement of the marks by which kosher are distinguished from non-kosher animals, a unicorn is mentioned, and is said to be the gazelle of Bei-Ilai. The mention of the latter suggests the \\"lion of Bei-Ilai,\\" and thereupon the compiler proceeds to tell an elaborate story of Caesar (the emperor) and Joshua ben Hananiah (59b et seq.).

It deals chiefly with the exact provisions of the law (Lev. 5:15-16) concerning the trespass-offering and the reparation which must be made by one who has used and enjoyed a consecrated thing. Mishnah In the Mishnaic order this treatise is the eighth, and contains six chapters comprising 38 paragraphs in all. Its contents may be summarized as follows: * Chapter 1: Sacrifices in which trespass can occur; in what parts: in the most holy sacrifices (\\"ḳodshe ḳodashim\\") in all parts and in the partly holy (\\"kodashim kallim\\") in certain parts only. Cases in which trespass can occur and those in which it can not occur. Rule of R. Joshua that if the priests have once had the right to eat of a sacrifice no trespass can take place (§ 1). In this connection the question is raised whether there can be a trespass in the case of those parts of the sacrifice which have been removed from the sanctuary before the sprinkling of the blood (§§ 2-3). Effects of the sprinkling upon the sacrificial animal with regard to trespass (§ 4). * Chapter 2: The time after which a trespass can take place in the various meat-offerings, the different offerings of food, the Pentecostal bread, and the showbread. Closely allied with this is the determination of the time after which the different sacrifices may be invalidated by certain errors, and the period after which one may become guilty of \\"piggul\\" (abomination), \\"notar\\" (leaving something over from the sacrifice), and \\"ṭame\\" (impurity) in connection with them (§§ 1-9), * Chapter 3: An enumeration of many things of which one may not partake, although if he does so, he is not guilty of trespass. This leads to a discussion of other regulations concerning certain of these things, as well as of the question whether and in what case one may be guilty of trespass in connection with objects belonging to or found upon certain consecrated things, such as grass in a consecrated field, the fruit of a consecrated tree (§ 6), and the foliage in a consecrated wood (§ 8). * Chapter 4: The combination of various sacrifices in reckoning the minimum amount necessary to be used in order to constitute trespass (§§ 1-2). In this connection many more kinds of combinations are given with relation to other legal and ritual questions. * Chapter 5: Determination of a peruṭa, the smallest coin, as the minimum value which the use of holy objects must have to make one guilty of trespass. Discussion of the question whether the use made of a consecrated object must be worth a peruṭa or whether the amount of the object consumed by this usage must equal a peruṭa; in connection with which a distinction is made between different objects (§ 1). The commission of trespass by various persons successively upon the same object. * Chapter 6: Cases in which the trespass has been committed by proxy. The principle is laid down that if the agent has acted precisely in accordance with his orders, the person who gave such orders is guilty of the trespass; but if the agent has not so acted, he himself is guilty of the trespass. Enumeration of different examples (§§ 1-5). Cases in which neither of the two is guilty of trespass and instances in which both trespass (§ 4).  Tosefta and Gemara In the Tosefta, Me'ilah is the seventh treatise and has only three chapters. These, however, contain all that is in the six chapters of the Mishnah, with a few omissions and amplifications. The Gemara to this treatise is devoted almost exclusively to elucidations of the mishnayot, there being only one aggadah in the treatise, bearing on the story of Ben Temalion. There is no gemara of the Jerusalem Talmud to this treatise, nor in fact to any treatise of the order Kodashim.Compare Buber, \\"Die Angebliche Existenz eines Jerusal.

The main subject of Tamid is the morning and evening burnt offerings (; ), but it also deals with other Temple ceremonies. Its full name is \\"Olat Tamid\\". The tractate includes information about the Temple Service from sages who had been present at the Temple and witnessed the service. This tractate in the Talmud does not contain disagreements between the sages nor does it have exegetical derivations. It is written as a historical description of the service. Mishnah High Priest Offering Incense on the Altar The Mishnah on Tamid is divided into seven chapters (six in Lowe's edition of the Mishnah), containing 34 paragraphs in all: * Chapter 1: The priests kept watch in three places in the Temple; where the young priests were on guard, and where the older ones slept who held the keys (§ 1); all who sought admission to remove the ashes from the altar were obliged to prepare themselves by a ritual bath before the officer appeared; when he appeared and when he called upon the priests to draw lots (§ 2); the mutual greetings of the priests (§ 3); how the one chosen by lot to remove the ashes from the altar performed his duties (§ 4). * Chapter 2: How the other priests continued the task of cleansing the altar (§ 1); the piling of the ashes, in the center of the altar, into a hillock, which was considered an adornment (§ 2); the supply of fuel for the altar and the kind of wood used (§ 3); the arrangement of the wood and fire in layers (§§ 4-5). * Chapter 3: The drawing of lots for various official duties, such as slaying the tamid, sprinkling its blood, and cleansing the altar and the candlestick (§ 1); the announcement of the time of slaying the morning sacrifice (§ 2); the bringing of the sacrificial lamb, which was given to drink from a golden cup before it was killed; who was charged with taking it to the place of sacrifice (§§ 3-5); the mode of cleansing the inner altar and the candlesticks, together with the statement, in conformity with Ezek. xliv. 2, that no man ever passed through the postern on the southern side of the large door; how the opening of this great portal was heard as far as Jericho, as was the sound of the trumpets and other music of the Temple (§§ 6-9). * Chapter 4: The ritual for killing and dismembering the sacrificial lamb; how the parts of the sacrifice were brought to the altar. * Chapter 5: The daily morning prayer in the Temple, which was supplemented on the Sabbath by a benediction on the division of priests who then completed their duties (§ 1); the drawing of lots for offering incense; the question as to whether one might make this offering twice, and the mode of burning the incense (§§ 2-5); the \\"magrefah,\\" a musical instrument used in the Temple ( see Organ), and the various priestly and Levitical meanings of the signals given on it (§ 6). * Chapter 6: Additional details in regard to offering incense. * Chapter 7: The ritual used in case the high priest himself performed the sacrifice; the mode in which he pronounced the benediction on the people; the divergency of this benediction from that bestowed by the priests outside the Temple, and the music which accompanied the high priest's performance of his functions (§§ 1-3); enumeration of the Psalms sung by the Levites in the Temple on the various days of the week (§ 4). Talmud The extant gemara on Tamid in the Babylonian Talmud covers only three chapters of the tractate (chapters 1, 2, and 4). It is the shortest tractate of gemara in the Babylonian Talmud consisting of only seven pages. There are approximately only 4,600 words in the tractate. It contains several sayings and ethical maxims of importance, as well as stories and legends of much interest. For example: \\"The Pentateuch and the writings of the Prophets and the mishnaic sages contain specific exaggerated expressions which can not be taken literally, such as, 'The cities are great and walled up to heaven' ()\\".Tamid 29a It also contains legends concerning Alexander the Great, his conversation with the sages of the South, his journey to Africa, and his adventures among the Amazons and at the gate of paradise.Tamid 32a-b References ","title":"Tamid"},{"id":"4420020","text":"Robert or Bob Russell may refer to: Politics *Robert Russell (died 1404), English MP for Worcestershire, 1395 *Bob Russell (British politician) (born 1946), former British Liberal Democrat MP for Colchester *Bob Russell (Canadian politician), former leader of the Liberal Party of Alberta and municipal councillor in St. Albert, Alberta *Robert B.

The burning of the heifer and the preparation of the ashes, as well as the fetching of the water and its mixture for sprinkling, were attended by strict ceremonies. The treatise Parah contains a detailed description of these ceremonies, as well as various regulations concerning the purity of the water for sprinkling and its different effects.

It treats of the effects of liquids in rendering foods with which they may come into contact susceptible, under certain conditions, of Levitical uncleanness. There is no Gemara, Yerushalmi or Bavli, to this treatise. Background The laws is based on the Scriptural provision, \\"If any water be put upon the seed, and any part of their carcass fall thereon, it shall be unclean\\" (Lev. 11:38; see 34 et seq.). From this the Rabbis deduce (1) that foods are not susceptible of uncleanness by contact with the carcass of a reptile unless the foods have first been moistened (see Hullin 36a); and (2) that as Scripture, in the passage just cited, uses the expression כי יתן, which, when vowelless, may be read either \\"ki yuttan\\" (= \\"if it be put\\") or \\"ki yitten\\" (= \\"if one will put\\"), and as \\"putting\\" is necessarily the result of intention, \\"being put\\" also must be accompanied by intention (see Bava Metzia 22b). Where this condition is absent the contact of liquid with foods will have no effect. Hence the general rule elaborated in the first chapter following. Mishnah Chapter 1: All liquids (mashkin; see 6:4 et seq.), when originally desired (expected to be beneficial), though ultimately unwelcome, or when the reverse is the case (not desired originally, but ultimately acceptable), predispose loose fruit moistened by them to Levitical uncleanness. Thus if one shakes a tree to bring down some fruit, or a dead reptile, and at the same time some drops of water fall from the tree on fruit lying near by, the water does not come under the law of ki yuttan, or the fruit under liability to uncleanness by contact with a defiling object; but when one's intention is to shake off the rain-water or the dewdrops, the loose fruit moistened thereby becomes susceptible to uncleanness. Where water is used for other than its ordinary purposes, as where one submerges fruit or vegetables to secrete them from thieves, the effect is not to render the fruit liable to defilement. A precedent under this rule is cited from the history of the last days of Judea's struggle against the Romans, when some citizens of Jerusalem secured their fig-cakes from the sicarii by hiding them under water, the Rabbis deciding that, under the circumstances, the submersion did not predispose the food to uncleanness. Similarly, fruit that is floated down a river is not subject to the rule of ki yuttan. Chapter 2: In doubtful cases, objects and conditions are classified by a majority rule. For example, the defiling effects of receptacles of waste water used in common by Jews and Gentiles will depend on the majority using them; if the majority are non-Jews the water will be considered Levitically unclean, but where the majority are Jews the water will be considered Levitically pure. Where these are equally divided the presumption of uncleanness will prevail. The majority rule is not limited to questions of clean and unclean; it serves as a criterion in other matters, ritual and even civil. Chapters 3-6:3 continue the discussion of the main subject in connection with the Scriptural expression \\"ki yuttan.\\" Chapter 6:4-8 enumerates the mashkin which render loose fruit liable to Levitical uncleanness through contact with defiling objects. According to the Rabbis, the term \\"mashkin\\" covers seven kinds of liquid: dew, water, wine, oil, blood, milk, and honey (see Tosefta, Shabbat 8 [9] 24-28, where Scriptural phraseology is adduced to prove the connotation of \\"mashkeh\\"). \\"Water\\" includes discharges of the eye, ear, and other organs.

It gives in detail all particulars of uncleanness and purification, specifies the degrees of the discharges which render an individual subject to the laws stated above, and mentions what persons are subject to those laws and in what way they cause vessels or other people to become unclean. The contents of the respective chapters may be summarized as follows: * Chapter 1: In order to be liable for the full length of impurity, a zav must have his discharge three times, either all on one day or on two or three consecutive days; consideration of the length of the intervals between the discharges. * Chapter 2: All are subject to the laws of Zavim, including proselytes, slaves, minors, deaf-mutes, and eunuchs; description of the different methods by which the zav is examined, and an explanation of the manner in which he makes people and things unclean by his touch. * Chapters 3 and 4: Specification of the different ways in which a man or a woman suffering from a discharge makes unclean another person. For instance, if a zav and a clean person sit together in a small boat or ride together on a beast, even though their garments do not come in contact the clean person becomes unclean by the pressure; but, according to R. Judah, if both of them sit on a tottering bench, the clean person does not become unclean. * Chapter 5: The ways in which a person becomes unclean by touching a zav, and also in which things become unclean through the touch of the zav and by touching other unclean things.

The municipality existed from 1838 until its dissolution in 1964. The administrative centre of the municipality was the village of Halse, which at that time was a suburb of the town of Mandal. It was located in the southern part of the present-day municipality of Mandal. When it was a municipality, it encompassed the rural areas that surrounded the town of Mandal, including many islands such as Hille, Skjernøy, and Pysen (Norway's southernmost point). History Mandals landdistrikt was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). It encompassed all the rural areas surrounding the town of Mandal. In 1865, the name was changed to Halse og Harkmark since those were the names of the two parishes surrounding Mandal. On 1 July 1921, a part of Halse og Harkmark (population: 221) was transferred to the town of Mandal. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee.

Origins In 2002, dissension in the heavy metal band Aria led to Aria members Valery Kipelov (vocals), Sergey Terentyev (guitar), and Alexander Maniakin (drums) leaving the band and joining with former Aria member Sergey Mavrin and bassist Alexey Harkov of Mavrik to form Kipelov. The band was named to make use of the fame of its best-known member, singer Valery Kipelov. Since Kipelov was, essentially, just a revision of Aria, they were able to begin performing immediately. In the fall of 2002, Kipelov toured through Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, including a sold-out concert in Moscow at the end of November at the legendary Gorbunov Palace of Culture. In May 2003, after a brief hiatus from touring, the group performed a concert in the open-air Voel Amphitheatre in Tel Aviv, Israel. On May 24, 2003, as part of a cultural program dedicated to the 300th anniversary of Saint Petersburg, the band performed a concert in Saint Petersburg Stadium. Video and audio versions of this concert were released. New members, venues, and material On October 4, 2003, Kipelov unveiled a new set list featuring the song \\"Babylon\\" at a concert at Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow which was attended by over 10,000 people. \\"Babylon\\" soon rose to a high position on the Heath chart. Valery Kipelov described this concert as the most memorable event of his creative life: \\"It was very important for us, since only a few had believed that, after the breakup of Aria, we would again become big stars.\\" Sergey Terentyev left the band shortly after this concert, and later founded his own bandm, Arteriya. He was replaced by former Strike and Legion guitarist Andrey Golovanov. The new lineup immediately resumed touring. In December 2003, a four-song CD with \\"Babylon\\", \\"Time of Troubles\\", and studio and live versions of \\"I am Free\\" was released through Moroz Records. On March 6, 2004, a concert at Gorbunov Palace of Culture showcased the new line-up to Muscovites. The group continued active work at clubs and, in May, appeared again at newly renovated Saint Petersburg Stadium as part of the city's anniversary celebration. Babylon and The Rivers of Time In September 2005, Kipelov released a video of \\"Babylon\\" directed by Vitaly Mukhametzyanov, who had previously directed videos for Linda, T.O.T.A.L., and others. This video achieved a high ranking on the MTV Russia charts, and the band received the \\"Most Promising Band of 2004\\" award at MTV Russia's Russian Music Awards. In October 2004, Kipelov began another tour in Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia, after which Sergey Mavrin left the band to pursue a solo career. He was replaced by Victor Smolski from the German group Rage, and the band began working on a new studio album, The Rivers of Time. The band worked on The Rivers of Time through the late winter, spring, and early summer of 2005, after which the album was mastered at Gernhart Studios in Germany. With the album mostly completed, Kipelov toured Belarus and Russia showcasing the new material, tour highlights including an appearances at LDS in Saint Petersburg and at Luzhniki Palace of Sports in Moscow, each concert attracting over 11,000 fans. In December 2005, The Rivers of Time was released through CD- Maximum Records. In support of the release, Kipelov again toured in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Israel. The ballad \\"Ya Zdes\\" (\\"I am Here\\") from the new album ranked high in radio charts. Vladimir Yankovskiy shot the video for this song at his Minsk studios. Yankovskiy, who has directed videos for Rage, cast Victor Smolski in the main role in this video. The band released a new single, Na Grani, in March 2009.

The show originated from KTLK 1150 AM in Los Angeles, California. The show was less politically focused and more comedic than the other weekday programs on Air America. It featured interviews (both political and showbusiness), live comedy, and extensive banter between Maron and Jim Earl, Maron's co-host, who provides humorous introductions after each commercial break and plays several of the recurring characters in the show's skits. Format The content of the show was a wide mix. Political segments and interviews similar to those on other shows on Air America were a regular fixture, with a slight focus away from the \\"topics of the day\\" towards a more general feel for the political landscape, and especially environmental, health-related chemical issues and religion. Also featured were interviews with authors, directors and writers, often of political or satirical works, and appearances by comics. The website of the show described it as having \\"a laid-back performance and interview style reminiscent of the Late Show with David Letterman or Late Night with Conan O'Brien, with an emphasis on culture and comedy\\". Comedy skits were a regular feature, with a variety of re-occurring skits and occasional one-off bits. The show's inception came about following the ending of Morning Sedition, Air America's original \\"morning drive\\" show. Maron's contract for the show was not renewed, so he moved back from New York to Los Angeles (where he lives). There KTLK set up The Marc Maron Show, since it had become evident following outcries to Air America by a small but committed fan base that there was an audience for his style of radio. As such, it shared many common characters and themes with Morning Sedition. In addition to Jim Earl also moving to Los Angeles to join the show and bringing all of his segments (Mort Mortensen's Weekly Remembrance, Cardinal Milf Milfington's Rapture Watch, War on Brains, etc.), the show also features Kent Jones's Lawton Smalls character occasionally. Maron's \\"Short Order News\\" is a similar vehicle for topical jokes to the \\"Morning Sedition Cliff Notes\\" from Morning Sedition. The show launched on February 28, 2006 and was broadcast \\"Live\\" from the Marc Graue Voice Over Studios in Burbank, California, until July 13, 2006, originally aired live only on KTLK. From its beginning the show was part of Air America's paid podcasting service. The show was officially scheduled from 1AM - 3AM ET. Due to contractual issues at KTLK, the show was frequently delayed by Los Angeles Clippers broadcasts and postgame shows during the basketball season. As of April 10, 2006, the show moved to being pre-recorded between 5PM - 7PM PT. Syndication by Air America was scheduled to start on April 17, 2006, but changes in the AAR management team delayed that event. Talks between Maron and AAR management continued, according to Maron, and because the management team refused to syndicate the show, Maron chose to exercise an escape clause in his contract when the syndication clause was not honored. Regular features * Marc Maron's Short Order News - Maron's take on the day's news; airs at the top and bottom of the show * Dick (as in Cheney) of the Day - the most reprehensible person of the day as chosen by Maron; airs at the bottom of the show * Liberal Confessional - Maron and callers confess their less-than- progressive moments * Wheel of Anger - Rants by Earl * Weekly Remembrances with Mort Mortensen - Earl disrespects the recently dead * Movie reviews with Svetlana, the Russian prostitute - contributor Iris Bahr Catchphrases * Opening: \\"Good evening, geniuses, philosopher kings and queens, working class heroes, progressive utopians with no sense of humor, lurking conservatives...\\" * Closing: \\"Goodnight, sheeple.\\" * Well used phrases: \\"Neo-con death cult\\", \\"Christo-fascist zombie brigade\\" Guest hosts * Cary Harrison Music * Theme: \\"Sell Out\\" by Reel Big Fish * Bumpers: varies, some regular tunes, but often if a musician is being interviewed, their music will be used instead.

The Yiddish word mandelbrot literally means almond bread, a reference to its common ingredient of almonds. It is typically formed by baking a loaf which is then cut into small slabs and twice-baked in order to form a crunchy exterior. The cookies were popular in Eastern Europe among rabbis, merchants and other itinerant Jews as a staple dessert that kept well.Nathan, Joan. Jewish Cooking in America. Alfred A. Knopf, 1994, p. 353.

The Constitution of Vietnam recognizes the assembly as \\"the highest organ of state power.\\" The National Assembly, a 496-member (in reality 483-member) unicameral body elected to a five-year term, meets twice a year. The assembly appoints the President (head of state), the Prime Minister (head of government), the Chief Justice of the Supreme People's Court of Vietnam, the Head of the Supreme People's Procuracy of Vietnam (or 'Supreme People's Office of Supervision and Inspection'), and the 21-member Government. Ultimately, however, the Communist Party of Viet Nam (CPV) has great influence over the executive and exercises control through the 150-member Central Committee, which elects the 15-member Politburo at national party congresses held every five years. Members of the party hold all senior government positions. Constitutionally, the National Assembly is the highest government organization and the highest-level representative body of the people. It has the power to draw up, adopt, and amend the constitution and to make and amend laws. It also has the responsibility to legislate and implement state plans and budgets. Through its constitution-making powers it defines its own role and the roles of the Vietnamese State President, the Vietnamese Government, the local people's councils and people's committees, the Supreme People's Court, and the Supreme People's Procuracy. The assembly can elect and remove government ministers, the chief justice of the Supreme People's Court, and the procurator general of the Supreme People's Procuracy. Finally, it has the power to initiate or conclude wars and to assume other duties and powers it deems necessary. The term of each National Assembly is five years, and meetings are convened twice a year, or more frequently if called for by the National Assembly Standing Committee. The National Assembly has gradually been more active and covered in Vietnam's political life. Although most legislation still originates from the government, such legislation is now more hotly debated in the National Assembly and attract a larger audience. As of 2009, the most debated legislation issues have included Vietnam's bauxite project in the Central Highlands and Vietnam's plan for new nuclear power stations in Ninh Thuan.  History of the National Assembly of Vietnam  The precursor of the current National Assembly of Vietnam was the National Representatives' Congress (), convened on August 16, 1945, in the northern province of Tuyên Quang. This Congress supported Viet Minh's nationwide general uprising policy against Japanese and French forces in Vietnam. It also appointed the National Liberation Committee () as a provisional government. * The First National Assembly (1946–1960) After a series of events which was later called collectively the \\"August Revolution\\", Viet Minh seized the power all over the country, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (Việt Nam dân chủ cộng hoà) was declared by Hồ Chí Minh in Hanoi on September 2, 1945. On January 6, 1946, the first general election ever in Vietnam was held all over the country in which all people 18 years old or older were eligible to vote. The first session of the First National Assembly (Quốc hội khoá I) took place on March 2, 1946 with nearly 300 deputies in the Great Theatre of Hanoi. Nguyen Văn Tố was appointed as the Chairman of the National Assembly's Standing Committee. The First National Assembly approved Hồ Chí Minh as the head of government and his cabinet, and the former Emperor Bảo Đại as \\"the Supreme Advisor\\". The second session, Bùi Bằng Đoàn was appointed to be the Chairman of the National Assembly's Standing Committee. Tôn Đức Thắng was Acting Chairman from 1948, and from 1955, when Đoàn died, he was Chairman of the Standing Committee. The first and second Constitutions of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam were passed by this National Assembly in 1946 and 1960, respectively. The term of the First National Assembly was prolonged (14 years) due to the war situation in Vietnam, particularly the partition of Vietnam according to the Geneva Accords of 1954. From 1954 to 1976, the National Assembly's activities were only effective in North Vietnam. * The Second National Assembly (1960–1964) Due to the partition of Vietnam]l and the declaration of the Republic of Vietnam in the South, a nationwide general election could not be organized. The Second National Assembly was formed by 362 elected deputies of the North and 91 deputies of the South from the First National Assembly who continued their term. Trường Chinh was appointed as the Chairman of the National Assembly's Standing Committee and held this position until 1981. * The Third National Assembly (1964–1971) The Third National Assembly consisted of 366 elected deputies from the North and 87 deputies continuing their term. The Third National Assembly's term was prolonged due to the war situation. President Hồ Chí Minh died during the Third National Assembly's term, and was succeeded by Tôn Đức Thắng. * The Fourth National Assembly (1971–1975) Four hundred and twenty deputies were elected for the Fourth National Assembly. During fourth term, the U.S. withdrew its troops from Vietnam in accordance with Paris Peace Accords 1973. * The Fifth National Assembly (1975–1976) The Fifth National Assembly consisted of 424 elected deputies. The fifth term was the shortest National Assembly's term as it was shortened to organize the nationwide general election after the re-unification of Vietnam. * The Sixth National Assembly (1976–1981) This was the first election following the reunification of the North and South and the voters selected 492 members, of which 243 represented the South and 249 the North. In this term, the National Assembly adopted the name \\"the Socialist Republic of Vietnam\\" (Cộng hoà xã hội chủ nghĩa Việt Nam) for the re-unified country, merged corresponding organizations between the Government of North Vietnam and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam, and renamed Saigon as Ho Chi Minh City. It also approved the new Constitution in 1980. * The Seventh National Assembly (1981–1987) The Seventh National Assembly and its 496 members witnessed the end of the Vietnamese centralized and heavily- planned economy and the CPV's launch of the Renewal Policy () to adopt market economy. Trường Chinh was elected as Chairman of the State Council and Nguyễn Hữu Thọ was elected as Chairman of the National Assembly. * The Eighth National Assembly (1987–1992) In previous elections, because successful candidates were chosen in advance, the electoral process was not genuine. No one could run for office unless approved by the Communist Party, and in many cases the local body of the party simply appointed the candidates. Nevertheless, every citizen had a duty to vote, and, although the balloting was secret, the electorate, through electoral study sessions, received directives from the party concerning who should be elected. The elections in 1987, however, were comparatively open by Vietnamese standards. It was evident that the party was tolerating a wider choice in candidates and more debate. The 1987 election chose 496 deputies for the Eighth National Assembly. In this term, the National Assembly approved the 1992 Constitution, in which the citizen's personal ownership of properties in business was guaranteed. Lê Quang Đạo was appointed to be the National Assembly's Chairman. * The Ninth National Assembly (1992–1997) The 1992 election established the first National Assembly after the 1992 Constitution came into effect. From this term, the National Assembly's agenda has been filled with law-making procedures to serve the Đổi mới Policy. Nông Đức Mạnh was elected as the National Assembly's Chairman and he served this position until 2001. * The Tenth National Assembly (1997–2002) During the tenth term, Chairman Nông Đức Mạnh was chosen to be the CPV's Secretary-General in its Ninth Congress and ceased his role as the National Assembly's Chairman. Nguyễn Văn An was appointed to replace Mạnh. * The Eleventh National Assembly (2002–2007) National Assembly consisted of 498 elected deputies. On 2002 Nguyễn Văn An elected as the Chairman of the National Assembly. On June 26, 2006, Mr. Nguyễn Phú Trọng was elected as the Chairman of the National Assembly. * The Twelfth National Assembly (2007–2011) The Twelfth National Assembly (2007–2011) had 493 members. In this term, Nguyễn Phú Trọng was elected as the Chairman of the National Assembly.http://www.quochoi.vn/htx/Vietnamese/C1400/C1405/ * The Thirteenth National Assembly (2011–2016) National Assembly consisted of 500 elected deputies. In this term, Nguyễn Sinh Hùng was elected as the Chairman of the National Assembly. NA Vice Chairpersons: Tong Thi Phong, Nguyen Thi Kim Ngan, Uong Chu Luu and Huynh Ngoc Son. *The Fourteenth National Assembly (2016–2021) National Assembly consisted of 496 elected deputies. In this term, Nguyễn Thị Kim Ngân was elected as the Chairwoman of the National Assembly. NA Vice Chairpersons: Tong Thi Phong, Uong Chu Luu, Phung Quoc Hien and Do Ba Ty.

She was India's first woman Chief Minister, serving as the head of the Uttar Pradesh government from 1963 to 1967. Early life She was born in Ambala, Punjab (now in Haryana) into a Bengali Brahmo family. Her father Surendranath Majumdar, worked as a medical officer,a job that required many transfers. As a result, she attended a number of schools, her final degree is a Master’s in History from St. Stephen’s College, Delhi. This was a time when the country’s atmosphere was charged with nationalist sentiments and the freedom struggle was gaining momentum. She was not born with a steely will and exemplary leadership qualities. Rather, she was a shy child, self-conscious about her appearance and intellect, as she points out in her book, An Unfinished Autobiography. It was the age she grew up in and the situations she faced that shaped her personality. Sucheta recounts how, as a 10-year-old, she and her siblings had heard their father and his friends talk about the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. It left them so outraged that they vented their anger on some of the Anglo-Indian children they played with, by calling them names. Her exact words were- “I could understand enough to feel great anger against the British [after hearing about the Jallianwala Bagh massacre]. We [Sucheta and her sister Sulekha] vented out anger on some of the Anglo- Indian children who played with us, calling them all kinds of names,” Both Sucheta and her sister Sulekha were desperate to join India’s burgeoning Independence movement. There is one particularly fascinating incident which Sucheta narrates in her book. After the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, the Prince of Wales had visited Delhi. Girls from her school were taken to stand near the Kudsia Garden to honour the Prince of Wales. Despite wanting to refuse, both the sisters couldn't, and that left them bitterly outraged at their apparent cowardice. “This did not absolve our conscience from feeling shame. We both felt very small of our cowardice,” she writes. Later, while a student of Kinnaird College in Lahore, her Bible class teacher had said some disparaging things about Hinduism. Furious, Sucheta and her sister went home and asked their father to help them out. He coached them on some religious teachings and, the next day, the girls confronted their teacher with quotes from the Bhagavad Gita. The teacher never referred to Hinduism in class ever again! She studied at Indraprastha College and Punjab University before becoming a Professor of Constitutional History at Banaras Hindu University. In 1936, she married J. B. Kripalani, a prominent figure of the Indian National Congress, who was twenty years her senior. The marriage was opposed by both families, as well as by Gandhi himself, although he eventually relented. Freedom movement and independence Like her contemporaries Aruna Asaf Ali and Usha Mehta, she came to the forefront during the Quit India Movement. She later worked closely with Mahatma Gandhi during the Partition riots. She accompanied him to Noakhali in 1946. Mahatma Gandhi wrote on her - She was one of the few women who were elected to the Constituent Assembly of India. She was elected as the first woman CM of state of Uttar Pradesh from the Kanpur constituency . and was part of the subcommittee that drafted the Indian Constitution. She became a part of the subcommittee that laid down the charter for the constitution of India. On 14 August 1947, she sang Vande Mataram in the Independence Session of the Constituent Assembly a few minutes before Nehru delivered his famous \\"Tryst with Destiny\\" speech. She was also the founder of the All India Mahilla Congress, established in 1940. Post-independence Kripalani with (from left to right) Ulla Lindström, Barbara Castle, Cairine Wilson and Eleanor Roosevelt in 1949. After independence, she remained involved with politics. For the first Lok Sabha elections in 1952, she contested from New Delhi on a KMPP ticket: she had joined the short-lived party founded by her husband the year before. She defeated the Congress candidate Manmohini Sahgal. Five years later, she was reelected from the same constituency, but this time as the Congress candidate. She was elected one last time to the Lok Sabha in 1967, from Gonda constituency in Uttar Pradesh. Meanwhile, she had also become a member of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly. From 1960 to 1963, she served as Minister of Labour, Community Development and Industry in the UP government. In October 1963, she became the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, the first woman to hold that position in any Indian state. The highlight of her tenure was the firm handling of a state employees strike. This first-ever strike by the state employees continued for 62 days. She relented only when the employees' leaders agreed to compromise. Kripalani kept her reputation as a firm administrator by refusing their demand for a pay hike. When Congress split in 1969, she left the party with Morarji Desai faction to form NCO. She lost 1971 election as NCO candidate from Faizabad (Lok Sabha constituency). She retired from politics in 1971 and remained in seclusion till her death in 1974.

Description Although the primary focus of self-pity is on the self and one's own emotions, it has a strong interpersonal component as well. In addition to loneliness, subjects may also feel \\"envy, blame, anger, and hostility directed towards others\\". However, it is also common for some people suffering from self-pity to deflect criticism of themselves; they are usually incapable of self-reflection and blame their bad situation on external factors, such as bad luck or other people's supposed resentment.  Effects  The research based on observation on self-pity is very slim, but the research that is available shows that self-pity can be an effect from a stressor of a dramatic event. It can also be shown that aspects of one's personality can have an effect of one's self-pity. This can also be combined with antagonistic views against others as their pity to themselves becomes jealousy to the people around. Even if this can be diagnosed based on an event, it is not restricted towards that alone as anybody can fall victim to feeling sorry for one's self. While looking into the science of psychology, the personalities that mostly respond to experiencing self-pity are moody and most likely experience feelings of anxiety, anger, loneliness, etc. In other words, people that are seen as mentally unstable are more likely to have self- pity for the most of their lifespan. There is also evidence that the effect of self-pity can depend on gender, with women being more vulnerable and more likely to go through with that cause. The focus of where self-pity could rise could come from their past failings or losses and as a result could break down the mind of a person. These people in question could repeat the cycle and continue to beat themselves down to further their pain.  Treatment  When someone goes through the effects of self-pity, it has been seen that these effects can be subsided if one were to think of happy thoughts during the process, it could be beneficial to them and reduce further harm. With the research that is given, it is possible that it can be used to prescribe and tell the difference between a person with anxiety and a person with depression. With how one would deal with self-pity, one could treat their ailment by finding some sort of relief and grow away from further pain.

He was the son of a Soviet journalist, Genrikh Borovik, who worked for many years as a foreign correspondent in the U.S. Journalism Borovik first appeared on Soviet television in late 1980s as one of the hosts of a highly progressive and successful Vzglyad (which literally translates as The View or The Look), a kind of satirical television show watched weekly by as many as 100 million people. The other anchors were Vladislav Listyev, Alexander Lyubimov and Alexander Politkovsky. Borovik was a pioneer of investigative journalism in the Soviet Union during the beginning of glasnost. He worked for the American CBS program 60 Minutes during the 1990s, and began publishing his own monthly investigative newspaper Top Secret, which grew into a mass-media company involved in book publishing and television production. In 1999, Borovik started an investigative program called Versia in partnership with U.S. News & World Report. His Top Secret TV programme often focused on corruption cases involving Russia's political and economic elite. The programme, as well as Borovik's print publications, Top Secret and Versia, were openly critical of Vladimir Putin. Borovik also opposed the First and Second Chechen Wars. His last investigation was about the Russian apartment bombings of 1999, which he and others alleged had actually been orchestrated by the Russian FSB.\\"Incident #1: Borovik's 'Top Secret'\\".

The originally scheduled aircraft was due to depart at 8:00 in the morning of 9 March 2000; however, due to Borovik's planned flight being delayed, Bazhayev offered Borovik a seat on his aircraft. The official investigation into the crash by the Interstate Aviation Committee revealed that whilst snow was removed from the aircraft exterior, de-icing fluid was not applied. The crew did not ask for permission to enter the taxiway, which was done at too high a speed for the icy conditions, and the flaps were set to 11°, instead of 20°. The aircraft reached a speed of 165 km/h, when the crew began to rotate the aircraft, at which stage it reached a 13° angle of attack, and stalled 8–10 metres off the ground, and reached a height of 63 metres, before crashing.

The Vietnamese economy is shaped primarily by the Vietnamese Communist Party through the plenary sessions of the Central Committee and national congresses. The party plays a leading role in establishing the foundations and principles of communism, mapping strategies for economic development, setting growth targets, and launching reforms. Planning is a key characteristic of centralized, planned economy, and one plan established for the entire country normally contains detailed economic development guidelines for all its regions. According to Vietnamese economist Vo Nhan Tri, Vietnam's post-reunification economy was in a \\"period of transition to socialism\\". The process was described as consisting of three phases. The first phase, from 1976 through 1980, incorporated the Second Five-Year Plan (1976–80)--the First Five-Year Plan (1960–65) applied to North Vietnam only. The second phase, called \\"socialist industrialization\\", was divided into two stages: from 1981 through 1990 and from 1991 through 2005. The third phase, covering the years 2006 through 2010, was to be time allotted to \\"perfect\\" the transition. The party's goal is to unify the economic system of the entire country under socialism. Steps were taken to implement this goal at the long-delayed Fourth National Party Congress, convened in December 1976, when the party adopted the Second Five-Year Plan and defined both its \\"line of socialist revolution\\" and its \\"line of building a socialist economy\\". The next two congresses, held in March 1982 and December 1986, respectively, reiterated this long-term communist objective and approved the five-year plans designed to guide the development of the Vietnamese economy at each specific stage of the revolution. The Three-Year Plan (1958–1960)The First Five-Year Plan (1961–1965) The first North Vietnamese Five-Year Plan contained a provision for relocating people from the overpopulated provinces (Red River Delta) to the \\"underpopulated\\" provinces of the delta's mountain rim. Because of the ambitiousness of its original goal the Northern program did not reach its objective. The objective being to resettle each year a number of people corresponding to the increase of population. Between 1961 and 1975 no more than one million people were moved, whilst the population grew by 8 million people.Desbarats, Jacqueline: Population Redistribution in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, in: Population & Development Review, 13, March 1987. The Second Five-Year Plan (1976–80) The optimism and impatience of Vietnam's leaders were evident in the Second Five-Year Plan. The plan set extraordinarily high goals for the average annual growth rates for industry (16 to 18 percent), agriculture (8 to 10 percent), and national income (13 to 14 percent). It also gave priority to reconstruction and new construction while attempting to develop agricultural resources, to integrate the North and the South, and to proceed with communization. Twenty years were allowed to construct the material and technical bases of communism. In the South, material construction and systemic transformation were to be combined in order to hasten economic integration with the North. It was considered critical for the VCP to improve and extend its involvement in economic affairs so that it could guide this process. Development plans were to focus equally on agriculture and industry, while initial investment was to favor projects that developed both sectors of the economy. Thus, for example, heavy industry was intended to serve agriculture on the premise that a rapid increase in agricultural production would in turn fund further industrial growth. With this strategy, Vietnamese leaders claimed that the country could bypass the capitalist industrialization stage necessary to prepare for communism. Vietnam was incapable, however, of undertaking such an ambitious program on its own and solicited financial support for its Second Five-Year Plan from Western nations, international organizations, and communist allies. Although the amount of economic aid requested is not known, some idea of the assistance level envisioned by Hanoi can be obtained from available financial data. The Vietnamese government budget for 1976 amounted to US$2.5 billion, while investments amounting to US$7.5 billion were planned for the period between 1976 and 1980. The economic aid tendered to Hanoi was substantial, but it still fell short of requirements. The Soviet Union, China, and Eastern Europe offered assistance that was probably worth US$3 billion to US$4 billion, and countries of the Western economic community pledged roughly US$1 billion to US$1.5 billion. The Third Five Year Plan (1981–85) By 1979 it was clear that the Second Five-Year Plan had failed to reduce the serious problems facing the newly unified economy. Vietnam's economy remained dominated by small-scale production, low labor productivity, unemployment, material and technological shortfalls, and insufficient food and consumer goods. To address these problems, at its Fifth National Party Congress held in March 1982, the VCP approved resolutions on \\"orientations, tasks and objectives of economic and social development for 1981-85 and the 1980s\\". The resolutions established economic goals and in effect constituted Vietnam's Third Five-Year Plan (1981–85). Because of the failure of the Second Five-Year Plan, however, the Vietnamese leadership proceeded cautiously, presenting the plan one year at a time. The plan as a whole was neither drawn up in final form nor presented to the National Assembly of Vietnam for adoption. The economic policies set forth in 1982 resulted from a compromise between ideological and pragmatic elements within the party leadership. The question of whether or not to preserve private capitalist activities in the South was addressed, as was the issue of the pace of the South's socialist transformation. The policies arrived at called for the temporary retention of private capitalist activities in order to spur economic growth and the completion, more or less, of a communist transformation in the South by the mid-1980s. The plan's highest priority, however, was to develop agriculture by integrating the collective and individual sectors into an overall system emphasizing intensive cultivation and crop specialization and by employing science and technology. Economic policy encouraged the development of the \\"family economy\\"; that is, the peasants' personal use of economic resources, including land, not being used by the cooperative. Through use of an end-product contract system introduced by the plan, peasant households were permitted to sign contracts with the collective to farm land owned by the collective. The households then assumed responsibility for production on the plots. If production fell short of assigned quotas, the households were to be required to make up the deficit the following year. If a surplus was produced, the households were to be allowed to keep it, sell it on the free market, or sell it to the state for a \\"negotiated price\\". In 1983 the family economy reportedly supplied 50 to 60 percent of the peasants' total income and 30 to 50 percent of their foodstuffs. Free enterprise was sanctioned, thus bringing to an end the nationalization of small enterprises and reversing former policies that had sought the complete and immediate communization of the South. The new policy especially benefited peasants (including the overwhelming majority of peasants in the South) who had refused to join cooperatives, small producers, small traders, and family businesses. The effort to reduce the capitalist sector in the South nevertheless continued. Late in 1983, a number of import-export firms that had been created in Ho Chi Minh City to spur the development of the export market were integrated into a single enterprise regulated by the state. At the same time, the pace of collectivization in the countryside was accelerated under the plan. By the end of 1985, Hanoi reported that 72 percent of the total number of peasant households in the South were enrolled in some form of cooperative organization. Despite the plan's emphasis on agricultural development, the industrial sector received a larger share of state investment during the first two years. In 1982, for example, the approximate proportion was 53 percent for industry compared with 18 percent for agriculture. Limiting state investment in agriculture, however, did not appear to affect total food production, which increased 19.5 percent from 1980 to 1984. The plan also stressed the development of small-scale industry to meet Vietnam's material needs, create goods for export, and lay the foundation for the development of heavy industry. In the South, this entailed transforming some private enterprises into \\"state-private joint enterprises\\" and reorganizing some small-scale industries into cooperatives. In other cases, however, individual ownership was maintained. Investment in light industry actually decreased by 48 percent while investment in heavy industry increased by 17 percent during the first two years of the plan. Nonetheless, the increase in light-industry production outpaced that of heavy industry by 33 percent to 28 percent during the same two-year period. The July 1984 Sixth Plenum (Fifth Congress) of the VCP Central Committee recognized that private sector domination of wholesale and retail trade in the South could not be eliminated until the state was capable of assuming responsibility for trade. Proposals therefore were made to decentralize planning procedures and improve the managerial skills of government and party officials. These plans were subsequently advanced at the Central Committee's Eighth Plenum (Fifth Congress) in June 1985. Acting to disperse economic decision making, the plenum resolved to grant production autonomy at the factory and individual farm levels. The plenum also sought to reduce government expenditures by ending state subsidies on food and certain consumer goods for state employees. It further determined that all relevant costs to the national government needed to be accounted for in determining production costs and that the state should cease compensating for losses incurred by state enterprises. To implement these resolutions, monetary organizations were required to shift to modern economic accounting. The government created a new dong in September 1985, and set maximum quotas for the amount permitted to be exchanged in bank notes. The dong also was officially devalued. The Fourth Five-Year Plan (1986–90) The fourth five- year plan continued the previous plan's emphasis on agricultural growth and expansion of exports and light industry. Efforts to promote socialist transformation were to continue, but at a gradual pace and \\"by appropriate forms.\\" Development aid continued to come primarily from the former Soviet Union and other Communist countries. In 1978, Vietnam became fully integrated into the Communist world planning and development structure, and its five-year plans were coordinated with those of its Communist partners. Planned Soviet outlays for the 1986–90 period totaled some $11–13 billion. This aid and trade waned with the decline of the USSR, with the full cutoff occurring in 1991. The country's new economic emphasis, Doi Moi, was instituted by Nguyễn Văn Linh following the sixth national party congress in 1986. His plan included policy and structural reforms for a market-based economic system: price decontrol (liberalized prices), currency devaluation, private sector expansion by de-collectivizing agriculture, legal recognition of private business, new foreign investment laws, autonomy of state enterprises, business accounting methods, devolution of government decision-making in industry to enterprise level, and limiting government participation to macroeconomic issues. Implementation of these policies was achieved with varied success.nationsencyclopedia.com The Fifth Five-Year Plan (1991–95)The Sixth Five-Year Plan (1996–2000)The Seventh Five-Year Plan (2001–05) The Seventh Five-Year Plan's stated purpose was to accelerate economic growth and to bring about a higher quality of life for the people of Vietnam.

Designer apparel, dresses, coats, dress shirts, eyewear, footwear and leather goods were sold under this 'black label' line which represented the top level in the brand pyramid of the various Calvin Klein brands. On March 7, 2019, parent company PVH announced a focus on the numerous less expensive mass market Calvin Klein brands and the discontinuation of the Calvin Klein 205W39NYC runway collections after the contract with designer Simons had been terminated. Overview Calvin Klein Collection was one of several Calvin Klein brands owned by Calvin Klein Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Phillips Van Heusen (PVH). PVH described the Collection as \\"the most prestigious and luxurious brand, setting the tone of elegance and modern sophistication for all of the other Calvin Klein brands.\\"pvh.com Calvin Klein Collection Calvin Klein Collection women's dresses retailed at about US$900–2,000 in the 1990s, but could cost up to $3,000 or more. A men's suit entered at around US$1,300. These prices were significantly higher than those for comparable, mass-produced items in the company's ck label, platinum label (for Europe & Asia only), white label (jeans, underwear, etc.) and sportswear lines. Calvin Klein Collection clothing was traditionally presented bi-annually during New York Fashion Week (womenswear) and Milan Fashion Week (menswear). For the fall/winter 2009-10 shows at New York Fashion Week in February 2009, \\"as a one-off event\\" and at the occasion of the brand's 40th anniversary, Calvin Klein Collection menswear returned to New York City \\"after years of showing in Milan\\".Vogue: Calvin Klein's Homecoming (31 July 2008)men.style.com Calvin Klein Collection Fall 2009 men's (15 February 2009) The spring/summer 2010 collection was shown in Milan again as it had always been clear that “the brand plans to return to the runway in Milan for future shows”.Fashionwireddaily Calvin Klein Bringing Men’s Show Back to New York (29 July 200) Under Raf Simons and with the new name, referring to the address of the company's headquarters in New York, the women's and men's collections were combined into one show during New York Fashion Week. The label sewn into the clothes used to be off-white with black characters until fall 2004. After that, it was black with a tonal logotype. The signature font did not change. From 2017 to 2019, it was a black label with the new name in white characters and capital letters (CALVIN KLEIN 205W39NYC). Licensing and Production Before PVH decided in 2003 to license the Collection business, the design of Calvin Klein Collection had been managed out of the label's West 39th Street headquarters in New York City by Mr. Klein and his design staff, even though the pieces were European-produced. The worldwide license for the Collection was then held from 2003 by Vestimenta SpA, an Italian high-fashion manufacturer, whose bankruptcy led Fingen SpA of Italy (the parent of the licensees for Calvin Klein Jeanswear in Europe and Asia and ck Calvin Klein bridge apparel in Europe) to take over the license starting with the Spring 2006 line in the form of a subsidiary named CMI (Confezioni Moda Italia).Daily News Record: Fingen replaces Vestimenta as licensee for firm's men's (10 October 2005)WWD: Calvin Klein and Fingen said in deal for Collection licence (30 September 2005) In late 2005, the New York- based Warnaco Group, an apparel manufacturer that already cooperates with Calvin Klein in their sportswear and Jeans business on the US market, arranged to acquire the worldwide license from \\"Florence-based Fingen SpA for $286 million\\" for the 2008 to 2013 period.financials.com: Warnaco announces agreement to acquire licensed Calvin Klein businesses in Europe and Asia (20 December 2005)Business Wire: PVH reaches agreement with Warnaco for Calvin Klein, Inc. to assume operation of Calvin Klein Collection business (10 December 2007) However, in December 2007 PVH took design and production duties for the collection back in-house to regain full control of the label and Warnaco instead received the rights to operate Calvin Klein Jeans retail stores in Europe, Asia and Latin America and ck Calvin Klein accessories stores in Europe and Latin America.Reuters: PVH reaches agreement with Warnaco for Calvin Klein (10 December 2007) Designers at Calvin Klein Collection Before the house of Calvin Klein was sold to PVH in late 2002, Mr. Klein himself oversaw the design of the women's and men's collection. After the sale, he functioned as a creative consultant for a short time and was later released from all duties within the company. The creative director for Calvin Klein Collection for women from 2003 to 2016 was Brazilian-born Francisco Costa, a former Gucci designer, who had already worked with Mr. Klein directly before the founder’s departure from the company. Italo Zucchelli, a former Jil Sander and Romeo Gigli designer, had worked as senior designer for menswear at Calvin Klein for six seasons before he served as creative director of the Calvin Klein Collection menswear line from spring 2004 until April 2016. Ulrich Grimm was the creative director of men’s and women’s Collection shoes and accessories. On August 2, 2016, Calvin Klein, Inc. announced the appointment of Raf Simons as Chief Creative Officer of the brand. During his tenure, Simons led the creative strategy of the Calvin Klein brand globally across the Calvin Klein Collection, Calvin Klein Platinum, Calvin Klein, Calvin Klein Jeans, Calvin Klein Underwear and Calvin Klein Home brands. As part of his role as Chief Creative Officer, Simon oversaw all aspects of design, global marketing and communications, and visual creative services. Simons’ first collections debuted for the fall/winter 2017 season. The arrival of Raf Simons as Chief Creative Officer signified “a momentous new chapter for Calvin Klein”, said Steve Shiffman, CEO of Calvin Klein, Inc. “Not since Mr. Klein himself was at the company has it been led by one creative visionary, and I am confident that this decision will drive the Calvin Klein brand and have a significant impact on its future. Raf’s exceptional contributions have shaped and modernized fashion as we see it today and, under his direction, Calvin Klein will further solidify its position as a leading global lifestyle brand.” Simons presented colorful avantgarde collections that were a complete departure from the simple and elegantly monochromatic designs of prior seasons. For his designs, Simons entered into costly collaborations with the Andy Warhol and Robert Mapplethorpe estates, among others. Simons' designs created a lot of media attention and were applauded by fashion critics but turned out not to sell well. In early 2018, PVH began to limit Simons' authority with regard to marketing. His contract was ended in December 2018 after internal disagreements over the strategic alignment of the Calvin Klein brand and its overall image. PVH announced in early March 2019 the discontinuation of the runway collections after it had been communicated beforehand to maintain them. In late March 2019, PVH's CEO announced rising revenue at Calvin Klein after Simons' departure. Calvin Klein Collection Advertising The Calvin Klein Collection advertisements used two \\"house/signature\\" models every season (one male, one female) to advertise the brand, in addition to modeling on the runway. Models for past seasons include Kate Moss, Christy Turlington, Natalia Vodianova, Toni Garrn, Suvi Koponen, and Andrew Stetson. For Fall 2010, Lara Stone was exclusively signed for the women's apparel advertising campaigns for Calvin Klein Collection, as well as ck Calvin Klein and Calvin Klein Jeans. Calvin Klein Collection stores Until its discontinuation in 2019 PVH operated only one store under the Calvin Klein Collection brand: * 654 Madison Ave., New York (flagship store) The Paris store at 53, Avenue Montaigne closed in March 2006 because PVH decided it was unprofitable. It was the label's only international signature outlet owned by PVH. The space is now occupied by German fashion company Escada. A third store in Dallas' Highland Park was closed after 20 years in January 2006 for the same above-mentioned reason. There were other international locations, such as London, Paris, Madrid, Barcelona, Hong Kong, Singapore and Bangkok where Calvin Klein Collection stores or shop-in-shops can be found that are maintained by partners.

It is the art and science of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of conditions, diseases, and disorders of the oral cavity, the maxillofacial region, and its associated structures as it relates to animals. In the United States, veterinary dentistry is one of 20 veterinary specialties recognized by the American Veterinary Medical Association. Veterinary dentists offer services in the fields of endodontics, oral and maxillofacial radiology, oral and maxillofacial surgery, oral medicine, orthodontics, pedodontics, periodontics, and prosthodontics. Similar to human dentists, they treat conditions such as jaw fractures, malocclusions, oral cancer, periodontal disease, stomatitis, and other conditions unique to veterinary medicine (e.g. feline odontoclastic resorptive lesions). Some animals have specialized dental workers, such as equine dental technicians, who conduct routine work on horses. Overview The practice of veterinary dentistry and oral medicine and surgery is performed by veterinarians in accordance with their state veterinary practice acts. Veterinary health-care workers may be allowed to perform certain non-invasive, non-surgical oral and dental procedures under the direct supervision of a licensed veterinarian in accordance with state regulations. As with other areas of veterinary practice, veterinary dentistry requires a veterinarian-client-patient relationship to protect the health, safety, and welfare of animals. One of the most important hallmarks of veterinary dentistry is that it addresses periodontal disease, the most common dental condition in dogs and cats. Pets as young as three years old can show early evidence of periodontal disease, which will worsen if effective preventive measures are not taken. Early detection and treatment are critical, because advanced periodontal disease can cause severe problems and pain. Pain originating from dental problems is very rarely recognized by owners or professionals. Seldom will an animal become anorexic due to a dental problem. The exception to this is in the case of severe soft tissue injury, for example chronic gingivostomatitis. In general, dental pain is a chronic pain, and it is only after treatment that an owner reports how much better their pet is doing. Pain is often mistaken for a pet just getting old. Very few clients examine their pets’ teeth unless they are carrying out daily home care, so actual dental problems often go unnoticed. It is important to recognize symptoms that may have a link to dental diseases, such as a nasal discharge or external facial swellings. In some cases, dental patients may even present with what appear to be neurological symptoms. The main signs of oral disease include : *Halitosis *Broken or discoloured teeth *Changes in eating behaviour *Rubbing or pawing at the face *Ptyalism *Bleeding from the mouth *Inability or unwillingness to open or close the mouth *Change in temperament *Morbidity *Weight loss Most pet owners are not aware that their pet has an oral problem, so an examination of the oral cavity should form part of every physical examination given by the veterinarian. The current AAHA-AVMA Canine Preventive Healthcare Guidelines and AAHA-AVMA Feline Preventive Healthcare Guidelines both include dental care as part of the assessment during annual veterinary examinations. Oral examination in a conscious animal can only give limited information and a definitive oral examination can only be performed under general anaesthesia. Examinations should occur at least once a year to identify any problems and ensure optimal oral health. It is important to examine the whole animal, even when the primary complaint is the mouth. Some dental diseases may be the result of a systemic problem and some may result in systemic complications, including kidney, liver, and heart muscle changes. In all cases, dental procedures require a general anaesthetic, so it is important to establish the cardiovascular and respiratory status and the physiological values of the patient to avoid risks or complications. Radiographs (x-rays) may be needed to evaluate the health of the jaw and the tooth roots below the gumline. Most dental disease occurs below the gumline and is not visible.  Oral abnormalities, anomalies, and defects  Abnormal, anomalous, or defective pet teeth are sometimes encountered in veterinary practice. One or several teeth may be involved and the concern may be for esthetics, function, patient comfort, or a combination of these issues. Causes may be congenital, developmental, or due to lifestyle factors.  Malocclusions  Malocclusion is the imperfect positioning of the teeth when the jaw is closed. In dogs and cats with normal occlusion, the upper incisors rest in front of the lower incisors, the lower canines fit in the diastema between the upper canine and third incisor, the upper first premolars fit behind the lower first premolars, and the upper fourth premolars overlap the lower first molars. Any deviations are known as malocclusions, and they are separated by class. = Class I malocclusion (MAL/1) = Also known as neutrocclusion, MAL/1 occurs when the maxilla and mandible are correctly proportioned, but one or more teeth are misaligned. This type of malocclusion is further classified by type: * Rostral cross bite (RXB) - one or more of the upper incisors are displaced so they rest behind the lower incisors, rather than in front. May be caused by retained deciduous (baby) upper incisors, preventing normal eruption of adult incisors. * Caudal cross bite (CXB) - the mandible is wider than the maxilla in the area of the premolars. Instead of the upper fourth premolar resting against the inner cheek (buccal occlusion) and the lower first molar resting against the tongue (lingual occlusion), the positional relationship is reversed. This is commonly observed in dolichocephalic head types (having a long skull). * Linguoversion (LV) - the lower canines are in the correct anatomic position but are angled inward towards the tongue, which can cause trauma to the palatal tissue (the roof of the mouth). * Mesioversion (MV) - occurs when a tooth is in the correct anatomic position in the dental arch but is angled more forward than normal. * Labioversion (LABV) - occurs when an incisor or canine tooth is in the correct anatomic position in the dental arch but is angled towards the lips. * Distoversion (DV) - occurs when a tooth is in the correct anatomic position in the dental arch but is angled more behind than normal. * Buccoversion (BV) - occurs when a tooth is in the correct anatomic position in the dental arch but is angled outward towards the cheeks. = Class II malocclusion (MAL/2) = Also called distoclusion, brachygnathism, overshot jaw, overbite, and parrot mouth, this occurs when the upper teeth rest in front of the lower equivalents. The maxilla is forward (maxillary prognathism) and the mandible is behind (mandibular retrognathism). It is more common in animals with dolichocephalic skulls, such as Collies. = Class III malocclusion (MAL/3) = English bulldog with underbite Also called mesioclusion, prognathism, undershot jaw, and underbite, this occurs when the upper teeth rest behind the lower equivalents. The maxilla is behind (maxillary retrognathism) and the mandible is forward (mandibular prognathism). It is more common in animals with brachycephalic skulls, such as pugs. This type of malocclusion is also often associated with rostral cross bite. = Other malocclusions = * Level bite - end-to-end bite of the incisors. Genetically is a degree of prognathism. * Wry mouth - refers to a variety of unilateral occlusal abnormalities. Genetically only affects one quadrant of the mandible or maxilla, such as one segment of the jaw being disproportionately sized relative to the other half. * Oligodontia - only a few teeth are present * Anodontia - congenital absence of teeth * Hypodontia - one or a few teeth are missing * Polydontia - presence of more teeth than is normal (supernumerary teeth) * Retained deciduous teeth - occurs when erupting permanent teeth do not push deciduous teeth out. This is common in toy breed dogs.  Oral lesions and masses  Some animals will develop oral lesions, masses, or growths, which may be benign or malignant. These may be caused by tooth or gum infections, tumors, or genetic predisposition. Most pets do not show signs of oral masses until it has grown large enough to make chewing and swallowing difficult. Bad breath, excessive drooling, or bloody oral discharge may also be signs of an oral lesion or mass. = Malignant tumors = *Melanoma - cancerous tumor that spreads to regional lymph nodes and lungs. Bone destruction is usually evident around the tumor. Most commonly observed in dogs; it is rare in cats. *Squamous cell carcinoma - fast-growing tumor that is often ulcerated. It spreads slowly and invades bone tissue. It is the most common oral tumor in cats and second most common tumor in dogs. *Fibrosarcoma - occurs at a younger age than other oral malignancies. It metastasizes slowly but is aggressively invasive. It is the second most common tumor in cats and third most common in dogs. *Osteosarcoma - may affect the bones of the maxilla or mandible. Oral osteosarcoma is more responsive to surgical intervention than the appendicular version. = Nonmalignant tumors = *Epulis - general term for any gingival mass. A biopsy and radiograph is required in order to differentiate the type. * Peripheral odontogenic fibroma - grows from the periodontal ligament. It contains no invasion of bone tissue and has a firm, smooth surface. It may cause tooth displacement. It is the most common benign tumor in dogs. * Peripheral acanthomatous ameloblastoma - a slow growing tumor that has a raised, cauliflower appearance and may transform into a malignant tumor at a later stage. It is usually invaded by surrounding bone tissue and aggressive surgical removal is required. = Resorptive lesions = Also known as feline cervical neck lesions or feline odontoclastic resorptive lesions, these lesions are most commonly observed in the cat but have been identified in other species as well. The lesion usually starts at the cementoenamel junction and furcation area between the roots of a tooth. They appear as an overgrowth of gingival or pulpal tissue. The lesions erode the dentin within a single tooth (or several simultaneously). It spreads rapidly once it reaches the pulp of the tooth. The crown of the tooth may appear normal, but the tooth may have little to no root left. This is a very painful condition. Teeth with resorptive lesions are incurable and cannot be prevented. There is no concrete evidence for the cause, but some studies have suggested they are caused by an excess of vitamin D. Extraction is the only method of treatment.  Developmental conditions  * Gemination - two crowns share one single root canal in an attempt to form two separate teeth from one enamel origin. * Fusion - two tooth buds grow together to form one larger tooth. * Impaction - the inability of the tooth to erupt through the gum. This can cause the development of a fluid-filled cyst surrounding the tooth and destruction to alveolar bone. * Misdirected teeth - teeth that erupt in an abnormal direction. *Enamel dysplasia - insufficient hardness or amount of enamel due to not properly forming. The enamel is soft, flakes off, stains easily, has a rough or pitted surface, and exposes underlying dentin once chipped away.  Oral disease = Periodontal disease  Dog with periodontal disease The most common and significant oral disease is the inflammation of the deeper supporting structures of the tooth and surrounding tissues of the periodontium; it is also called periodontal disease or periodontitis. It begins with the formation of plaque, specifically subgingival plaque within the gingival sulcus or periodontal pocket. This allows a proliferation of bacteria; the subsequent inflammation and the animal's own immune response starts the progression of periodontal disease. The hallmark feature of periodontitis is attachment loss of the tooth from the alveolar bone. Periodontitis is an irreversible process unless the animal is treated with advanced periodontal surgery techniques. Periodontal disease is classified by one of four stages: * Stage 1 (PD1) - characterized by presence of gingivitis. This stage can be treated with dental scaling, polishing, irrigation, and home health care. * Stage 2 (PD2) - early periodontal disease with less than 25% attachment loss of the tooth from the alveolar bone. The treatment for this stage includes the addition of locally applied antimicrobials and subgingival scaling. * Stage 3 (PD3) - established periodontal disease with 25-50% attachment loss of the tooth from the alveolar bone. Treatment includes teeth extraction, closed or open root planing, or advanced periodontal treatment options like guided tissue regeneration. * Stage 4 (PD4) - advanced periodontal disease with more than 50% attachment loss of the tooth from the alveolar bone. Extraction of teeth or periodontal surgery, including osseous resective or additive procedures, are necessary. The prognosis for this stage is guarded. = Consequences of periodontal disease = Periodontal disease eventually culminates in tooth loss; however, significant health problems can precede this.  Local consequences * Oronasal fistulation * Class II periodontal-endodontic lesion * Eye abscessation and infection * Jaw fracture *Osteomyelitis * Oral cancer  Systemic consequences * Liver - Bacteremia from periodontal disease can cause inflammation of the hepatic tissue, portal vein fibrosis, and cholestasis. * Kidney - Chronic stimulation of the immune system can lead to immune complexes in the kidney, causing glomerulonephritis, chronic kidney inflammation and secondary scarring, decreased kidney function and ability to filtrate, and chronic kidney disease. * Heart - Bacteria in the bloodstream attach to the heart valves. This causes cardiopulmonary changes like an increased risk of endocarditis, hypertension, and roughening of the epithelium of the heart tissue. * Metabolic - Increased inflammatory proteins may lead to insulin resistance.  Gingivitis  Gingivitis is the earliest stage of periodontal disease. It is the inflammation of the gingiva and is caused by bacterial plaque. It is reversible and preventable. Gingivitis appears as a thin red line along the margin of the gums and may be accompanied by swollen gum margins, bad breath, plaque and tartar. The earliest clinical sign of gingivitis is bleeding on probing, chewing, or brushing. Dental cleaning In dogs, as in humans, daily tooth brushing is considered the gold standard for at-home prophylaxis and prevention of gingivitis and periodontal disease progression. However, a Swedish study with over 60,000 respondents reported that only 4% of dog owners brushed their dog's teeth daily. Basic dental cleaning under general anesthesia includes scaling to remove dental plaque, tartar, and calculus deposits, as well as polishing to smooth out microabrasions caused by the dental equipment and normal wear and tear. Endodontic procedures such as tooth extractions and root canals are also performed.  Dental instruments  Dental instruments are tools used to provide dental treatment. They include tools to examine, manipulate, treat, restore, and remove teeth and surrounding oral structures. = Hand instruments = * Curette - used for removing calculus above and below the gumline. It is also used for root planing. It has a U-shaped cross section and the tip is rounded with up to two sharp edges. The two most commonly used types are the Gracey curette and the Universal curette.Tighe, M. & Brown, M. (2015). Mosby's Comprehensive Review for Veterinary Technicians. St. Louis, MO: Elsevier. * Sickle scaler - used for removing calculus above the gumline, as well as removing calculus from pits, fissures, developmental grooves, and areas between each tooth. The blade can be straight or curved with a sharp tip and two cutting edges on either side. * Explorer - used to examine the surface of the tooth to detect any abnormalities, such as resorptive lesions, caries, or fractured teeth. It is also used to assess tooth mobility. The most common type is the Shepherd's hook. * Periodontal probe - used to measure gingival recession, which ascertains the stage of any periodontal disease. It has a blunted tip that is marked in 1 mm increments. The probe is inserted into the gingival sulcus to measure its depth. * Elevator - used to stretch, cut, and tear the periodontal ligament in order to displace the tooth root from the socket. The tip has a rounded scoop appearance with a sharp edge, which may or may not be serrated. * Luxator - used to cut the periodontal ligament around the tooth; it is not used for leverage. It is similar to a dental elevator in design but has a thinner tip to allow easier access to the periodontal ligament. *Extraction forceps - used for gripping and removing the tooth after it has been loosened. It can also be used for cracking and dislodging heavy dental calculus. = Power instruments = * Ultrasonic scaler - used for removing calculus above the gumline. It utilizes a removable tip that vibrates at high frequencies by converting sound waves into mechanical vibrations, allowing for more rapid removal of calculus. It generates a substantial amount of heat and may cause thermal damage to the pulp if left on the surface of the tooth for too long. * Sonic scaler - used for removing calculus above the gumline. It utilizes compressed air and operates at lower frequencies than an ultrasonic scaler. It is also less likely to cause thermal damage. *Low-speed handpiece - utilizes a rubber tip called a prophy angle that polishes microabrasions and small grooves on the surface of the tooth. *High-speed handpiece - utilizes a variety of removable dental burs to section teeth and remove alveolar bone during extractions.

Its members are elected from among National Assembly deputies. Between 1980 and 1992, the Standing Committee served as the collective head of state, as the office of President was abolished. Council of State (1980–1992) The Council of State was \\"responsible and accountable\\" to the National Assembly, according to Chapter VII of the 1980 Constitution. It played a more active role than the presidency it replaced, and, in addition, it assumed the day-to- day duties of the former Standing Committee of the National Assembly under the old constitution. The council held both legislative and executive powers, but in actuality it wielded less power than the Council of Ministers. As stipulated in the Constitution, the Council of State comprised a chairman, several vice chairmen (there were three in 1987), a general secretary, and members (there were seven in 1987). Members of the Council of State could not be concurrently members of the Council of Ministers. Its chairman concurrently commanded the armed forces and chaired the National Defense Council, which controlled the armed forces. The Council of State nominally presided over the election of deputies to the National Assembly; promulgated laws and issued decrees; supervised the work of the Council of Ministers, the Supreme People's Court of Vietnam, the procurator general of the Supreme People's Organ of Control, and the People's Councils at all levels; it decided, when the National Assembly is not in session, to form or dissolve ministries and state committees and to appoint or dismiss the vice chairmen of the Council of Ministers, ministers, and heads of state committees; it could declare a state of war, and order general or local mobilisation in the event of invasion. Such decisions, however, needed to be submitted to the next session of the National Assembly for ratification. The five-year term of the Council corresponds with that of the National Assembly, but the Council continued its functions until the new National Assembly elected a new Council of State. However, this collective arrangement proved unwieldy, and in 1992, a new constitution was passed, reforming the Executive in the opposite direction: The office of President was reinstated, the Council of State reverted to being the Standing Committee of the National Assembly, and the Council of Ministers - itself also a collective body - was replaced with a cabinet, headed by a Prime Minister with wide amount of control over the executive.

The saddle-shaped dorsal blotches are reddish brown, except for near and on the tail, where they are dark brown or blackish. The rostral is about as long as it is broad, not elongated as in other Pituophis subspecies.Smith, H.M., and E.D. Brodie, Jr. 1982. Reptiles of North America: A Guide to Field Identification. Golden Press. New York. 240 pp. (paperback). (Pituophis melanoleucus affinis, p. 186.) Habitat It primarily inhabits the Sonoran Desert ecosystem of the Southwest USA, and into northern Mexico. Diet They feed on small rodents, hence the common name gopher snake. Behavior They are fairly aggressive but can be domesticated, and become very gentle. They have hard tough skin on their noses used to burrow into gopher holes and the burrows of other rodents. During the winter they hibernate. They invade gopher holes and holes of other burrowing rodents and eat what they need to stay alive in the invaded burrow. Reproduction P. c. affinis is oviparous. Adult females lay 7-22 eggs in July or August. The eggs average . The hatchlings are about in total length. ReferencesFurther reading * Hallowell, E. 1852.

He was elected in the Toronto riding of Dovercourt in 1948. Background Park was born in Monkstown, County Cork, Ireland in 1916. His father, Robert Park Sr., was in the Royal Navy and on manoeuvers at the time of his son's birth. Catherine Mary Park left Portsmouth, England to be with her family in Ireland to have the baby. George was the eldest of four children; Catherine (called Kae), Thomas and Robert Jr. followed. In 1925 the family moved to Wales where Robert Park was working as a foreman at a mine. A long strike led the Parks to decide to move to Canada. They arrived in Toronto, Ontario in 1927. George attended high school in Toronto and graduated from De La Salle Academy. Upon graduation he got involved with the labour movement, becoming a staff member at the United Steel Workers and an activist with the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation. It was during this time he dropped his first name and began to use the name Eamon instead. During World War II, Park was living in Ottawa and met and married Anne Clare, a social worker originally from Winnipeg Manitoba. They had two children; Patricia Anne and Kevin Robert. His wife Anne returned to Canada and remained an NDP activist until her death in January 1991. Both of their children followed in the Park family footsteps. Patty is a social worker, who also worked for the NDP government in Ontario in the 1990s. Her first husband, Dick Proctor, later became federal secretary of the NDP and a Member of Parliament for Saskatchewan. Her current husband, Murray Weppler, is a former executive assistant to federal NDP leader Ed Broadbent and Ontario leaders Michael Cassidy and Bob Rae. Kevin Park became a union activist, working for the United Food and Commercial Workers and the Canadian Auto Workers union. He worked on staff at the British Columbia Government Employees Union in Vancouver. He died in Vancouver in 2007. Kevin's twin children are carrying on the family tradition. Gareth Robert is a social worker in Ottawa, currently working with the Canadian Mental Health Association. He was a delegate to the 1989 NDP convention, making him the third generation of Parks to vote at an NDP gathering, and worked for Howard Hampton when he was an Ontario cabinet minister. Megan Kathleen is on staff at the Ontario Public Service Employees Union in Toronto and also worked for an NDP cabinet minister in the 1990s. Politics In 1948 Park was elected as the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (Ontario Section) (CCF) member of the Ontario legislature for the Toronto riding of Dovercourt. He ran in the 1951 election and was defeated. He ran in the federal election of 1968 as the NDP candidate for York East in Toronto but was defeated, coming in third with 27.47% of the vote. CCF/NDP organizer Park continued his work with the union and the party, holding many roles within the provincial and national CCF infrastructure. Following the federal party's crushing defeat in the 1958 federal election, it was decided that the Canadian Labour Congress would align itself with the CCF to form a new political party. Park was a CLC representative on the Political Action Committee. The reborn group was first called The New Party, adopting a suggestion made by Park, later to become the New Democratic Party. At the NDP founding convention in 1961, Park was elected as secretary of the NDP executive. From 1965 to 1967 he served as president of the federal party. In 1972 the Canadian government appointed Park as labour attache to the High Commission of Canada to the United Kingdom. He also had responsibility for labour relations with Sweden. He died in London on 28 April 1975. His ashes were interred alongside his wife's in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto.

A boulevard for the vast majority of its length, Outer Drive includes travel through beautiful subdivisions, school sites, and park areas. First proposed in 1918, it immediately won acceptance and eventually evolved into the thoroughfare which exists today.

Outer Drive then resumes on Detroit's east side, over-taking State Fair Avenue, Conner Avenue, Alter Road, Chandler Park Drive, and Whittier Avenue, with its eastern terminus at Mack Avenue at the northern edge of the City of Grosse Pointe Park, but not actually entering that city.

She was a deaconess of the early church. According to legend, she was the daughter of a Roman civil servant who was secretly Christian, and raised his daughter in the faith, and she became a deaconess in the church. This was dangerous, and one day the jurist Ulpian captured Tatiana and attempted to force her to make a sacrifice to Apollo. She prayed, and miraculously, an earthquake destroyed the Apollo statue and part of the temple. Tatiana was then blinded, and beaten for two days, before being brought to a circus and thrown into the pit with a hungry lion. But the lion did not touch her and lay at her feet. This resulted in a death sentence being pronounced, and after being tortured, Tatiana was beheaded with a sword on January 12, around AD 225 or 230. Veneration Painting showing the beheading of Tatiana of Rome from the Menologion of Basil II (c. 1000 AD) Tatiana is venerated as a saint, and her feast day is on January 12 (for those churches which follow the traditional Julian Calendar, January 12 currently falls on January 25 of the modern Gregorian Calendar). The miracles performed by Saint Tatiana are said to have converted many people to the fledgling religion. Saint Tatiana is patron saint of students. In Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine, Tatiana Day is semi-formally celebrated as \\"Students' Day.\\" The similarity of her life with those of Martina and Prisca has led some to question whether they may even all be the same person, or if perhaps similar hagiographies were assigned to them posthumously. There is no early evidence of veneration of either Martina or Tatiana in Rome, and Prisca (or Priscilla) is hard to identify. References *Attwater, Donald and Catherine Rachel John.

Since Vietnam is a one-party socialist republic, the judiciary falls under the leadership of the Communist Party of Vietnam, and judges and procurators are all members of the Party. The judiciary is nominally accountable to the National Assembly of Vietnam, which is the highest institution of government power in the country. Structure The judicial system of Vietnam comprises the \\"people's courts,\\" military tribunals, and people's procuracies. The highest court in the country is the Supreme People's Court. Underneath the Supreme People's Court are three levels of courts: the superior people's courts (toà án nhân dân cấp cao), of which there are three; the provincial-level people's courts (toà án nhân dân cấp tỉnh), of which there are 63; and district-level people's courts (toà án nhân dân cấp huyện), which is the lowest level. The superior courts are appellate courts based in Hanoi, Danang, and Ho Chi Minh City, each responsible for the northern, central, and southern region of the country, respectively. Provincial and municipal courts are both trial courts and appellate courts, while district courts are trial courts. There are military tribunals established at various levels in the Vietnam People's Army, the highest one being the Central Military Tribunal, which is subordinate to the Supreme People's Court. The Supreme People's Court is headed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme People's Court (Chánh án Toà án nhân dân tối cao), who is appointed by the National Assembly of Vietnam. The people's procuracies (also known as the people's office of inspection and supervision, viện kiểm sát nhân dân) serve as the prosecutorial authority in Vietnam. They also have the responsibility to supervise and inspect judicial compliance by government agencies and officials. There is a people's procuracy for every people's court, and the military has its own military procuracies. The highest procuracy is the Supreme People's Procuracy (Viện Kiểm sát nhân dân tối cao), headed by the Chief Procurator of the Supreme People's Procuracy (Viện trưởng Viện Kiểm sát nhân dân tối cao), who is appointed by the National Assembly. Criticisms Although the constitution provides for independent judges and lay assessors (who lack administrative training), the U.S. Department of State maintains that Vietnam lacks an independent judiciary, in part because the Communist Party of Vietnam selects judges and vets them for political reliability. Moreover, the party seeks to influence the outcome of cases involving perceived threats to the state or the party's dominant position. In an effort to increase judicial independence, the government transferred local courts from the Ministry of Justice to the Supreme People's Court in September 2002. However, the Department of State saw no evidence that the move actually achieved the stated goal. Vietnam's judiciary also is hampered by a shortage of lawyers and rudimentary trial procedures. Death penalty The death penalty often is imposed in cases of corruption and drug trafficking. As of February 2014, the death penalty remains a punishment that can be applied to those who have been found guilty of criminal activity. In January 2014, a court in northern Vietnam sentenced 30 Vietnamese citizens to death after they were found guilty of heroin trafficking—the largest number of defendants sentenced to death in a single trial in the country's legal history. At the same time, there are around 700 people awaiting on death row in Vietnam. The January 2014 decision received condemnation from numerous international organizations, such as the World Coalition Against the Death Penalty.

Fort Pickett is a Virginia Army National Guard installation, located near the town of Blackstone, Virginia. Home of the Army National Guard Maneuver Training Center, Fort Pickett is named for the United States Army officer and Confederate General George Pickett. Fort Pickett is one of ten U.S. Army installations named for former Confederate Generals.  Beginnings  Late in 1941 a team of Army surveyors visited the site of a former Civilian Conservation Corps camp near the small rural town of Blackstone, Virginia. There they found enough land, water and other resources needed to establish a post large enough to simultaneously train more than one infantry division. The site also offered easy railroad access to both mountain and coastal training sites. By December, 1941, of land in Nottoway, Dinwiddie, Lunenburg and Brunswick Counties were acquired and cleared to prepare for construction of the first buildings. Elements of the Virginia National Guard had their first taste of what is now Fort Pickett on Dec. 6–7 when the 1st Battalion, 116th Infantry, camped here on the way back to its home station at Fort Meade, Maryland, having completed a series of war games in North Carolina.  World War II  Two rail spurs were built into the camp in 1942–1943 to increase logistical efficiency and the rapid movement of troops on and off post. Air transportation to and from Pickett became available with the completion of a Blackstone Army Airfield in late 1942. The tower was placed beside the only hangar built on post, and its steel beam frames and cinder block foundation are still visible today. Since each cement runway was 5,269 feet long and 300 feet wide, the four-runway airfield was large enough to allow the safe landing of the Douglas C-47 \\"Gooney Bird.\\" Fighter planes could use the runway in an emergency, although none were stationed at the airfield. Aircraft fuel was delivered by rail and contained in fuel trucks, since permanent storage tanks were not constructed until after World War II. The airfield remained virtually unchanged until the 1990s. By the end of 1942, more than 1,400 buildings were completed and in use across the post, including approximately 1,000 enlisted barracks and 70 officer's quarters. Twelve chapels, the post hospital complex (later greatly expanded) and six firehouses were built, along with warehouses, headquarters and administrative buildings. To assure an adequate water supply for the post and its potential 60,000-soldier population, the Army built and maintained its own water pumping, filtration and sewage treatment plants. In the 1980s the Army transferred control and operation of these facilities to the town of Blackstone. For recreation, there were four movie theaters (two more were added later), a field house with a gym, several enlisted clubs, a main post exchange and several \\"satellite\\" PXs. By the war's end, more than 300 additional buildings were constructed, including a female barracks and facilities for two prisoner-of-war camps.  Cold War and beyond  Marines unload M1A1 Abrams tanks at Fort Pickett in preparation of field training. Although Camp Pickett seemed destined to once again be closed after the conclusion of the war, the demands of the Cold War and the need to train division-sized reserve component units in the mid-Atlantic region brought a redefined role for the post. By 1960, portions were being revamped to house battalions coming for a week or two each year to conduct specialized training. This included not only Guard/Reserve commands, but also Navy and Marine Corps personnel. These components still use Pickett's facilities today under Virginia National Guard control. The predecessor to the Virginia National Guard Maneuver Training Center was organized and stationed at Pickett in 1961. Its primary mission, then as now, was to store and maintain pieces of equipment such as tanks and other armored vehicles that visiting units could use, rather than incurring the high cost of bringing their own machines from home station. Pickett experienced two significant interrelated events in 1974. The first was its redesignation from \\"Camp\\" to \\"Fort Pickett\\" as a reflection of its new mission to offer training opportunities, not only to Reserve units, but also active duty forces on a yearly basis. The second important event was the completion of the first new building on the post since the Korean War. Building 467 contained space to house enlisted personnel, a mess facility, and administrative offices. It was built of brick. Ten years later, a new complex of barracks and support structures was completed. Large enough to house an entire brigade, the complex was dedicated June 8, 1984, in memory of Tech. Sgt. Frank D. Peregory of the 116th Infantry, 40 years to the day after he earned the Medal of Honor during the D-Day invasion. Other upgrades of facilities included a doubling of the existing telephone system from 2,600 to 5,100 lines in 1991 and renovation and extension of the Blackstone Army Airfield's runways in 1994 to allow use by C-130 and C-17 transport aircraft. This permitted easy access for airmobile troops and equipment coming to Fort Pickett for training. In more recent years, other structures were added or converted to meet the post's changing missions. Among these were a new firehouse and renovations on the remaining NCO Club, making it more of a community center where local town events as well as post functions are held. Good community relations have always been important to the success of Fort Pickett. From its very beginning, the post has dramatically changed the lives of the citizens of Blackstone. It has created a number of good jobs and supported the town in a variety of other ways, from hosting elderly fishing trips at the on-post lakes to Fourth of July celebrations. Boy and Girl Scouts organizations also have camped, fished and hiked the nature trails for many years. Currently, many activities attract a large number of local citizens and former staff and personnel who had been stationed there during the war. Fort Pickett is also the home of an annual exercise with elements of 36 Canadian Brigade Group, located in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. Exercise \\"Southbound Trooper\\" is a joint exercise between the Canadian Forces Primary Reserves and Virginia National Guard that helps forge solid NATO doctrine between the two militaries. Soldiers from 37 Canadian Brigade, located in New Brunswick and Newfoundland also hold an annual exercise \\"Maritime Raider\\", usually shortly after Southbound Trooper. While the facilities at Pickett are geared to train military personnel and units, non-military organizations use them too. These include the United States Marshals Service, FBI, ATF, the Virginia Wing of the Civil Air Patrol, Virginia State Police and local law enforcement agencies. The decision to inactivate the regular Army garrison at Fort Pickett and turn over operation of the post to the Virginia National Guard was finalized in 1995 and enacted in 1997. Since that time no regular Army personnel have been assigned to Pickett for the first time since January 1942. The 183rd Regiment maintains the Virginia RTI at Fort Pickett. Today Fort Pickett has 42,000 acres of Maneuver areas and provides many state of the art facilities such as live fire range, a forward operation base, urban assault, training villages, EST 2000 and several other training facilities.http://vko.va.ngb.army.mil/fortpickett/mtc/garrison/aboutus/aboutus.htm References External links  * Fort Pickett (GlobalSecurity.org) * Fort Pickett Army National Guard Maneuver Training Center Category:Brunswick County, Virginia Category:Dinwiddie County, Virginia Pickett Category:Lunenburg County, Virginia Category:Buildings and structures in Nottoway County, Virginia Category:Civilian Conservation Corps in Virginia Category:Installations of the United States Army National Guard Category:1942 establishments in Virginia Category:Military installations established in 1942 ","title":"Fort Pickett"},{"id":"4420352","text":"Saint Aldric (c. 800 - 7 January 856) was Bishop of Le Mans in the time of Louis the Pious. Life Aldric was born of a noble family, of partly Saxon and partly Bavarian extraction, about the year 800. At the age of twelve he was placed by his father in the court of Charlemagne, in the household of his son Louis the Pious at Aix la Chapelle. Aldric was highly esteemed by both monarchs, but at the age of twenty-one he withdrew to Metz and became a priest. He was then recalled to the court by Louis, who took him as his chaplain and the guide of his conscience.Campbell, Thomas. \\"St. Aldric.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 1.

CatholicSaints.Info. 18 May 2012 Apart from being conspicuously virtuous, he showed a practical turn in building aqueducts and ransoming captives, as well as building new churches and restoring monasteries. In the civil wars which followed the death of Louis, Aldric's loyalty to Charles the Bald resulted in his expulsion from his see, and he withdrew to Rome. Gregory IV reinstated him. In 836, as an emissary of the Council of Aix la Chapelle Aldric visited Pepin I, who was then King of Aquitaine, with Erchenrad, Bishop of Paris, and persuaded Pepin to order that all the possessions of the Church which had been seized by his followers should be restored. Aldric's episcopate lasted for twenty-four years, and during his lifetime he took part in the Councils of Paris in 846 and Tours in 849. The two last years of his life he was confined to his bed by a palsy. He died at Le Mans on 7 January 856 and was buried in the church of Saint Vincent, having been bishop for twenty-four years.

The former municipality is now part of Ypres. History On 3 March 1914 the then municipality was granted the arms are those of the last Lords of Zillebeke, the Canton family, Viscounts of Winnezeele, which had in 1740 acquired the Ancien Régime estate of Zillebeke. In World War I, like other parts of Ypres, it was the site of bipartisan heroism, with Victoria Crosses being won by two soldiers in the area, John Henry Stephen Dimmer and John Franks Vallentin, both in 1914. The village was mentioned in the Wipers Times, the most well- known of the trench magazines that were published by soldiers fighting on the front lines of the Great War. The 1st Battalion of The Irish Guards suffered huge casualties defending the village and playing a major part in stopping the German breakthrough to the Channel Ports between 1 and 11 November 1914 as part of the First Battle of Ypres. Located in or close to Zillebeke are Hill 60, the Hill 62 Memorial, The Bluff, the Sanctuary Wood Museum Hill 62 and the Sanctuary Wood CWGC Cemetery. Within Zillebeke Churchyard CWGC Cemetery, which forms part of the churchyard at Zillebeke Catholic parish church, there is a section with war graves of soldiers from aristocratic backgrounds; this plot is called The Aristocrat's Cemetery.

Fureai () is a Japanese term to refer to the formation of emotional connection between people of different age group and/or profession within the community. Linguistic definition The word \\"Fureai\\" is composed of \\"Fure\\" (of \\"Fureru\\" (), to touch/contact) and \\"ai\\" (, a sign to show the mutuality). \\"Fureai\\" approximates the English expressions for \\"mutual touch\\" or \\"mutual contact\\". Generally, the word \\"Fureai\\"\\" is used in the following contexts: * Only applied for socially-beneficial realms (such as welfare, education and environmental protection) * Evaluates emotional relationship while excluding exchange of technical knowledge and/or arrangement of political/economic interests * makes it necessary that humans (or between human(s) and animals) keep in face to face contact, excluding connections by Internet, mobile phones and other IT devices. The following are examples of correct usage in Japan: * Fureai between children and carers at a kindergarten * Fureai between children and animals at a zoo * Fureai with Nature * Fureai between an enka singer and the elderly * Fureai between nurses and patients The following examples would not be correct Japanese usage: * Fureai by way of Internet * Fureai between Yakuzas and Politicians * Fureai between executives of local businesses * Fureai among IT experts History of usage \\"Fureai\\" is a relatively recent addition to Japanese, first usage recorded in the 1970s and 1980s. The acceptance of Fureai reflects Japan's socioeconomic transformation, particularly the collapse of traditional communities. Most Japanese had been living, since its economic growth in 1950s and 1960s, in their rural community with agriculture, fishing and/or forestry as its main industry, with their own extended family where the elderly lived together with their offspring, but the popularization of nuclear family and individualism made some people, especially the elderly, suffer from social exclusion. The traditional childrearing method also disappeared as a result of such a social change, giving rise to delinquency in the adolescence and the concept \\"Fureai\\" became popular in Japan as a means to solve such social issues by trying to create their emotional relationship. Difference from \\"Solidarity\\" Some may argue that \\"Fureai\\" is similar to \\"Solidarity\\", however the latter refers to the union of people in order to achieve a common social goal. \\"Fureai,\\" on the other hand, does not imply any goal but merely to offer some emotional connection.

In mid-1942 it was transferred to Tontouta, New Caledonia and then to Turtle Bay Airfield on the island of Espiritu Santo in the British-French Condominium of New Hebrides prior to the invasion of Guadalcanal. While flying the Grumman F4F Wildcat during World War II, the squadron participated in numerous Pacific campaigns including Guadalcanal, Southern Solomons, Santa Cruz, Luzon, and the Southern Philippines.

In late April 1951 the squadron was transferred to Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, California. With the aircraft transition complete, the squadron was re-designated Marine Attack Squadron 251 (VMA-251) on April 25, 1951. VMA-251 embarked to Korea in June 1953. Although the squadron only saw action the last two weeks of the war, it flew 310 combat sorties totaling more than 550 hours and had the distinction of having the last Marine aircraft engaged in combat during the Korean War on 27 July 1953. VMA-251 remained in Korea for two and a half years providing air defense along the Korean Demilitarized Zone. In January 1956, the Thunderbolts relocated to Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan and remained in the Far East for fifteen months. In 1957, VMA-251 was again relocated to Marine Corps Air Station Miami, Florida flying the FJ-4 Fury. With the transition to the FJ-4 came the re-designation to VMF-251 on April 20, 1957. In April 1958 VMF-251 was moved to Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, California to receive its first supersonic fighter, the F8U Crusader.

In 1961, VMF-251 was assigned to Marine Aircraft Group 31 (MAG-31) at Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, South Carolina. In August and September 1961 the squadron was deployed to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and to Jamaica during the time between the Bay of Pigs Invasion and the Cuban Missile Crisis. From February through August 1962, VMF-251 was the first Marine F-8 squadron to deploy on board an aircraft carrier as part of Carrier Air Group Ten on the . During the cruise, VMF-251 set the record for the most flight time in one month for a Sixth Fleet based F-8 squadron by flying over 500 hours. In July 1963 the Thunderbolts were the recipients of the 2nd MAW Commanding General's award for achievement in competitive exercises which took place while the squadron was deployed to NAS Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico. On 31 October 1964, the Thunderbolts became the first Marine squadron in 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing to transition to the F-4 Phantom II and receive its current designation as Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 251 (VMFA-251). The Thunderbolts received the CNO's flight safety award in 1967 and again in 1969 as well as the Fleet Marine Force Atlantic safety award for the years 1967, 1968 and 1970. In 1969 they also received the Robert M. Hanson award, presented annually to the \\"most outstanding Marine fighter squadron of the year.\\" Training exercises were conducted in Puerto Rico in 1964-1965, 1971, and 1973. In April 1971 the squadron stood \\"hot pad\\" duty at Naval Air Station Key West, Florida and provided additional support for the North American Air Defense Command. Further deployments in support of NATO were made to Cigili Air Base, Turkey in 1973 and to Rota, Spain in 1975 and the Thunderbolts participated in a Western Pacific deployment to Japan, Korea, and the Philippines during 1977-1978.

In April 1982, the Thunderbolts again deployed to Keflavik in Iceland where the squadron intercepted six Soviet Bear Bombers while on \\"hot pad\\" alert. The squadron deployed to the Kingdom of Denmark in September 1982 for NATO Exercise \\"Northern Wedding 82\\" during which 102 Soviet aircraft flew sorties against NATO naval forces. The squadron was placed on alert for possible redeployment to Lebanon before returning to the United States. After twenty-one years and 85,000 flight hours, VMFA-251 flew its last F-4S Phantom in November 1985. In January of the following year, the Thunderbolts transitioned to the F/A-18 Hornet. The squadron stood up as the sixth Marine F/A-18A squadron the following August and reported full combat ready in March 1987. The 1990s The squadron transitioned from the aging F/A-18A to the F/A-18C during the early 1990s. This change also increased the squadron's mission capable rate. From January to April 1994, the Thunderbolts flew close air support missions while deployed to Aviano, Italy supporting Operation Deny Flight in Bosnia-Herzegovina. These missions marked the first combat sorties for a Marine squadron in Europe since World War I. In 1994, the squadron became part of the Navy's Carrier Air Wing One and deployed as part of the USS America and USS George Washington battle groups from 1995 through 1997. The squadron then deployed on board the USS John F Kennedy (CV-67) during 1999-2000 for OPERATION SOUTHERN WATCH. Global War on Terror 2005 squadron photo On 12 February 2003, the squadron deployed to Ahmed Al Jaber Airbase, Kuwait as part of Marine Aircraft Group 11, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). On February 20, 2003, the squadron began flying combat missions in support of Operation Southern Watch and then transitioned to combat operations in support of OIF on 20 March 2003. During the conflict Thunderbolts flew over 650 combat missions over Iraq, accumulating more than 1,200 combat flight hours and dropped more than 7,100 weapons amounting to approximately 832,000 pounds of ordnance. Throughout the deployment maintenance Marines performed over 8,000 maintenance man-hours resulting in a 76% full mission capable rate. In 2006 the squadron deployed to Al Asad, Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). Upon their return they again deployed, this time on board the USS Enterprise (CVN-65).

He was especially notable for being a champion of a scheme in South Australia to put working men onto small blocks of land (around 20 acres) on which they could carry out agricultural production. Life Cotton was born on 4 February 1821 at Staplehurst in Kent, England to Samuel and Lydia Cotton. He was apprenticed to a carpenter and studied at Wesley College, Sheffield for two years. After working in London he migrated with his wife, Lydia, and his parents to South Australia aboard the Athenian, arriving in March 1849. His wife and son died shortly after their arrival and later in 1849 he married Elizabeth Mitchell with whom he had nine children.J. B. Hirst, 'Cotton, George Witherage (1821–1892)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/cotton-george-witherage-3269/text4953, published in hardcopy 1969, accessed online 3 October 2014. Upon arriving in South Australia, Cotton worked as a carpenter at Willunga and store-keeper on Hindmarsh Island. He then moved to Adelaide in 1862 and went into business as a land agent, becoming quite wealthy. In 1865 Cotton called a meeting of laymen of the Wesleyan Church to consider the purchase of a site for a Wesleyan college in Adelaide. This was to become Prince Alfred College, one of the most prominent schools in Adelaide, and Cotton was the founding Secretary, a position he held for twenty years. In 1875, he was the first to import typewriters to Australia.http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article208177778 In 1879 Cotton retired from real estate, leaving the business to his clerk Edward Andrew Devonshire Opie, an \\"old scholar\\" of Adelaide Educational Institution, and his son George Samuel Cotton, who followed his father as secretary of Prince Alfred College. In 1882 (at the age of 61), Cotton was elected to the Legislative Council. In the depression years following he took an interest in the unemployed and in land reform. Cotton developed a working men's blocks scheme in which the government would offer blocks of up to of crown land at low rents. The hope was that income from such blocks would eventually be adequate to support a family, forming the basis of a new society of independent producers and co-operative associations.Cotton, G. W. (1888) In 1885 the South Australian government began to implement Cotton's plan. Blocks were surveyed and occupied in many parts of the colony, from Adelaide suburbs and country town fringes to the open country. In 1896 about 12,900 people, or nearly 4 per cent of the population, lived on them. Cotton also championed the State Bank, technical education, a strong government department of labour, and boards of conciliation and arbitration. He was short-tempered and not an effective speaker despite being widely read. In the 1880s he left the Wesleyans, whose indifference to reform enraged him, and declared a new faith: 'I worship a living Christ in the person of every child, however it may have been born into the world'.ibid The depression affected Cotton's financial position to such a degree that in 1886 he was forced to resign his seat (as at that time members of the Legislative Council were unpaid). Cotton was a Fellow of the Royal Colonial Institute and the Royal Horticultural Society of London, a member of the British Economic Association and the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science. Family George Witherage Cotton (4 February 1821 – 15 December 1892) married Elizabeth Mitchell (1832 – 27 December 1901) with whom he had nine children, including: *Mary Elizabeth Cotton (c. 1851 – 5 July 1862) *Emma Morcom Cotton (c. 1853 – 31 July 1908), married William Bowen Chinner on 23 June 1875 *George Samuel Cotton (22 February 1858 – 26 October 1918), married Annie Wallace on 15 July 1880 *William Mitchell Cotton L.R.C.P., M.R.C.S. (4 May 1860 – 21 April 1899), married Maude Pullein on 26 June 1888, died in London *James Boorman Cotton (22 April 1862 – 9 May 1878), died at sea when mast collapsed *Francis John Cotton (30 September 1868 – 18 April 1880), died after swimming accident *Edward Witherage Cotton (1 March 1870 – 31 October 1941), married Mary Catherine Dempster on 5 September 1894. He was one of the first students at Roseworthy Agricultural College, under Professor John D. Custance, later a farmer in Western Australia. *Charles Henry Cotton (23 September 1873 – 27 February 1947) A sister, Jane Boorman Cotton (c. 1824 – 20 November 1910), married Claude Shuttleworth (c. 1819 – 27 May 1892), and conducted Hardwicke College for Girls. Newspaper reports Cotton's opinions attracted controversy, as extracts from newspapers of the day show. For instance, in a spirited public debate on unemployment, a Thomas H. Smeaton, under the heading \\"Delusive Demagogues\\", said of Mr Cotton and his supporters: Dangerous men these at the present. Discard them working-men; they will fool you and nothing more..., and another man wrote: He is a secret enemy, not an open fee, and in future it is the duty of all right-thinking men to treat his wordy vapourizings with the select contempt they deserve... The maligned politician sprang to defend himself on 13 April 1886, page 6f: Any man speaking of me as attempting to \\"gull\\" anybody can only be measuring me by some standard of his own to which course I respectfully demur to have judgments passed upon me... Another correspondent to the Register on 16 September 1886 complained: If [he] wishes his 300 to 400 pioneers on labourers' blocks to succeed he had better abstain from inflaming their zeal with misleading statements, but rather ought to preach to them uninterrupted industry (no eight-hours system), the strictest of economy and an unlimited amount of self-denial. A further unsolicited opinion is given in the Register on 27 October 1886: [He is] a gentleman who works hard in writing and speaking to educate South Australians in finance, and yet every effort he makes seems to increase the fog through which we have to discover his meaning... A Rev Honner criticised Cotton's scheme in the Register, 15 February 1888, saying: If I may judge of those blocks by some I have seen, then they must be intended for blockheads, for no sane man would live on them, unless he was seeking a wilderness for the occupation of meditation. But Cotton retorted on 17 February 1888: I hope when the historian has to look back at the difficulties small holdings had to encounter... that there will not be \\"perils among false brethren\\" to be received as amongst the bitterest opposition. Another citizen entered the fray on 22 February 1888: For some years past Mr Cotton has been energetically blowing his own trumpet from the homestead blocks. Some of us working men are growing tired of [it]: Cotton's the man for all jobs, He scowls on all the nobs, He winks and shouts at the snobs, And he sighs for the Government's bobs.'' Yet another citizen offered an unflattering opinion of Cotton in the Register, 4 August 1890: ...They distrust him; they do not know in what category of politicians to place him; he really stands alone. Sometimes he seems radical and appears is the advocate of thorough reform; at others he opposes the very things which would more than any other benefit the workers... In the heat of a public debate on the \\"land question\\" a correspondent to the Register on 31 July 1888 puts the following to Cotton: Must a man be a landjobber before he can honestly propose land reform? And is the only honest politician the land agent who opposes land nationalisation? And, pray, what right have you to say that all but yourself are catering for the votes of the working men?... You may vaunt as much as you like your love for the \\"poor man\\"; there is one thing you dare not do... you dare not be an honest politician. An editorial on the Block system is in the Register, 16 March 1888: Taken at its best it seems to us that it is more a hindrance than of a help to the establishment of a sound and rational system of land tenure... On 21 March a correspondent said: That he is sincere does not admit the question, but why the continual proclamations, why always clamour for the expected chorus of applause?... Two correspondents to the Register on 28 August 1888 pass judgement on Cotton: [It would be] much more worthy of a man who is privileged to write the prefix Honourable to his name if he were as particular in retailing slanderous statements... You will have observed long ago that Cotton never gives a straightforward answer however called for by nasty innuendoes, falsehoods and misrepresentations which he slips into his communications... On industrial relations, Cotton wrote in the Register, 31 December 1889: I believe that the wage-receivers are quite as anxious for fair play as those who have to pay the wages. But who is to decide what is fair? Governments shirk the responsibility and cry delusively \\"It is a matter of open contract\\". and so it will remain... till it is realised that it is the function of every Government to be a great arbitration and conciliation Association – nothing more and nothing less. In the meantime Trades and Labour Councils must act for the workers... And on 10 February 1890 Cotton wrote in relation to parliamentary representation: What I hold is wanted is a fair representation of each class and not a packed chamber that can only legislate for the country from the standpoint of its own class interests... For several years past South Australia has progressed in one direction only and that is in rapidly adding to its indebtedness to foreigners... Death Cotton died at his home on Young Street, Parkside after a brief and painful illness, leaving his widow, four sons, and a daughter. An obituary is in the Register, 17 December 1892: Anything which tended to benefit the working classes received [his] most serious attention... There has been no man who has been more straight forward and endeavoured to do good in the community... The good acts of some men are far above their failings and [his] little faults could well be overlooked... The working men's block system [has] been a moral lesson to all the world... The tide of wealth had been heaped against him, but he had never shrunk from his duties. At his funeral, a wreath from some \\"blockers\\" bore the inscription – \\"In loving gratitude to [our] father, friend and champion\\" The Register of 3 February 1893 has a proposal for a \\"Cotton Memorial Homestead Institute\\" and at the same time the author unwittingly pens an appropriate epitaph for a man of compassion and Christian principles: He it was who trod that broader path of humanity, revelled in those broader views that teach us there is a temporal as well as a spiritual side to questions concerning man's salvation... Legacy A school named after George Cotton was opened in 1914 and closed in 1945. The town of Cotton in the Hundred of Noarlunga is discussed in the Chronicle of 26 May 1894. The Block Scheme area of Cottonville in the southern suburbs of Adelaide was later re-subdivided and incorporated into Westbourne Park. A house of Prince Alfred College Preparatory School was named after Cotton (and another after his father in law). The Cotton Memorial Hall in Mylor is named in his honour.

Kapi was the first Papua New Guinean citizen to be appointed as a judge and only the third PNG national to be appointed Chief Justice. Kapi was born at Keapara village, Rigo District, Central Province. He was entirely educated in Papua New Guinea, graduating from the University of Papua New Guinea in 1972. He was employed as a lawyer with the Office of the Public Solicitor and on 1 January 1978 became the first Papua New Guinean national to be appointed a puisne justice of the Supreme and National Courts of Papua New Guinea (the Supreme Court not being a separately constituted court but a \\"full court\\" of the National Court). He was appointed Deputy Chief Justice in 1982. In his jurisprudence, Sir Mari is generally perceived as a strict legalist in the stamp of Sir Owen Dixon and his judgments are noted for their erudition, articulateness and highly literate awareness of common law principles. In evident recognition of Mr Justice Kapi's considerable rigour in the application of the principle of stare decisis he was appointed a member of the Fiji Court of Appeal and, in addition to his judicial responsibilities in Papua New Guinea, he also rendered appellate judgments in that common law jurisdiction. Sir Mari was elevated to Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea on 16 August 2003, for a ten-year term, the fourth person to occupy that position since Papua New Guinea's independence in 1975. Already a Knight Bachelor, he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the 2008 Birthday Honours. Mari retired from active duty on the Supreme Court in August 2008, citing deteriorating health. He last official \\"farewell ceremonial sitting\\" took place in Port Moresby on 21 November 2009. His successor as Chief Justice, Sir Salamo Injia, PNG Attorney General Allan Marat and PNG Law Society president Kerenga Kua jointly described Kapi as a \\"perfect role model in the legal profession\\" and a \\"top national jurist.\\" Mari credited the support from colleagues and friends in Papua New Guinea, Australia, the Solomon Islands, New Zealand and Fiji, as well as the National Judicial Staff Services, for his successful career at the November 2008 retirement ceremony. Mari was the founding chairman of Prison Fellowship Papua New Guinea and member of the Board of Prison Fellowship International. He has received the President´s award for Ministry Statesmanship, recognizing his impact and influence in advancing the cause of doing justice with mercy.http://www.pina.com.fj/?p=pacnews&m;=read&o;=58670308649caf6a6ed83e2d7892c5 Sir Mari Kapi died from kidney failure on 25 March 2009, in Singapore at the age of 58. He had been in Singapore's Raffles Hospital since February 2009 awaiting a kidney transplant from his younger brother. However, the transplant operation had been delayed.

He became chief minister at the age of 38 and was responsible for bringing major reforms and developments in Rajasthan. For this, he is still widely revered as the \\"founder of modern Rajasthan\\". Later in his career, Sukhadia also served as the Governor of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. Early life Mohan Lal Sukhadia was born in a Jain family of Jhalawar, Rajasthan. His father, Purshottam Lal Sukhadia, was a well known cricketer of the Bombay and Saurashtra teams. After completing primary education in Nathdwara and Udaipur, Sukhadia went to Mumbai for a diploma in electrical engineering from VJTI. There, he was elected General Secretary of the student body. Mr. Berley, the British principal of the college, wanted to invite governor of Bombay in a college ceremony. Sukhadia, along with other students, vehemently opposed the idea and asserted to invite then Chief Minister of Bombay B. G. Kher instead. Finally, college authorities had to bow down against the demands of students. Sukhadia had successfully led his first revolt against British Rule exemplifying his uncanny leadership abilities and managerial skills. In college, he came in contact with prominent national leaders like Subhas Chandra Bose, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Yusuf Meherally and Ashok Mehta. Sukhadia regularly attended meetings of Congress workers and volunteers headed by Patel in Mumbai. When he came back to Nathdwara, he started a small Electrical workshop. This shop was essentially a meeting place where Sukhadia and his friends would discuss about the ubiquitous autocracies of British rule and socio-economic reforms in the region.Kochar, p. 19 Various education and social awareness programs were schemed and executed in the region by Sukhadia and his fellow workers. He married Indubala on 1 June 1938 in Beawar. This inter-caste marriage was not an ordinary event in those days. Expecting a stiff backlash in Nathdwara and Udaipur, Sukhadia decided to perform the ceremony in Beawar adhering to customs of the Arya Samaj. When he returned to Nathdwara with Indubala, he was hailed by a large number of his supporters. Young overjoyed supporters thronged the streets of Nathwara, steered a huge rally across the town and greeted him with slogans, \\"Mohan Bhaiya Jindabad\\". This remained to be one of the most memorable and inspiring moments of his life. Sukhadia himself acknowledged this fact to one of his protagonists a few days before his death.Kochar, p. 20 Contribution in freedom struggle On account of excessive taxes and autocratic rule of princes and jagirdars, Praja Mandals were formed in different states of Rajputana. These mandals provided wider base to the agitation and direction to the civil right movement and administrative reforms in various princely states. In Udaipur state, Mewar Praja Mandal was founded in 1938 having renowned social activist and freedom fighter Manikya Lal Verma as its president. After one year of foundation, Mandal received a dose of fresh vigor with promising youth Mohal Lal Sukhadia joining it. Freedom struggle in Rajasthan was facing twofold and threefold resistance in form of British raj, princely states and local zamindars. Sukhadia along with other activists traveled across remote tribal areas and villages of the region, established direct contact with local peasants and tribesmen, edified them about their constitutional rights and encouraged to espouse the national movement. Fearing the torment of their zamindars, most of the locals were reluctant to shelter national activists in their houses. Public workers were not allowed to enter Bhil villages as zamindars considered contact of activists with simple-minded peasants undesirable. Often they were beaten and arrested by police for entering Bhil villages. In 1946, Praja Mandals of various states merged to form a statewide organization and named it Rajputana Prantiya Sabha. Sukhadia was inducted in Executive Committee of this newly formed organization. Party meetings were held in one of the Rajputana provinces in every two-three months where representatives of different provinces discussed and debated on common problems of the states. Sukhadia's matter-of-fact and efficient problem solving tactics were valued highly in these meetings that earned him recognition of top leaders in the state. Responding to Mahatma Gandhi's call of \\"Quit India\\" in 1942, entire Rajasthan plunged into Quit India Movement with leaders like Manikya Lal Verma, Heera Lal Shastri, Gokulbhai Bhatt, Jai Narayan Vyas and Mohanlal Sukhadia playing instrumental role in channelizing it. Seeing the situation go beyond control, British Government decided to contain top leadership by incarcerating them. Sukhadia stayed in jail for one and half years at the age of 25. Intense torrential rainfall of 1943 devastated Bhilwara and nearby areas causing huge destruction of property and life. Sukhadia mobilized relief workers and arranged food supply, medicines and clothing for the people. Independence and participation in government On 15 August 1947, 22 princely states of Rajasthan (erstwhile Rajputana) agreed to join the Union of India. Their merger and unification took place in a phased manner over a period of 2 years. In the first phase, four Princely States of Alwar, Bharatpur, Dholpur and Karauli formed the Matsya Union. On 25 March 1948, Union of Rajasthan was formed comprising Banswara, Bundi, Dungarpur, Jhalawar, Kishangarh, Pratapgarh, Shahapura, Tonk, and Kota. Three days after formation of Union of Rajasthan, Maharana of Udaipur decided to join Union of Rajasthan on 28 March 1948. It was formally inaugurated by Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru on 18 April 1948 and cabinet was formed under the leadership of Manikya Lal Verma. Mohan Lal Sukhadia joined the cabinet as Irrigation and Labor Minister. In the fourth phase, states of Bikaner, Jaisalmer, Jaipur and Jodhpur merged with Union of Rajasthan. Sardar Patel inaugurated unified Rajasthan on 30 March 1949 and Heera Lal Shastri formed the cabinet to become first Chief Minister of Rajasthan. On 15 May 1949, Matsya Union also merged with Rajasthan. After Heera Lal Shasrti resigned from the post on 26 March 1951, Jai Narayan Vyas took over his post. Sukhadia was appointed as minister in newly created cabinet. First state Legislative elections of Rajasthan were held in 1952. Tika Ram Paliwal became Chief Minister on 3 March 1952 for a brief period of time. Jai Narayan Vyas replaced him on 1 November 1952. Sukhadia handled Revenue, Irrigation, Agriculture and other significant portfolios during this period. After elections in 1952, 22 members of Ram Rajya Parishad joined Congress Party on persuasion of Jai Narayan Vyas. However, congress workers objected to his decision as most of the Ram Rajya Parishad members were former zamindars and believed this would affect ongoing land reforms in the state. Amidst growing resentment against Jai Narayan Vyas, Congress High command directed him to seek Vote of Confidence of Congress legislative members.Kochar, p. 40 Veteran Jai Narayan Vyas was directly pitched against the 38-year-old Revenue Minister of his own cabinet, Shri Mohan Lal Sukhadia. First time in history of Democratic India, two people were openly contesting for post of Chief Minister. Sukhadia defeated him by 8 votes to become youngest Chief Minister of India. He continued on this post for record making 17 years(13 Nov 1954 – 8 July 1971). His record of longest- serving Chief Minister in Indian political history was untouched until Jyoti Basu surpassed it in 1994.Kochar, p. 10 Sukhadia era of Rajasthan politics=Founding and development of Rajasthan Congress Formation of Rajasthan Congress started in 1946 when Praja Mandals of various states merged into the Rajputana Prantiya Sabha to form a common decision making and organization framework.Sisson, p. 97 Mohan Lal Sukhadia was one of the fifteen members of Executive Committee of Prantiya Sabha that consisted of prominent political elites of Rajasthan.Sisson, p. 99 Sukhadia along with other members of this committee played the crucial role of formulating and publicizing the policies and resolutions of the party. Desire for the inclusion of party in Indian National Congress was finally realized in April 1948 at the Bombay session of All-India Congress organization, when Rajputana Prantiya Sabha was declared as one of the provincial units of Indian national Congress.Sisson, p. 98 Initial years were impaired by instability within the party, which witnessed four chief ministers in less than first six years (1948–1954), until Sukhadia was given the responsibility of leading the government. Major credit for deploying stability and institutionalization in Congress party goes to leadership abilities and political skills of Mohanlal Sukhadia.Sisson, p. 252 Serving on the post of Chief Minister for almost two decades clearly denotes the kind of support, affection and honor Sukahdia enjoyed from his party members and public. Land reforms in the state Zamindari system, which had prevailed in Rajasthan for centuries, percolated deeply in socio-economic system of the state by the time of independence. Poor peasants were subjected to atrocities of their zamindars, had no right on the land they tilled and often had to pay very high land revenues. Congress government under the leadership of Jawaharlal Nehru passed a law to abolish the zamindari system. Impact of law was very limited in beginning years as zamindars approached the Supreme Court challenging the orders. To come up with the backdrop, the Congress Government passed the Rajasthan Jagir Abolition Act in 1952. With this Act, Jagirdari system in the state was abolished and the power of judicial review over these legislations was taken away from the courts and the fundamental right to the property was amended. Sukhadia was given the challenging post of Revenue Minister in the cabinet, reckoning that land reforms would not be easy without establishing an efficient or uniform system of revenue administration.Kochar, p. 23 When Sukhadia took over as Chief Minister in 1954, the challenging task of implementing the reforms lay ahead of him. Sukhadia's government passed Rajasthan Zamindari and Biswedari Abolition Act in 1959 that transferred the title of land to the tenants, doing away with centuries-old zamindari system in Rajasthan. Factors like political influence of jagirdars and jamindars, confusing varieties of land system in the different princely states and lack of reliable land records made the implementation immensely difficult. Sukhadia confronted all these hindrances and led land reforms in the state successfully. Development in health and education sector In his famous tryst with destiny speech, India's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru declared the eradication of ‘ignorance and disease’ as one of the most crucial tasks that the country faced. Challenge to eradicate ‘ignorance and disease’ was even bigger in Rajasthan as this was one of the least developed states in India at the end of British rule. During the early decades of the twentieth century Rajasthan had one of the lowest levels of education and highest levels of mortality of all provinces in India. Sukhadia Era in Rajasthan witnessed a dramatic reversal of the colonial policy of almost complete neglect of the education and health sectors. Sukhadia government's commitment to the social sector is brought out by the fact that despite facing a very precarious budgetary situation, it steadily increased its expenditure on social service. One of the clearest signals of this was decision of Sukhadia to retain the Education portfolio even after becoming the Chief Minister of the state.Kochar, p. 47 Results were evident by the end of 1970. Rajasthan's outlays on health and education were significantly higher than all other North-Central Indian states and all-India average. By 1969 Rajasthan's education spending as a proportion of total SDP (3.2%) was double that of UP (1.5%). Similarly, in the health sector, Rajasthan's expenditure grew to Rs.8.23 per capita in 1970–71 whereas UP spent only Rs.3.2 ReferencesBibliography   * * External links * His Excellency Mohan Lal Sukhadia with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on her visit to Raj Bhavan * His Excellency Mohan Lal Sukhadia taking oath of Governorship from Chief Justice * Mohanlal Sukhadia visiting Wool Research Laboratories in Australia in 1963 * Link of Rajasthan Assembly Category:1916 births Category:1982 deaths Category:Chief Ministers of Rajasthan Category:Governors of Andhra Pradesh Category:Governors of Karnataka Category:Governors of Tamil Nadu Category:7th Lok Sabha members Category:Lok Sabha members from Rajasthan Category:Chief ministers from Indian National Congress ","title":"Mohan Lal Sukhadia"},{"id":"4420444","text":"RNP-AR 3D approach tracks to Cajamarca, Perú (above) and La Serena, Chile (below), demonstrating the benefits of precise lateral and vertical navigation on airports located on mountainous regions Required navigation performance (RNP) is a type of performance-based navigation (PBN) that allows an aircraft to fly a specific path between two 3D-defined points in space. Navigation precision Area navigation (RNAV) and RNP systems are fundamentally similar. The key difference between them is the requirement for on-board performance monitoring and alerting. A navigation specification that includes a requirement for on-board navigation performance monitoring and alerting is referred to as an RNP specification. One not having such a requirement is referred to as an RNAV specification. Therefore, if ATC radar monitoring is not provided, safe navigation in respect to terrain shall be self-monitored by the pilot and RNP shall be used instead of RNAV. RNP also refers to the level of performance required for a specific procedure or a specific block of airspace. An RNP of 10 means that a navigation system must be able to calculate its position to within a circle with a radius of 10 nautical miles. An RNP of 0.3 means the aircraft navigation system must be able to calculate its position to within a circle with a radius of 3/10 of a nautical mile.PBN Learning Center  GE Aviation Systems  GE Aviation The differences in these systems are typically a function of on-board navigational system redundancies. A related term is ANP which stands for \\"actual navigation performance.\\" ANP refers to the current performance of a navigation system while \\"RNP\\" refers to the accuracy required for a given block of airspace or a specific instrument procedure. Some oceanic airspace has an RNP capability value of 4 or 10. The level of RNP an aircraft is capable of determines the separation required between aircraft with respect to distance. Improved accuracy of on-board RNP systems represent a significant advantage to traditional non-radar environments, since the number of aircraft that can fit into a volume of airspace at any given altitude is a square of the number of required separation; that is to say, the lower the RNP value, the lower the required distance separation standards, and in general, the more aircraft can fit into a volume of airspace without losing required separation. This is not only a major advantage for air traffic operations, but presents a major cost-savings opportunity for airlines flying over the oceans due to less restrictive routing and better available altitudes. RNP approaches with RNP values currently down to 0.1 allow aircraft to follow precise three-dimensional curved flight paths through congested airspace, around noise sensitive areas, or through difficult terrain.  History  RNP procedures were introduced in the PANS-OPS (ICAO Doc 8168), which became applicable in 1998. These RNP procedures were the predecessor of the current PBN concept, whereby the performance for operation on the route is defined (in lieu of flight elements such as flyover procedures, variability in flight paths, and added airspace buffer), but they resulted in no significant design advantages. As a result, there was a lack of benefits to the user community and little or no implementation. In 1996, Alaska Airlines became the first airline in the world to utilize an RNP approach with its approach down the Gastineau Channel into Juneau, Alaska. Alaska Airlines Captain Steve Fulton and Captain Hal Anderson developed more than 30 RNP approaches for the airline's Alaska operations. In 2005, Alaska Airlines became the first airline to utilize RNP approaches into Reagan National Airport to avoid congestion.Alaska Airlines Becomes First Carrier Authorized To Conduct RNP Precision Approach Flight Validations In April 2009, Alaska Airlines became the first airline to gain approval from the FAA to validate their own RNP approaches. On 6 April 2010, Southwest Airlines converted to RNP. Since 2009, regulators in Perú, Chile, and Ecuador have deployed more than 25 RNP AR approach procedures, designed in conjunction with LAN Airlines. Benefits included reduction in greenhouse gases emissions and improved accessibility to airports located on mountainous terrain. The use of RNP AR approaches in Cusco, near Machu Picchu, has reduced cancellations due to foul weather by 60 percent on flights operated by LAN. In October 2011 Boeing, Lion Air, and the Indonesian Directorate General of Civil Aviation, performed validation flights to test tailor-made Required Navigation Performance Authorization Required (RNP AR) procedures at two terrain- challenged airports, Ambon and Manado, Indonesia as pioneering the use of RNP precision navigation technology in South Asia.  Established on RNP approaches  Inspired by a 2011 white paper, the ICAO published in November 2018 the Established on RNP-Authorization Required (EoR) standard to reduce separation for parallel runways, improving traffic flow while reducing noise, emissions and distance flown. Similar to Denver International, it was implemented in over three years at Calgary International, lowering the final approach requirement from , before reaching trajectory-based operations. As 40% of aircraft arriving are equipped to fly RNP-AR, 3,000 RNP-AR approaches per month would save , and associated with continuous descent, would reduce greenhouse gases emissions by 2,500 metric tons in the first year. Description Qantas Boeing 737-800 flying RNP departure from Queenstown, New Zealand The current specific requirements of an RNP system include: * Capability to follow a desired ground track with reliability, repeatability, and predictability, including curved paths; and * Where vertical profiles are included for vertical guidance, use of vertical angles or specific altitude constraints to define a desired vertical path. RNP APCH supports all leg types and path terminators used in standard RNAV, including TF and RF. RNP AR procedures support only two leg types: * TF leg: Track to Fix: a geodesic path between two fixes. * RF leg: Radius to Fix. This is a curved path supported by positive course guidance. An RF leg is defined by a radius, arc length, and a fix. Not all RNP capable FMS systems support RF legs. Use of RF legs is allowed prior to the Final Approach Fix. For RNP AR APCH operation see Special Aircraft and Aircrew Authorization Required approach section below. The performance-monitoring and alerting capabilities may be provided in different forms depending on the system installation, architecture, and configurations, including: * display and indication of both the required and the estimated navigation system performance; * monitoring of the system performance and alerting the crew when RNP requirements are not met; and * cross track deviation displays scaled to RNP, in conjunction with separate monitoring and alerting for navigation integrity. An RNP system utilises its navigation sensors, system architecture, and modes of operation to satisfy the RNP navigation specification requirements. It must perform the integrity and reasonableness checks of the sensors and data, and it may provide a means to deselect specific types of navigation aids to prevent reversion to an inadequate sensor. RNP requirements may limit the modes of operation of the aircraft, e.g. for low RNP, where flight technical error (FTE) is a significant factor, and manual flight by the crew may not be allowed. Dual system/sensor installations may also be required depending on the intended operation or need. An RNAV system capable of achieving the performance requirements of an RNP specification is referred to as an RNP system. Because specific performance requirements are defined for each navigation specification, an aircraft approved for a RNP specification is not automatically approved for all RNAV specifications. Similarly, an aircraft approved for an RNP or RNAV specification having stringent accuracy requirements is not automatically approved for a navigation specification having a less-stringent accuracy requirement. Designation For oceanic, remote, enroute and terminal operations, an RNP specification is designated as RNP X, e.g. RNP 4. Approach navigation specifications cover all segments of the instrument approach. RNP specifications are designated using RNP as a prefix and an abbreviated textual suffix, e.g. RNP APCH (for RNP approach) or RNP AR APCH (for RNP authorisation required approach). Performance monitoring and alerting requirements The performance monitoring and alerting requirements for RNP 4, Basic-RNP 1 and RNP APCH have common terminology and application. Each of these specifications includes requirements for the following characteristics: * Accuracy: The accuracy requirement defines the 95% Total System Error (TSE) for those dimensions where an accuracy requirement is specified. The accuracy requirement is harmonised with the RNAV navigation specifications and is always equal to the accuracy value. A unique aspect of the RNP navigation specifications is that the accuracy is one of the performance characteristics that is monitored. * Performance monitoring': The aircraft, or aircraft-and-pilot combination, is required to monitor the TSE ''and to provide an alert if the accuracy requirement is not met or if the probability that the TSE exceeds two-times the accuracy value is larger than 10−5. To the extent operational procedures are used to satisfy this requirement, the crew procedure, equipment characteristics, and installation are evaluated for their effectiveness and equivalence. * Aircraft failures: Failure of the aircraft equipment is considered within airworthiness regulations. Failures are categorised by the severity of the aircraft level effect, and the system must be designed to reduce the likelihood of the failure or mitigate its effects. Both malfunction (equipment operating but not providing appropriate output) and loss of function (equipment ceases to function) are addressed. Dual system requirements are determined based on operational continuity (e.g. oceanic and remote operations). The requirements on aircraft failure characteristics are not unique to RNP navigation specifications. * Signal-in-space failures: Signal-in-space characteristics of navigation signals are the responsibility of the ANSP.ICAO. Doc 9613, Performance-based Navigation (PBN) Manual – Annex 10 Aeronautical Telecommunications, 2008. The net effect of RNP navigation specifications is to provide bounding of the TSE distribution. Since path definition error is assumed to be negligible, the monitoring requirement is reduced to the other two components of TSE, i.e. flight technical error (FTE) and navigation system error (NSE). It is assumed that FTE is an ergodic stochastic process within a given flight control mode. As a result, the FTE distribution is constant over time within a given flight control mode. However, in contrast, the NSE distribution varies over time due to a number of changing characteristics, most notably: * selected navigation sensors: the navigation sensors which are being used to estimate position, such as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) or DME/DME; * the relative geometry of the aircraft position to the supporting navigation aids: all radio navaids have this basic variability, although the specific characteristics change. GNSS performance is affected by the relative geometry of the satellites compared to the aircraft DME/DME navigation solutions are affected by the inclusion angle between the two DMEs at the aircraft (90° being optimal) and the distance to the DMEs, since the aircraft DME transponder can have increasing range errors with increasing distance; * inertial reference units: errors increase over time since last updated. Application of performance monitoring and alerting to aircraft Although the TSE can change significantly over time for a number of reasons, including those above, the RNP navigation specifications provide assurance that the TSE distribution remains suitable to the operation. This results from two requirements associated with the TSE distribution, namely: * the requirement that the TSE remains equal to or better than the required accuracy for 95% of the flight time; and * the probability that the TSE of each aircraft exceeds the specified TSE limit (equal to two times the accuracy value) without annunciation is less than 10 −5. Typically, the 10−5 TSE requirement provides a greater restriction on performance. For example, with any system that has TSE with a normal distribution of cross-track error, the 10−5 monitoring requirement constrains the standard deviation to be 2 × (accuracy value)/4.45 = accuracy value/2.23, while the 95% requirement would have allowed the standard deviation to be as large as the accuracy value/1.96. It is important to understand that while these characteristics define minimum requirements that must be met, they do not define the actual TSE distribution. The actual TSE distribution may be expected to be typically better than the requirement, but there must be evidence on the actual performance if a lower TSE value is to be used. In applying the performance monitoring requirement to aircraft, there can be significant variability in how individual errors are managed: * some systems monitor the actual cross-track and along-track errors individually, whereas others monitor the radial NSE to simplify the monitoring and eliminate dependency on the aircraft track, e.g. based on typical elliptical 2-D error distributions. * some systems include the FTE in the monitor by taking the current value of FTE as a bias on the TSE distribution. * for basic GNSS systems, the accuracy and 10−5 requirements are met as a by- product of the ABAS requirements that have been defined in equipment standards and the FTE distribution for standardised course deviation indicator (CDI) displays. It is important that performance monitoring is not regarded as error monitoring. A performance monitoring alert will be issued when the system cannot guarantee, with sufficient integrity, that the position meets the accuracy requirement. When such an alert is issued, the probable reason is the loss of capability to validate the position data (insufficient satellites being a potential reason). For such a situation, the most likely position of the aircraft at that time is exactly the same position indicated on the pilot display. Assuming the desired track has been flown correctly, the FTE would be within the required limits and therefore the likelihood of the TSE exceeding twice the accuracy value just prior to the alert is approximately 10−5. However, it cannot be assumed that simply because there is no alert the TSE is less than twice the accuracy value: the TSE can be larger. An example is for those aircraft that account for the FTE based on a fixed error distribution: for such systems, if the FTE grows large, no alert is issued by the system even when the TSE is many times larger than the accuracy value. For this reason, the operational procedures to monitor the FTE are important. Areas of operation=Oceanic and remote continental Oceanic and remote continental airspace is currently served by two navigation applications, RNAV 10 and RNP 4. Both rely primarily on GNSS to support the navigation element of the airspace. In the case of RNAV 10, no form of ATS surveillance is required. In the case of RNP 4, ADS contract (ADS-C) is used. Continental en-route Continental en-route airspace is currently supported by RNAV applications. RNAV 5 is used in the Middle East (MID) and European (EUR) regions, but as of 2008, it is designated as B-RNAV (Basic RNAV in Europe and RNP 5 in the Middle East). In the United States, RNAV 2 supports en-route continental airspace. At present, continental RNAV applications support airspace specifications which include radar surveillance and direct controller-to-pilot voice communications. Terminal airspace: arrival and departure Existing terminal airspace concepts, which include arrival and departure, are supported by RNAV applications. These are currently used in the European (EUR) Region and the United States. The European terminal airspace RNAV application is known as P-RNAV (Precision RNAV). Although the RNAV 1 specification shares a common navigation accuracy with P-RNAV, this regional navigation specification does not satisfy the full requirements of the RNAV 1 specification. As of 2008, the United States terminal airspace application formerly known as US RNAV Type B has been aligned with the PBN concept and is now called RNAV 1. Basic RNP 1 has been developed primarily for application in non-radar, low density terminal airspace. In future, more RNP applications are expected to be developed for both en-route and terminal airspace. Approach Approach concepts cover all segments of the instrument approach, i.e. initial, intermediate, final, and missed approach. The RNP APCH specifications requiring a standard navigation accuracy of 1.0 NM in the initial, intermediate and missed segments and 0.3 NM in the final segment. Typically, three sorts of RNP applications are characteristic of this phase of flight: new procedures to runways never served by an instrument procedure, procedures either replacing or serving as backup to existing instrument procedures based on different technologies, and procedures developed to enhance airport access in demanding environments (RNP APCH and RNP AR APCH). RNP approaches to 0.3 NM and 0.1 NM at Queenstown Airport in New Zealand are the primary approaches used by Qantas and Air New Zealand for both international and domestic services. Due to terrain restrictions, ILS approaches are not possible, and conventional VOR/DME approaches have descent restrictions more than 2,000 ft above the airport level. The RNP approaches and departures follow curved paths below terrain level.NZ AIP =Special Aircraft and Aircrew Authorization Required approach= RNP instrument approach procedures with Authorization Required or RNP AR (previously known as Special Aircraft and Aircrew Authorization Required or SAAAR)FAA Advisory Circular 90-101A: Approval Guidance for RNP Procedures with AR. 2011.ICAO. Doc 9905, Required Navigation Performance Authorization Required (RNP AR) procedure Design Manual, 2009 approach procedures build upon the performance based NAS concept. The performance requirements to conduct an approach are defined, and aircraft are qualified against these performance requirements. Conventional obstacle evaluation areas for ground-based navigation aids are based on a predefined aircraft capability and navigation system. RNP AR criteria for obstacle evaluation are flexible and designed to adapt to unique operational environments. This allows approach specific performance requirements as necessary for an approach procedure. The operational requirement can include avoiding terrain and obstacles, de-conflicting airspace or resolving environmental constraints. RNP AR APCH is defined as an RNP approach procedure that requires a lateral TSE lower than the standard RNP values on any segment of the approach procedure. RNP approaches include capabilities that require special aircraft and aircrew authorization similar to category II/III ILS operations. All RNP AR approaches have reduced lateral obstacle evaluation areas and vertical obstacle clearance surfaces predicated on the aircraft and aircrew performance requirements. The following characteristics differ from RNP APCH: * RF leg segments may be used after PFAF (precise final approach fix). * lateral TSE values as low as 0.10 NM on any segment of the approach procedure (initial, intermediate, final or missed). When conducting an RNP AR approach using a line of minima less than RNP 0.3, no single-point-of-failure can cause the loss of guidance compliant with the RNP value associated with the approach. Typically, the aircraft must have at least dual GNSS sensors, dual flight management systems, dual air data systems, dual autopilots, and a single inertial reference unit. When conducting an RNP AR approach with a missed approach less than RNP 1.0, no single-point-of-failure can cause the loss of guidance compliant with the RNP value associated with a missed approach procedure. Typically, the aircraft must have at least dual GNSS sensors, dual flight management systems, dual air data systems, dual autopilots, and a single inertial reference unit. Flight planning Manual or automated notification of an aircraft's qualification to operate along an air traffic services (ATS) route, on a procedure or in an airspace is provided to ATC via the flight plan.Flight plan procedures are addressed in Procedures for Air Navigation Services – Air Traffic Management (PANS-ATM) (Doc 4444) See also *Acronyms and abbreviations in avionics  Notes ReferencesFurther reading * Category:Air traffic control ","title":"Required navigation performance"},{"id":"4420451","text":"Jean-Marie Tjibaou (January 30, 1936 – May 4, 1989) was a French politician in New Caledonia and leader of the Kanak independence movement.

He graduated from the University of Georgia in 1937 with a B.S., where he was a member of the Chi Phi Fraternity. Hartman was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1984 and the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in 1981.Georgia Sports Hall of Fame entry Football career Hartman was born in Thomaston, Georgia in 1915. He started playing football in Madison, Georgia, where his talents soon became evident. He played college football for the Georgia Bulldogs starting in 1935. Hartman distinguished himself at both fullback and linebacker for the Bulldogs. His best game is considered to be his performance in a 7-7 tie against Fordham University in 1936 which knocked Fordham out of contention for the Rose Bowl. In his final year in 1937, Hartman was an All-American and All-SEC player. He also became a punter kicking the ball 82 yards against Tulane University. After graduation, he signed with the Washington Redskins, who wanted him as a backup to Sammy Baugh. However, Baugh was injured in the preseason and Hartman started for the first six games of the season. He threw the winning pass in a 24-22 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in his first game in the NFL. Hartman completed two years in the NFL to work as an assistant coach to Wally Butts in a Bulldogs team that won both the Orange Bowl and Rose Bowl.

The story follows the materialistic rise of Silas Lapham from rags to riches, and his ensuing moral susceptibility. Silas earns a fortune in the paint business, but he lacks social standards, which he tries to attain through his daughter's marriage into the aristocratic Corey family. Silas' morality does not fail him. He loses his money but makes the right moral decision when his partner proposes the unethical selling of the mills to English settlers. Howells is known to be the father of American realism, and a denouncer of the sentimental novel. The resolution of the love triangle of Irene Lapham, Tom Corey, and Penelope Lapham highlights Howells' rejection of the conventions of sentimental romantic novels as unrealistic and deceitful. An excerpt of the text was used in the 2019 AP English Literature and Composition Exam as a short answer question. List of characters * Silas Lapham * Penelope Lapham * Persis Lapham * Irene Lapham * Tom Corey * Bromfield Corey * Anna Corey * Milton K. Rogers Plot summary The novel begins with Silas Lapham, a middle-aged native of rural New England, being interviewed for a newspaper story about his rise to wealth in the mineral paint business. Despite his limited education, Lapham is a shrewd and hardworking man, an American success story. But he, his wife and two daughters feel socially awkward compared to other wealthy Bostonians. They decide to build a new home in the fashionable Back Bay neighborhood, and Lapham spares no expense in making it impressive. Tom Corey, a young man from an \\"old money\\" Boston family, shows an interest in the Lapham girls, and Mr. and Mrs. Lapham assume he is attracted to Irene, their beautiful younger daughter. Corey joins the Lapham paint business in an attempt to find his place in the world, rather than rely on his wealthy father. Tom introduces Lapham to the cream of Boston society at a dinner party, and they remain on good terms even though the occasion turns out to be embarrassingly awkward. As Tom continues calling on the Laphams regularly, it's assumed that he wants to marry Irene, and she hopes for just such a result. Tom, however, later shocks both families by revealing that he loves Penelope, the older, less glamorous but more intelligent and thoughtful Lapham sister. Though Penelope has feelings for Tom, she is held back by the romantic conventions of the era, not wanting to act on her love for fear of betraying her sister. Meanwhile, Lapham and his wife, Persis, sometimes clash over people from their past. For instance, he is very generous to the family of his fallen Civil War comrade Jim Millon, feeling that he owes the man his life. He quietly sends money to Millon's widow and gives the couple's daughter a job. Persis Lapham considers the two women irresponsible characters who are taking advantage of her husband and potentially damaging his reputation, but he insists he is paying a debt of honor. Also, Mrs. Lapham often complains to her husband that he dealt shabbily with his former business partner Milton K. Rogers, who has come down in the world since their association ended. Silas Lapham insists he was fair to Rogers. Amid the uproar over the Corey courtship, Rogers quietly reappears in the Laphams' life, asking for money for a series of schemes. Persis Lapham convinces her husband to provide the help. Unfortunately, Rogers proves to be a very poor businessman, and the Laphams' new dealings with him cause them to lose a considerable amount of money. On top of that, Lapham's major asset, the new home on Beacon Street, burns down before its completion due to his own carelessness. Mr. and Mrs. Lapham are forced to move to their humble rural home, where the mineral paint was first developed, and while they are not destitute, they are no longer wealthy. Tom and Penelope are finally able to marry after Irene accepts their romance. The elder Laphams, living in the countryside by themselves, are left to reflect on their extraordinary rise and decline. Composition and publication history Howells had moved to Massachusetts in the 1860s and became influential as the editor of the Atlantic Monthly, a role he held until 1881. The 1880s proved to be an extremely prolific period for him; in that decade, Howells published nine novels, a novella, several magazine articles, and a few plays.Goodman, Susan and Carl Dawson. William Dean Howells: A Writer's Life. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2005: 253. He completed The Rise of Silas Lapham while living at 302 Beacon Street in Boston.Levine, Meriam. A Guide to Writers' Homes in New England. Applewood Books, 1989: 178. Historian Francis Parkman had difficulty understanding the realism of the book and judged it by his more romantic standards and sought a didactic purpose for the story. As he wrote, \\"It is an admirable portraiture, realistic in the best sense of the word. It must touch the consciousness of a great many people; and as we descendants of the Puritans are said to be always on the lookout for a moral — it will teach the much needed lesson that money cannot do everything.\\"Jacobs, Wilbur R. Francis Parkman, Historian as Hero: The Formative Years. Austin: The University of Texas Press, 1991: 117. Analysis Historian Scott E. Casper suggested that The Rise of Silas Lapham was partly a satire on contemporary biography conventions. Howells, who had written a campaign biography of Abraham Lincoln, attacked the formulaic style of biographies of the day, including the \\"rise\\" from early adversity to later success. Howells emphasized this early in the book where Lapham is interviewed by Bartley Hubbard (a character revived from his 1882 novel A Modern Instance) who interjects while his subject tells his life story with assumptions of his romanticized life.Casper, Scott E. Constructing American Lives: Biography and Culture in Nineteenth-Century America. Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 1999: 316–317. Further, the title character is excessively class- conscious and worries about being humiliated for not fitting in with the culture of wealthy Boston, as exemplified in a scene where he struggles to determine if it is appropriate to wear gloves to a particular event, but refuses to ask for help.Bentley, Nancy. Frantic Panoramas: American Literature and Mass Culture, 1870-1920. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2009: 96.

He is the chairman of The Portland Trust and Bridges Ventures.Klion Forum with Sir Ronald Cohen: \\"Why Do We Need Social Capital Markets?\\",Columbia Business School, He has been described as \\"the father of British venture capital\\"Brown picks tycoon to back power bid, The Sunday Times, 16 January 2005. Accessed 22 March 2006 and \\"the father of social investment\\". Early life Cohen was born in Egypt on 1 August 1945, the son of Michael Mourad Cohen, a banker, and Sonia Douek. His family are Sephardi Jews, though his mother, Sonia Douek, is British by nationality. In 1957, following the Suez Crisis, Cohen's family was forced to abandon all their assets and flee Egyptian President Nassar's persecution of Jews.Profile: Sir Ronald Cohen: Midas with a mission – to make Gordon king, The Sunday Times, 23 January 2005. Accessed 22 March 2006. The family (including younger brother Andre) moved to England. His father started his own import/export business, but having arrived with just £10, life was a struggle. Though initially speaking only a few words of English, Cohen went to Orange Hill grammar school in North London, now part of Mill Hill County High School where despite describing it as \\"a school of very doubtful reputation\\" he excelled. Cohen won a scholarship to Oxford University, where he became President of the Oxford Union, and earned a degree in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at Exeter College. He subsequently attended Harvard Business School, where he was a member of the Harvard Business School Rugby Club. Career After leaving Harvard Business School, Cohen worked as a management consultant for McKinsey & Company in the UK and Italy. In 1972, along with two former business school colleagues as partners, he founded Apax Partners, one of Britain's first venture capital firms. The company grew slowly at first, but expanded rapidly in the 1990s, becoming Britain's largest venture capital firm, and \\"one of three truly global venture capital firms\\". Apax provided startup capital for over 500 companies, and provided money for many others, including AOL, Virgin Radio, Waterstone's, and PPL Therapeutics, the company that cloned Dolly the sheep. In 1996 Cohen helped establish Easdaq, a technology focused stock exchange intended to be the European counterpart to the American NASDAQ. He is the recipient of a Jubilee Award for services to Israeli business, awarded by Benjamin Netanyahu and the BVCA's Lifetime Achievement Award. He is a member of the Harvard Board of Overseers and is also a fellow of Exeter College, Oxford. In 2002, alongside Jon Moulton, he was the inaugural inductee into the Private Equity Hall of Fame, at the British Venture Capital Association and Real Deals' Private Equity Awards. Social investment In 2000, at the invitation of the Treasury he became Chairman of the Social Investment Task Force (SITF). The remit of the SITF was \\"to set out how entrepreneurial practices could be applied to obtain higher social and financial returns from social investment, to harness new talents and skills, to address economic regeneration and to unleash new sources of private and institutional investment\\". The SITF made several recommendations to Government, including that it: (1) introduce Community Investment Tax Relief (CITR); (2) match finance to help set up the first community development venture capital fund; (3) encourage banks to disclose more of their lending activities; (4) to support legislative and regulatory changes to provide greater latitude and encouragement for charitable trusts and foundations to invest in community development finance; and (5) to create the Community Development Finance Association (cdfa) to provide support for community development finance institutions (CDFIs). In 2002, he co-founded and became chairman of Bridges Ventures, an innovative sustainable growth investor that delivers both financial returns and social and environmental benefits. Bridges Ventures has raised eight successful funds to date: Bridges Sustainable Growth Funds I, II and III, the Bridges Sustainable Property Fund, the CarePlaces Fund, Bridges Property Alternatives III, the Bridges Social Entrepreneurs Fund, and the Bridges Social Impact Bond Fund. The organisation currently has almost £600 million under management. The portfolio includes a number of businesses who invest in regeneration areas or have a sustainable business model. Bridges Ventures has had several successful exits to date, including The Gym Group, The Office, Simply Switch, HS Atec and Harlands of Hull. In 2003, Cohen co- founded the Portland Trust with Sir Harry Solomon, co-founder and former chairman and CEO of Hillsdown Holdings. The aim of Portland Trust is to help develop the Palestinian private sector and relieve poverty through entrepreneurship in Israel. Portland Trust is involved in a number of important initiatives, including the development of financial and economic infrastructure, housing, trade, investment, and entrepreneurship. The Portland Trust has offices in London, Tel Aviv and Ramallah. In 2005, Cohen chaired the Commission on Unclaimed Assets.p which looked into how unclaimed funds from dormant bank accounts could be used to benefit the public. The final recommendation of the Commission was that a Social Investment Wholesale Bank be created to help finance charitable and voluntary projects by providing seed capital and loan guarantees. In 2007 he co-founded and became a non-executive director of Social Finance UK, a London-based advisory organisation that has worked to create a social investment market in the UK. The organisation provides access to capital, designs social finance interventions and offers advice to investors and social sector entities interested in delivering significant social impact. It has developed the social impact bond which is a financial instrument that is an outcomes-based contract in which public sector commissioners commit to pay for significant improvement in social outcomes for a defined population. Social Finance set up a pilot social impact bond with the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) in September 2010 to reduce re-offending amongst male prisoners leaving HMP Peterborough who have served a sentence of less than 12 months. During the Peterborough Prison pilot, experienced social sector organisations, such as St. Giles Trust and the Ormiston Children and Families Trust, provided intensive support to 3,000 short-term prisoners over a six-year period, both inside prison and after release, to help them resettle into the community. In July 2017, the success of the Peterborough Social Impact Bond was announced. The results showed reoffending of short-sentenced offenders reduced by 9% overall compared to a national control group. This exceeded the target of 7.5% set by the Ministry of Justice. As a result, the 17 investors in the Peterborough Social Impact Bond receive a single payment representing their initial capital plus an amount that will represent a return of just over 3% per annum for the period of investment. Cohen is also a member of the board of directors for Social Finance UK's sister organisation in the United States, Social Finance US. In 2010, Cohen chaired a review of the work of the SITF in 2010 and published a report titled Social Investment: Ten Years On which assess the changes that had happened over the last decade in the area of social investment. The report found that there are three specific initiatives that will help define the future of the social investment market in the UK: (1) establishing the infrastructure necessary to create a dynamic market in social investment through initiatives such as the Social Investment Bank; (2) creating new tools to deliver social change through financial instruments such as the social impact bond; (3) engaging the financial sector to invest in disadvantaged areas through the Community Reinvestment Act. Big Society Capital Since its official launch in July 2011, Sir Ronald Cohen has been the Chairman of Big Society Capital, Britain's first social investment bank. The role of the BSC is to help speed up the growth of the social investment market, so that socially orientated financial organisations will have greater access to affordable capital, using an estimated £400million in unclaimed assets left dormant in bank accounts for over 15 years and £200million from the UK's largest high street banks. Its first £1 million investment from dormant accounts has gone to the Private Equity Foundation, an organisation whose mission it is to support disadvantaged young people into employment, education or training. Charity In January 2005, Cohen was appointed a trustee of the British Museum. Cohen is a member of the executive committee of the International Institute of Strategic Studies. Controversies Cohen was chairman of Apax at the time of the Apax-owned British United Shoe Machinery pension collapse in 2000 which left 544 workers, many of them long service, without any pension. Collapse followed demerger from USM-Texon and asset transfer between the companies. Pension funds were transferred to the new BUSM scheme two weeks before receivership, and 4 days before a new revaluation was due. MPs Edward Garnier, Patricia Hewitt and Ashok Kumar all called for a proper enquiry, Garnier citing the \\"mysterious circumstances\\" under which the pensions \\"disappeared\\", whilst Hewitt said \\"it is clearly important that such serious allegations are properly investigated.\\" No new investigation took place, leading Kumar to say \\"I think these people need flogging. I feel so angry on behalf of decent upright citizens robbed of their basic human rights. ... These are greedy, selfish capitalists who live on the backs of others.\\" In 2007, the GMB (trade union) blamed private equity firms for the collapse of 96 pension funds and linked Cohen with losses totalling £81m at Dexion, British United Shoe Machinery and USM Texon. Politics In 1974 Cohen stood as the parliamentary candidate for the Liberal Party in Kensington North, and in 1979 he stood as its European candidate in London West. In 1996 he switched allegiance to the Labour Party, becoming a supporter of Tony Blair. In 2004, Cohen was the Labour Party's fourth largest financial supporter, after Lord Sainsbury, Sir Christopher Ondaatje and Lord Hamlyn. In November 2011 he was financially linked with a new \\"non-political\\" movement in Israel, the sole goal of which is to change the country's electoral system. Personal In 1972 Cohen married Carol Belmont; they divorced in 1975. In 1983 he married a second time, to Claire Enders; they divorced in 1986. Cohen married his third wife in 1987, Sharon Harel, daughter of Yossi Harel, the commander of the Holocaust survivors' ship Exodus. They have two children and live in London.

Fox has been semi-retired since 1996, but still gives seminars and lives in Adelaide, South Australia. Career In 1981, while working in drama, Fox decided to retrain in literacy studies. She said: \\"Literacy has become the great focus of my life – it's my passion, my battle and my mission and my exhaustion.\\" She has published books on literacy aimed at children, their parents, teachers and educators. She held the position of Associate Professor, Literacy Studies, in the School of Education at Flinders University until her retirement in 1996. Since her retirement from teaching, Fox travels around the world visiting many countries and doing presentations and speaking on children's books and literacy issues. Following an interrogation by US immigration officials on a trip in February 2017 to deliver a keynote speech in Milwaukee, Fox said that she would probably never visit the US again.\\"An Australian Children's-Book Author'S U.S. Customs Ordeal\\" by Cynthia Zarin, The New Yorker, 27 February 2017 Possum Magic Fox wrote her first draft for Possum Magic in 1978 during a course in children's literature at Flinders University. Nine publishers rejected the draft over a five-year period. When it was accepted by Omnibus Books in Adelaide they asked Fox to reduce the 4½ page book, then entitled Hush the Invisible Mouse, by two-thirds and to change the mice to Australian animals to place emphasis on her Australian theme. Possum Magic is now one of the most recognised picture books in Australia and has sold over 3 million copies worldwide. The two main characters in Possum Magic are Grandma Poss and Hush. Hush has been made invisible by her Grandma to protect her from the dangers of the Australian bush. The story details the duo's adventures as they tour Australia searching for the secret to Hush's visibility. It is a rhythmical story of Australia's varied landscapes and the animals that live in them. Guess What? The book Guess What? ranks number 66 on the American list of the 100 most challenged books 1990 to 2000. Groups and agencies can challenge a book to prevent it from being available to be read by the general public. Personal life Fox was born Merrion Frances Partridge in Melbourne, Australia, but grew up in Southern Rhodesia. Her parents were missionaries and she attended Hope Fountain mission school, near Bulawayo. When she was eighteen, she went to England where she was accepted into an English Drama school. In 1969, she married Malcolm Fox, a teacher. The following year they returned to Australia and in 1971 she gave birth to her only child Chloë Fox, a former ALP member of the South Australian Parliament. She dislikes her given name, and adopted the shortened form \\"Mem\\" at around the age of 13. She has never taken the step of legally changing her name, and so remains \\"Merrion\\" for official purposes.

The claims may be categorized into linguistic decipherments, identifying the language of the inscription, and non-linguistic decipherments. A purely ideographical reading is semantic but not linguistic in the strict sense: while it may reveal the meaning of the inscription, it would not allow us to identify the underlying language. A large part of the claims are clearly pseudoscientific, if not bordering on the esoteric. Linguists are doubtful whether the inscription is sufficiently long to be unambiguously interpreted. It is possible that one of these decipherments is correct, and that, without further material in the same script, we will never know which. Mainstream consensus tends towards the assumption of a syllabic script, possibly mixed with ideogram, like the known scripts of the epoch (Egyptian hieroglyphs, Anatolian hieroglyphs, Linear B). Some approaches attempt to establish a connection with known scripts, either the roughly contemporary Cretan hieroglyphs or Linear A native to Crete, or Egyptian or Anatolian hieroglyphics. Solutions postulating an independent Aegean script have also been proposed.

He interprets the text as \\"proto-Ionic\\" Greek in syllabic writing. Reading A-side first, inwards, he deciphers a (funerary) hymn to one Arion, child of Argos, destroyer of Iasos. The language is a Greek dialect, written with considerable phonological ambiguities, comparable to the writing of Mycenean Greek in Linear B, hand-crafted by Faucounau to suit his reading, among other things postulating change of digamma to y and loss of labiovelars, but retention of Indo-European -sy- (in the genitive singular -osyo, Homeric -oio). Faucounau has gathered evidence, which he asserts shows the existence of proto-Ionians as early as the Early Bronze Age and of a proto-Ionic language with the required characteristics during the Late Bronze Age. He has presented this evidence in several papers and summarized it in his two books, of 1999 and 2001. The text begins :ka-s (a)r-ko-syo / pa-yi-s / a-ri-o / a-a-mo / ka-s læ-yi-to / te-ri-o-s / te-tmæ- næ :kas Argoio payis Arion ahamos. kas læi(s)ton dærios tetmænai :\\"Arion, the son of Argos, is without equal. He has distributed the spoil of battle.\\" Faucounau's solution was critically reviewed by Duhoux (2000), who in particular was sceptical about the consonantal sign s (D12) in the otherwise syllabic script, which appears word-finally in the sentence particle kas, but not in nominatives like ahamos. Most syllabaries would either omit s in both places, or use a syllable beginning with s in both places. Luwian Achterberg et al., 2004 interpreted the text as Anatolian hieroglyphic, reading inwards, A-side first. The research group proposes a 14th-century date, based on a dating of PH 1, the associated Linear A tablet. The resulting text is a Luwian document of land ownership, addressed to one na-sa-tu (\\"Nestor\\"; Dative na-sa-ti) of hi-ya-wa (Ahhiyawa). Toponyms read are pa-ya-tu (Phaistos), ra-su-ta (Lasithi), mi-SARU (Mesara), ku-na-sa (Knossos), sa3-har- wa (Scheria), ri-ti-na (Rhytion). Another personal name read is i-du-ma-na (\\"Idomeneus\\"), governor of Mesara. The strokes are read as a 46th glyph, expressing word-final ti.

It belongs to a clade of Patagioenas which generally lack iridescent display plumage, except some vestiges in the pale-vented pigeon.  Description  Red-billed pigeons have largely dark, slate-gray plumage with a more maroon, though sometimes described as purple, head, neck, and wing coverts. They have pale red eyes with an orange orbital ring, along with a red bill with a yellow tip. Noticeably, they don't have iridescent collar plumage. A blue-gray belly and tail coverts, as well as a less brown back, distinguish it from most other species., such as the Ruddy Pigeon and Short-billed Pigeon. The only noticeable difference between males and females is that the females have a duller colored head and neck. Juveniles are often even more dull in color and have dark and dusky shoulders, as well as a more brown mantle and wings. Compared to other birds, they are a more mid-to-large sized bird, growing to be between 30-37 cm (12-15 in.) in length and a weight of . Red- billed pigeons have a very distinctive call, described to be a long, high- pitched call consisting of a coooo followed by three cuk-c'-c'-coo notes. It follows an ascending sound. When taking off, the birds' wings create a noticeable clapping noise.  Distribution and Habitat  Red-billed pigeons are common throughout dry forests in primarily coastal Mexico and Central America, most common in Rio Grande, though still an uncommon find during summertime. They can sometimes be found in Southern Texas, with a declining population. In almost all areas, they are rare to see during the winter.

S. Friedman. It is the first book in the Coldfire Trilogy, followed by When True Night Falls. Plot introduction Black Sun Rising takes place on the fictional planet of Erna, following the perspective of Damien Vryce, a priest of the Church of Human Unification on Erna. The tale begins with him entering the great city of Jaggonath, a mimicry of modern-day Jerusalem, as the pagan religions that advocate the worship of personal gods and the church of the One God share the city. He has come to assist the Patriarch of his Church with a new, somewhat controversial mission: teaching initiates of his Order the rudiments of sorcery with the energy force known as the Fae (detailed further in Coldfire Trilogy section). As the Church primarily resists human reliance on the Fae, the classes are opposed by the Patriarch, though held with high regard by the Matriarch whom Damien serves. While in the city, Damien Vryce enters the shop of an Adept (individuals with the ability to sense the Fae on a level akin to a sixth sense) named Ciani, with whom he begins a light- hearted courtship. Their fledgling love is abruptly put on hold, however, when Ciani's shop explodes in a Fae-related accident. Damien presumes she is dead, but her assistant, Senzei \\"Zen\\" Reese, informs him otherwise. Ciani was alive, but mortally wounded, not physically but mentally and spiritually. She had been assaulted by a gang of unknown creatures that stole from her memories, and her skills as an Adept. This has left her bereft of a will to live; an Adept sees the Fae every waking moment, giving their vision a \\"life\\" to it that regular humans could not comprehend. Without her skill however, all she can see is a dead world. Senzei had set off the store as a Sacrifice, so as to hide the fact that Ciani was still alive. Damien vows to help Ciani, and prepares to set off after the mysterious thieves. The Patriarch does not fully approve, but offers his blessing, and the aid of the Church's most valued relic: a vial of pure, liquified Solar Fae, the sacred Fire of the Church. Together with Ciani and Senzei, the trio leaves Jaggonath, tailing the sadistic creatures. Plot summary As they make their way north, they encounter a man by the name of Gerald Tarrant, who marks himself as the servant of the Hunter, a powerful Adept who lives in the middle of a vortex of Fae. He accompanies them for a time, for unexplained reasons. One night as the party rests at an inn near the Forest, they are accosted by the Soul Eaters responsible for Ciani's current condition. In the immense confusion of the battle, not helped by the mysterious appearance of a hooded woman who utilized the Tidal Fae, Tarrant loses self-control, and accidentally feeds upon the vulnerable Ciani, sapping her of her remaining memories. In a rage, Damien attempts to confront a strangely weakened Tarrant, who flees with Ciani. The two remaining of the party rush off to rescue Ciani from where she must have been taken; the Forest. The Priest and the Sorcerer manage to combat the dread creatures that feed on the Dark Fae swirling around the Forest, a winded Damien and a mortally wounded Senzei stumble upon an immense castle; a castle Damien eventually recognizes to be of Church-design. The Hunter's servants welcome them inside, and ask them to wait for their Master. To the surprise of all, the Hunter is none other than Gerald Tarrant himself; furthermore, Tarrant reveals himself to be the former Neocount of Merentha, and Prophet of the Church for Human Unification on Erna, Damien's church. While Damien buckles under this revelation, Zen succumbs to wounds he sustained from the dark beasts of the Forest, which the Hunter offers to cleanse. As payment, Tarrant demands to be allowed to accompany the three of them on their journey. The Hunter is an insurmountably arrogant man; the assault by the Soul Eaters made him feed upon Ciani, a woman he vowed not to harm. Ironically, part of the forces that protect his existence is his honor, and reneging on any vow he makes could destroy him. He refused to allow anyone to make a fool of him, for which he seeks to find the Master of the Soul Eaters in order to punish him. Damien grows conflicted: on the one hand, the oaths of his Order demand that he do what he can to destroy this evil standing before him, and entering into a pact with him would be the blackest anathema; yet without the Hunter's help, it was very likely that the three of them would not survive to find Ciani's violators. With a heavy heart, he accepts. The group then begin their way to the Rakhlands: a land inhabited by an intelligent and indigenous species of Erna called the Rakh. The Rakh are somewhat feline in appearance, but are very much humanoid, having evolved rapidly from their smaller, cat-like ancestors thanks to the appearance of the humans. They are primarily hostile to humans, given the latter's attempt at eradicating their race some hundreds of years ago. To enter the Rakhlands, the party must cross the Canopy, an odd anomaly in the Fae, where it fluctuates in intensity and power randomly and rapidly. As Gerald Tarrant relies upon the Fae to live, this crossing nearly kills him. While he survived, he is hopelessly weakened, and would require months to heal under normal circumstances. Knowing this, Damien volunteers to feed Tarrant, as the Adept would be useless in his current condition, and the group needed him to survive. Tarrant reluctantly accepts, chafing at the idea of having to rely on another for his continued existence, and establishes a link between them that would allow the Hunter to feed on Damien's fears. The Keeper sends a fae-born creature, Calesta, who uses Senzei's longing to be an Adept as a means to kill him. Calesta traps Tarrant with an image of his murdered wife, and binds him over a subterranean fire, where the Keeper of Souls feeds off his pain. Damien then must make a decision: should he rescue the Hunter, and unleash his evil power over the world again, or should he leave him to his fate and try to defeat the Keeper of Souls without an Adept's power? He ultimately decides to save Tarrant and worry about the consequences later. They defeat the Keeper of Souls by triggering an earthquake in the fault zone upon which the palace is built. As the party flees the Soul Eaters, they end up trapped in a dead-end tunnel. Tarrant collapses the tunnel, forming an escape route for Damien, Ciani, and Hesseth, exposing the Soul Eaters - and himself - to the killing sun. Damien and Ciani return with Hesseth to the rakh village, where Ciani chooses to stay. Damien is ready to head back to the human lands when he receives a surprising visitor: Gerald Tarrant, who had somehow managed to survive his exposure to sunlight. Damien asks the Hunter to join him in his journey to the Eastern Continent of Erna, where he believes the corruption that turned rakh into Soul Eaters originates. Tarrant refuses; he has been badly burned by the sun, and doesn't relish the thought of traveling miles above the earth fae, which cannot be reached through deep water, with the man who has sworn to kill him. But, after a visit from Calesta nearly results in the breaking of an oath he had sworn long ago, the Hunter changes his mind and goes with Damien. Their experiences in the Eastern Continent are documented in the next book, When True Night Falls.

European Jōdō Championship, jodo shiai. Place Bologna Italia EJC-2005. Seitei Jodo The art contains twelve forms (kata) and were developed in part by Shimizu Takaji and by a committee tasked with the creation of a compact Jōdō system to be taught mainly in Kendo dojos. Taylor, Kim. A Brief History of ZNKR Jodo, Journal of Non-lethal Combatives, Sept 2000 The result was the Zen Ken Renmei Seitei Jōdō system containing twelve forms (kata)and twelve basic techniques (kihon). Both the basic techniques and forms are drawn primarily from the koryu martial art Shinto Muso-ryu. The kata were chosen from the three first series of SMR, Omote, chudan and Ran ai as they were seen to best represent the art. Ten of these kata were taken from the existing SMR kata but with minor modifications as to better suit the requirements of the Kendo Federation. The two other kata was created specifically for the new Seitei Jōdō system and was not part of the original SMR-system.

The dan/kyu system is used for everyone. The koryu training licenses as found in SMR (Oku-iri, Shomokuroku, Gomokuroku and Menkyo Kaiden) are not used in Seitei Jōdō. The Seitei-system includes renshi, kyoshi, and hanshi ranks, although a Seitei Jodo practitioner can of course achieve the older ranks in SMR assuming they are trained in it specifically. Competitions Unlike the original art, Seitei Jōdō holds competitions in which the performance of the uchidachi (sword) and shidachi (jo) is evaluated by a panel of judges giving points for proper execution of techniques. Training gear=Jō - The Staff * The Jō is featured in several Japanese martial arts. For more information see the Jōdō article. A Jō made of red oak, approx 128 cm long. The All Japan Kendo Federation specifies that the Jō should be 128 cm in length, with a diameter of 2.4 cm and be made from red or white oak.Zen Nihon Kendo Renmei Jodo Manual (English version) 2003 According to legend, Muso Gonnosuke, the founder of the original art of Shintō Musō-ryū, was inspired to create and use the Jo from a divine vision some time after he was defeated by Miyamoto Musashi in a duel. In this vision, a divine being in the form of a child appeared, brandishing a stick (or log in one version) and proclaiming \\"know the solar plexus [of your opponent] with a round stick\\". The jō, however, as a simple staff or walking-stick cannot be claimed to have a single inventor and would have existed long before Gonnosuke. The jo, like its larger sibling the Bō (long staff), was never an effective weapon on the battlefield in comparison to the sword, spear and bow just to name a few. Although the jo and most other staves could be used to lethal effect when thrust at vital points of the body, when faced with a fully armoured opponent those vital points would in most cases be covered by armoured plating. As a result, there were very few ryu dedicated to the staff- arts in the warring era. There are several ryu that include jo-techniques in its system. One example is the jo-tradition found in the koryu art Tendo-ryu Naginatajutsu, founded in 1582. In Tendo-ryu, which uses the Naginata as the primary weapon, there are techniques with the jo that simulates a scenario where the naginata has been cut in two and the wielder has to defend himself with the staff-portion only. With the onset of peace with the start of the Edo period (1603–1867), the conflicts with heavily armed and armoured warriors became a thing of the past. In this era, the jo-art would come into its own against non-armoured samurai and other opponents. Various other martial arts also include elements of jōjutsu not necessarily related to Shinto Muso-ryu. One of the most famous promoter of the jo outside of Shinto Muso-ryu in modern times, and indeed in the martial arts community as a whole, was the founder of Aikido, Morihei Ueshiba. Ueshiba trained in a variety of ryu including Yagyu swordsmanship, but is not known to have trained in Shintō Musō-ryū. It is believed that Ueshiba used his training in sojutsu (spear) to create a set of techniques for the jo. (Ueshiba also used the longstaff bō to perform the same techniques.) Tachi (Ken) - The sword * The Ken is featured in several Japanese martial arts. For more information see the Kenjutsu article. A regular bokken (or bokuto), the wooden practice sword used in several martial arts including Shintō Musō-ryū. The All Japan Kendo Federation specifies that the Tachi used in seitei Jodo should be 101.5 cm in length, and made from white oak. The length of the tsuka, or hilt, should be 24.2 cm. The Japanese sword, with its long history and many variations, has a prominent role in Shintō Musō-ryū. In the early Edo period the katana and the shorter wakizashi were the weapons of choice for samurai during their regular duties. On the battlefield, the slightly longer and more curved tachi would be used. In SMR the katana is the weapon used, but for training purposes a bokken (wooden sword) is used to minimize risk of injuries. Every training sequence (kata) starts with the swordsman, called Uchidachi, attacking the defender (shidachi), who in turn defeats his opponent. Unlike the main Shintō Musō-ryū system, Seitei Jodo does not hold any kata that uses the kodachi (short sword) and it is not used during training. The kata hissage uses a kodachi in SMR but is substituted in SJ with the regular odachi (katana). Clothing In the majority of dojos today, the jodoka essentially uses the same clothing as practitioners of kendo, minus the armour and other protective padding: A blue/indigo uwagi (jacket), an obi (belt, often the same type as used in iaido), a blue or black hakama (wide trousers used by samurai). The type of clothing worn is not universal for all SMR dojos. In some dojos, which in addition to jodo may also have aikido practitioners, the white keikogi and regular white trousers are allowed. All-white keikogi and hakama are also used in various dojos and/or on special occasions such as public demonstrations or competitions See also *Iaido ReferencesExternal links * Official All Japan Kendo Federation website * Seitei Jodo in Spain * Official Swedish Seitei Jodo section of Kendo Category:Shinto Muso-ryu Category:Jojutsu ","title":"Zen Nihon kendō renmei Jōdō"},{"id":"4420619","text":"Ocean Highway was a designation established early in the 20th century for a combination of roadways and water-crossings for motor vehicles which would generally traverse as close as possible to the Atlantic Ocean along the East Coast of the United States from Jacksonville, Florida to North Brunswick, New Jersey. The Ocean Highway concept predated the creation of the Interstate Highway System beginning in the 1950s, and in many states the highways and byways of coastal routes from Florida to North Brunswick still carry the name. Unlike many of the earlier named roads such as the Lincoln Highway, Dixie Highway, and the National Auto Trails, the Ocean Highway was intended to promote tourism and leisurely drives, rather than primarily a fast and expeditious long distance route. Eight states participated in the program at its inception: Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey. Formed as an opportunity to promote tourism of the various beaches up and down the Atlantic Coast, the Ocean Highway promotions began in the 1930s. Route description The Ocean Highway began in Jacksonville, Florida, where it headed to the north on U.S. Route 17, following that route until Virginia. It continued from Florida into Georgia and headed toward Savannah. Within the state of South Carolina, the Ocean Highway ran along the state’s coast, passing through Charleston and Myrtle Beach. In North Carolina, the highway served the cities of Wilmington, Jacksonville, New Bern, and Elizabeth City. The Ocean Highway passed through the Great Dismal Swamp on the border of North Carolina and Virginia before reaching the city of Norfolk, Virginia. At this point, the Ocean Highway shifted from US 17 to U.S. Route 13, and followed that route through Virginia Beach before coming to a ferry across the Chesapeake Bay. From here, the Ocean Highway ran the length of the Eastern Shore of Virginia before coming into Maryland. In Maryland, the Ocean Highway followed US 13 and passed through the city of Salisbury. Continuing into Delaware, the road passed through Dover before coming to Hares Corner, where the Ocean Highway split from US 13 and joined U.S. Route 40. The Ocean Highway crossed the Delaware River into New Jersey and continued to the northeast on U.S. Route 130. It passed through the Camden and Trenton areas before ending in North Brunswick. There were several spurs that existed off the main Ocean Highway. In North Carolina, side route A ran from the main road in Elizabeth City east to Hatteras Inlet. In South Carolina, the Ocean Highway had five side routes. Side route B ran from Mount Pleasant toward Isle of Palms, side route C connected the road to Folly Beach, side route D ran northwest toward Summerville, side route E connected the route in Adams Run south to Edisto Beach, and side route F ran between Walterboro and Combahee River. In Georgia, side route G ran east to Sea Island. History Over the years, some of the routing has changed. For example, for many years, the routing to the north through Virginia after passing the eastern edge of the Dismal Swamp offered a choice. A westerly track followed U.S. Route 17, passing through Portsmouth and crossing the James River Bridge and the George P. Coleman Memorial Bridge to travel northerly to the west of the Chesapeake Bay, while an eastern alternative used U.S. Route 13 to pass through Norfolk and crossed the Chesapeake Bay via the Little Creek Ferry (replaced by the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel in 1964) to reach Virginia's Eastern Shore, and move north up the Delmarva Peninsula to Maryland and Delaware. After 1964, the former Little Creek Ferry equipment was transferred to the Delaware Bay, and the Cape May-Lewes Ferry was introduced, offering another choice for crossing into New Jersey and following the shore points north from the traditional route over the Delaware Memorial Bridge.

In the early 1980s, Sauers developed a novel method by which to measure the degradation of Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) in high-voltage systems. SF6, a hypervalent molecule, is used as a gaseous insulator in conjunction with solid insulating material in high voltage systems such as transmission lines, substations and switchgear. When the dielectric strength of SF6 is exceeded, regions of high electrical stress can cause nearby gas to partially ionize and begin conducting, forming toxic products like SOF2 or S2F10. This method allows scientists to detect the toxic by-products of SF6 breakdown at very low concentrations (ppb) using an ion- molecule reaction cell and a negative ion mass spectrometer, as opposed to conventional methods such as electron impact mass spectrometry (MS), gas chromatography (GC) with thermal conductivity detection, gas chromatography with electron capture detection, or a combination of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry.

It is also an affluent residential area located just to the north of the hill. The area consists primarily of Shouson Hill Road, a loop off the main Wong Chuk Hang Road, together with a few side roads. The hill is named after Chow Shouson, who was born in the village and became a senior official in the Qing Dynasty before the 1911 Revolution and then an active businessman and politician in Hong Kong. History The valley north of Shouson Hill was formerly a cultivated area containing a walled village. It has also been known as Wong Chuk Hang Valley and Staunton's Valley. In the early 20th century, the British military used the hill to bunker troops and as a sentry post overlooking Deep Water Bay, Aberdeen, and area now occupied by Ocean Park. The bunkers are now abandoned and run down. During World War II, locals were evacuated to the area to avoid Japanese air assault. Geography Shouson Hill comprises two sections: The West and South Nursery. The area slopes steeply to Deep Water Bay and gradually towards Aberdeen. Loose gravel and steep slopes make it prone to landslides during heavy rain that occasionally require the closure of sections of road. Vegetation covers nearly three-quarters of the hill, with species including mandarin shrubs, mangrove trees, palm trees and some coniferous forest trees.

Westfield Booragoon is located at the corner of Marmion Street and Riseley Street in the southern suburb of Booragoon. 50% of the shopping complex is owned by AMP Limited through its Australian Core Property Portfolio with the remaining 50% owned by Scentre Group which owns and operates its properties under the Westfield name of which the company is derived from. In recent years there have been, on average, 13 million annual individual visits to the centre, generating an estimated turnover of over A$500 million annually. In 2011, it grossed a Moving Annual Turnover of A$577.1 million giving it the highest turnover of any centre in the state and the 13th highest in the country. Westfield Carousel has the 2nd highest MAT in the state. Garden City has been managed under AMP Shopping Centres since 1986; Scentre Group has part-managed it since December 2019. History and development In the late 1960s, the planning department of the state government drew up a plan for several 'sub-regional' retail centres, which would form the commercial and economic focus of each 'node', and take the retail burden away from the CBD. Booragoon, in the southern suburbs, was chosen as one of the ideal locations. It was decided to be named 'Garden City' and construction work was undertaken by Hooker Corporation which began in 1970. In December 1971, Lady Lloyd Jones placed a time-capsule in the ground. The centre was opened in 1972, and immediately became popular as the nexus of the Melville Civic Centre Complex, which had been established after the Melville Council Offices were built in 1968. The site was in the midst of sandy bush, not far from Applecross Senior High School and Wireless Hill Park. RedevelopmentsThe original precinct= To visitors today, the original section of Garden City consists of everything from the Davy Street entrance (where HBF is currently situated, as of December 2019), to where one reaches the Garden City Newsagents. Garden City remained this way (with less than 100 shops) until 1983. =New department stores= In the early 1980s, moves were afoot to upgrade Garden City to meet growing demand. The shopping centre's owners went after big-name department stores. One department store retailer David Jones had withdrawn from Western Australia, and so Boans (West Australian predecessor to Myer) and Aherns (since taken over by David Jones) were selected to build two department stores. In 1983, the first major redevelopment went ahead at a cost of A$25 million. =Food court and cinemas= In the next decade or so, demand increased, resulting in the first major expansion in over a decade. In 1994, the current food court was built. This was followed in 1995 with the cinema complex. The new floor space of 48,000 square metres was however still considered inadequate, and so a second expansion was planned. =Major redevelopment= The second major redevelopment of Garden City commenced in January 1999 and was completed in October 2000. The main addition was a new eastern section with three parallel malls. Another big change, was the creation of a new 'marketplace' in the area previously occupied by K-mart, and the re-location of K-Mart to the north-eastern corner of the shopping complex. A new bus station was constructed to replace the old one. Another new addition to the shopping centre was the $2.71 million Newmart discount supermarket which opened its doors on 3 October 2000, creating 120 jobs for local people. Newmart would later go on to become an Action supermarket in time for Christmas 2003 and then a Woolworths supermarket in late 2005. This phase of expansion removed much of the ground level parking, replacing it with undercover and rooftop parking. Apart from minor modifications to several satellite buildings such as the demolition of a service station in 2005, the shopping centre has remained largely unchanged since. = Second major redevelopment= Following the finalisation of a transaction which gave AMP Capital 100% ownership of the centre, AMP announced on 25 October 2012 that it was planning to invest up to $400m to upgrade Garden City. The centre is proposed to increase from its current approximate 72,000sq.m to 120,000sq.m., making it the largest shopping centre in Western Australia. The redevelopment would result in a new David Jones, an additional supermarket, an additional discount department store, a new fresh food precinct and an outdoor dining area. Retail in the centre will remain largely single-level. Works on the redevelopment were expected to commence in early 2017 and take over 18 months to complete. However, as of December 2019, no major redevelopment works have not taken place. = Third major redevelopment= AMP Capital gained approval for the new $750 million redevelopment for Garden City. Once completed, the centre would have been Perth's largest shopping centre with AMP Capital forecasting the Garden City trade area to grow from 480,000 to 555,000 by 2026. However, after several delays and an eventual halt on planning and construction work, the plans were considered 'dead'. Architectural features The glass atrium, which has been a feature of Garden City since 1972, has since been extensively remodelled. As part of the major redevelopment in 1999 and 2000, a significant number of new striking architectural and aesthetic features were added, including a three-storey atrium at the eastern end of the complex in the fashion mall. Transport A key Transperth bus station for the southern suburbs, the Booragoon Bus Station, is located at the corner of Riseley and Marmion Streets, and is the fourth bus station to have existed on the shopping centre premises. A number of mainline and feeder bus services operate from or via the station. Routes 114, 115 and 160 travel via Booragoon Bus Station en route to Perth City (Elizabeth Quay bus station), originating from Munster, Hamilton Hill Hall and Fremantle respectively. The 510 provides a direct connection to Murdoch Station via Fiona Stanley Hospital to Murdoch. The 501 services Booragoon Bus Station while en route to Fremantle and Bull Creek station. Westfield Booragoon is amply provided with both undercover and rooftop open-air parking. Facilities At present, the main shopping complex has a floor space of over 72,000 square metres. The entire centre is situated on approximately 300,000 square metres of land. The main shopping complex consists of a long main mall with several wings and side malls. Coles and Woolworths are the two principal supermarkets, while the anchor department stores include Myer, David Jones and discount department store K-mart. In addition to shopping the main shopping complex, Westfield Booragoon houses: *an 8-screen Hoyts cinema *a public library *several external banking buildings *an office complex centred on the Alcoa and Gateway buildings *another office complex known as Garden City House *the Melville City Council offices *a major regional bus station Major precincts The main shopping complex can be broken into several main areas: *the original precinct, centred at the sky-roof atrium which includes Woolworths (a former Action/Newmart store and the original site of Coles in the centre prior to its relocation to the 'marketplace' precinct in 2000, and its conversion to its $2.71 million replacement of its discount supermarket chain Newmart) *a food court, which leads to the cinema *a 'marketplace' which includes Coles *a central 'fashion mall' which includes many boutique outlets *two diametrically opposite north-south wings leading to David Jones and Myer *a northern and southern mall parallel to the central mall *a north-south mall at the eastern end of the centre leading to K-mart ReferencesFurther reading *Builder, The, Jan-Feb 2001 p-43-50.

Friedman. It is the second book in the Coldfire Trilogy. Plot summary In When True Night Falls, Damien, Hesseth, and Tarrant land on the shores of the Eastern Continent where the order of the Church have managed to subdue the unconscious working of the Fae. Consequently, the technology of the civilization is far more advanced than the Western Continent as is seen by the casual use of explosive weapons and fireworks. While conversing with various leaders, the group learns that only women are allowed to rise to the highest ranks in the Eastern Church. Many rarely see the Matria or holy women of the Church except for odd snippets of time and it is discovered by the group that the Matria and holy women are in fact rakh disguised with tidal fae. After learning of the corruption starting on the Eastern Continent the group manage to trace it south, to the crystal palace of the Immortal Prince, and his Iezu servant, Calesta. Along the way, they rescue a young girl, Jenseny, whose father was killed and impersonated by the Prince's rakh servants. Jenseny is driven near to madness by events she has seen and her rare ability to see and control tidal fae. While scared and untrustful she manages to form a bond with Hesseth who is unable to bear children as was ritual to the rakh who journey away from their homes to mingle with humans. The Prince makes a deal with Tarrant; in return for immortality, the Hunter must lead Hesseth, Damien, and Jenseny into a trap. But there was one catch to the deal: the Immortal Prince's plans include the corruption of the Church, and the former Prophet is not willing to accept that. Meanwhile, Damien, Hesseth and Jenseny cross a seemingly endless desert populated with scraggly white trees and skeletons. Damien is hesitant to cross the desert as the skeletons indicate some form of predator but sees nothing that could possibly pose a true threat. The group decides to cross and settle down for the night under a tree. Damien and Hesseth awaken to find that the tree's roots have begun to grow into their bodies. While at first they cannot move, they both eventually break free of the trees and find that Jenseny's body has also been invaded by the roots. Damien cut away the roots but feared that they might still be harmful to the young girl. The trio keeps traveling without rest to avoid the roots of the trees. They finally find rest on a granite outcropping. That evening when Gerald returns, he kills the roots of the tree that are still inside Jenseny. Damien then Heals the wounds that are left when Gerald is finished. Soon afterwards the group notice that there are large quadrupeds headed towards them with the intent purpose of killing them. In the escape that follows, Hesseth willingly gives up her life to save Jenseny - feeling that Jenseny was much akin to a child of her own and thereby willing to possess the greatest honor in sacrifice. Tarrant joins the group at nightfall and leads Damien and Jenseny into the trap in the Prince's lands but finds a way to smuggle a coldfire-worked knife into Damien's hands. Damien attempts to kill the Prince, but the Prince's soul jumps into the body of his rakh captain. Jenseny finds the coldfire knife, and, hiding it, makes a deal with the Immortal Prince: he can have her body, and with it, her ability to work the tidal fae, a newly evolved human trait. The Prince agrees, but just as he is entering her body, Jenseny weaves a bond between herself and the Prince, and sacrifices herself to kill the Prince. Following the Prince's death, Damien and Gerald Tarrant return north where civil unrest has broken out due to the revealing of the corruption in the Church. The new leader of the Church plans to purge the Eastern Continent which in turn infuriates Tarrant as that was not Tarrant's conception of the Church. However, in Tarrant's confrontation with the new leader, Tarrant accidentally shares a \\"divining\\" of the possible fall of the Church thereby bringing the new leader to his senses and stopping the slaughter of thousands of innocent lives. By doing so, Tarrant breaks his oath to the Unnamed and endangers his life in the process - a fact Calesta is quick to catch on to.

Kuali modules include Student, Financial, Human Resources, Research Administration, and Library. Founding partners are Indiana University, The University of Arizona, the University of Hawaii, Michigan State University, San Joaquin Delta Community College, Cornell University, NACUBO, and the rSmart Group. History Around 2003, Indiana University administrators were considering alternatives for replacing the existing financial information system. They looked at retooling the current financial system or buying vendor software. In 2004, Indiana University chief information officer Brad Wheeler wrote a paper about the state of open and community source software development in education. This paper helped coalesce a movement among higher ed institutions to create a community source enterprise resource planning software suite. Wheeler's preliminary work assessed higher education's readiness for a community source financial system project and its applicability across colleges and universities through a planning grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to National Association of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO) in 2004. In March 2005, after more than a year of evaluation, partner coalescing, and preparatory work, the Kuali Financial System (KFS) received a $2.5 million grant from the Mellon Foundation to help complete the software development. Colorado State University and San Joaquin Delta College became the first to host large-scale installations of the full KFS in 2009. Kuali modules now include Student, Financial, Research, and a no-code forms and workflow tool called Kuali Build. Over the next ten years, usage of Kuali had increased substantially, and by 2014 the Kuali Foundation had 74 member institutions. In 2014, the foundation invested in Kuali, Inc., which is now responsible for the development of Kuali software and offers the software in the cloud for higher ed institutions.

CLaMS was first described by McKenna et al. (2000a,b) and was expanded into three dimensions by Konopka et al. (2004). CLaMS has been employed in recent European field campaigns THESEO, EUPLEX, TROCCINOX SCOUT-O3, and RECONCILE with a focus on simulating ozone depletion and water vapour transport. Major strengths of CLaMS in comparison to other CTMs are # its applicability for reverse domain filling studies # its anisotropic mixing scheme # its integrability with arbitrary observational data # its comprehensive chemistry scheme  CLaMS gridding  Unlike other CTMs (e.g. SLIMCAT, REPROBUS), CLaMS operates on a Lagrangian model grid (see section about model grids in general circulation model): an air parcel is described by three space coordinates and a time coordinate. The time evolution path that an air parcels traces in space is called a trajectory. A specialised mixing scheme ensures that physically realistic diffusion is imposed on an ensemble of trajectories in regions of high wind shear. CLaMS operates on arbitrarily resolved horizontal grids. The space coordinates are latitude, longitude and potential temperature.  CLaMS Hierarchy  CLaMS is composed of four modules and several preprocessors. The four modules are # a trajectory module # a box chemistry module # a Lagrangian mixing module # a Lagrangian sedimentation scheme  Trajectory module  Integration of trajectories with 4th order Runge-Kutta method, integration time step 30 minutes. Vertical displacement of trajectories is calculated from radiation budget.  Box chemistry module  Chemistry is based on the ASAD chemistry code of the University of Cambridge. More than 100 chemical reactions involving 40+ chemical species are considered. Integration time step is 10 minutes, species can be combined into chemical families to facilitate integration. The module includes a radiative transfer model for the determination of photolysis rates. The module also includes heterogeneous reactions on NAT, ice and liquid particle surfaces.  Lagrangian mixing  Mixing is based on grid deformation of quasi uniform air parcel distributions. The contraction or elongation factors of the distances to neighboring air parcels are examined: if a critical elongation (contraction) is reached, new air parcels are introduced (taken away). This way, anisotropic diffusion is simulated in a physically realistic manner.  Lagrangian sedimentation  Lagrangian sedimentation is calculated by following individual nitric acid trihydrate (NAT) particles that may grow or shrink by the uptake or release of HNO3 from/to the gas phase. These particle parcels are simulated independently from the Lagrangian air parcels. Their trajectories are determined using the horizontal winds and their vertical settling velocity that depends on the size of the individual particles. NAT particles are nucleated assuming a constant nucleation rate and they evaporate where temperatures grow too high. With this, a vertical redistribution of HNO3 (denitrification and renitrification) is determined.  CLaMS data sets  A chemical transport model does not simulate the dynamics of the atmosphere. For CLaMS, the following meteorological data sets have been used * European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), Predictions, Analyses, ERA-15, ERA-40 * United Kingdom Met Office (UKMO) * European Centre Hamburg Atmospheric Model (ECHAM4), in the DLR version To initialize the chemical fields in CLaMS, data from a large variety of instruments have provided data. * on satellite (CRISTA, MIPAS, MLS, HALOE, ILAS, ...), * on aircraft and balloons (HALOX, FISH, Mark IV, BONBON...) If no observations are present, the chemical fields can be initialised from two-dimensional chemical models, chemistry-climate models, climatologies, or from correlations between chemical species or chemical species and dynamical variables.

Trained as a biologist in zoology and ethology at the University of Leiden, he taught that subject before becoming a full-time writer in the 1980s, having made his debut as a novelist in 1971 under the name Martin Hart with Stenen voor een ransuil (\\"Stones for a Long-Eared Owl\\"). He is the author of many novels, including Het Woeden der Gehele Wereld and De kroongetuige. His books have been translated into a number of European languages, and he is especially popular in Germany. Three of his novels, (A Flight of Curlews, trans. 1986), De aansprekers (Bearers of Bad Tidings, trans. 1983), and (The Sundial, trans. 2004) have appeared in English, as have a few of his short stories. The themes of his novels, which often have an autobiographical component, include: * the hometown of his youth, Maassluis * the strict form of the Protestantism with which he was brought up, and his rebellion against it * the love of a man for a woman * the relationship between an elderly man and a young man (e.g. a father and his son, a teacher and a student) * guilt. His writings are full of detailed descriptions of nature (e.g. the weather, insects, plants) and show his passionate love for classical music (especially the music of the composers Bach, Mozart and Schubert). Hart is supporter of the Party for Animals, and, in 2004, agreed with the party to underline that by becoming a candidate in the European elections. However, for this he needed an official identity document, and he has no driving licence, and had neither a passport nor another identity document (he had not been abroad for 10 years), and, for reasons of principle, did not want to get one for this purpose. He is also a prominent radio and television personality, and a regular contributor to daily newspapers. He currently lives in Warmond, close to Leiden, with his wife. His chief pastimes are music – he plays the piano and the organ – and reading. He says he reads six books a week, in Dutch, English, German, and French. He knows very little about films and rarely watches one. He does not want to be involved in films based on his books. He was, however, \\"rat consultant\\" to Werner Herzog for the film Nosferatu the Vampyre. This turned out to be a disagreeable experience about which he wrote a story, \\"Ongewenste zeereis\\", that appeared in 2004 in Granta under the title \\"Rats\\".

History In traditional Chinese society, a retired person was supposed to be supported by his family and his savings, thus an extended family formed a safety net. Life expectancy was comparatively low compared to today. As Hong Kong became a developed entity, life expectancy in the territory improved greatly and the birth rate dropped significantly. Extended family was broken into nuclear family. By the late 1990s, only 29% of Hong Kong's three-million workforce was covered by formal retirement provisions, Hong Kong's social security system is faced with the demographic challenge of a growing number of elderly people in the future. There were some calls to establish a central provident fund and heated debates among government, politicians and trade unions in the early 1990s. In 1994, the World Bank published the report \\"Averting the Old-Age Crisis: Policies to Protect the Old and Promote Growth\\", in which a three- pillar approach to protection for the aged was put forward. The three pillars were: * a publicly managed, tax-financed social safety net; * a mandatory, privately managed fully funded contribution scheme; * voluntary personal savings and insurance. After some 30 years of debate on how to provide financial security for the ageing Hong Kong population, the British Hong Kong Government legislated on a mandatory, privately managed fully funded contribution scheme in 1995 along the lines of the second pillar defined in the World Bank report. Legislators representing the business sector refused to back the MPF legislation unless an offset mechanism was included to allow employers to use amounts paid by them to make long-service payments or severance to staff. Under the legislation, occupational schemes are unlike publicly run national provident funds found in other countries, and those schemes marketed to the public as mandatory provident fund (MPF) are established and run by financial institutions.  Regulatory oversight  The Mandatory Provident Fund was implemented in December 2000, following the enactment of the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance in August 1995 and Provident Fund Schemes Legislation (Amendment) Ordinance 1998 in March 1998. The Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority (MPFA), up and running in September 2000, is charged with supervising the provision of MPF schemes – it registers schemes and ensures that approved trustees administer schemes prudently. The MPFA have powers to ensure compliance, including the ability to conduct inspections, audits and investigations, and also to impose sanction on a trustee in the event of breaches of the legislation. Initially, all 300,000 employers in Hong Kong without an existing occupational retirement scheme are required to enrol their employees, in the region of 2.2 million individuals, in an MPF plan by 1 December 2000. Any company that has not set up an MPF plan may be liable to criminal prosecution with possible fines of up to HK$100,000 and six months imprisonment; persistent offenders risk a penalty of HK$200,000 and one year in prison. At the same time, companies hoping to be admitted as service providers were also required to register by the deadline.  Mechanism  As the scheme operates on the principle of fully funded defined contributions into a privately managed plan funds contributed by employers and employees have and managed as a trust, which compartmentalises fund assets from those of the manager, investment decisions are delegated to trustee in the private sector. Legislation defines three types of MPF schemes: *master trust scheme – membership open to workers of different employers and different self-employed persons. These enjoy economies of scale from pooling the contributions of small employer units together for administration and investment. This type of scheme is especially suitable for small and medium- sized enterprises. *employer sponsored scheme – membership open to the employees of a single employer, thus is only practical for large corporations. * industry scheme – established for worker of industries where the degree of labour mobility is high, for example, catering and construction. The system is mandatory for all employees in Hong Kong who have an employment contract of 60 days or more and applies also to the self-employed between ages 18 and 65. Those employed in the catering and construction sectors are generally exempt but they may be covered on a daily basis. Hawkers (street vendors), domestic employees, persons covered by statutory pension or provident fund schemes such as civil servants or teachers. Members of occupational retirement schemes with specific exemptions, and foreign citizens who work in Hong Kong for periods shorter than 13 months or who are covered by another country's retirement system may also be exempt. Under the scheme, the choice of MPF provider is the province of the employer, with employees having no say. Employees are expected to join the MPF provider of their new employers when they change jobs. The employer and the employee each contribute 5 per cent(a sum equal to 10%) of the salary of employee whose earnings are above a certain threshold to funds run by banks, insurers or fund houses. Total contributions are capped at HK$1,500 a month. Employees and self-employed are required to contribute 5% of their earnings to their MPF fund. When the scheme was launched, the upper relevant income limit for contributions was $20,000. The lower and upper thresholds for relevant earnings are subject to periodic adjustment. An employee's MPF assets are fully vested, and are portable when the employee changes employers. Benefits that have accrued under the scheme of a former employer can be transferred to a scheme operated by the new employer. There are strict guidelines on the types of assets in the investment funds. However, MPF providers may offer more than one investment option constituted along the guidelines to its members through different funds, thus employees may build their own investment portfolio out of the funds provided by the provider chosen by their employers. Employees may elect on the asset allocation among different funds available from their providers, but may only do so for their part of the retirement contribution. Hong Kong employees and their employers started contributing to the scheme as early as 2000, but can only withdraw accrued benefits at 65. Only since 1 November 2013, employees were given freedom to transfer their fund assets to any provider they liked, once a year. However, only the portion of the fund assets corresponding to their contributions could be transferred. Offset of Long Service Payments is a feature of the MPF since the inception. The legislation permits employers to use contributions they have made to offset payments made to employees in respect of long service. According to analysis of offsets by unions between 2008 and 2014, it was found that 37 per cent of early withdrawals of MPF benefits, valued at HK$10.6 billion, came from offsetting by employers.  Criticisms = Increase in cost of employment  The MPF was launched during a downturn in the economic cycle, and there was pressure from businesses to delay its launch. Furthermore, there was disquiet among many small businesses, for which employers' MPF contributions represented a de facto 5% increase to payroll costs.  Inadequacy of provision  When the scheme was launched, there were concerns among employee federations that due to changing life expectancy and investment returns, the assets constituting the fund at retirement would only suffice to cover living expenses for a short period.  Fund management charges  Common with other defined-contribution system with individual accounts, administrative fees may be high. MPF trustees are free to set their fees provided that fees and structures are transparent. As there is no uniform method of charging fees, fund holders attempting to choose may be confused by the lack of comparability between different funds.  Offset mechanism  CY Leung made a pledge during the 2012 chief executive election to introduce measures to reduce the use of the offsetting mechanism progressively. However, union representatives criticised Leung for stalling on the delivery of his campaign promise as no changes had been made to the offset arrangements as at the end of October 2015. In early 2016, the pro-establishment Bauhinia Foundation endorsed phasing out the offset mechanism, saying that additional costs to employers would be affordable, as they amount to only 0.4% of payroll costs expenditures, and the annual net profit margin would be lowered by a mere 0.04 percent. Global Aging Institute president Richard Jackson remarked in 2016 that the retiring baby-boomers in Hong Kong were faced with challenges, as MPF was immature and traditional family retirement support was breaking down. Dr Ernest Chui, an academic at Hong Kong University criticised the scheme as being unadapted to Hong Kong workers. He said that in terms of the demographic changes that Hong Kong is facing, \\"the MPF scheme is very ineffective in terms of 'replacement rate' and thus cannot satisfy people's need after they retire.\\" Robert Palacios, a senior economist at the World Bank noted that the Mandatory Provident Fund's offset mechanism, where an employee's severance pay can be offset by the contributions made to his or her retirement funds, undermined the effectiveness of retirement protection in the city. Palacio explained that contributions being made are directed at two purposes – unemployment benefit and at the same time as a pension – thus not achieving either objective. From the period since its launch to 2010, employers used HK$12 billion from employees' MPF accounts to make severance or long-service payments; employees made redundant risked seeing their MPF funds depleted by these withdrawals.

The species was first described by Berthold Neumoegen in 1893. It is known from lowland deciduous woodland in the eastern United States but also suburban areas where lilacs (Syringa species) are planted, ranging from New York to northern Florida east to Missouri and Louisiana. The wingspan is 100–128 mm. There is one generation in the north with adults on wing from late June to early July. In the south, there may be a partial second generation with adults on wing from August to September. Adults most frequently nectar from phlox (Phlox paniculata and cultivars). However, males will occasionally gather over moist charcoal to obtain nutrients from the charred wood prior to copulation. Adults fly at dusk and in the early morning hours. The larvae feed on several plants in the olive family. The only native hosts of this moth are ash (Fraxinus) and fringe tree (Chionanthus virginicus). However, larvae seem to have a liking for ornamental lilac (Syringa), and occasionally will feed on privet (Ligustrum). Larvae are commonly parasitized by native braconid wasps. The introduced tachinid fly poses additional threat to the beautiful caterpillars of this species. Larvae pupate in subterranean chambers a few inches beneath the surface of the ground. The pupa is a shiny, chestnut-brown color. ReferencesExternal links *Struttmann, Jane M. \\"Franck's sphinx (Sphinx franckii)\\". Moths of North America. Archived April 5, 2005.

It is now the most successful team in ABL, winning 15 Claxton Shields. Australian Baseball League (1989–1999) Perth Heat won the ABL championship in 1990–91, when Graeme Lloyd pitched the Heat to a Game 5 championship win on the Gold Coast against the Dolphins to take the 3–2 series win. The Heat won a second championship in 1996–97 defeating the Brisbane Bandits. During the original Australian Baseball League the Perth Heat were the second-most successful team in the league, winning the title twice and finishing runner-up a further three times. Claxton Shield (2005–2009) In 2005, the name was resurrected by the Western Australian baseball team competing in the Claxton Shield. This re- branding of the team, together with the facilities of the new Tom Bateman Reserve in the suburb of Thornlie, reportedly contributed to increased interest in the sport in Western Australia, with many exhibition matches attracting more than 2,000 spectators, very high compared with usual Australian attendances for the sport. Western Australia hosted the 2007 Claxton Shield tournament at Tom Bateman Reserve, with games also being played in the nearby regional centres of Rockingham and Mandurah. Spectator numbers were between 1,000 and 1,500, and the grand final, eventually won by Victoria against New South Wales, attracted 1,500. However, the Heat was unable to win a game during the tournament. In late 2007, the name was further applied to the state's junior representatives, with the under-14, under-16 and under-18 teams being renamed the \\"WA State Heat\\". The Heat won back-to-back Claxton Shield titles in 2008 and 2009. In 2008, it won the Southern Division with an 8–4 record and swept New South Wales in the best-of-three semi final series in Sydney. In 2009, the Heat finished the regular season with the best record, at 12–4, and came back from losing the first game to beat New South Wales in three games in the Grand Final. The WA side led the deciding third game throughout but blew a 2–0 lead in the top of the ninth inning. With the game set for extra innings, outfielder Daniel Floyd hit a walk-off single to deliver back-to-back titles for Perth. Australian Baseball League (2010 – present) In early 2010, plans for a reformed Australian Baseball League were announced. The ABL, which is partly funded by Major League Baseball features six teams, Sydney Blue Sox, Melbourne Aces, Canberra Cavalry, Brisbane Bandits and Adelaide Bite. The first season featured a 40-game home-and-away regular season, with the top four teams qualifying for a three-round playoff format. The Heat's first game was at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground against the Brisbane Bandits on 11 November, won by Brisbane 8–3. The Heat won their first home game 4–2, on 17 November against the Adelaide Bite at the newly renovated Baseball Park. The Heat made several key signings in preparation for the new season. 2008 Claxton Shield MVP Clint Balgera returned to the team after sitting out the last two seasons, while pitching prospect Liam Baron is another key acquisition, with the former collegiate pitcher expected to lead the Heat's rotation. Allan de San Miguel, Warwick Saupold, Daniel Schmidt and Mitch Graham, who have been some of the Heat's most significant players in recent Claxton Shield seasons, as well as Jesse Baron, Clint Knight, Brandon Dale, Aaron Bonomi and Tyler Anderson have also signed on for the upcoming season. However, 2009 MVP and former Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim minor league centre fielder Nick Kimpton is leaving the Heat to return home to play for Canberra, while Tim Kennelly will miss the first half of the season after it was announced he will be sent to the Arizona Fall League by the Philadelphia Phillies. In early October, Perth announced a deal with the Baltimore Orioles, which saw the Major League Baseball outfit send four of their top prospects to play for the Heat during the first ABL season. Left- handed starter Cole McCurry, right-handed reliever Brett Jacobson and outfielders Ronnie Welty and Robbie Widlansky were the prospects Perth secured. Jacobson is the most noteworthy of the four, having been drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the 2008 MLB draft, before he was traded for Aubrey Huff. Jacobson was traded by the Orioles to Minnesota in the middle of the ABL season and he returned to America. 2010–11 Season The Heat started the 2010–11 season with a loss to the Brisbane Bandits, but quickly bounced back by winning the final three games of the series. They then won two out of four games in their next three series' before sweeping the Canberra Cavalry at home. Perth's season hit a snag when they lost every match of a four-game series to the Sydney Blue Sox but bounced back emphatically. The Heat won their next eight games before splitting the final home series against the Melbourne Aces to finish the regular season in second position. Among the highlights of the season were Widlansky, who led the league in hits with 52, and Daniel Schmidt, who was tied with Brisbane's Chris Mowday for most wins (six). Perth faced Sydney in the major semi-final and swept the series, winning game one 4–2 after Matt Kennelly's go-ahead two-run home run in the ninth inning before taking game two 6–0. That ensured they hosted the inaugural ABL Championship Series, where they met the Adelaide Bite. In front of 2,680 fans in game one, which was broadcast nationally on Fox Sports, Adelaide won 4–3 despite allowing 14 hits. The Heat forced the best-of-three series to a deciding game with a 9–1 victory in game two, which came on the back of an eight-run fifth inning, where Ronnie Welty homered twice (a solo home run and then a grand slam) in front of 3,074 spectators. In game three, which was attended by 1,876 people, the Heat scored three in the fifth inning and four in the eighth to secure the title with a 7–1 victory. Import Ben Moore pitched a complete game four-hitter in game three, allowing just one run and striking out 10 without walking an Adelaide batter. Moore was named the MVP of the championship series. 2011–12 Season Before the 2011–12 season began, Perth announced they've recruited the previous season's Helms Award winner James McOwen from the Adelaide Bite. They also recruited American utility player Alex Burg, who is a San Francisco Giants minor league player and Brenden Webb, Mychal Givens, Aaron Baker from the Baltimore Orioles system. Brooke Knight returned to the Heat as the Manager of the team. The Perth Heat began the 2011–12 season with an ABL record breaking 11–0 November with three consecutive series victories against the Adelaide Bite, Melbourne Aces and Sydney Blue Sox. As Champions of the 2010–11 season, the Perth Heat made the trip to Taiwan to compete in the Asia Series against teams from Japan, Korea and Taiwan. Perth had a lead in two of the three games, ultimately finishing the tournament winless. Returning to continue their 2011–12 season, the Perth Heat quickly lost their first game of the season against the Canberra Cavalry, 7–0 and then to lose the series 3–1. Perth ended the season winning the final six series' to finish the regular season with a record breaking 34–11 win/loss record. Entering the playoffs for the second consecutive season, Perth Heat hosted the Melbourne Aces for a five-game series. After Melbourne took game one 8–7, the Heat won the next three games outscoring Melbourne to a combined score of 21–10 to clinch their second ABL Championship Series berth. Two weeks later the Melbourne Aces returned to Perth after winning the Preliminary Final Series 3–2 against the Sydney Blue Sox and then began a Championship Series to remember. Game One of the 2012 ConocoPhillips Australian Baseball League Championship Series saw a Major League matchup with former major league pitcher Virgil Vasquez on the mound for the Perth Heat against Melbourne's starter Travis Blackley (San Francisco Giants). With a classic pitchers duel in the making, the bottom of the fourth saw James McOwen hit a home run to break the tie and to give the Heat a 2–1 lead. That's all the support Virgil Vasquez needed as he went on to pitching a complete game striking out eight hitters. Perth Heat won game one 4–1. Game Two went deep into the night with a 13-inning game which saw the Melbourne Aces tie the series at one game each. Behind superb pitching by both teams, it was a matter of clutch hitting to end the game. The bullpens were the highlight of the game with Melbourne's pitching 7.1 shutout innings to Perth's 6.2 innings. Brad Harman singled off Benn Grice in the 13th inning and Melbourne won the 3 hour and 45 minute game 3–2. Game Three saw Melbourne put on a hitting display scoring six runs through the first three innings of the game. Perth kept the game close scoring four runs of their own which included a three-run home run by catcher Allan de San Miguel. Like game two, the third and final game was a battle of the bullpens. Melbourne relief pitcher Bubbie Buzachero was lights out from the moment he stood on the mound. the likely candidate for the Series MVP kept the Aces in the game with eight innings pitched. Buzachero's bullpen counterpart Jacob Clem pitched 6.1 innings for the Perth Heat. Entering extra innings for the second night in a row, Perth relief pitcher Jack Frawley took the win and help keep the Claxton Shield in Perth pitching four shutout innings with four strikeouts. In the bottom of the 13th inning and Perth's Corey Adamson hitting, Melbourne pitcher Andrew Russell threw a wild pitch that got away from catcher Kevin David which allowed James McOwen to score the winning run to secure Perth Heat's second ABL Championship in as many seasons. Virgil Vasquez was named series MVP for his shutout in game one. 2012-13 Season Perth Heat finished the regular season in third position, with a 25 win 21 loss record. They went on to play Sydney in the preliminary final. Game one was postponed, meaning a doubleheader took place on Saturday. A delayed game one in the series fell Perth's way after a 4-1 victory, with 3 runs scored in the 7th inning which blew the game open in Perth's' favour. Game two was all that was needed for Perth to qualify for another grand final appearance with the Heat prevailing in an 8-6 win. The heat scored all of their runs before the 5th innings, leaving Sydney with a lot of chasing to do which they couldn't quite handle. Perth took on Canberra in the final series, unfortunately for the heat they were beaten in two close matches which saw Canberra win their first title in the new ABL format. Game one final score was 6-4 and game two was 7-6.  2013-14 Season  The 2013-14 season was extremely successful for the Heat, with an outstanding regular season record of 32-14 they qualified first and earnt a spot in the Grand Final series to be played against the winner of the preliminary final series between Sydney and Canberra. Canberra set up a Grand final rematch with Perth by winning the Preliminary series 2-1. With the same final combatants from the 2012-13 season the ABL could rest assured it would be a close series. The heat had the home ground advantage this series unlike the previous year. Game one went down to the wire with the Heat prevailing 4-3, putting all the pressure on Canberra. Game two was also close with the heat exacting revenge and atoning for the previous seasons loss. The heat won 2-1 and brought the Claxton shield to Perth.  2014-15 Season  The Heat finished the regular season with a 28-20 record which saw them finish in second position. Yet again the Heat played Sydney in the preliminary final series. Game one was a close contest with Sydney mounting a four run comeback, but it wasn't enough as the Heat held on by one run to win 5-4. Game two was disappointing for all Sydney fans as the Heat blew the game wide open and Sydney made four errors in a forgettable night for the Blue Sox. The final score was 9-2 and it saw the Perth Heat qualify for another Grand Final series, this time against ladder leaders the Adelaide Bite. Adelaide got the perfect start against Perth in the series by winning game one and putting Perth on the back foot after a 3-2 win. Game two saw the away team tie up the series and force a deciding game with the final score being 5-3. Game three was an exciting game with 17 runs being scored overall. The game was a home run fest, with 5 homers being hit. Luke Hughes, Tim Kennelly and Tim Smith hit the home runs for Perth, while Mitch Dening and Craig Maddox hit them for Adelaide. In the end the game was a blowout with Perth winning a successive ABL title and returning the Claxton Shield to Perth with as 12-5 win.  2015-16 Season  In Manager Kevin Boles' final season at the helm, the defending champion Heat went 23-33 to finish in fifth position and miss the playoffs. On the mound, import pitcher Edwin Carl led the league with 85 strikeouts. Offensivley, the Heat hit a league-low .223 whilst scoring just 214 runs across the 56-game season.  2016-17 Season  The 2016-17 season saw the ABL shift to a 40-game season, as opposed to a 56-game season. The season was the Heat's worst since the rebirth of the ABL in 2010/11. The Heat posted a 14-26 record to finish in sixth position. Led by first-year Manager Matt Kennelly, Perth struggled for consistency and missed out on the playoffs. Despite strong offensive seasons from Luke Hughes and Tim Kennelly who combined for 12 home runs and 32 RBIs, Perth scored a league-low 158 runs across the year.  2017-18 Season  After two years of missing out on postseason action, the Heat made their return to playoff baseball in 2017-18. Following the appointment of new Manager Andy Kyle, who replaced Matt Kennelly, the Heat compiled a 26-14 record to finish second in the ABL standings behind the Brisbane Bandits. Led by Tampa Bay Rays prospects Jake Fraley and Mike Brosseau, alongside local young-guns Jess Williams and Robbie Glendinning, the Heat re-established themselves as a powerhouse of Australian baseball. The Heat's return to playoff baseball saw them square off against the Canberra Cavalry in the 2017-18 ABL semi-finals. After claiming a tense 6-3 win in Game One - a game where MLB pitcher Warwick Saupold recorded the hold and Cameron Lamb the save. An injury to Brosseau and the absence of catcher Zac Law and Fraley would end up costing the Heat, however, as they dropped Games Two and Three to end their season. Fraley would go on to be named the league's Helms Award winner after breaking the league's stolen base record with 39 stolen bases. The outfielder also hit 13 home runs, 39 RBIs and scored 50 runs, while teammate Williams won Rookie of the Year. Off the diamond, Perth's Baseball Park in Thornlie was renamed the Perth Harley- Davidson Ballpark after securing a partnership with Perth Harley-Davidson.  2018-19 Season  The 2018-19 season saw the Heat win the inaugural South- West Division and return to the ABL Championship Series for the first time since 2014-15. Despite losing star first baseman Luke Hughes to the Melbourne Aces, the Heat opened the season with an impressive 4-0 series sweep of newly- formed expansion side, the Auckland Tuatara. The Heat went on to finish with a 24-16 record - good enough to pip the Aces to the South-West crown and return to the playoffs for a second consecutive year. Led by the signing of former World Series Champion Pete Kozma, the Heat scored a league-high 289 runs across the 40 game season, while hitting 51 home runs. Despite dropping Game One of their semi-final series to the Sydney Blue Sox 7-0, the Heat rallied to take Game Two by a scoreline of 3-1 in a tight ballgame. With their season on the line, the Heat then produced a solid offensive performance to defeat the Blue Sox 11-6 in the deciding Game Three and book their spot in the ABL Championship Series. The Heat lost the Championship Series 2-0 against the Brisbane Bandits - the Bandits' fourth consecutive ABL title. Heat outfielder Tim Kennelly was named the recipient of the Helms Award, while Robbie Glendinning won the league's Rookie of the Year. Off the field, all ABL teams became privately owned with the Heat purchased by a private consortium headed by WA businessmen and former childcare centre boss Rory Vassallo, experienced broadcaster Christian Galopolous and America's Cup winner Eileen 'Red' Bond.  2019-20 Season  On 1 August 2019, it was announced that former Manager Brooke Knight would return to for the 2019-20 Australian Baseball League season, replacing Andy Kyle. On the same day it was announced Kyle would remain at the Heat as an assistant coach alongside former Perth pitcher Tyler Anderson and Kevin Hooker. Perth opened their 2019-20 season away against the Auckland Tuatara on 22 November 2019. They reached the Wild Card game as the 5th seed, falling to the Canberra Cavalry 5-4.

The squadron was last based at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina and fell under the command of Marine Aircraft Group 14 (MAG-14) and the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing (2nd MAW). The squadron was decommissioned on June 2, 2017 as the Marine Corps sundowns the EA-6B Prowler. Mission Support the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Commander by conducting airborne electronic warfare, day or night, under all weather conditions during Expeditionary, Joint, or Combined operations. History=Korean War On September 15, 1952, VMC-1 was established at Pohang-dong, Korea. While flying combat missions during the Korean War, VMC-1 flew the Douglas AD-4N Skyraider from 1952 to 1958. After flying the Skyraider, VMC-1 was combined with VMJ-1 on July 31, 1958 at Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, California. This combination, along with the formation of VMCJ-2, provided the Marine Corps with squadrons that were dedicated to perform electronic warfare and photoreconnaissance missions. Vietnam War During this new era, VMCJ-1 flew the first carrier-based all weather jet, the Douglas F3D-2Q Skynight. In 1962, the Navy and Marine Corps re-designated all of their aircraft, resulting in the plane's new designation of EF-10 Skynight. VMCJ-1's Skynights were the only jet-powered aircraft to fly combat missions in both the Korean and Vietnam Wars. From April 14, 1964 to December 16, 1965 VMCJ-1 flew its Vought RF-8A Crusaders in photoreconnaissance missions from the USS Ticonderoga (CVA-14), USS Constellation (CVA-64), USS Coral Sea (CVA-43) and the USS Oriskany (CVA-34). In April 1965 VMCJ-1 took its EF-10B aircraft from Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan and joined Marine Aircraft Group 16 (MAG-16) at Danang to combat the increase of surface-to-air missiles in Vietnam. In July of that same year, six VMCJ-1 EF-10B's supported the first strike against a surface-to-air missile site in history. In November 1966, the Grumman EA-6A Electric Intruder was introduced at Danang and flew combat missions as far north as Hanoi and Haiphong and eventually phased out the EF-10B Skynight. VMCJ-1 retired its RF-8A Crusaders and received McDonald-Douglas RF-4B Phantom IIs to accomplish the photoreconnaissance mission. VMCJ-2 and VMCJ-3 also rotated through Danang with the VMCJ squadrons flying electronic attack and photoreconnaissance missions for thousands of strike missions for the remainder of the Vietnam War. After the withdrawal of troops from Vietnam, VMCJ-1 was again flying missions from Navy aircraft carriers. During the fall of South Vietnam from September 11, 1973 to December 31, 1975, VMCJ-1 and VMCJ-1 Detachment 101 conducted missions from the USS Midway (CVA-41), eventually being replaced by VMCJ-2 in December 1975 when the USS Midway returned to her home port. Reorganization and the 1980s Due to force restructures, the Marine Corps decided to reorganize its squadrons to establish dedicated electronic attack and reconnaissance squadrons. The result was the establishment on July 1, 1974 of VMFP-3 at MCAS El Toro, which would then only fly the RF-4B Phantom II. All EA-6A aircraft were reorganized at MCAS Cherry Point, North Carolina under the designation VMAQ-2. In September 1975, VMCJ-1 and its “Romeo Mike” tail flash was disestablished. During this time, the U.S. Navy had been receiving the newly designed Grumman EA-6B Prowler. The Marine Corps decided to maintain its war proven EA-6A's until the Prowler Improved Capability (ICAP) aircraft would be produced. In the early 1980s, the Marine Corps began receiving the ICAP EA-6B Prowlers. The growing number of Prowlers forced the Marine Corps to reduce its number of EA-6A's. To accomplish this, the Marine Corps moved its EA-6A's to the Marine Reserves at NAS Whidbey Island, Washington. This allowed the Marine Corps to maintain a proven electronic attack asset and on May 21, 1981 VMAQ-4 was established as a reserve squadron at NAS Whidbey Island flying the EA-6A. Many members of the new VMAQ-4 had flown EA-6As in Vietnam while in VMCJ-1, and when the time came to designate a tail code the members reprised the old “RM” as a remembrance of VMCJ-1. Gulf War and the 1990s During the spring of 1990, VMAQ-4 transitioned from the EA-6A to the newer EA-6B Prowler. That summer, the squadron was activated for a Unit Deployment Program (UDP) to MCAS Iwakuni, Japan to help relieve the active duty squadron VMAQ-2 detachments that spent the previous 14 months overseas. During the UDP, VMAQ-4 had several \\"mini- det\\"s to places such as Kadena Air Force Base, Okinawa; RAAF Curtin, Australia; and Naval Air Station Cubi Point, Philippines. In 1990, VMAQ-4 received the \\"Outstanding Unit Award\\" from the Association of Old Crows. After returning from the UDP and standing down for approximately 10 months as a reserve squadron, VMAQ-4 was restructured as an active duty squadron and moved to MCAS Cherry Point in October 1992. Around the same time, one year after Operation Desert Storm, VMAQ-2, detachments X (x-ray), Y (yankee), and Z (zulu) were divided into three squadrons, VMAQ-1, 2, and 3. This restructuring move gave the Marine Corps four full active duty EA-6B squadrons based out of MCAS Cherry Point, NC. From 1996 to 1998, VMAQ-4 and its “RM” tail flash flew in support of combat sorties from Aviano Air Base, Italy during Operation Deny Flight, Operation Decisive Endeavour, and Operation Deliberate Guard over the former Yugoslavia. In March 1999, with only three days notice, VMAQ-4 deployed again to Aviano, in support of NATO Operation Allied Force, joining VMAQ-2 and other U.S. Navy EA-6B squadrons flying hundreds of air strikes against the Serbian Air Force and Air Defense during the Kosovo Campaign. In 2002, VMAQ-4 deployed to Saudi Arabia in support of Operation Southern Watch. Recent History In 2005, VMAQ-4 deployed to Al Asad Airbase, Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. After a successful deployment, the squadron returned to Cherry Point in July and supported the fall WTI course in Yuma, AZ. In 2006, VMAQ-4 conducted a DEFTAC exercise in MCAS Yuma and later that year supported Exercise RED FLAG 06-02B. In January 2007, VMAQ-4 deployed to MCAS Iwakuni from January to April where they conducted DEFTAC and HARM exercises at Kadena AFB in Okinawa and participated in Operation FOAL EAGLE. VMAQ-4 returned from deployment in April 2007. In August 2007, VMAQ-4 conducted a TACDEMO exercise at MCAS Yuma in order to prove the effectiveness of the integration of the EA-6B and the LITENING Targeting Pod. Later that fall, a VMAQ-4 detachment augmented WTI 1-08 in MCAS Yuma. During December 2007, VMAQ-4 deployed to MCAS Yuma in support of Exercise DESERT TALON 01-08. Upon return to MCAS Cherry Point, the squadron spent the remainder of 2007 preparing for the upcoming deployment to Operation Iraqi Freedom in January 2008. In January 2008, VMAQ-4 deployed to Al Asad Airbase for a six-month deployment in support of OIF 06-08. In February 2013, VMAQ-4 deployed to Iwakuni Air Base in Iwakuni Japan. In August 2014, VMAQ-4 deployed to Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. From here they supported Operation Enduring Freedom, along with Operation Inherent Resolve which would start while they had been deployed there for only a few months. They returned home to MCAS Cherry Point, NC in February 2015. The squadron was decommissioned on June 2, 2017 at MCAS Cherry Point after 35 years service.VMAQ-4 deactivates after 35 years Unit awards=Other awards=See also * United States Marine Corps Aviation * List of inactive United States Marine Corps aircraft squadrons ReferencesExternal links * VMAQ-4's official website , EA-6B Category:Inactive units of the United States Marine Corps ","title":"VMAQ-4"},{"id":"4420871","text":"Lintneria istar, the Istar sphinx moth, is a moth of the family Sphingidae.

Life His title seems to have been a purely honorary one, for his patriarchate lay under the dominion of the Saracens, and he himself resided at Constantinople. Nothing is known of him before the Sixth Ecumenical Council, which deposed him on account of his monothelitism, after which he disappeared into obscurity in a Roman monastery. Nonetheless, he is noted in ecclesiastical history for causing the anathemisation or condemnation of Pope Honorius I.Bacchus, Francis Joseph. \\"Macarius of Antioch.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 27 October 2017 In the first session of the council, the Roman legates delivered an address in which they described four successive patriarchs of Constantinople and others as having \\"disturbed the peace of the world by new and unorthodox expressions\\", referring to the controversial doctrine of monothelitism. Macarius retorted, \\"We did not publish new expressions but what we have received from the holy and œcumenical synods and from holy approved fathers\\". He then went through the names given by the legates, adding to them that of Pope Honorius. In this and the following session Macarius was unable to find any references to monothelitism in a passage from St. Cyril of Alexandria and St. Leo. In the third session, several documents which he claimed emanated from Mennas and Pope Vigilius were found to be forgeries, surreptitiously introduced into the Acts of the Fifth Ecumenical Council. In the fifth and sixth sessions, he and his adherents produced three volumes of patristic testimonies which were sealed up for later examination. In the eighth session, he read his ecthesis, or \\"profession of faith\\", in which he appealed to the authority of Honorius on behalf of Monothelitism. In answer to questions put to him by the Emperor, he declared that he would rather be cut to pieces and thrown into the sea than admit the doctrine of dyothelitism, which states that Jesus Christ had two wills, the divine and human. In this same session and the following one his patristic testimonies were found to be hopelessly garbled. He was formally deposed at the close of the ninth session. Although his case was closed, Macarius had left the council in order to do more work. The papal legates seemed determined that monothelitism should be disposed of once and for all, so, when at the eleventh session the emperor inquired if there was any further business, they answered that there were some further writings presented by Macarius and one of his disciples still awaiting examination. Among these documents was the first letter of Honorius to Sergius I of Constantinople. The legates, apparently without any reluctance, accepted the necessity of condemning Honorius. They must have felt that any other course of action would leave the door open for a revival of monothelitism. Their conduct in this respect is the more noteworthy because the Sixth General Council acted throughout on the assumption that the doctrinal definitions of the Roman Pontiff were irreformable. The council had not met to deliberate but to bring about submission to the epistle of Pope St. Agatho — an uncompromising assertion of papal infallibility — addressed to it.see Harnack, \\"Dogmengesch.\\", II, 408; 2nd edition) At the close of the council Macarius and five others were sent to Rome \\"as the place they were more likely to be converted from their errors\\". This was done at the request of the council and not, as Hefele makes it appear, at the request of Macarius and his adherents.History of Councils, V, 179; Eng. trans. Macarius and three others who still held out were confined in different monasteries (see Liber Pontificalis, Leo II). Later on, Pope Benedict II tried for thirty days to persuade Macarius to recant. This attempt was quoted in the first session of the Seventh General Council as a precedent for the restoration of bishops who had fallen from the Faith. Baronius gives reasons for supposing that Benedict's purpose was to restore Macarius to his patriarchal dignity, the patriarch who had succeeded him having just died (Annales, ann. 685). The profession of faith in the Eucharist, in his \\"Ecthesis\\", is perhaps the earliest instance of a reference to this doctrine in a formal creed. To Macarius the Eucharist was a palmary argument against Nestorianism. The flesh and blood in the Eucharist is not mere flesh and blood, he argued, for how else could it be life-giving? He contended that it is life-giving because it is the own flesh and blood of the Word, which being God is by nature Life. Macarius develops this argument in a manner which shows how shadowy the line was which separated the Monothelite from the Monophysite.

It is one of the main precursors to other cadmium compounds. It crystallizes in a cubic rocksalt lattice like sodium chloride, with octahedral cation and anion centers.Wells, A.F. (1984) Structural Inorganic Chemistry, Oxford: Clarendon Press. . It occurs naturally as the rare mineral monteponite. Cadmium oxide can be found as a colorless amorphous powder or as brown or red crystals.Lewis, Richard J., Sr., Hawley's condensed chemical dictionary, 13th ed., 1997, p. 189 Cadmium oxide is an n-type semiconductor with a band gap of 2.18 eV (2.31 eV) at room temperature (298 K). Production and structure Since cadmium compounds are often found in association with zinc ores, cadmium oxide is a common by-product of zinc refining. It is produced by burning elemental cadmium in air. Pyrolysis of other cadmium compounds, such as the nitrate or the carbonate, also affords this oxide. When pure, it is red, but CdO is unusual in being available in many differing colours due to its tendency to form defect structures resulting from anion vacancies.Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. Inorganic Chemistry. Academic Press: San Diego, 2001. . Cadmium oxide is prepared commercially by oxidizing cadmium vapor in air. Uses Cadmium oxide is used in cadmium plating baths, electrodes for storage batteries, cadmium salts, catalyst, ceramic glazes, phosphors, and nematocide. Major uses for cadmium oxide are as an ingredient for electroplating baths, and in pigments.Clifford A. Hampel and Gessner G. Hawley, The encyclopedia of Chemistry, 3rd Ed., 1973, p. 169 Transparent conductor CdO is used as a transparent conductive material, which was prepared as a transparent conducting film as early as 1907 by Karl Baedeker. Cadmium oxide in the form of thin films has been used in applications such as photodiodes, phototransistors, photovoltaic cells, transparent electrodes, liquid crystal displays, IR detectors, and anti reflection coatings. CdO microparticles undergo bandgap excitation when exposed to UV-A light and is also selective in phenol photodegradation. Cadmium plating Most commercial electroplating of cadmium is done by electrodeposition from cyanide baths. These cyanide baths consist of cadmium oxide and sodium cyanide in water, which likely form cadmium cyanide and sodium hydroxide. A typical formula is 32 g/L cadmium oxide and 75 g/L sodium cyanide. The cadmium concentration may vary by as much as 50%. Brighteners are usually added to the bath and the plating is done at room temperature with high purity cadmium anodes.Clifford A. Hampel, Rare Metals Handbook, 1954, p. 87-103 Reactivity CdO is a basic oxide and is thus attacked by aqueous acids to give solutions of [Cd(H2O)6]2+. Upon treatment with strong alkaline solutions, forms. A thin coat of cadmium oxide forms on the surface of cadmium in moist air at room temperature. Cadmium will oxidize at room temperatures to form CdO. Cadmium vapor and steam will form CdO and hydrogen in a reversible reaction.

A young Marine private waits on the beach during the Marine landing, August 3, 1965. The term \\"Fucking New Guy\\" (FNG) is a derogatory term, made popular within combatants, military chaplains, and combat medics of the U.S. Army and the U.S. Marine Corps deployed to South East Asia during the Vietnam War, usually to refer to newcomers.. Vietnam War overview Usually, but not always, the term referred to recruits fresh from the United States who joined pre-existing units in Vietnam. Every unit had a FNG, and the term was used across all unit types, from front line combat through to support and medical units. The term was not gender specific; female personnel could be FNGs as well. The FNG phenomenon grew out of the U.S. Armed Forces's individual rotation policy during the Vietnam War, under which individual troops were rotated in and out in twelve-month tours with already deployed units in Vietnam. In other modern American wars before and since, military units have been maintained and have deployed as a whole. During this period, because of the Cold War, the United States faced the need of maintaining a large presence of troops not only in Southeast Asia, but in South Korea and Western Europe as well. The Johnson administration lacked the political capital and will that would have been required to call up the National Guard and Reserves or to convince Congress to extend the tours of duty of draftees beyond twenty-four months. Lacking sufficient ground combat units to sustain a unit-based rotation strategy, the individual rotation policy was adopted. FNGs were an important part of the group dynamic of U.S. units in Vietnam and their treatment had at its core an overall sense of \\"us\\" (those with experience of the war) and \\"them\\" (those who were back in the United States). As one soldier said, FNGs were \\"still shitting stateside chow\\".. It was in combat units that the FNG was truly ignored and hated by his colleagues. An FNG in a combat unit was \\"treated as a non-person, a pariah to be shunned and scorned, almost vilified, until he passed that magic, unseen line to respectability\\". On the surface, such treatment of new members in the unit happened for simple survival reasons. New recruits had a higher attrition rate than experienced troops, and the small units of veteran jungle warfare troops simply saw them as a liability. \\"They talked too loud and made too much noise while moving around, didn't know what to take into the bush or even how to wear it properly, couldn't respond to basic combat commands, fired too much ammo, and tended to flake out on even the easiest 10-klick moves. An' Christ, they even got homesick.\\" Beyond mere survival though, there were deeper reasons for veterans to hate the newcomers. On one level, the FNG represented those men who were still in America and this fomented resentment. As one popular marching song of the era went: Ain't no use in lookin' back, Jody's got your Cadillac; Ain't no use in going home, Jody's got your girl and gone. Until they set foot in Vietnam, every FNG was a \\"Jody\\", back in the U.S. enjoying life. Within a combat unit, the FNG was seen as a grunt. A unit would attach an almost mystical quality to any members of the unit with prior combat experience; the FNG was expected to live up to the same standard and would not be accepted into the group until he too had made a name for himself. The term is still used today in law enforcement, the United States military, wildland firefighters (especially the Hotshots), the Canadian Military, and technical trades heavily populated with ex-military. NASA Astronaut Group 8, the first post-Apollo astronaut group, was self-nicknamed \\"TFNG\\". Officially acronym stood for \\"Thirty-Five New Guys\\" (the number of astronauts selected), but unofficially was a reference to the term used in Vietnam. Studies Several specific studies have been undertaken into the FNG phenomenon. Prominent military psychiatrists warned that the individual replacement system was having catastrophic consequences on unit cohesion. * Dr. Douglas R. Bey published \\"Group dynamics and the \\"F.N.G.\\" in Vietnam—a potential focus of stress\\" in 1972 and has been referenced extensively, including having been used in defense of initiation practices within modern U.S. combat units. * Dr. Charles Figley has also written on the effects of being an FNG as part of the development of post traumatic stress disorder in combat veterans. Media and entertainment The term FNG and the group dynamics associated with it have been addressed on some level in several major motion pictures in the last couple of decades and is still used in the US military. *The film Hamburger Hill follows a group of young conscripts during the Vietnam War, who are often referred to as FNGs, and their relatively abrupt participation in one of the war's bloodiest conflicts. * Oliver Stone's film Platoon traces the experiences of young recruit Private Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) during the Vietnam War.. * In Robert Zemeckis's film Forrest Gump, the titular character (Tom Hanks) and his best friend Bubba (Mykelti Williamson) are called FNGs by their commanding officer Lt Dan Taylor (Gary Sinise) when they first arrive in Vietnam. * The backpacker novel The Beach by Alex Garland, later made into a film of the same title and directed by Danny Boyle, introduced the term into popular culture amongst young tourists in South East Asia. * Donald Bodey has written a fictional account of the FNG experience in his novel titled simply FNG. * In first episode (\\"Get Some\\") of the HBO series Generation Kill LCpl.

It is defined in section 983(d) of title 18 of the United States Code () and is part of the Code that defines forfeiture laws and more specifically the general rules for civil forfeiture proceedings. It states that the \\"claimant shall have the burden of proving that the claimant is an innocent owner by a preponderance of the evidence.\\" United States v. Liberty Avenue is a case in which the innocent owner defense was used. It can be claimed when the owner can prove that he had no knowledge of illegal activity or had not consented to the illegal activity. Many property owners choosing to assert the innocent owner defense are burdened by inconsistent judicial interpretation of the statutory phrase \\"without the knowledge or consent of that owner.\\" Some jurisdictions give this phrase a conjunctive meaning by requiring an owner to prove both lack of knowledge and lack of consent to defeat a forfeiture. Other jurisdictions interpret the phrase disjunctively by allowing the owner to prove either lack of knowledge or lack of consent to defeat a forfeiture action. The question in the case was whether a property owner can assert the innocent owner defense on the basis of lack of consent even if he admits to having knowledge of the drug-related use of his property. The government argued that to assert the innocent owner defense successfully, the claimant must show both lack of knowledge and lack of consent. Claimant, on the other hand, asserted that lack of consent represents an independent way of satisfying the requirements of the innocent owner defense and so he could thus prevail by showing that he did not consent to the criminal use of his property. The court concluded that a claimant could achieve innocent owner status by showing either that he lacked knowledge of or that he had not consented to the drug-related use of his property. In United States v. 92 Buena Vista a woman had purchased a home with money that her boyfriend had given her without knowledge that the money came from drug-trafficking. She claimed the innocent owner defense, but the court ruled that it applied to her as well even if it was later nullified by the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000. There are many jurisdictions that refuse to take any position, leaving the determination of the conjunctive or disjunctive question to the lower courts. Moreover, courts have also inconsistently defined the statutory terms \\"knowledge\\" and \\"consent.\\" The inconsistent judicial interpretation renders the standard for \\"innocence\\" under the innocent owner defense unclear.

It is a collection of 26 paintings, each depicting a collection of objects starting with a particular letter of the alphabet. It was published in 1986 as a competition with a £10 000 prize, closing in 1988. Unlike children's alphabet books, it contains unusual words, and is extremely intricately painted, with the paintings in a realistic style, but rendered surrealistic by the strange juxtaposition of subject matter. Wilks himself appears at least once in every painting, as does his trademark snail. Some of Wilks's appearances are less prominent than others; the hardest to spot is in the \\"W\\" painting, where he appears (representing, of course \\"Wilks\\") in a tiny cameo on a reproduction of the cover of his earlier book Weather Works. Each letter is itself represented several times, typically in braille, morse code, semaphore, and sign language as well as in its printed form. According to Wilks the book contained depictions of 7,777 words in total, ranging from just 30 for the letter X to 1,229 for the letter S, taking a total of 18,000 hours to complete. A single object may be described by more than one word beginning with the same letter: for instance, a dalmatian is also a dog and a witch is also a woman. Conversely, the same word may refer to more than one class of object: thus the leg of a tripod and the leg of a human being count as two separate words, and the image for K depicts several types of king. However, as Wilks points out in his Introduction, \\"anyone with expertise in any particular subject will certainly be able to identify more in these images than I have intentionally included\\". For competition purposes the book was accompanied by The Ultimate Alphabet Workbook, a smaller, saddle- stitched volume containing a checklist of 12,000 words: the 7,777 words depicted in the paintings plus 4,223 that were not. Contestants were to receive one point for each correct word checked, but would lose two points for each incorrect word. The winner was to be the contestant with the highest number of points, regardless of whether they correctly identified all of the words. Additional workbooks were available for purchase by mail order. Completed workbooks were to be submitted by post, to be received before April 1, 1988. The cover of The Annotated Ultimate Alphabet In 1988, after the competition had closed, Wilks produced The Annotated Ultimate Alphabet (), an answer book in which the paintings were accompanied by numbered line drawings referencing numbered lists of the words depicted together with brief definitions. These lists also incorporate several sketches of some relevant objects. As he had predicted, between the two editions Wilks had discovered a number of words he had omitted from his original list, bringing the total up to 7,825 (and that of the most prolific letter, S, to 1,234); and this did not include several more words discovered by readers that were too late to include in the lists. A number of omissions are still apparent. For instance the A painting includes a statue of Adam (which is listed), depicted with a prominent Adam's apple (which is not); likewise, an aeroplane is not also identified as an aircraft or airplane. The letter B contains a listing for belly but not belly button, while under F a flying saucer is not listed as a flying disk or foo fighter. There are almost certainly many other additional words that do not appear in the official list. The Ultimate Alphabet was the first book in Wilks' 'Ultimate' trilogy. The other books are The Ultimate Noah's Ark () and The Ultimate Spot-The-Difference Book (). This last title was published in North America as Metamorphosis (). The Ultimate Alphabet Game was released in June 2010 for the iPad, by Toytek, a UK-based independent games developer.

Friedrich Bernard Christian Maassen (24 September 1823 – 9 April 1900, age 76) was a German jurist, professor of law, and Roman Catholic scholar. Biography Maasen was born in Wismar, Mecklenburg-Schwerin. After studying the humanities in his native city, he studied jurisprudence at Jena, Berlin, Kiel and finally Rostock, where in 1849 as an advocate, he took his degree at the university there in 1851. He was active in the constitutional conflict of 1848 between the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and the Diet, defending the rights of the representatives in three pamphlets, and, together with Franz von Florencourt, founded the anti-revolutionary \\"Norddeutscher Korrespondent\\". Shortly after his graduation he became a convert to Roman Catholicism. Later realizing that, as a Catholic, he was no longer eligible for public office in his native town, he travelled to Bonn, where he devoted himself to academic teaching. Maassen's magnum opus, Der Primat des Bischofs von Rom und die alten Patriarchalkirchen (Bonn, 1853), dealt with two important questions: whether the Roman primacy had existed in the first centuries, and whether the much-discussed sixth canon of the First Council of Nicaea bears witness to the primacy. This work won immediate recognition among scholars, and Count Thun invited him to Pesth in 1855 as professor extraordinarius of Roman Law. Several months later, he was given a professorship of Roman and canon law at Innsbruck, one at Graz in 1860, and one in 1871 at Vienna, where, until he retired in 1894, he attracted many pupils. In 1873 he became a member of the Vienna Academy of Sciences, in 1885 a life member of the Upper House, and from 1882 till 1897 was a member of the Supreme Court of the Empire. During the Vatican Council he adhered to Ignaz von Döllinger, but was in no real sense an Old Catholic, and in 1882 explicitly retracted all his utterances in favour of that sect. Incited by Friedrich Karl von Savigny's important work on the history of Roman law in the Middle Ages, Maassen began a history of canon law on the same lines. But of this work, which was to have numbered five volumes, he published only the first, Geschichte der Quellen und der Literatur des kanonischen Rechts im Abendlande bis zum Ausgang des Mittelalters (Graz, 1870). Several of his articles in the Report (Sitzungsberichte) of the Vienna Academy were practically complements of this work. His \\"Neun Kapitel über freie Kirche und Gewissenfreiheit\\" (Graz, 1876) is written in a vehement style; a sweeping condemnation of the Prussian Kulturkampf. An amplification of the first chapter appeared under the title: \\"Ueber die Gründe des Kampfes zwischen dem heidnischen Staate und dem Christentum\\" (Vienna, 1882). In many respects his \\"Pseudoisidorstudien\\" (Vienna, 1885) is a continuation of his masterpiece. He also edited in masterly style one volume of the great \\"Monumenta Germaniæ Historica: Leges\\", III (Hanover, 1893), being the \\"Concilia ævi Merovingensis\\". Noteworthy, also, is his \\"Zwei Synoden unter Childeric II\\" (Graz, 1867). Maassen was often perceived as an aggressive political tactician. He was an adherent of the so-called Federalismus, and strove energetically for the formation of a Catholic Conservative party in Styria, where he belonged for a time to the Diet. Maassen died in Wilten near Innsbruck.

In 1989 the University's Faculty of Dental Science amalgamated with Medicine to become the Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry and later expanded again to include Physiotherapy, Psychology and Nursing. The University established Australia's first School of Population and Global Health in 2001 and then the School of Rural Health in 2002. As of 2016, the faculty also includes the School of Social Work (having moved from the University of Melbourne Faculty of Arts) as well as the Nossal Institute for Global Health. Jones, R.

The Faculty is highly active with over 1400 researchers in eight broad research domains encompassing the breadth of medicine, dentistry and the health sciences. As of 2016, some examples of research outcomes from the University of Melbourne School of Medicine, Dentistry, and Health Sciences include the Stentrode a collaboration between the University of Melbourne, the Royal Melbourne Hospital and the Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health,University of Melbourne joint project to create the Stentrode and prosthetic body parts that can simulate touch sensations to amputees. The Ultrasound Education Group (UEG) is a research and education group within the Department of Surgery, founded by Alistair and Colin Royse in 2004. UEG’s research topics are transthoracic echocardiogram; transesophageal echocardiography for cardiac surgery; clinical point of care diagnostic ultrasound for heart, vascular, lungs, abdomen, invasive procedures. Other areas of research include cardiothoracic surgery; cardiothoracic anaesthesia; postoperative quality of recovery in surgery; and self-directed learning with ultrasound simulators. UEG research outcomes include: * Patients in heart surgery have better probabilities of survival if arteries from their chest wall and arms are used to replumb their heart, instead of leg veins. By scrutinising 51,000 Australian patients, Melbourne researchers discovered the risk of dying prematurely was at least 22 per cent higher if any leg vein was used in coronary bypass surgery * Cardiac surgery relies heavily on donated blood because of the high blood transfusion rates. But a major study of over 5,000 heart surgery patients has now shown that surgeons can safely use significantly less blood than they have been. The potential saving is equivalent to around one blood donation (about 470 millilitres) per moderate- to-high risk patient. Criticisms In 2010 the Faculty drew criticism from the Australian Medical Students' Association (AMSA) over its decision to alter its course structure to allow full fee paying domestic student places: \\"The Bradley report into Higher Education stated that participation by students from low socio-economic backgrounds in higher education in Australia needs to be increased. The Federal Government and Universities have been working hard to achieve this aim, which AMSA strongly supports. So for one of Australia's leading Universities to make an active decision to disadvantage students from low socio-economic backgrounds is very disappointing and will undermine much the good work being done around the nation\\", said Ross Roberts-Thomson, AMSA President. This alteration from labelling the course from \\"undergraduate\\" to \\"post-graduate\\" was seen as a way of avoiding the Australian Governments ban on full fee paying places for Undergraduate degrees, and as increasing potential barriers for applicants from low socio-economic background from enrolling.

Career Born Mona Barlee Smith in London to comedian Phil Smith and variety performer Jessie Barlee, she lived in Australia from 1913, and made her professional debut as Mona Barlee on stage in a 1922 J. C. Williamson production of The Merry Widow.Biographer Dr. Clay Djubal believes this suggests a 1906 date of birth as more likely than 1909. For the next ten years she performed for J.C. Williamson's, mostly in musical comedies and earning a popular reputation, appearing with numerous Australian based variety stars including Roy Rene. She also appeared in her first film, His Royal Highness, with Australian comedian George Wallace. In 1933 she emigrated to New York, was given a test for films and this led to signing with Fox Film Corporation. She made her first US film Sleepers East using the stage name Mona Barrie. While her lack of a glamorous beauty resulted in her generally being cast in important but secondary roles, during a film career spanning almost twenty years she appeared in more than fifty films. She co-starred in 1942's Dawn on the Great Divide, the last film Buck Jones made before he died in the Cocoanut Grove fire in Boston, Massachusetts. Barrie also performed at various playhouses across the U.S, debuting on Broadway in 1937. For her contributions to the film industry, Barrie received a motion pictures star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960. Her star is located at 6140 Hollywood Boulevard.

A BMX rider who has won just about everything from the World Championships downwards, he decided at the end of 2001 that he wanted to win an Olympic medal. As BMX was not an Olympic sport at the time, he turned his attention to track cycling. He qualified for the GB Cycling Team at the first attempt. A natural competitor, he revels in the combative nature of the Sprint and the Keirin, though his stand-out rides so far have been in the Team Sprint and The Kilo. At the Commonwealth Games, he was a member of the silver medal winning England Team Sprint trio, an impressive semi-finalist in the sprint (during which he broke the national 200 m record) and the winner of a bronze in the Kilometer, behind GB team-mates Chris Hoy and Jason Queally. However, he surpassed all expectations when he helped GB to win a gold medal in the Team Sprint at the 2002 UCI Track World Championships in Copenhagen, less than a year after taking up track racing. In 2003 he continued to progress, recording two personal best times in the \\"Kilo\\" (1 km time trial) and a win in the Mexico World Cup in the discipline.Olympics In 2004 he competed at the Athens Olympics in the Keirin and team sprint, but not medalling in either. This was despite becoming Keirin world champion only months before and setting the second fastest time in the Team Sprint competition, only to be knocked out by the German team, who set the fastest time. He continued to focus on the sprint, achieving multiple silvers and bronzes at World Championships, and the 2006 Commonwealth Games.

The other histone proteins are: H1, H2B, H3 and H4. Structure of the H2AFJ protein Background Histones are proteins that package DNA into nucleosomes. Histones are responsible for maintaining the shape and structure of a nucleosome. One chromatin molecule is composed of at least one of each core histones per 100 base pairs of DNA. There are five families of histones known to date; these histones are termed H1/H5, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. H2A is considered a core histone, along with H2B, H3 and H4. Core formation first occurs through the interaction of two H2A molecules. Then, H2A forms a dimer with H2B; the core molecule is complete when H3-H4 also attaches to form a tetramer. Sequence variants Histone H2A is composed of non- allelic variants. The term \\"Histone H2A\\" is intentionally non-specific and refers to a variety of closely related proteins that vary often by only a few amino acids. Notable variants include H2A.1, H2A.2, H2A.X, and H2A.Z. H2A variants can be explored using \\"HistoneDB with Variants\\" database Changes in variant composition occur in differentiating cells. This was observed in differentiating neurons during synthesis and turnover; changes in variant composition were seen among the H2A.1 histone. The only variant that remained constant in the neural differentiation was variant H2AZ. H2AZ is a variant that exchanges with conventional H2A core protein; this variant is important for gene silencing. Physically, there are small changes on the surface area of the nucleosome that make the histone differ from H2A. Recent research suggests that H2AZ is incorporated into the nucleosome using a Swr1, a Swi2/Snf2- related adenosine triphosphatase. Another H2A variant that has been identified is H2AX. This variant has a C-terminal extension that’s utilized for DNA repair. The method of repair this variant employs is non-homologous end joining. Direct DNA damage can induce changes to the sequence variants. Experiments performed with ionizing radiation linked γ- phosphorylation of H2AX to DNA double-strand break. A large amount of chromatin is involved with each DNA double-strand break; a response to DNA damage is the formation of γ- H2AX. Lastly, MacroH2A variant is a variant that is similar to H2A; it is encoded by the H2AFY gene. This variant differs from H2A because of the addition of a fold domain in its C-terminal tail. MacroH2A is expressed in the inactive X chromosome in females.  Structure  Histone tails and their function in chromatin formation H2A consists of a main globular domain and a long N-terminal tail or C-terminal on one end of the molecule. The N-terminal tail or C-terminal tail is the location of post-translational modification. Thus far, researchers have not identified any secondary structures that arise in the tail. H2A utilizes a protein fold known as the ‘histone fold.’ The histone fold is a three-helix core domain that is connected by two loops. This connection forms a ‘handshake arrangement.’ Most notably, this is termed the helix-turn-helix motif, which allows for dimerization with H2B. The ‘histone fold’ is conserved among H2A at the structural level; however the genetic sequence that encodes for this structure differs between variants. The structure of macroH2A variant was exposed through X-ray crystallography. The conserved domain contains a DNA binding structure and a peptidase fold. The function of this conserved domain remains unknown. Research suggests that this conserved domain may function as an anchor site for Xist DNA or it may also function as a modifying enzyme.  Function  Basic units of chromatin structure DNA Folding: H2A is important for packaging DNA into chromatin. Since H2A packages DNA molecules into chromatin, the packaging process will affect gene expression. H2A has been correlated with DNA modification and epigenetics. H2A plays a major role in determining the overall structure of chromatin. Inadvertently, H2A has been found to regulate gene expression. DNA modification by H2A occurs in the cell nucleus. Proteins responsible for nuclear import of H2A protein are karyopherin and importin. Recent studies also show that nucleosome assembly protein 1 is also used to transport of H2A into the nucleus so it can wrap DNA. Other functions of H2A have been seen in the histone variant H2A.Z. This variant is associated with gene activation, silencing and suppression of antisense RNA. In addition, when H2A.Z was studied in human and yeast cells, it was used to promote RNA polymerase II recruitment. Antimicrobial peptide: Histones are conserved eukaryotic cationic proteins present in the cells and are involved in the antimicrobial activities. In vertebrates and invertebrates, Histone H2A variant is reported to be involved in host immune response by acting as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). H2A are α-helical molecule, amphipathic protein with hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues on opposing sides that enhances the antimicrobial activity of H2A. Genetics H2A is coded by many genes in the human genome, including: H2AFB1, H2AFB2, H2AFB3, H2AFJ, H2AFV, H2AFX, H2AFY, H2AFY2, and H2AFZ Genetic patterns among the different H2A molecules are mostly conserved among variants. The variability in gene expression exists among the regulatory machinery that manages H2A expression. Researchers studied eukaryotic evolutionary lineages of histone proteins and found diversification among the regulatory genes. The greatest differences were observed in core histone gene cis-regulatory sequence motifs and associated protein factors. Variability in gene sequence was seen in bacterial, fungi, plant, and mammalian genes. One variant of H2A protein is H2ABbd (Barr body deficient) variant. This variant is composed of a different genetic sequence compared to H2A. The variant functions with transcriptionally active domains. Other variations associated with H2ABbd are located within its C-terminus. H2ABbd has a shorter C-terminal domain compared to the large C-terminal found on H2A. The two C terminals are about 48% identical. H2ABbd functions with active chromosomes. Thus far, it is missing from Xi chromosomes in fibroblast cells. Lastly, it found to be associated with acetylated H4. Different functions of H2A.Z compared to H2A are correlated with genetic differences between H2A and the variant. Resistance to nucleosomes occurs in H2A.Z by binding to H1 factor. H2A.Z gene is an essential gene in yeast and it is denoted as Htz1. Comparatively, vertebrates have two H2A.Z genes. These genes, H2A.Z1 and H2A.Z2 encode for proteins that differ from H2A.Z by three residues. At first researchers figured that these genes were redundant; however, when a mutant H2A.Z1 was created, it resulted in lethality during mammalian tests. Therefore, H2A.Z1 is an essential gene. On the other hand, researchers have not identified the function of H2A.Z2 variant. It is known that it is transcribed in mammals and this gene expression is conserved among mammalian species. This conservation suggests that the gene is functional. When studying H2A.Z in plants species, the protein different among residues from species to species. These differences contribute to differences in cell-cycle regulation. This phenomenon was only observed in plants. Phylogenetic trees were created to show the divergence of variants from their ancestors. The divergence of variant, H2A.X, from H2A occurred at multiple origins in a phylogenetic tree. Acquisition of the phosphorylation motif was consistent with the many origins of H2A that arose from an ancestral H2A.X. Finally, the presence of H2A.X and absence of H2A in fungi leads researchers to believe that H2A.X was the original ancestor of the histone protein H2A Modification of H2A H2A modification is under current research. However, modification of H2A does occur. Serine phosphorylation sites have been identified on H2A. Threonine O-GlcNAc has also been identified on H2A. Large differences exist between the modified residues of H2A variants. For example, H2ABbd lacks modified residues that exist in H2A. The differences in modification change the function of H2ABbd compared to H2A. As previously mentioned, variant H2AX was found to function in DNA repair. This function is dependent upon the phosphorylation of H2AX C-terminal. Once H2AX becomes phosphorylated, it can function in DNA repair. The H2A.X variant differs from H2A through modification. The C-terminal of H2A.X contains an additional motif compared to H2A. The motif that is added is Ser-Gln-(Glu/Asp)- (hydrophobic residue). The motif becomes heavily phosphorylated at the serine residue; if this phosphorylation occurs the variant becomes γH2A.X. Phosphorylation occurs due to dsDNA breaks. Modification on histone proteins can sometimes result in a change in function. Different H2A variants were exploited to have different functions, genetic sequences, and modifications.

Featuring a main globular domain and long N-terminal and C-terminal tails, H2B is involved with the structure of the nucleosomes.  Structure  Histone tails and their function in chromatin formation Histone H2B is a lightweight structural protein made of 126 amino acids. Many of these amino acids have a positive charge at cellular pH, which allows them to interact with the negatively charged phosphate groups in DNA. Along with a central globular domain, histone H2B has two flexible histone tails that extend outwards – one at the N-terminal end and one at C-terminal end. These are highly involved in condensing chromatin from the beads-on-a- string conformation to a 30-nm fiber. Similar to other histone proteins, histone H2B has a distinct histone fold that is optimized for histone-histone as well as histone-DNA interactions. Two copies of histone H2B come together with two copies each of histone H2A, histone H3, and histone H4 to form the octamer core of the nucleosome to give structure to DNA. To facilitate this formation, histone H2B first binds to histone H2A to form a heterodimer. Two of these heterodimers then bind together with a heterotetramer made of histone H3 and histone H4, giving the nucleosome its characteristic disk shape. DNA is then wrapped around the entire nucleosome in groups of approximately 160 base pairs of DNA. The wrapping continues until all chromatin has been packaged with the nucleosomes.  Function  Basic units of chromatin structure Histone H2B is a structural protein that helps organize eukaryotic DNA. It plays an important role in the biology of the nucleus where it is involved in the packaging and maintaining of chromosomes, regulation of transcription, and replication and repair of DNA. Histone H2B helps regulate chromatin structure and function through post-translational modifications and specialized histone variants. Acetylation and ubiquitination are examples of two post- translational modifications that affect the function of histone H2B in particular ways. Hyperacetylation of histone tails helps DNA-binding proteins access chromatin by weakening histone-DNA and nucleosome-nucleosome interactions. Furthermore, acetylation of a specific lysine residue binds to bromine-containing domains of certain transcription and chromatin regulatory proteins. This docking facilitates the recruitment of these proteins to the correct region of the chromosome. Ubiquitinated histone H2B is often found in regions of active transcription. Through the facilitation of chromatin remodeling, it stimulates transcriptional elongation and sets the stage for further modifications that regulate multiple elements of transcription. Specifically, the ubiquitin on histone H2B opens up and unfolds regions of chromatin allowing transcription machinery access to the promoter and coding regions of DNA. While only a few isoforms of histone H2B have been studied in depth, researchers have found that histone H2B variants serve important roles. If certain variants stopped functioning, centromeres would not form correctly, genome integrity would be lost, and the DNA damage response would be silenced. Specifically, in some lower eukaryotes, a histone H2B variant binds to a histone H2A variant called H2AZ, localizes to active genes, and supports transcription in those regions. In mice, a variant called H2BE helps control the expression of olfactory genes. This supports the idea that isoforms of histone H2B may have specialized functions in different tissues.  Isoforms  There are sixteen variants of histone H2B found in humans, thirteen of which are expressed in regular body cells and three of which are only expressed in the testes. These variants, also called isoforms, are proteins that are structurally very similar to the regular histone H2B but feature some specific variations in their amino acid sequence. All variants of histone H2B contain the same number of amino acids, and the variations in sequence are few in number. Only two to five amino acids are changed, but even these small differences can alter the isoform’s, higher level structure. Histone H2B isoforms interact differently with other proteins, are found in specific regions of chromatin, have different types and numbers of post-translational modifications, and are more or less stable than regular histone H2B. All of these differences accumulate and cause the isoforms to have unique functions and even function differently in different tissues. Many histone H2B isoforms are expressed in a DNA replication independent manner. They are produced at the same level during all phases of the cell cycle. Regular histone H2B is only added to nucleosomes during the S-phase of the cell cycle when DNA is replicated; histone H2B isoforms can be added to nucleosomes at other times during the cell cycle. Histone variants of H2B can be explored using \\"HistoneDB with Variants\\" database.  Post-Translational Modifications  Histone H2B is modified by a combination of several types of post- translational modifications. These modifications affect the structural and functional organization of chromatin, and the majority of them are found outside the globular domain of the nucleosome where amino acid residues are more accessible. Possible modifications include acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and sumoylation. Acetylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination are the most common and most studied modifications of histone H2B.  Acetylation  Histone H2B proteins found both in the promoter and coding regions of genes contain specific patterns of hyperacetylation and hypoacetylation on certain lysine residues found in the N-terminal tail. Acetylation relies on specific histone acetyltransferases that work at gene promoters during transcriptional activation. Adding an acetyl group to lysine residues in one of several positions in the amino acid tail contributes to the activation of transcription. In fact, scientists consider acetylation of histone H2B’s N-terminal tails, such as H2BK5ac, to be an extremely important part of regulating gene transcription.  O-GlcNAcylation  Modification of H2B S112 with O-GlcNAc is thought to facilitate monoubiquitination of K112, which in turn is associated with transcriptionally activated regions.  Phosphorylation  In histone H2B, a phosphorylated serine or threonine residue activates transcription. When a cell experiences metabolic stress, an AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylates the lysine at position 36 in histone H2B of the promoter and coding regions on DNA, which helps regulate transcriptional elongation. If cells receive multiple apoptotic stimuli, caspase-3 activates the Mst1 kinase, which phosphorylates the serine at position 14 in all histone H2B proteins, which helps facilitate chromatin condensation. DNA damage can induce this same response on a more localized scale very quickly to help facilitate DNA repair.  Ubiquitination  Ubiquitin residues are usually added to the lysine at position 120 on histone H2B. Ubiquitinating this lysine residue activates transcription. Scientists have discovered other ubiquitination sites in recent years, but they are not well studied or understood at this time. Ubiquitin- conjugating enzymes and ubiquitin ligases regulate the ubiquitination of histone H2B. These enzymes use co-transcription to conjugate ubiquitin to histone H2B. Histone H2B’s level of ubiquitination varies throughout the cell cycle. All ubiquitin moieties are removed from histone H2B during metaphase and re-conjugated during anaphase.  Genetics  Histone H2B’s amino acid sequence is highly evolutionarily conserved. Even distantly related species have extremely similar histone H2B proteins. The histone H2B family contains 214 members from many different and diverse species. In humans, histone H2B is coded for by twenty-three different genes, none of which contain introns. All of these genes are located in histone cluster 1 on chromosome 6 and cluster 2 and cluster 3 on chromosome 1. In each gene cluster, histone H2B genes share a promoter region with sequences that code for histone H2A. While all genes in the histone cluster are transcribed at high levels during S-phase, individual histone H2B genes are also expressed at other times during the cell cycle. They are dually regulated by the cluster promoter sequences and their specific promoter sequences.

The district was bifurcated from Salem District with Namakkal town as headquarters on 25 July 1996 and started to function independently from 1 January 1997. The district has seven taluks (subdivisions): Tiruchengode, Namakkal, Rasipuram, Paramathi-Velur, Sendamangalam, Kumarapalayam, Kolli Hills and Mohanur. It has two revenue divisions: Tiruchengode and Namakkal. As of 2011 census, Namakkal district had a population of 1,726,601 with a sex-ratio of 986 females for every 1,000 males and Tiruchengode is the largest city in terms of population. Namakkal district is geographically affiliated to Kongu Nadu region. to The district is famous for its large poultry industry, egg production and lorry body-building industry, for which it is often referred to as \\"Egg City\\" and \\"Transport Hub of South India\\". History Valvil Ori was a chieftain and one of the seven patrons from Sangam age who ruled over Kolli Hills around 200 CE. After the struggle between the Cheras, Cholas, and Pandyas, the Hoysalas rose to power and had the control until the 14th century, followed by Vijayanagara Empire until 1565 CE. Then, the Allala Ilaya Nayakas Vettuvagounder king came to power in 1623 CE under the Vijayanagara Kingdom. He build the Paramathi Fort with sand and stones on a 40- to 50-acre land. Two of the Poligans of Tirumalai Nayak, including Ramachandra Nayaka, ruled the Salem area. The Namakkal fort is reported to have been built by Ramchandra Nayaka after about 1635 CE. Geography Namakkal district covers an area of 3,368.21 km2. The district is bounded by Salem district on the north; on the east by Attur taluk of Salem district, Perambalur and Tiruchirapalli District's, by Karur District on the south and on the west by Erode district.The average annual rainfall is 716.54 mm. This district receives rainfall mainly from North East Monsoon. Panoramic View of Kolli Hills Namakkal District comes under the North Western Agro climatic zone of Tamil Nadu.Tiruchengode taluk alone is placed under Western Agro-climatic zone.The forest cover has an area of 512.5 km2, which is 15.4% of the total area. Temperature ranges between maximum of 40°C and minimum of 18°C. Besides the above two zones, Kolli Hills (a part of the Eastern Ghats mountain range) and a few isolated hills and ridges are scattered over Namakkal, Rasipuram, and Tiruchengode and along with the valleys and rolling hills, make up the characteristic topography of the district. The river Kaveri flows south and southwest hugging the district's borders with Karur and Erode. The other rivers flowing through the district are Aiyaru, Karaigottan Aaru and Thirumanimutharu.  Irrigation  The district is situated in the dividing portion of two watersheds between Cauvery and the Vellar System with the Taluks of Attur, Rasipuram and Namakkal on the East and Salem, Omalur and Mettur on the West. Mettur East Bank canal irrigates Pallipalayam Block with an area of 4,585 Ha. Rajavaikal canal irrigates an area of 4,215 Ha. Mohanur vaikal irrigates about 355 Ha. Kumarapalayam vaikal irrigates about and Poiyeri vaikal irrigates about . Demographics According to 2011 census, Namakkal district had a population of 1,726,601 with a sex-ratio of 986 females for every 1,000 males, much above the national average of 929. A total of 150,699 were under the age of six, constituting 78,754 males and 71,945 females. Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes accounted for 20.% and 3.3% of the population respectively. The average literacy of the district was 68.12%, compared to the national average of 72.99%. The district had a total of 475,511 households. There were a total of 898,245 workers, comprising 152,497 cultivators, 228,614 main agricultural labourers, 35,156 in house hold industries, 422,885 other workers, 59,093 marginal workers, 5,976 marginal cultivators, 25,112 marginal agricultural labourers, 3,641 marginal workers in household industries and 24,364 other marginal workers. Industry and Economy= Agriculture  The main occupation for most of the people in the district is agriculture, with a gross cropped area of around 336,700 Ha, out of which about 60,939 Ha are irrigated and about 80,598 Ha are rainfied. The cultivation generally depends on monsoon rains, wells, and tanks. Major soil in this district is red soil (77%). Nearly 90 percent of the cultivated area is under food crops. The principal cereal crops of this district are paddy, cholam, cumbu and ragi. Panivaragu, Kuthiraivali, Samai Varagu and Thinai are some of the millets cultivated. Among pulses, the major crops are redgram, blackgram, greengram and horsegram. Among oil, seeds, groundnut, castor, and gingelly (sesame) occupy important places. Of the commercial crops, sugarcane, cotton and tapioca are some of the important. Using tapioca as raw material about 350 factory units are engaged in the production of Starch and Sago in Namakkal District. Around 800 jaggery manufacturing units were located around ParamathiVelur.  Lorry Body- Building  Namakkal district is noted for truck and lorry external body building industry which dates back to 1956. Nationwide Namakkal is known for body building for truck, trailer, tanker and rig unit. Throughout India, Tiruchengode is known for its body building industry for trucks, trailers, tankers, and rig units. Finished trucks and rig units are exported to foreign countries from Namakkal. Nearly 25,000 people are employed, both directly and indirectly, in truck body building activity and about 300 units in Namakkal and 100 units in Tiruchengode are engaged in this activity. Ashok Leyland's Driver Training Institute in Namakkal (right in the trucking heartland of Tamil Nadu) was the first of its kind and has served as a beacon to lead the way in the training of drivers. Easily accessible from Erode, Salem and Trichy, and spread over 25 acres, the campus includes a driving range with every conceivable road configuration. A spacious building accommodates large classrooms, a library, a model room, a laboratory and a cafeteria with an open-air theatre attached. The roads come with electronic signals, signs, markings and streetlights for night driving – everything, in fact, that drivers will encounter on the highways.  Poultry  Poultry plays an important role in the economy of Namakkal which has an astounding number of 29.3 miiliion fowls and 32.4 million eggs produced every day, accounting for a bulk of supply of poultry products to neighbouring industries. Namakkal produces about 65% of the total egg output of Tamil Nadu. About 1,500 Poultry/Cattle Feed manufacturing units are also in existence. Mostly every poultry unit has put up their own feed manufacturing unit.  Others  Nearly 176 Sago factories are located in and around the Rasipuram Taluk. Bore- wells and textile are the main business in Tiruchengode. Nearly 37 spinning mills and more than 10,000 powerlooms are functioning in Tiruchengode. One sugar mill and one paper mill were functioning under Private Sector. Culture and Tourism=Namakkal Rock Fort and Hindu temples The town of Namakkal is built around a rock fort. The rock fort is on the summit of the rock, and the remnants in brick and stone still bear the brunt of the skirmishes to lay siege to the fort by the Cholas in the 9th century. There are two rock–cut cave temples located on both sides of the hill dedicated to Narasimhaswamy and Ranganathaswamy. The caves were constructed by Adhiyaman rulers who ruled over Kongu Region during the 7th Century. The Temple has been declared as monuments under the preservation of Monuments and sites Act 1958 and being administered by the HR&CE; department of Government. A temple dedicated to the Goddess Namagiri Amman is situated within the temple complex of the Narasimha Swamy kovil. The famous Namakkal Digambara Anjaneyar Temple, housing an 18-foot-tall Hanuman statue is located opposte to the Narasimhaswamy temple. It is believed that the Hanuman statue keeps growing and to stop the growth a priest put a magic needle at the top of the statue's head. Hanuman statue carved out of a single stone at this temple. Tiruchengode Tiruchengode is 35 km from Namakkal. It is one of the seven Sivasthalams in Kongunadu. The Ardhanareeswarar temple is located on a hill. The presiding deity is depicted as half-male and half-female, vertically to represent Shiva and Parvati worshipped as one form. It is considered one of the oldest temples in this region. Tiruchegode is the olden Poondurainadu in Kongunadu. Tiruchengode olden name is Thirukodimadachengondurur. Kollimalai (Kolli Hills) Water falls in Kolli Hills Kolli Hills are at an altitude of in the Namakkal District and are 45 km from Namakkal town. The Kolli hills are featured in several works of classical Tamil literature such as Silappathigaram, Manimekalai, Purananuru and Ainkurnuru. The region was ruled by Valvil Ori whose valor and marksmanship are sung by several poets, and his exploits are a popular part of folklore. There are three reserved forests that are controlled by the Government of Tamil Nadu, namely Ariyur Solai, Kundur Nadu and Puliancholai. It is not correct to regard the name Kolli Hills (Tamil: kolli noi- killer disease) as being due to the incidence of deadly diseases. It is because early literature records the existence of a deity called Kollippavai on top of these hills. The hills are known for medicinal herbs and plants that grow in abundance on their slopes. The Arapaleswarar Temple, the Horticulture Farm, the herbal farm, Agaya Gangai waterfalls, boat house, Peryaswamy Temple, Ettukai Amman Temple, Pineapple farms, View Point, and the Telescope House are the places to visit for the interested tourist. Attukalkilangu soup and raw was sold in this hills. The Valvil Ori festival is organised there every year during the month of August. The Arapaleeswarar temple is believed to have a secret path to the Shiva temple in Rasipuram. This Shiva temple is said to have been built by Valvil Ori king in the 1st or 2nd century AD when he ruled this area. \\"Arappaleeswara Sathakam\\" is the poem which praises the Lord Arappaleeswarar.  Jedarpalayam Dam  Jedarpalayam Dam is located in Kabilarmalai Panchayat Union of Namakkal District. It is located about 36 km from Namakkal. The dam is constructed across the River Cauvery and it is constructed by The king Allala ilaya nayagan, a Vettuvan king and also he make a vaaikal called Raja vaaikal. This dam is having a water storage area for boating. Transport Transport is the major field of work in Namakkal. A large number of bulk carriers and lorries run through all over India from Namakkal. Many lorry (truck) body building workshops are located in Namakkal.More than 5000 lorry workshops are present in this city. Egg production in this district is largely facilitited by the lorry transport. It is the main centre for linking other districts via bus routes, to the North (Salem, Villupuram, Dharmapuri, Krishnagiri and Bangalore), East (Tiruchirapalli, Thanjavur, Thiruvarur and Nagapattinam), South (Karur, Dindugal, Madurai, Tiunelveli and Kanyakumari) and the West (Erode, Coimbatore, Tirupur and Nilgiris). The train route between Karur and Salem Junction saves fuel and time for transportation of goods. Government buses are maintained by TNSTC-Salem division.The national highway NH-44 which runs through the city.

Her work contains political, social, ecological, and spiritual themes that reflect her interest in community and political action. Her pieces also celebrate the ability of women to adapt and recreate themselves in foreign circumstances and environments. > \\"As a Chicana artist, I believe it is important to produce and disseminate > positive images of our varied lives: my work counteracts the stereotypes of > Latina women as either passive victims or demonized creatures. My subjects > range from grandmothers to folk singers to truck drivers, and in a very real > sense, my artwork becomes a form of iconography. In honoring the experiences > of these bold women, I gain a renewed understanding of myself.\\" -Ester > Hernandez  Biography  Hernández is a Chicana of Yaqui and Mexican heritage. She was born and raised by farm worker parents in Dinuba, a small town in the central San Joaquin Valley of California, an area often associated with the struggle of farm workers. She was influenced by her family's involvement in the Farm Workers Movement and the politically charged atmosphere at the University of California, Berkeley, where she received her BA in 1976. In 1977 she joined the Mujeres Muralistas, the first established all-Latina mural activist group in San Francisco. By 1977, she had completed eleven murals in the San Francisco area. After receiving her B.A., she worked as an art instructor at several schools and universities in the Bay Area. Hernández is best known for representing the Latinx/Chicanx culture and hardships of the working class in San Francisco during the Farmers Workers Movement. Growing up in Dinuba, California, she was a spectator of the riots and strikes organized by Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta. In the early mid 1900s, labor movements began to take form and shaped the political and social climate. Mark D. Johnson, Professor of Art at San Francisco State University, states “At one time, the strongest and most important artists in California made art about labor.” Many artists were inspired and began to reflect the life of the working class through their art. During her education at Grove Street College in Oakland, California, Ester Hernandez began to learn more about her own culture and the unfair treatment of the working Latina women. There, she began focusing on using her art as an outlet for her anger about the treatment of her community. Hernández works with a variety of media, using painting for more personal work and screen-printing for more political work. Art critic Amalia Mesa-Bains has noted: > In the 1980s, Hernandez began to develop a counterpoint to her screen > printing tradition, using the medium of the pastel to create a more > narrative and naturalistic rendering of characters influential within her > own life. The pastel work almost serves as a pleasurable respite from the > demands of a cultural critique in its joyful celebration of community. Continues Mesa Baines, \\"As with her artwork of her close friend and artistic madrina (godmother) Tejana singer Lydia Mendoza, she subverts, re- contextualizes, and transforms culturally traditional images into a series of feminist icons, elevating their status to that of role models.\\" In an interview with the Mujeres Muralists, Chicana feminists art collective, her female colleagues commented about her noteworthy works: “She is best known for her depiction of Latina and Native women through her paste prints and installations.”  Selected Artwork =Sun Mad One of Hernández's most renowned works of art is Sun Mad, a screen print that \\"speaks of the impact of the overuse of pesticides and the effect they have on the farm workers, consumers and the environment.\\" In speaking about the work, she said, \\"I focused on something personal, the Sun Maid box.\\" \\"Slowly I began to realize how to transform the Sun Maid and unmask the truth behind the wholesome figures of agribusiness. Sun Mad evolved out of my anger and my fear of what would happen to my family, my community, and to myself.\\" San Francisco Chronicle art critic, Kenneth Baker, says of this print that \\"Ester Hernandez's bitterly comic revisionist screen print, Sun Mad, successfully dovetails artistic intervention, political animus, and pop culture raw material.\\" With her screen print Sun Mad, Hernández brought awareness to the injustices faced within her community. She created Sun Mad in 1982 after learning that her hometown in Dinuba, California had “polluted water and [laborers who] worked in an environment contaminated by pesticides.” Depicted in Sun Mad are a bright red background, a “yellow disk of sun,” and a red bonneted skeletal figure holding a basket of grapes. To add, the skeletal woman is smiling and wearing a white shirt with two black stripes on the sleeves. Below the skeleton are the words, “Sun mad raisins, unnaturally grown with insecticides - miticides - herbicides - fungicides.” Here the words “sun mad” are printed in a bold, yellow font, while the rest of the font is in a smaller and finer white. Additionally, Hernández's palette consists of cool and warm colors; for instance, the green grapes and leaves, as well as the brown basket and skeleton’s hair, illustrate cool colors. On the other hand, the red background and bonnet plus the yellow disk and “Sun mad” logo illustrate warm colors. The artwork’s surface is flat but contains bright, expressive colors alongside a recognizable symbol; here Hernández offers deep messages within the screen print. Sun Mad’s warm palette expresses feelings of anger; also, Hernández's appropriation of the popular Sun Maid emblem emphasizes the damage being done to her community. Specifically, the scarlet red background and yellow/white print catch the viewer’s attention. Because red and yellow are primary colors, placing a pronounced, yellow logo in front of a red background makes it stand out. Thus, this brings attention to Hernández's use of wordplay where she printed “Sun mad” instead of the well- known Sun Maid label. Similarly, the white words below the yellow “Sun mad” logo stand out against the red background because of their neutral color. Hence, the news of the use of pesticides on staple foods is subtle yet explicit because viewers learn that they are being harmed. Likewise, by placing the white skeletal woman in the center and in front of the contrasting red background makes her the focal point of the screen print. Moreover, the replacement of the Sun Maid with a skeletal figure surprises viewers in the way that “this figure is turned against itself to comment on the corporate use of the female body to sell commodities.” In various societies, women are seen as innocent, maternal, and trustworthy, so appropriating the youthful, beautiful Sun-Maid and replacing her with a skeleton signifies how the Sun- Maid company has deceived members of Hernández's community. Furthermore, Hernández's skeleton exemplifies the deadly use of pesticides and its harmful effects on consumers. Overall, the skeleton is an important symbol in Mexican culture that represents a celebration of departed loved ones; yet, Hernández twists this positive Mexican image into an eerie symbol of poison. Being such a recognizable symbol, the skeletal woman bearing poisonous grapes represents the looming faith of the farm workers who worked in a polluted environment and of the people of Dinuba who drank contaminated water and ate contaminated food. Specifically, in the screen print, the dark shading of the grapes may illustrate the “lethal consequences of pesticides.” If Hernández were to draw naturally grown grapes, there may be less harsh shading and instead lighter shading to enhance a wholesome and nourishing appearance. Although many people associate Sun-Maid raisins with “the innocent pleasure of childhood,” this subversive alteration of the vibrant Sun-Maid depicts the “death-dealing lie” fed to the innocent people of Dinuba. In conclusion, Ester Hernández protested the use of pesticides through her screen print, Sun Mad, believing it would reach hundreds of people in her community and spark a discussion about the tainted environment, food, and water they encountered. Sun Raid, with The Serie Project  In 2008, Hernández was an artist in residence at The Serie Project, a workshop founded by Sam Coronado, where underrepresented artists could produce special editions of serigraphs. There, she printed Sun Raid, an edited version of Sun Mad, in which she depicted the skeletal farm worker, wearing a global GPS \\"security-monitoring bracelet labeled ICE, for the Immigrations and Customs Agents, signifying looming deportation.\\" Just as in Sun Mad, Hernández changes the words on the appropriation of the original Sun Maid imagery to address immigration concerns, saying the following phrases: \\"Un-naturally harvested,\\" \\"Guaranteed Deportation: Mixtecos, Zapotecos, Triques, Purepechas\\" (in reference to indigenous Mexican farmers working in the U.S. from the Oaxaca region), and \\"By-Product of NAFTA\\" at the bottom. On the right side of the box, it says, \\"Hecho in Mexico\\" (Made in Mexico) and on the right it says, \\"Mad in USA\\" (instead of what one might expect it to say: \\"Made in the USA\\"). This again references Hernández's original and iconic Sun Mad print while also referencing both the outrage and concern caused by ICE raids in 2008. La Virgen De Las Calles Hernández has played a key role in the Chicano Civil Rights Movement. She uses her art as a medium to express her overflowing gratitude and admiration for Latina women, who are so often mistreated in society (both in the past and present). In 2001, Hernández created La Virgen de las Calles (Virgin of the Streets), a pastel print, to represent the hard working Latina women in a glorified and divine perspective. In this work of art, Hernández portrays an older Latina women selling roses on the street against a black background. She is wearing regular blue jeans and a bright red oversized sweater with a logo saying \\"USA\\" written across her chest in bold black letters. Near her plain black shoes, there lies a white construction bucket with a logo featuring a Mexican elote and the word \\"future\\" pasted across the front side. The bucket holds red and white roses that she is presumably selling on the streets. Most notable is the green shawl, with red stripes and white stars, that she wears around her head and shoulder. The shawl, the roses, and the bright red and green colors all represent and allude to Mexico’s depiction of the Virgen de Guadalupe (The Virgin Mary). In \\"Art and La Virgen de Guadalupe,\\" Surage reveals that the reimagining of La Virgen de Guadalupe “is actually part of an ongoing Chicana artistic tradition”. (See works by other artists such as Yolanda Lopez's \\"Virgen de Guadalupe\\" series, for instance.) Hernández does this to show the importance and significance of women of color. On her personal website, Ester Hernández describes the purpose of the piece: “ [to pay] tribute to the dignity, strength and perseverance of immigrant women as they strive for a better life for themselves and their families.” Furthermore, many Chicana artists are known for using this image because it represents the Mexican community. Most of Hernández's art is controversial but she creates with the purpose of progressing the rights of the underrepresented. Hernández often draws inspiration from her personal heroines, who include Frida Kahlo, Dolores Huerta, and Lydia Mendoza. She finds strength and inspiration not only in her heroines, but also in Latina women with whom she has worked. She uses her art as an attempt to communicate a very crucial message to the audience: the infinite loyalty Latina women have for their family and the sheer volume of sacrifices they make for them. La Virgen de las Calles was special to Hernández because it was important for her to depict the love a Chicana mother has for her family, and how many Chicana mothers just like the one in this piece “‘…[often] work day and night to educate their children because they know this is the greatest gift a parent can give a child.’\\" Hernández strives for her artwork to communicate a sense of belonging, so that her audience can gaze upon her piece and think, “these images represent my family, my mother, my uncles, cousins, grandparents, and community.\\" Hernández uses immigrants, women of color, and other underrepresented minorities to depict the working class and their struggles in a positive and divine light in order to appreciate their sacrifices and their hardships. Artists like Hernández possess an imperative piece of knowledge that sometimes, in order for change to happen, it is necessary to be an “effective agitator”. Hernández’s artwork embodies her deep understanding behind the value of “…finding a place where you, me, and everybody can feel that they are safe and accepted.\\" Libertad (Liberty) The National Museum of Mexican Art is home to Hernández's 1987 etching Libertad (Liberty). The 12\\" by 6\\" artwork portrays a multitude of ways that Hernández is proud to be both a feminist and Chicana. The viewer gets the opportunity to witness a postmodern modification of The United States' beloved gift from France, The Statue of Liberty. As the inside of the monument is exposed, intricate Aztec carvings take center stage. At the monument's foundation, the inscription \\"Aztlán\\" translates to \\"White Land\\" or Aztec homeland, suggesting that America's roots are necessarily tied to Mexico and Mexican indigenous origins. A nod to feminism is included via the female sculptor carving the monument, granting her the agency to correct history. As Guisela M. Latorre writes, \\"[i]mages such as Ester Hernández’s 1976 etching Libertad depicting a young Chicana resculpting the Statue of Liberty to resemble a Maya carving, and Yolanda López’s pastel drawings (1978) that depicted herself, her mother, and her grandmother in the role of the Virgin of Guadalupe were examples of early Chicana art that placed women at the center of discourses on liberation and decolonization.\\" The subtle detail of the New York skyline symbolizes the modern world, and its lesser importance in comparison to the origins of the United States.  Activism  Hernández has said that art is how she contextualizes the world around her and her subject matter: :In many ways my artwork has always been a futile attempt to capture time, to create beauty, and most importantly, to make sense of the complex, ever changing, globalized world we live in. So many things separate us. I hope I will see a time when we will all unite, regardless of race, size, age, economic status, ability, gender or any other ism that exists to separate us. I aspire to create artwork that helps to bridge that dialogue. Hernández uses screen printing for the purposes of disseminating affordable work using socio- political imagery. For instance, her screen print \\"Sun Mad\\" illustrates the deadly impact of pesticides on farm workers, consumers and the environment. The poster was included in Latin American Posters: Public Aesthetics and Mass Politics, a retrospective \\"trac[ing] four decades of Latin American social and political history during a time of widespread crisis and unrest.\\" Another print, Jesus Barazza, addressed the anti-immigration act SB1070 by creating an image of La Virgen de Guadalupe as a wanted terrorist. In 1974, she joined Las Mujeres Muralistas, an influential group of female mural artists based in the San Francisco Mission District. Ideas from her work also engaged with the Chicana/Chicano civil rights movement. With her long effort over the years, her art and activism has led her to become a main leader in the civil rights movement towards the advancement of Chicana/o rights.  Exhibitions  Hernández's work has been exhibited both nationally and internationally since 1973. Her work is included in the permanent collections of the National Museum of American Art, the Smithsonian Institution, the Library of Congress, the Museum of Modern Art and the Mexican Museum in San Francisco, the Mexican Fine Arts Center Museum in Chicago, and the Frida Kahlo Studio Museum in Mexico City. In 1988 her first major solo exhibition, titled The Defiant Eye, was held at Galería de la Raza in San Francisco. Since that time her work has appeared in such exhibitions as Day of the Dead (Mexican Fine Arts Center Museum, Chicago, 1989), Meeting of the Madonnas (Ethnographic Museum, Warsaw, Poland, 1991), Mostra América (Museu da Gravura, Curitiba, Brazil, 1992), The Art of Provocation: Ester Hernández, A Retrospect (University of California, Davis, 1995), Transformations: The Art of Ester Hernández (MACLA Center for Latino Arts, San Jose, CA, 1998) and Ester Hernández: Everyday Passions (Galería de la Raza, 2001), as well as touring exhibitions including Chicano Art: Resistance and Affirmation (CARA) (1990–93), Ceremony of Spirit (1994–96), Chicano Expressions (1994–96), The Role of Paper (1998-2001), Chicano (2002–03), and One Heart, One World (2002). She has received awards and commissions from organizations ranging from the California Arts Council to the National Endowment for the Arts. Artwork by Hernández was recently featured in the inaugural opening of the Museo Alameda—Smithsonian in San Antonio, Texas. Additionally, her work is in permanent collections of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Stanford University has recently acquired her artistic and personal archives as well. Hernández's work has been a part of the exhibition, \\"Estampas de la Raza: Contemporary Prints from the Romo Collection,\\" which provides a comprehensive look at Chicano printmaking from 1984-2011. Beginning at the McNay Museum in San Antonio, TX, the show will travel to multiple institutions throughout New Mexico, North Carolina, and California.

Main characteristics  The most important symbol in these films are the quite expensive Art Deco sets featuring white telephones (status symbol of bourgeois wealth generally unavailable to the movie-going public), and children wearing Shirley Temple curls. The films tended to be socially conservative, promoting family values, respect for authority, a rigid class hierarchy and country life, all stances perfectly in line with the ideology of the fascist regime. The genre is also referred by modern film critics as \\"Hungarian style comedies\\", because the scripts were often adaptations of stage plays written by Hungarian authors (a popular source material also for Hollywood productions of the time).  Censorship  To avoid the limitations imposed by the censureship of the authorities, with potentially controversial topics in the plot (for instance divorce, at the time illegal in Italy, or adultery, a punishable offence by the contemporary Italian laws), the action was often set in various foreign – sometimes imaginary – Eastern European countries, but always with Italian protagonists.  Effect on neorealism  The Neorealist filmmakers saw their gritty films as a reaction to the idealized Telefoni Bianchi style. They compared and contrasted the high-and-almighty gimmicks of set and studio production, with the dishevelled beauty of everyday life, the rigorous depiction of human life and its sufferings, and chose instead to work on location and with non-professional actors.

UCl3 is used mostly to reprocess spent nuclear fuel. Uranium(III) chloride is synthesized in various ways from uranium(IV) chloride; however, UCl3 is less stable than UCl4. Preparation There are two ways to synthesize uranium(III) chloride. The following processes describe how to produce uranium(III) chloride. (1) In a mixture of NaCl-KCl at 670–710 °C, add uranium tetrachloride with uranium metal. :3UCl4 \\\\+ U → 4UCl3Serrano, K.; Taxil, P.; Dugne, O.; Bouvet, S.; Puech, E. J. Nucl.

Properties In solid uranium(III) chloride each uranium atom has nine chlorine atoms as near neighbours, at approximately the same distance, in a tricapped trigonal prismatic configuration.Wells A.F. (1984) Structural Inorganic Chemistry 5th edition Oxford Science Publications Uranium(III) chloride is a green crystalline solid at room temperature. UCl3 melts at 837 °C and boils at 1657 °C. Uranium(III) chloride has a density of 5500 kg/m3 or 5.500 g/cm3. Its composition by weight: :Chlorine: 30.84% :Uranium: 69.16% Its formal oxidative states: :Chlorine: −1 :Uranium: +3 Uranium(III) chloride is very soluble in water and is also very hygroscopic. UCl3 is more stable in a solution of hydrochloric acid.Comey, Arthur M.; Hahn, Dorothy A. A Dictionary of Chemical Solubilities: Inorganic. New York: The MacMillan Company, 1921. Uses=Reagent Uranium(III) chloride is used in reactions with tetrahydrofuran (THF) and sodium methylcyclopentadiene to prepare various uranium metallocene complexes.Brenna, J.G.; Anderson, R.A.; Zalkin, A. Inorg. Chem. 1986, 25, 1756–1760. Catalyst Uranium(III) chloride is used as a catalyst during reactions between lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH4) and olefins to produce alkyl aluminate compounds.Le Marechal, J.F.; Ephritikhine, M.; Folcher, G. J. Organomet. Chem. 1986, 309, C1–C3. Molten form The molten form of uranium(III) chloride is a typical compound in pyrochemical processes as it is important in the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuels.Okamoto, Y.; Madden, P.; Minato, K. J. Nucl. Mater. 2005, 344, 109–114. UCl3 is usually the form that uranium takes as spent fuel in electrorefining processes.Okamoto, Y.; Kobayashi, F.; Ogawa, T. J. Alloys Compd. 1998, 271, 355–358. Hydrates There are three hydrates of uranium(III) chloride: #UCl3.2H2O.2CH3CN #UCl3.6H2O #UCl3.7H2O Each are synthesized by the reduction of uranium(IV) chloride in methylcyanide (acetonitrile), with specific amounts of water and propionic acid.Mech, A.; Karbowick, M.; Lis, T. Polyhedron. 2006, 25, 2083–2092. Precautions While there are no long-term data on the toxic effects thas UCl3, it is important to minimize exposure to this compound when possible. Similar to other uranium compounds that are soluble, UCl3 is likely absorbed into the blood through the alveolar pockets of the lungs within days of exposure. Exposure to uranium(III) chloride leads to toxicity of the renal system.Bertell, Rosalie. \\"Gulf War Veterans and Depleted Uranium.\\" May 1999.

Aside from reviewing new cars (which were graded by awarding \\"steering wheels\\"), Trafikmagasinet featured news, educational content, and consumer reports. The show was created by Carl Ingemar Perstad who also hosted the show until 2002. Christer Glenning co-hosted the show and was responsible for car testing until his death in 1998. History Trafikmagasinet launched on March 15, 1978. The show was an immediate success and its ratings were higher than many popular entertainment shows. Internationally, the show was a pioneer. The type of road tests first introduced in Trafikmagasinet became very popular and used by motor journalists in several countries. Beside the TV-audience, journalists and car industry looked upon Trafikmagasinet with high confidence. In 1987 Carl-Ingemar Perstad received an award from the Swedish Royal Automobile Club for his contribution to enhance and improve the level of Swedish road and traffic safety. An important event in the show's history was when a Škoda failed miserably in a road test, flipping over while turning in 30 km/h. History repeated itself in 1997, when Trafikmagasinet together with the car magazine Teknikens Värld overturned the new Mercedes-Benz A-Class during testing. Mercedes-Benz initially claimed that the car had been manipulated and threatened to sue the journalists, but finally had to admit that the car was unsafe during sharp turns at high speed. The A-Class was re- released with Electronic Stability Control, and the episode gave some fame to the expression moose test - this due to Mercedes-Benz' initial attempt to ridicule the failed test and claim that it was only of interest to Swedes. During the 1990s and onward new co-hosts joined Trafikmagasinet. Sofia Lindahl was followed by Bodil Karlsson and later Veronica Marklund. When Christer Glenning died in 1998, Staffan Borglund replaced him as car tester. During its last year, Trafikmagasinet left the studio-based concept. The show was one of many that were axed when SVT were forced to make major budget-cuts in 2003.\\"Trafikmagasinet\\" läggs ned efter 25 år ReferencesExternal links * SVT official site Category:Sveriges Television original programming Category:Automotive television series ","title":"Trafikmagasinet"},{"id":"4421106","text":"William Lutley Sclater (23 September 1863 – 4 July 1944) was a British zoologist and museum director. He was the son of Philip Lutley Sclater and was named after his paternal grandfather, also William Lutley Sclater. William's mother, Jane Anne Eliza, was the daughter of Sir David Hunter-Blair and a sister-in-law of Sir Walter Elliot the Indian naturalist. Sclater received his Master of Arts degree in Natural Science from Keble College at Oxford in 1885. He worked for two years as a Demonstrator at Cambridge under Professor Adam Sedgwick and went on a collecting trip to British Guiana in 1886. He published about birds in the Ibis in 1887. In the same year, he received an appointment as a deputy superintendent of the Indian Museum in Calcutta from 1887 until 1891, when he joined the science faculty of Eton College. It was at Eton that he met his future wife, Charlotte Mellen Stephenson, an American divorcée whose two sons attended the school. The couple were married at St. George's Cathedral in London on 1 February 1896 at St. George, shortly after which they moved to Cape Town, South Africa. Here, Sclater took up the position of curator at the South African Museum, whose collections he reorganized and moved into a new facility. During his time in South Africa, he continued his scientific writings, including completion of the work Flora and Fauna of South Africa. He also completed the four-volume series The Birds of South Africa, begun by Dr Arthur Stark; the five-volume Birds of Africa, begun by Captain George Shelley; and The Birds of Kenya Colony and the Uganda Protectorate, begun by Sir Frederick John Jackson. In 1906, following a dispute with the Museum's board of trustees, Sclater resigned as curator. He travelled with his wife through Mombasa, Lake Victoria, Khartoum, and Cairo before returning to England. He then moved to Colorado Springs, Colorado, which had been founded by Charlotte's brother-in-law, General William Jackson Palmer. Palmer offered Sclater a small estate outside the city and a professorship at Colorado College. Here, he helped in reorganizing the museum. When the general died in 1909, the couple returned to England. From 1909 Sclater became curator of the Bird Room at the Natural History Museum. While working there he compiled the Systema Avium Aethiopicarum (1924 - 1930), a scholarly work that assisted further research. He worked there until his death in 1944. In 1912, Sclater published A History of the Birds of Colorado in two volumes. During the Great War, he volunteered for the Soldiers' and Sailors' Families Association. Both his stepsons were killed in action during the war: *Captain Eric Seymour Stephenson died on 6 May 1915, aged 36, while serving with the 1st Battalion Gloucestershire Regiment (attached as Landing Staff Officer to Sir Ian Hamilton's Staff). He was wounded on 26 April while directing landing operations from the SS River Clyde during the Gallipoli Campaign and died of wounds on board the hospital ship Sicilia. He was awarded a DSO and was mentioned in despatches. He served in the Second Boer War and was attached for many years to the Egyptian Army.

In 1919 and 1920, he and his wife travelled around the globe. In 1930, he was awarded the Godman-Salvin Gold Medal. In 1942, Charlotte died of injuries sustained during the bombing of London. Two years later, William Sclater died at St. George's Hospital, two days after a V-1 flying bomb fell over his home at 10 Sloane Court in Chelsea on Sunday, 2 July 1944.

It was previously designated as a Humanities College. The student body is divided into four different houses - Annay, Clairvaux, Cîteaux and La Plaine. The houses are named after various monastic houses, relating to the school's history. The school's motto is \\"Dieu Mon Abri\\", which means \\"God is my Shelter\\". The crest is a diamond, with three parallel, diagonal, swords on a blue background. The school has been given an \\"outstanding\\" by Ofsted and constantly tops school leaderboards, its recent 2018 and 2019 GCSE results putting the school academically in the top 1% of the country. History=Aldin House The school is built around and includes Aldin House, which dates from about 1860. Nikolaus Pevsner believed the house was built by and for Charles Aldin.St Bernard's Catholic Grammar School website, st-bernards.slough.sch.uk; accessed 22 October 2014. It was widely believed that the house was built for Angela Burdett-Coutts but that she never lived there as Queen Victoria did not approve of her marriage to the much younger William Lehman Ashmead Bartlett. The marriage did not take place until 1881, however, when the house had already entered use as a school so Pevsner's version seems more plausible. In 1869, John Hawtrey opened St Michael's School in Aldin House. The school remained there for 14 years, with pupils including the future Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin. The original chapel was built in 1875, and dedicated as an Anglican chapel by Bishop Samuel Wilberforce of Oxford. After St. Michael's left, the site was used for a year by the Welsh Charity School of Ashford, Middlesex while their usual buildings were modified, and subsequently St George's School, Southwark used the building for the same purpose. The Jesuit Fathers bought the house and used it as a college for eight years. St Bernard's Aldin House was bought (and renamed St Bernard's) by the Bernardine nuns in 1897. Since then, various additions have been made to the building. Beginning with a school for 12 French students, the educational work of the Bernardines has evolved enormously. In 1904, day girls were first admitted to the school, leading to the development of a girls' grammar school. The school became co-educational in 1989. and now forms a large mixed Voluntary Aided Grammar School for some 900 students, aged 11–18. In 1906, a nearby house was bought and opened as St Joseph's day school \\"for children of all denominations\\". In 1945, St Joseph's formally merged with St Bernards, becoming the preparatory school. In the 1970s and 1980s, the prep school moved to a new siteHistory of St Bernard's Preparatory School where it continues today as an independent fee paying school for about 200 pupils, although it shares a badge with the state supported grammar school. Until August 2006, the school was also the home to nuns of the Bernardine order, who gave up their home for the school, and a few gave up their time to teach. At the time of the foundation, the convent was right in the countryside, with nothing but fields separating it from Windsor Castle. The convent, set in extensive grounds with fields, a vegetable garden, orchard and cemetery, provided an oasis of peace and prayer for those who visit. A large house - Stella Maris - in the monastery grounds served as a small pastoral centre. The Bernardines have always wished to co-operate with the pastoral life of the Church, and this was one such way of collaborating with the Church in the Diocese of Northampton. The nuns left the school in mid-2006. The school received a brand new Cafe in the Summer of 2019. Merger plans In October 2008 the schools confirmed that the Diocese of Northampton had approached the Department for Children, Schools and Families with a proposal to merge St. Bernard's Catholic Grammar School with St. Joseph's Catholic High School to form an all-ability Catholic Academy on the St Bernard's site. The proposal is supported by Slough Borough Council and the governing bodies of the two schools. The plan would result in the first closure of a grammar school since 1997. In March 2009 the DCSF responded with a Statement of Intent letter, inviting the Council to develop concrete plans (an Expression of Interest document), with a planned opening date of September 2011. A group of concerned parents calling themselves \\"Faith and Choice Together (FaCT)\\" have created a web site (Save St Bernard's) to highlight the opposition to the plan, and put forward three candidates who were elected as parent governors.Save St Bernard's website, savestbernards.co.uk; accessed 22 October 2014. They collected more than 1000 signatures on a petition. The parent campaign is supported by the National Grammar Schools Association. In 2010 it was announced that the plans to merge the two schools had been abandoned. This was partially down to the large number of people, be it staff, students or parents who were opposed to the plans.  Claire Gill  On 28 June 2006 Claire Gill, a student at St Bernards hanged herself in a school cubicle after writing a suicide note. Police said bullying was not involved and did not treat the death as suspicious. The school has since blocked off the bathroom where her suicide took place and the school says that they make sure to take care of student's mental wellbeing.  Traditions =GA The most known tradition of the school is Guardian Angels. On this day, the males exchange ties with the females and a majority of the day are special events. Some of these events include: football matches between staff and students, netball match between staff and students and the most notable: the assembly ran by the Sixth Form. The day is entirely planned by students -to give thanks for all their hard work- and staff are provided free food and other services. Forms There are about 800 pupils, with four forms in each year group; A, B, R, S and W (W was added in 2019). The letters correspond to the founder of the house (e.g. Citeaux, founded by Robert XXX, becomes R, and you get 7R, 8R, 9R etc.) Years 12 and 13 are organised into roughly six forms apiece, though this can vary from year to year. Each form is named after the various monastic houses of the founding Bernadine Sisters. For example, 12Br and 13Br are dedicated to the Brownshill Monastery in Stroud, Gloucestershire; 12Mi and 13Mi are dedicated to the Mikkabi Monastery in Inasa District, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan.

But his official work restricted his appearances and he soon returned to India. At the age of 45 he captained the Muslims in the Lahore tournament of 1924. On what was his first appearance in a first-class match on Indian soil, he went in last against Sikhs and scored 100 not out in 40 minutes, adding 150 in an unbroken tenth- wicket partnership with Abdus Salaam. Excluding centuries made under contrived circumstances, it is the second-fastest hundred (in terms of minutes) ever made in first-class cricket. Haq was later involved in the creation of the Indian cricket board.

Gilbert Oswald Smith (25 November 1872 – 6 December 1943Profile at Spartacus Educational ), familiarly known as G. O. Smith or simply as G. O. or Jo, was an English amateur footballer often referred to as \\"the first great centre forward\\". In addition, Smith played first-class cricket for Oxford University and Surrey.Cricket archive-GO Smith Retrieved 24 October 2012 Smith was educated, from 1886 to 1892, at Charterhouse School, one of the principal nurseries of the Association Football game, and learned many of the skills that subsequently brought him fame while boarding at the school. He went on to study at Keble College, Oxford, and was by profession a school teacher. He was unmarried. Club career Born in Croydon but the son of a Scottish merchant who settled in India,G.O. Smith, Scots Football Worldwide Smith played football for Oxford University, representing the team from his first year, winning three out of four Varsity matches played against Cambridge, and captaining Oxford in his final year. On going down from university, he joined the Corinthians, then the best-known amateur football club in Britain and one not only renowned for its promotion of the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play, but also fully capable of meeting the best professional teams of the day on equal terms. Smith's scoring record for the club – 132 goals in 137 matches – remains one of the best strike rates in the history of the game, equating to one goal for every 93 minutes played. His record for the Casuals was even more impressive, with 42 goals in 29 appearances. In the course of his club career, Smith captained Corinthians in the first Sheriff of London Charity Shield fixture, a competition created to match the best professional and amateur teams in Britain. The match, played in 1898 against Sheffield United, proved controversial and with the score standing at 1–1 after 90 minutes, the professional side declined to play extra time because they had disagreed with several of the referee's decisions. Smith also scored the winning goal in Corinthians' memorable 2–1 Charity Shield win against the professionals of Aston Villa played at Crystal Palace in November 1900. International career Smith captained the England team on at least 13, and possibly as many as 16, occasions (early records are inexact) between 1896 and 1901, winning at least eight games, possibly as many as ten, and drawing two. His most productive game in an England shirt came in February 1899, when he netted three times in only five minutes and four times in all during the 13–2 demolition of Ireland. \\"Fine fellows they were,\\" the great Welsh player Billy Meredith wrote of the Smith-led, all-amateur England forward line of 1895, :\\"some six feet three in their socks and carrying plenty of weight with their inches. And they were not afraid to use their weight either, as some of us discovered. All in true sporting fashion, of course, for they were just as ready to take as to give hard knocks. Every man of them could run like a deer and before the game was over most of us were crying bellows to mend. Most of them were Corinthian stars and they played the Corinthian game. 'Twas a grand sight to see their forward line sweeping down the field, though probably our backs didn't think so.\\" He made a total of 20 appearances for England (scoring 11 goals), between 1893 and 1901. Some authorities, including the author of the article on Smith published in the Dictionary of National Biography, credit him with 21 caps, one of which was won in the unofficial 12–0 victory over Germany in 1901. Playing style G.O. Smith was renowned throughout his playing career for his exceptional balance and timing, and was further noted for his close control of the ball. Unlike the majority of centre-forwards of the day, Smith also excelled at passing. \\"He was,\\" his obituary in The Times contended, \\"a maker rather than a scorer of goals.\\"G.O. Smith\\". Obituary in The Times, 7 December 1943 Steve Bloomer, Smith's professional colleague in several international matches, remarked that it was for this reason that he would rather play alongside Smith than any other centre-forward.Peter Seddon (1999). Steve Bloomer: The Story of Football's First Superstar. Derby: Breedon Books. The Dictionary of National Biography contends that he \\"transformed the role of the centre-forward from that of an individual striker into a unifier of the forward line, indeed the whole team.\\" Physically, Smith seemed unprepossessing. Though standing nearly 5 feet 11 inches, a good height for the day, he was of slight build, suffered from asthma and lacked the obvious brawn that had characterised predecessors in the England team such as W.N. \\"Nuts\\" Cobbold in a period in which body-checking and other rough tactics were considered fair play. He was also noted for his reluctance to head the ball, stating that he would be happy to see the practice banned. \\"G.O.\\" atoned for these deficiencies by positioning himself intelligently and by shooting accurately, and – so his obituary observed – \\"invariably low\\", though opponents testified that he was also \\"hard as a whipcord\\" and by no means easy to shake off the ball. Reputation By the time of his retirement, Smith was perhaps the most admired figure in the English game, familiarly known to several generations of schoolboys simply by his initials at a time when only one other sportsman – the cricketer W.G. Grace – was so recognised. Despite the emergence of later, equally capable centre forwards in a more recognisably modern mould – most notably Vivian Woodward, Smith's successor in the England team – his abilities were recalled and praised well into the 1940s. The International Federation of Football History & Statistics, a scholarly group based in Wiesbaden, describes him as \\"the most brilliant, indeed perfect, footballer in the world around the turn of the century\\". \\"G.O.\\" was, according to contemporaries, unusually popular among professional footballers who were generally wary of the leading amateurs. Sir Frederick Wall, the long-serving Secretary of the Football Association wrote that he was \\"a man without petty pride\\". Wall recalled that Steve Bloomer \\"had an intense admiration\\" for his England striking partner, and Bloomer himself remarked that, unlike the majority of amateurs of the day, Smith was invariably courteous to his professional teammates and social inferiors: \\"He was the finest type of amateur, one who would always shake hands with us professionals in a manner which said plainly he was pleased to meet them.\\" Cricket career In his youth, G.O. Smith was also a noted cricketer, representing Oxford University and scoring a match-winning 132 runs in the fourth innings of the 1896 Varsity Match to win the game against Cambridge. He batted right-handed. showing excellent timing with his drives and cutting beautifully, bowled reasonably well, and fielded at cover point. In the field he moved – his obituary in Wisden noted – \\"gracefully with quickness in all he did.\\"Smith's Wisden obituary Retrieved 24 October 2012 See also * List of English cricket and football players ReferencesBibliography * William Gibson and Alfred Pickford (1906).

The term chronic is often applied when the course of the disease lasts for more than three months. Common chronic diseases include arthritis, asthma, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, Lyme disease, and some viral diseases such as hepatitis C and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. An illness which is lifelong because it ends in death is a terminal illness. It is possible and not unexpected for an illness to change in definition from terminal to chronic. Diabetes and HIV for example were once terminal yet are now considered chronic due to the availability of insulin and daily drug treatment for individuals with HIV which allow these individuals to live while managing symptoms. In medicine, a chronic condition can be distinguished from one that is acute. An acute condition typically affects one portion of the body and responds to treatment. A chronic condition on the other hand usually affects multiple areas of the body, is not fully responsive to treatment, and persists for an extended period of time. Chronic conditions may have periods of remission or relapse where the disease temporarily goes away, or subsequently reappears. Periods of remission and relapse are commonly discussed when referring to substance abuse disorders which some consider to fall under the category of chronic condition. Chronic conditions are often associated with non-communicable diseases which are distinguished by their non-infectious causes. Some chronic conditions though, are caused by transmissible infections such as HIV/AIDS. 63% of all death's world wide are from chronic conditions. Chronic diseases constitute a major cause of mortality, and the World Health Organization (WHO) attributes 38 million deaths a year to non-communicable diseases. In the United States approximately 40% of adults have at least two chronic conditions. Types Chronic conditions have often been used to describe the various health related states of the human body such as syndromes, physical impairments, disabilities as well as diseases. Epidemiologists have found interest in chronic conditions due to the fact they contribute to disease, disability, and diminished physical and/or mental capacity. For example, high blood pressure or hypertension is considered to be not only a chronic condition itself but also correlated to diseases such as heart attack or stroke. Additionally, some socioeconomic factors may be considered as a chronic condition as they lead to disability in daily life. An important one that public health officials in the social science setting have begun highlighting is chronic poverty. Researchers, particularly those studying the United States, utilize the Chronic Condition Indicator (CCI) which maps ICD codes as \\"chronic\\" or non- chronic\\". The list below includes these chronic conditions and diseases: In 2015 the World Health Organization produced a report on non-communicable diseases, citing the four major types as: * Cancers * Cardiovascular diseases, including cerebrovascular disease, heart failure, and ischemic cardiopathy * Chronic respiratory diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) * Diabetes mellitus (type 1, type 2, pre-diabetes, gestational diabetes) Other examples of chronic diseases and health conditions include: * Alzheimer's disease * Atrial fibrillation * Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder * Autoimmune diseases, such as ulcerative colitis, lupus erythematosus, Crohn's disease, coeliac disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and relapsing polychondritis * Autism or Asperger's Syndrome * Blindness * Cerebral palsy (all types) * Chronic graft-versus-host disease * Chronic hepatitis * Chronic kidney disease * Chronic osteoarticular diseases, such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis * Chronic pain syndromes, such as post-vasectomy pain syndrome and complex regional pain syndrome * Dermatological conditions such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis * Deafness and hearing impairment * Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (various types) * Endometriosis * Epilepsy * Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder * Fibromyalgia * HIV/AIDS * Huntington's disease * Hypertension * Lyme Disease(Eisner, Hasley, Olsen, & Baumgarth, 2015; Embers et al., 2017; Hodzic, Feng, & Barthold, 2014; Straubinger, 2000)(Häupl et al., 1993; Hudson et al., 1998; Marques et al., 2014; Oksi, Marjamaki, Nikoskelainen, & Viljanen, 1999; Pfister, Preac-Mursic, Wilske, Einhäupl, & Weinberger, 1989; Preac-Mursic et al., 1989; Preac-Mursic et al., 1993) *Mental illness * Migraines * Multiple sclerosis * Myalgic encephalomyelitis ( chronic fatigue syndrome) * Narcolepsy * Obesity * Osteoporosis * Parkinson's disease * Periodontal disease * Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome * Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome * Sickle cell anemia and other hemoglobin disorders *Substance Abuse Disorders * Sleep apnea * Tick- borne illness (Eisner, Hasley, Olsen, & Baumgarth, 2015; Embers et al., 2017; Hodzic, Feng, & Barthold, 2014; Straubinger, 2000).(Häupl et al., 1993; Hudson et al., 1998; Marques et al., 2014; Oksi, Marjamaki, Nikoskelainen, & Viljanen, 1999; Pfister, Preac-Mursic, Wilske, Einhäupl, & Weinberger, 1989; Preac-Mursic et al., 1989; Preac-Mursic et al., 1993) * Thyroid disease Risk factors While risk factors vary with age and gender, most of the common chronic diseases in the US are caused by dietary, lifestyle and metabolic risk factors that are also responsible for the resulting mortality. Therefore, these conditions might be prevented by behavioral changes, such as quitting smoking, adopting a healthy diet, and increasing physical activity. Social determinants are important risk factors for chronic diseases. Social factors, e.g., socioeconomic status, education level, and race/ethnicity, are a major cause for the disparities observed in the care of chronic disease. Lack of access and delay in receiving care result in worse outcomes for patients from minorities and underserved populations. Those barriers to medical care complicate patients monitoring and continuity in treatment. In the US, Minorities and low-income populations are less likely to access and receive preventive services necessary to detect conditions at an early stage. The majority of US health care and economic costs associated with medical conditions are for the costs of chronic diseases and conditions and associated health risk behaviors. Eighty-four percent of all health care spending in 2006 was for the 50% of the population who have one or more chronic medical conditions (CDC, 2014). There are several psychosocial risk and resistance factors among children with chronic illness and their family members. Adults with chronic illness were significantly more likely to report life dissatisfaction than those without chronic illness. Compared to their healthy peers, children with chronic illness have about a twofold increase in psychiatric disorders. Higher parental depression and other family stressors predicted more problems among patients. In addition, sibling problems along with the burden of illness on the family as a whole led to more psychological strain on the patients and their families. Prevention A growing body of evidence supports that prevention is effective in reducing the effect of chronic conditions; in particular, early detection results in less severe outcomes. Clinical preventive services include screening for the existence of the disease or predisposition to its development, counseling and immunizations against infectious agents. Despite their effectiveness, the utilization of preventive services is typically lower than for regular medical services. In contrast to their apparent cost in time and money, the benefits of preventive services are not directly perceived by patient because their effects are on the long term or might be greater for society as a whole than at the individual level.Kenkel DS \\"Prevention\\" \\"Handbook Of Health Economics\\" Therefore, public health programs are important in educating the public, and promoting healthy lifestyles and awareness about chronic diseases. While those programs can benefit from funding at different levels (state, federal, private) their implementation is mostly in charge of local agencies and community-based organizations. Studies have shown that public health programs are effective in reducing mortality rates associated to cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer, but the results are somewhat heterogeneous depending on the type of condition and the type of programs involved. For example, results from different approaches in cancer prevention and screening depended highly on the type of cancer. The rising number of patient with chronic diseases has renewed the interest in prevention and its potential role in helping control costs. In 2008, the Trust for America's Health produced a report that estimated investing $10 per person annually in community-based programs of proven effectiveness and promoting healthy lifestyle (increase in physical activity, healthier diet and preventing tobacco use) could save more than $16 billion annually within a period of just five years. It is uncertain whether school-based policies on targeting risk factors on chronic diseases such as healthy eating policies, physical activity policies, and tobacco policies can improve student health behaviours or knowledge of staffs and students. Encouraging those with chronic conditions to continue with their outpatient (ambulatory) medical care and attend scheduled medical appointments may help improve outcomes and reduce medical costs due to missed appointments. Finding patient-centered alternatives to doctors or consultants scheduling medical appointments has been suggested as a means of improving the number of people with chronic conditions that miss medical appointments, however there is no strong evidence that these approaches make a difference.  Nursing  Nursing can play an important role in assisting patients with chronic diseases achieve longevity and experience wellness. Scholars point out that the current neoliberal era emphasizes self-care, in both affluent and low-income communities. This self-care focus extends to the nursing of patients with chronic diseases, replacing a more holistic role for nursing with an emphasis on patients managing their own health conditions. Critics note that this is challenging if not impossible for patients with chronic disease in low-income communities where health care systems, and economic and social structures do not fully support this practice. A study in Ethiopia showcases a nursing-heavy approach to the management of chronic disease. Foregrounding the problem of distance from healthcare facility, the study recommends patients increase their request for care. It uses nurses and health officers to fill, in a cost- efficient way, the large unmet need for chronic disease treatment. They led their health centers manned by nurses and health officers; so, there are specific training required for involvement in the programmed must be carried out regularly, to ensure that new staff is educated in administering chronic disease care. The program shows that community-based care and education, primarily driven by nurses and health officers, works. It highlights the importance of nurses following up with individuals in the community, and allowing nurses flexibility in meeting their patients' needs and educating them for self-care in their homes. Epidemiology The epidemiology of chronic disease is diverse and the epidemiology of some chronic diseases can change in response to new treatments. In the treatment of HIV, the success of anti-retroviral therapies means that many patients will experience this infection as a chronic disease that for many will span several decades of their chronic life. Some epidemiology of chronic disease can apply to multiple diagnosis. Obesity and body fat distribution for example contribute and are risk factors for many chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart, and kidney disease. Other epidemiological factors, such as social, socioeconomic, and environment do not have a straightforward cause and effect relationship with chronic disease diagnosis. While typically higher socioeconomic status is correlated with lower occurrence of chronic disease, it is not known is there is a direct cause and effect relationship between these two variables. The epidemiology of communicable chronic diseases such as AIDS is also different than that of noncommunicable chronic disease. While Social factors do play a role in AIDS prevalence, only exposure is truly needed to contract this chronic disease. Communicable chronic diseases are also typically only treatable with medication intervention, rather than lifestyle change as some non-communicable chronic diseases can be treated. United States As of 2003, there are a few programs which aim to gain more knowledge on the epidemiology of chronic disease using data collection. The hope of these programs is to gather epidemiological data on various chronic diseases across the United States and demonstrate how this knowledge can be valuable in addressing chronic disease. In the United States, as of 2004 nearly one in two Americans (133 million) has at least one chronic medical condition, with most subjects (58%) between the ages of 18 and 64. The number is projected to increase by more than one percent per year by 2030, resulting in an estimated chronically ill population of 171 million. The most common chronic conditions are high blood pressure, arthritis, respiratory diseases like emphysema, and high cholesterol. Based on data from 2014 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), about 60% of adult Americans were estimated to have one chronic illness, with about 40% having more than one; this rate appears to be mostly unchanged from 2008. MEPS data from 1998 showed 45% of adult Americans had at least one chronic illness, and 21% had more than one. According to research by the CDC, chronic disease is also especially a concern in the elderly population in America. Chronic diseases like stroke, heart disease, and cancer were among the leading causes of death among Americans aged 65 or older in 2002, accounting for 61% of all deaths among this subset of the population.name=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\"The state of aging and health in america 2007\\" It is estimated that at least 80% of older Americans are currently living with some form of a chronic condition, with 50% of this population having two or more chronic conditions. The two most common chronic conditions in the elderly are high blood pressure and arthritis, with diabetes, coronary heart disease, and cancer also being reported among the elder population.name=ParentGiving.\\"Common Chronic Conditions and Aging at Hom\\" In examining the statistics of chronic disease among the living elderly, it is also important to make note of the statistics pertaining to fatalities as a result of chronic disease. Heart disease is the leading cause of death from chronic disease for adults older than 65, followed by cancer, stroke, diabetes, chronic lower respiratory diseases, influenza and pneumonia, and, finally, Alzheimer's disease. Though the rates of chronic disease differ by race for those living with chronic illness, the statistics for leading causes of death among elderly are nearly identical across racial/ethnic groups. Chronic illnesses cause about 70% of deaths in the US and in 2002 chronic conditions (heart disease, cancers, stroke, chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, mental illness and kidney diseases) were 6 of the top ten causes of mortality in the general US population.National Center for Health Statistics. \\" Health, United States\\" / 2004. Economic impact=United States Chronic diseases are a major factor in the continuous growth of medical care spending. In 2002, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services stated that the health care for chronic diseases cost the most among all health problems in the U.S. Healthy People 2010 reported that more than 75% of the $2 trillion spent annually in US medical care are due to chronic conditions; spending are even higher in proportion for Medicare beneficiaries (aged 65 years and older). Spending growth is driven in part by the greater prevalence of chronic illnesses, and the longer life expectancy of the population. Also improvement in treatments has significantly extended the life spans of patients with chronic diseases but results in additional costs over long period of time. A striking success is the development of combined antiviral therapies that led to remarkable improvement in survival rates and quality of life of HIV-infected patients. In addition to direct costs in health care, chronic diseases are a significant burden to the economy, through limitations in daily activities, loss in productivity and loss of days of work. A particular concern is the rising rates of overweight and obesity in all segments of the US population. Obesity itself is a medical condition and not a disease, but it constitutes a major risk factor for developing chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, stroke, cardiovascular disease and cancers. Obesity results in significant health care spending and indirect costs, as illustrated by a recent study from the Texas comptroller reporting that obesity alone cost Texas businesses an extra $9.5 billion in 2009, including more than $4 billion for health care, $5 billion for lost productivity and absenteeism, and $321 million for disability.Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts \\"Gaining Costs, Losing Time: The Obesity Crisis in Texas\\". Special Report, Austin, Texas, February 2011, Publication# 96-1360.  Social and personal impact  There have been recent links between social factors and prevalence as well as outcome of chronic conditions.  Mental health  Specifically, the connection between loneliness and health and chronic condition has recently been highlighted. Some studies have shown that loneliness has detrimental health effects similar to that of smoking and obesity. One study found that feelings of isolation are associated with higher self reporting of health as poor, and feelings of loneliness increased the likelihood of mental health disorders in individuals. The connection between chronic illness and loneliness is established, yet oftentimes ignored in treatment. One study for example found that a greater number of chronic illnesses per individual were associated with feelings of loneliness. Some of the possible reasons for this listed are an inability to maintain independence as well as the chronic illness being a source of stress for the individual. A study of loneliness in adults over age 65 found that low levels of loneliness as well as high levels of familial support were associated with better outcomes of multiple chronic conditions such as hypertension and diabetes. There are some recent movements in the medical sphere to address these connections when treating patients with chronic illness. The biopsychosocial approach for example, developed in 2006 focuses on patients “patient's personality, family, culture, and health dynamics.” Physicians are leaning more towards a psychosocial approach to chronic illness to aid the increasing number of individuals diagnosed with these conditions. Despite this movement, there is still criticism that chronic conditions are not being treated appropriately, and there is not enough emphasis on the behavioral aspects of chronic conditions or psychological types of support for patients. The mental toll of chronic illness is often underestimated in society. Adults with chronic illness that restrict their daily life present with more depression and lower self-esteem than healthy adults and adults with non-restricting chronic illness. The emotional influence of chronic illness also has an effect on the intellectual and educational development of the individual. For example, people living with type 1 diabetes endure a lifetime of monotonous and rigorous health care management usually involving daily blood glucose monitoring, insulin injections, and constant self-care. This type of constant attention that is required by type 1 diabetes and other chronic illness can result in psychological maladjustment. There have been several theories, namely one called diabetes resilience theory, that posit that protective processes buffer the impact of risk factors on the individual's development and functioning.  Financial cost  People with chronic conditions pay more out-of-pocket; a study of the United States found that people spent $2,243 more on average. The financial burden can increase medication non- adherence. In some countries, laws protect patients with chronic conditions from excessive financial responsibility; for example, as of 2008 France limited copayments for those with chronic conditions, and Germany limits cost sharing to 1% of income versus 2% for the general public.  Gender  Gender influences how chronic disease is viewed and treated in society. Women's chronic health issues are often considered to be most worthy of treatment, or most severe when the chronic condition interferes with a woman's fertility. Historically, there is less of a focus on a woman's chronic conditions when it interferes with other aspects of her life or well being. Many women report feeling less than or even “half of a woman” due to the pressures that society puts on the importance of fertility and health when it comes to typically feminine ideals. These kinds of social barriers interfere with women's ability to perform various other activities in life and fully work toward their aspirations.  Socioeconomic class and race  Race is also allegedly implicated in chronic illness, although there may be many other factors involved. Racial minorities are 1.5-2 times more likely to have most chronic diseases than white individuals. Non Hispanic blacks are 40% more likely to have high blood pressure that non Hispanic whites, diagnosed diabetes is 77% higher among non Hispanic blacks, and American Indians and Alaska Natives are 60% more likely to be obese than non-Hispanic whites. Some of this prevalence has been suggested to be in part from environmental racism. Flint Michigan for example had high levels of lead poisoning in their drinkable water after waste was dumped into low value housing areas. There are also higher rates of asthma in children who live in lower income areas due to an abundance of pollutants being released on a much larger scale in these areas.  Advocacy and research organizations  In Europe, the European Chronic Disease Alliance was formed in 2011, which represents over 100,000 healthcare workers. In the United States, there are a number of nonprofits focused on chronic conditions, including entities focused on specific diseases such as the American Diabetes Association, Alzheimer's Association, or Crohn's and Colitis Foundation. There are also broader groups focused on advocacy or research into chronic illness in general, such as The National Association of Chronic Disease Directors, Partnership to FIght Chronic Disease, the Chronic Disease Coalition which arose in Oregon in 2015, and the Chronic Policy Care Alliance.

His best known contributions to chemistry were his work explaining the unusual structural, electrochemical, and spectroscopic properties of blue copper proteins, particularly plastocyanin. He also introduced protein crystallography to Australia and was a strong advocate for programs to ensure Australian scientists have good access to \\"big science\\" facilities. Freeman has received numerous honours, including being elected a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science (FAA) and appointed a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) by the Australian Government. He was a charismatic lecturer who voluntarily continued teaching well into his formal retirement and imbued his students with a love of science. Biography=Early years and education Hans Charles Freeman was the first and only son of Karl and Lotte Freeman and was born in Breslau in Germany in 1929 (now Wrocław, Poland). In 1938, following a tip-off from a Nazi party member, Karl decided to relocate his Jewish family to Australia. Karl brought his knowledge of detergents (a novelty in Australia at the time) to his new homeland, applying it to the problem of cleaning blood-stained blankets that would otherwise be wasted. After the war, he founded K. H. Freeman Pty Ltd, a detergent and soap manufacturing company; Hans spent many weekends working in the factory, gaining a practical insight into chemistry. Hans adapted well to his new environment, quickly mastering his new language and demonstrating his outstanding scholastic ability. He was dux of his primary school, dux of Sydney Boys High in 1945, and took his Bachelor's degree with the university medal in chemistry in 1949. He was one of the ten chemistry students in his class at Sydney Boys High to go on to become Professors of Chemistry. After receiving his MSc in 1952 under the supervision of Raymond Le Fèvre FRS, Freeman attended Caltech on a Rotary Foundation Fellowship where, at the urging of Linus Pauling, he learned the fundamentals of crystallography. He received a PhD in 1957 for his work on the structure of biuret hydrate, where he completed most of the calculations for the crystal structure by hand. Personal life Freeman came to Australia with his parents and his sister, Eva. Following the death of his father in 1958, he became a Director of K. H. Freeman Pty Ltd, which continues to operate today. He met Edith Siou in 1964 and they married in 1966. They have two children, Maeva and Philip. Career Structure of poplar plastocyanin Freeman was appointed to the faculty of the University of Sydney in 1954 as a Lecturer, working his way up until he was made the inaugural Professor of Inorganic Chemistry in 1971. Freeman pioneered the use of computers in crystallography in Australia, working on SILLIAC (the Australian cousin of the University of Illinois' ILLIAC machine and Australia's second computer) after its installation in 1956. His research group extended its interests beyond purely organic compounds and on to metal complexes (such as copper biuret, one of the first bioinorganic substances to be structurally determined) and went on to determine the structures of numerous metal complexes of amino acids and peptides. The copper site in plastocyanin, with the four amino acids that bind the metal labelled In 1970, the focus of Freeman's research became protein crystallography and he turned his attention to the blue copper proteins (cupredoxins) and particularly the electron transport protein plastocyanin. The intensely blue colour of plastocyanin and its unusual redox properties had frustrated all attempts to synthesise a small molecule mimic. It was not until 1977 that his group finally determined the structure of plastocyanin crystallised from the poplar tree (see diagram at right); this was the first protein crystal structure determined in the southern hemisphere. Together with subsequent work in collaboration with Ed Solomon, this work led to understanding of the unusual geometry of the copper metal site (see diagram at left) as well as the spectroscopic and electrochemical properties characteristic of blue copper proteins. Later in his career, Freeman developed an interest in the applications of EXAFS spectroscopy to metalloprotein structure, collaborating with both James Penner-Hahn and Keith Hodgson. Working together, the Freeman and Hodgson groups were, in 1988, the first to determine a new crystal structure of a protein using the multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) method. Throughout his career, Freeman was concerned about the influence of the tyranny of distanceThe phrase \\"the tyranny of distance\\" comes from the 1966 book The Tyranny of Distance: How Distance Shaped Australia's History by Geoffrey Blainey on the development of Australian science. For this reason, in 1972 Freeman and Alexander Boden AO, FAA, founded the Foundation for Inorganic Chemistry at the university to bring international scholars to the department to deliver a course for graduate students and give seminars for faculty. The inaugural Foundation scholar was nobel laureate Linus Pauling and the Foundation has brought many other eminent research chemists to Australia. The Foundation has thus functioned to increase Australian awareness of state of the art international research, increased international recognition of Australian research, and allowed graduate students to interact with leading chemists based in institutions far from Australia. Many of the students have gone on to post-graduate or post-doctoral positions with a Foundation scholar. Freeman also provided advice to the Australian Government on the problem of access to \\"big science\\" facilities. This included making major contributions to the report Small Country - Big Science in his work for the Australian Science and Technology Council. The report emphasised the need for Australian researchers to have access to facilities such as synchrotron X-ray and high intensity neutron sources, and led directly to the formation of the Australian Synchrotron Research Programme (ASRP) to fund access to such facilities. Freeman served as a board member of the ASRP until its functions were subsumed under the newly commissioned Australian Synchrotron in 2008. The Australian expertise developed as a consequence of ASRP-supported research led to the Australian Synchrotron being built a decade sooner than would have otherwise been the case. Freeman retired from his Chair in 1997, and was succeeded by Len Lindoy FAA. Nevertheless, he continued working in research and became Emeritus Professor of Chemistry and Emeritus Professor of Molecular and Microbial Biosciences. He also voluntarily continued teaching at first-year level. His lecturing was described as \\"charismatic\\" and \\"teaching was a love and a privilege and never an obligation\\" for him. Legacy Freeman was principally responsible for the establishment of structural biology as a discipline in Australia. He founded the first protein crystallography laboratory in Australia; today, there are more than 15 active research groups carrying out protein crystallography in Australia and New Zealand. Many former members of the Freeman research group have moved on to join one of these other groups. The groups interact through the Society of Crystallographers of Australia and New Zealand (SCANZ); Freeman was the Foundation President of then Society of Crystallographers of Australia, an organisation he was instrumental in forming in 1976. Working as a crystallographer, Freeman's major legacies are the understanding of plastocyanin and other blue copper proteins, and development of the MAD method as an extension of EXAFS spectroscopy. Freeman's work in ensuring Australian scientists have access to \\"big science\\" facilities will continue to assist researchers into the future. His teaching also leaves a legacy of \\"generations of students imbued with a love of science\\". Honours and awards Freeman was recognised for his professional achievements with Fellowships in the Royal Australian Chemical Institute (RACI) in 1968, the Royal Society of Chemistry in 1984, and the Australian Academy of Science in 1984. Freeman's contributions were also recognised by the Australian Government with a Centenary Medal in 2001 for \\"service to Australian society and science in chemistry\\" and with his appointment as a Member of the Order of Australia in June 2005 for \\"service to science and scientific research in the field of bio- inorganic chemistry, particularly through the establishment and development of the discipline of crystallography in Australia\\". Freeman received numerous awards over his long career. In 1980, Freeman received the Burrows Award, the premier award of the Inorganic Chemistry Division of the RACI. He was also awarded the 1999 Leighton Memorial Medal which is \\"the RACI's most prestigious medal and is awarded in recognition of eminent services to chemistry in Australia in the broadest sense.\\" In 2007, he received both the Australian Academy of Science's Craig Medal and an RACI Distinguished Fellowship.

Ethio telecom is owned by the Ethiopian government and maintains a monopoly over all telecommunication services in Ethiopia. Based in Addis Ababa, it is one of the \\"Big-5\\" group of state owned corporations in Ethiopia, along with Ethiopian Airlines, the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, Ethiopian Insurance Corporation, and the Ethiopian Shipping Lines. Ethio telecom was managed, on a management contract arrangement from 2010 to 2013 June, by France Télécom, and was required to comply with Ethiopian Government orders. The government said it outsourced the management as ETC was not able to meet the demands of the fast-growing country. It also said that telecommunications services would not be privatized, at least not in the near future. Ethio telecom generates a revenue of over US$300 million for the Ethiopian government, and was dubbed a \\"cash cow\\" by the previous Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn.  History  antenna mast in Mekelle Originally a division of the Ministry of Post, Telephone and Telegraph, what would become the ETC was established as the Imperial Board of Telecommunications of Ethiopia (IBTE) by proclamation No. 131/52 in 1952. Under the Derg Regime, the IBTE was reorganized as the Ethiopian Telecommunications Service in October 1975, which was in turn reorganized in January 1981 as the Ethiopian Telecommunications Authority. In November 1996, the Ethiopian Telecommunications Authority became ETC by Council of Ministers regulation No. 10/1996. The subsequent Proclamation 49/1996 expanded the ETC's duties and responsibilities. For its international traffic links and communication services, ETC mainly uses its earth station at Sululta which transmits and receives to both the Indian Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean satellites.\\"Ethiopian Telecommunications Corporation: Historical Background\\" (accessed 30 April 2010) Engineering consulting firm Arup, were involved in the design and engineering of the early tower structures (during the 1970s). In late 2006, the ETC signed an agreement worth US$1.5 billion with three Chinese companies, ZTE Corporation, Huawei Technologies and the Chinese International Telecommunication Construction Corporation, to upgrade and expand Ethiopian telecommunications services. This agreement will increase the number of mobile services from 1.5 million to 7 million, land line telephone services from 1 million to 4 million, and expansion of the fibre optic network, from the present 4,000 kilometers to 10,000 by 2010. It is part of a larger US$2.4 billion plan by the Ethiopian government to improve the country's telecommunications infrastructure.\\" $1.5 billion China telecoms deal\\", Ethiopian News Newsletter August, September and October, 2006 (accessed 11 January 2007) In 2018, the mobile service business has reached 85% of the country. In February 2018, it was reported that Ethio Telecom had 64.4 million subscribers making it the largest telecommunication services operator in the continent. The operator runs three terrestrial fiber optic cables with a capacity of 42 Gbit/s to connect Ethiopia to the rest of the world via Kenya, Djibouti and Sudan. In August 2019, the company announced that it will install 4G network before other telecom companies enter the Ethiopian market since the government decided that it will liberalize the telecom sector. The current chief executive officer of Ethio telecom is Frehiwot Tamru since August 1, 2018 preceded by Andualem Admassie who served five years. Andualem is now assigned as Director of the Higher Education Relevance and Quality Agency. Frehiwot previously worked as deputy CEO for Internal Support Service for then Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation. She told Capital she would manage all surveillance quality protocols. By August 26, 2020, Ethio telecom planned to extended 842 new infrastructure site during 2020 fiscal year. This infrastructure expected to enable the company to host additional 5.2 million new customers. During this fiscal year, the company planned to generate 55.5 billion birr in revenue, a 16pc growth from the last fiscal year. It also plans to boost the country's telecom density to 51.3pc. Censorship According to reports by the OpenNet Initiative and Freedom House, the Ethiopian government through Ethio telecom imposes nationwide, politically motivated internet filtering. Under a 2012 law regulating the telecommunication industry, attempts by journalists to circumvent Ethio telecom surveillance and censorship of the internet could be interpreted as a criminal offense carrying a prison sentence of up to 15 years. Most blocked sites are those run by Ethiopians in the diaspora who are highly critical of the government, however, Ethio telecom has also intermittently blocked access to other sites. In 2008, the Committee to Protect Journalists site was blocked for several months after it reported the arrest and beating of the editor-in- chief of The Reporter. For almost two years following the 2005 elections, Ethio telecom, which is also the sole telephone provider in the country, blocked mobile phone text-messaging. The government accused the Coalition for Unity and Democracy, the largest electoral opposition at the time, of coordinating anti-government demonstrations using text messages.

It formerly traded as London Taxis International and Carbodies. It operated a coachbuilding business on Holyhead Road, Coventry. After half a century making short runs of limited demand bodies for major manufacturers it was obliged to replace these now moribund activities and in 1971 took from its former customer and supplier of taxi chassis, Austin, the manufacture of complete London taxicabs. Two years later was bought by Manganese Bronze Holdings. Rebranded as The London Taxi Company in October 2010, it was placed in administration in October 2012, with certain assets purchased by Geely to form what is now the London EV Company. History The origins of The London Taxi Company can be traced to 1919, when Robert 'Bobby' Jones, a former general manager at coachbuilder Hollick & Pratt took over the coachbuilding operations of his then employer, timber merchants Gooderhams and set up in business in premises acquired from Thomas Pass in West Orchard, Coventry.David Thoms, Tom Donnelly, The Motor Car Industry in Coventry since the 1890s Croom-Helm 1985 1919-1954Standardised Coachwork= Hillman Minx sports tourer 1934 Hillman Minx drophead coupé 1947 Rather than make bespoke bodies to individual designs, Carbodies set out to produce coachwork to a number of standardised designs for car companies that did not have their own coachbuilding facilities. Their first major customers during the 1920s were MG and Alvis Cars. The scale of a new contract to build bodies for the MG M-Type Midget meant that they needed larger premises and in 1928, they moved to a larger site on Holyhead Road, where they remain to this day. In the 1930s, they supplied bodies for Rover, Invicta and Railton, but by far their biggest and most important customer in that decade was the Rootes Group. During World War II the company made bodies for military vehicles. They also acquired press tools through the Lend-Lease scheme, which enabled them to make aircraft components. In 1943, Carbodies also became a limited company at this time, with Bobby Jones as governing director and his son, Ernest Jones managing director.Companies House extract company no 382553 Companies House =Taxicabs, Convertibles, Daimlers and other Postwar Vehicles= After the war, Carbodies negotiated with London taxi dealer Mann & Overton and Austin to make bodies for the Austin FX3 taxi, introduced in 1948, as well as finishing and delivering the complete vehicles. More than 7,000 FX3s, mainly destined for London, were produced over 10 years. They also developed a system for turning modern all-steel saloon cars into convertibles. This work was carried out on the early unit construction Hillman Minx, the Austin Somerset and Hereford, the Ford Mk1 Consul and Zephyr and, later the Mk2 Ford Consul, Zephyr and Zodiac. BSA ownership (1954-1973) In 1954, Bobby Jones sold Carbodies to the BSA Group, who put it under the control of its prestige car company, Daimler. Although it was intended for Carbodies to become the manufacturing plant for Daimler steel bodies, this was never fulfilled. It did, however convert the Conquest saloon into a drophead, using the same methods they used on Fords and Austin and also made a drophead coupe body for the Daimler Conquest Roadster and made bodies for the Daimler Majestic and Majestic Major saloons. Under BSA, manufacturing facilities were extended and more plant installed. In 1958, Carbodies began manufacturing the body and carrying out the assembly, finishing and delivery of the most important vehicle in their history, the Austin FX4 taxi. Carbodies also supplied prototype bodies and tooling, projects including the Jaguar E-type bonnet and panels for Triumph, Ariel and BSA motorcycles and scooters. Further contracts undertaken during the 1960s and early 1970s were the conversion of Humber Hawk and Super Snipe, Singer Vogue and Triumph 2000 saloons into estate cars, but gradually, as contract work on private cars and commercial vehicles fell away, the FX4 taxi would become more important for the company. In 1971 Carbodies bought the FX4 chassis assembly line from British Leyland's Adderley Park, Birmingham factory and moved it to Coventry, making them complete manufacturers of the FX4, in actuality if not in name.BSA assemble taxis The Times, Wednesday, 12 May 1971; p. 18; Issue 58170; col F Manganese Bronze ownership (1973-2013) In 1973, Carbodies was included in the sale of BSA to Manganese Bronze Holdings.MBH to buy taxi group The Times, Wednesday, 11 April 1984; p. 20; Issue 61803; col F In the 1970s, Carbodies tried to make a new taxi of their own, the FX5, but it was abandoned in 1979 because the development costs were too high.

A new model of taxi, the CR6, based on a Range Rover bodyshell was abandoned after almost five years of development. In 1984, the London taxicab dealer Mann & Overton was bought by Manganese Bronze Holdings. Pending the development of a new model, the FX4 was further developed and became the LTI Fairway. =Rebranded as London Taxis International= In 1992 the company was rebranded London Taxis International with three divisions: LTI Carbodies, LTI Mann & Overton and London Taxi Finance. In 1997, a new model of taxicab, the TX1 was introduced as a successor to the FX4. Further development resulted in the launch in 2002 of the TXII, powered by a Ford Dura Torq 2.4-litre diesel engine and featuring an integral fold-down ramp for wheelchair users. It also has an intermediate step and swivel-out seat for passengers with moderate walking difficulties. For people with hearing problems it has an induction loop incorporated in the intercom system. In 2007 the TXII was replaced by the TX4. This series established LTI Vehicles as a worldwide supplier of London-type taxis. In October 2010 the London Taxis International was rebranded as The London Taxi Company. A joint venture with Chinese car maker Geely, who already held a 20% interest in the company through its Manganese Bronze shareholding, was formed to build a factory in Shanghai to manufacture London taxis for the export market and to supply components to the home factory in Coventry.London taxi parts to be made in China Sydney Morning Herald 21 March 2010 Manganese Bronze to seek funds from China's Greely China Daily 16 October 2010London Taxi eyes Australian market Go Auto 1 October 2012 In 2010 the Mann & Overton trading name was dropped. =Administration= In October 2012, following a suspension of sales due to the discovery of a serious flaw with vehicle steering components and having failed in an attempt to obtain new financing, the company was placed in voluntary administration.Manganese Bronze to call in administrators BBC News 22 October 2012 The quite recently specified faulty steering components had been sourced from Geely supplier, Gang Yang in China.Manganese Bronze taxi steering fault solution found BBC News 15 November 2012Black cab fix on the way ‘within weeks’.

Finite temperature and instantons At zero temperature, instantons are the name given to solutions of the classical equations of motion of the Euclidean version of the theory under consideration, and which are furthermore localized in Euclidean spacetime. They describe tunneling between different topological vacuum states of the Minkowski theory. One important example of an instanton is the BPST instanton, discovered in 1975 by Belavin, Polyakov, Schwartz and Tyupkin. This is a topologically stable solution to the four-dimensional SU(2) Yang–Mills field equations in Euclidean spacetime (i.e. after Wick rotation). Finite temperatures in quantum field theories are modeled by compactifying the imaginary (Euclidean) time (see thermal quantum field theory).See for a derivation of this formalism. This changes the overall structure of spacetime, and thus also changes the form of the instanton solutions. According to the Matsubara formalism, at finite temperature, the Euclidean time dimension is periodic, which means that instanton solutions have to be periodic as well. In SU(2) Yang–Mills theory In SU(2) Yang–Mills theory at zero temperature, the instantons have the form of the BPST instanton. The generalization thereof to finite temperature has been found by Harrington and Shepard: : A_\\\\mu^a(x) = \\\\bar\\\\eta_{\\\\mu u}^a \\\\Pi(x) \\\\partial_ u \\\\Pi^{-1}(x) \\\\quad\\\\text{with} \\\\quad \\\\Pi(x) = 1+\\\\frac{\\\\pi\\\\rho^2T}r \\\\frac{\\\\sinh(2\\\\pi rT)}{\\\\cosh(2\\\\pi rT)-\\\\cos(2\\\\pi \\\\tau T)} \\\\ , where \\\\bar\\\\eta_{\\\\mu u}^a is the anti-'t Hooft symbol, r is the distance from the point x to the center of the caloron, ρ is the size of the caloron, \\\\tau is the Euclidean time and T is the temperature. This solution was found based on a periodic multi-instanton solution first suggested by 't Hooft and published by Witten.

Early life  Rallis was the son of former Greek Prime Minister Dimitrios Rallis, and he came of a family with a long tradition in political leadership. He studied law at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, as well as in France and Germany. Upon his return to Greece he became a lawyer. In 1905, he was elected as a member of parliament for the first time; he remained in parliament until 1936, when democracy was abolished in Greece by the 4th of August Regime of Ioannis Metaxas.  Political career  Rallis originally belonged to the Greek conservative and monarchist People's Party. As a member of this party he served in various administrations as: *Minister of the Navy (4 November 1920 - 24 January 1921). Under Prime Minister Dimitrios Rallis, his father. *Minister of Economics (August 26, 1921 - March 2, 1922). Under Prime Minister Dimitrios Gounaris. *Minister of Foreign Affairs (November 4, 1932 - January 16, 1933). Under Prime Minister Panagis Tsaldaris. After the victory of the People's Party in 1933 Greek legislative election, he served the new government under Tsaldaris from various posts. In 1935, he had a disagreement with Prime Minister Tsaldaris, the leader of the People's Party, and at the ensuing 1935 Greek legislative election he campaigned with Ioannis Metaxas and Georgios Stratos as a candidate of the Freethinker's Party, but he failed to win election. Greece was in a time of great political instability and new elections were held, the 1936 Greek legislative election. This time Rallis joined with Georgios Kondylis and Ioannis Theotokis and he was elected. Parliament was fractured, with the Liberal Party under Themistoklis Sophoulis having a one- seat majority and the opposition divided between monarchists and Communists and every philosophy in between. When the Metaxas dictatorship was declared later that year, and parliament was dissolved on August 4, 1936, Rallis expressed disapproval of this political coup, despite his personal friendship with Metaxas. Collaboration with the occupying forces After the successful German invasion of Greece in the spring of 1941, Rallis was the first eminent Greek political figure to collaborate politically with the German occupying forces.Mark Mazower, Inside Hitler's Greece. The Experience of Occupation, 1941-44.(Greek translation), Athens: Αλεξάνδρεια, 1994(1993),125. The Germans hoped that Rallis would gain some support from the pre-war Greek political elites, that he might be able to restore order to the country and that he could form an anticommunist front against the Ethniko Apeleftherotiko Metopo (EAM) and the Ethnikos Laikos Apeleftherotikos Stratos (ELAS). EAM was the main movement of the Greek Resistance and had been initially formed by an alliance of Communist Party of Greece, the Socialist Party of Greece, the Greek Popular Republic and the Agricultural Party of Greece. ELAS was its military arm. Since anti-communism served as a common ground between the Liberal Party and the People's Party, the idea of a united front seemed plausible. Rallis changed the ministry council and was instrumental in creating the so-called \\"Security Battalions\\"--collaborationist paramilitary groups equipped by the Wehrmacht and dedicated to the persecution of resistance groups (mainly ELAS). Being more experienced in politics than his predecessors, a general and a German-speaking doctor, he was more respected by the Germans and proved more effective against the resistance movements.Mazower 1993, p. 146  Greek collaborators  All three administrators during the occupation (Georgios Tsolakoglou, Konstantinos Logothetopoulos and Ioannis Rallis) presided over what was in effect a puppet government (1941–1944) completely subordinate to the Nazi occupation authorities. Thus, they all failed to prevent the Nazis from imposing heavy \\"reconstruction\\" fees on Greece, paid eventually by the confiscation of crops and precipitating a terrible famine that according to the Red Cross, cost the lives of about 250,000 people (mainly in the urban areas of the country).Mazower 1993, p. 67 However, the Germans had no deliberate plan of starvation of the Greeks.Mazower 1993, p.46 Imprisonment and death After the liberation of Greece, Rallis was sentenced to life imprisonment for collaboration and treason. He died in prison in 1946. Personal life Ioannis Rallis's son Georgios Rallis became prime minister during 1980-1981\\\\. In 1947, Georgios published a book entitled Ioannis Rallis Speaks from the Grave, which consisted of a remorseful text written by his father during his imprisonment.

Department of Environment and Conservation . An attractive plant with fine feathery leaves and large red-brown flower spikes, it usually grows as an upright bush around two metres (7 ft) high, but can also occur as a small tree or a low spreading shrub. First collected in 1829 and published the following year, it is placed in Banksia subgenus Banksia, section Oncostylis, series Spicigerae. There are two genetically distinct forms. Banksia brownii occurs naturally only in two population clusters between Albany and the Stirling Range in southwest Western Australia. In the Stirling Range it occurs among heath on rocky mountain slopes; further south it occurs among jarrah woodland in shallow nutrient-poor sand. It is rare and endangered in its natural habitat, with all major populations currently threatened by Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, a disease to which the species is highly susceptible. Other threats include loss of habitat, commercial exploitation and changes to the fire regime. Highly valued by Australia's horticultural and cut flower industries, B. brownii is widely cultivated in areas not exposed to dieback. It prefers a sheltered position in soil with good drainage, and must be provided with some moisture over summer.  Description  Banksia brownii usually grows as an upright bush between one and three metres (3–10 ft) high, but it can also grow as an openly branched small tree to six metres (20 ft) in sheltered gullies, or as a low, spreading shrub in exposed locations such as the peaks of the Stirling Range. The bark is a grey-brown colour, smooth and thin, with lenticels. The leaves are long and thin, from three to ten centimetres (1–5 in) long, and five to ten millimetres (– in) wide. Dark green and hairless above but with a hairy white underside, they are easily recognised by their feather-like appearance, caused by the fact that they are finely divided almost back to the midrib, into as many as 70 thin tapered lobes. Flowers occur in typical Banksia \\"flower spikes\\", inflorescences made up of hundreds of pairs of flowers densely packed in a spiral around a woody axis. B. brownii's flower spike is a metallic red- brown colour, roughly cylindrical, 6 to 19 centimetres (2–7½ in) high and eight to ten centimetres (3–4 in) wide. Each flower consists of a tubular perianth made up of four united tepals, and one long wiry style. Perianths are cream at the base and grey-brown at the end. Styles are rusty red-brown with a cream tip, and downwardly hooked rather than straight. The style end is initially trapped inside the upper perianth parts, but breaks free at anthesis. Flower spikes are held erect and are typically terminal on a branch; often other branchlets grow up and around a spike from below. The fruiting structure is a stout woody \\"cone\\", around five centimetres (2 inches) in diameter, with a hairy appearance caused by the persistence of old withered flower parts. A \\"cone\\" may be embedded with up to 60 follicles, although usually there are very few or even none at all. Unusually for Banksia, each follicle contains just one seed. This is shiny black, oval in shape, about 20 millimetres (¾ in) long, with a brown papery wing.  Taxonomy  Leaf variation in B. brownii. Left: a leaf of the shrubby \\"mountain form\\". Right: a leaf of the upright \\"Millbrook Road\\" form. Banksia brownii was first collected near King George Sound in 1829 by William Baxter, who named it in honour of botanist Robert Brown. A formal description was published by Brown in his 1830 Supplementum Primum Prodromi Florae Novae Hollandiae; thus the full botanic name of the species is Banksia brownii Baxter ex R.Br. Under Brown's taxonomic arrangement, B. brownii was placed in subgenus Banksia verae, the \\"true banksias\\", because its inflorescence is a typical Banksia flower spike. Banksia verae was renamed Eubanksia by Stephan Endlicher in 1847. Carl Meissner demoted Eubanksia to sectional rank in his 1856 classification, and divided it into four series, with B. brownii placed in series Dryandroideae. When George Bentham published his 1870 arrangement in Flora Australiensis, he discarded Meissner's series, placing all the species with hooked styles together in a section that he named Oncostylis. This arrangement would stand for over a century. In 1891, Otto Kuntze challenged the generic name Banksia L.f., on the grounds that the name Banksia had previously been published in 1775 as Banksia J.R.Forst & G.Forst, referring to the genus now known as Pimelea. Kuntze proposed Sirmuellera as an alternative, republishing B. brownii as \\"Sirmuellera brownei (Baxter)\\" [sic]. The challenge failed, Banksia L.f. was formally conserved, and Sirmuellera brownii (Baxter ex R.Br.) Kuntze\\" is now a nomenclatural synonym of B. brownii. Alex George published a new taxonomic arrangement of Banksia in his landmark 1981 monograph The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae). Endlicher's Eubanksia became B. subg. Banksia, and was divided into three sections, one of which was Oncostylis. Oncostylis was further divided into four series, with B. brownii placed in series Spicigerae because its inflorescences are cylindrical. In 1996, Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges published a new arrangement for the genus, after cladistic analyses yielded a cladogram significantly different from George's arrangement. Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement retained B. brownii in series Spicigerae, placing it in B. subser. Occidentales along with B. occidentalis (red swamp banksia), B. seminuda (river banksia), B. verticillata (granite banksia) and B. littoralis (swamp banksia). This arrangement stood until 1999, when George effectively reverted to his 1981 arrangement in his monograph for the Flora of Australia series. Under George's taxonomic arrangement of Banksia, B. brownii's taxonomic placement may be summarised as follows: :Genus Banksia ::Subgenus Banksia :::Section Banksia :::Section Coccinea :::Section Oncostylis ::::Series Spicigerae :::::B. spinulosa \\\\- B. ericifolia \\\\- B. verticillata \\\\- B. seminuda \\\\- B. littoralis \\\\- B. occidentalis \\\\- B. brownii ::::Series Tricuspidae ::::Series Dryandroidae ::::Series Abietinae ::Subgenus Isostylis The closest relative to B. brownii is held to be B. occidentalis, which differs in having smaller, deep red flowers and narrow, sparsely serrate leaves. Since 1998, Austin Mast has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for the subtribe Banksiinae, which comprises Banksia and Dryandra. With respect to B. brownii, Mast's results are somewhat at odds with those of both George and Thiele and Ladiges, finding it to be more closely related to B. nutans (nodding banksia) and B. quercifolia (oak-leaved banksia) than to many of the Spicigerae. Overall, the inferred phylogeny is very greatly different from George's arrangement, and provides compelling evidence for the paraphyly of Banksia with respect to Dryandra. Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement of Banksia by transferring Dryandra into it, and publishing B. subg. Spathulatae for the species having spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then B. brownii is placed in B. subg. Spathulatae. Three genetically distinct forms of B. brownii are recognised: the better known forms are a \\"mountain form\\" with a shrubby habit, short thin hard leaves, and a squat inflorescence; and a \\"Millbrook Road form\\", with a tree habit and longer, wider, soft leaves. Some horticulturists also recognise an intermediate form. Recent genetic testing has confirmed the existence of three distinct forms, but currently these have no taxonomic status.  Distribution and habitat  Banksia brownii occurs between Albany (35°S) and the Stirling Range (34°24'S) in the southwest of Western Australia, at the juncture of the Esperance Plains, Warren and Jarrah Forest biogeographic regions. This is the taxonomically richest area for Banksia, with 19 species, of which six are endemic, including B. brownii itself. It is cool and wet, with temperatures between four and 30 °C (39–86 °F) and rainfall of around 800 millimetres (31 in). The species occurs there in two distinct population clusters: southern populations occur among low woodland of Eucalyptus marginata (jarrah) in shallow, nutrient-poor white or grey sand over laterite; Stirling Range populations occur at altitudes of between 500 and 1100 metres (1640–3960 ft), among heath on rocky mountain slopes and tops, and in shale in gullies. There are 27 known populations within this region, but only nine of these populations contain more than 10 individual plants, and only five populations have more than 100. Ten populations are now presumed extinct. The total number of plants is estimated at around 1000.  Ecology  Coastal plants begin to flower at around five years from seed, but plants in the Stirling Range take much longer to mature. In one Stirling Range population, only 15% of plants had flowered after eight years. Flowering time is highly variable, but in general it occurs between March and August, with a peak around June. More flowers open during the day than at night. As with other Banksia species, B. brownii is a heavy producer of nectar, and serves as a food source for a range of nectariferous birds, mammals and insects. Honeyeaters such as Phylidonyris novaehollandiae (New Holland honeyeater), Acanthorhynchus superciliosus (western spinebill) and Anthochaera carunculata (red wattlebird) are frequent visitors that often carry heavy pollen loads, making them important pollinators. Nocturnal mammals such as Rattus fuscipes (bush rat) and Tarsipes rostratus (honey possum) also carry heavy pollen loads, but the foraging behaviour of bush rats suggests that these may transfer pollen only over very short distances. Invertebrate visitors include the introduced Apis mellifera (western honeybee), native bees, flies and ants; bees appear to be effective pollinators, but ants and flies forage only at the base of flowers and do not come in contact with plant pollen. The species is partly self-compatible, as some seed is set when pollinators are excluded. Selection against self-pollinated seed has been observed, but the species has nonetheless been shown to have one of the lowest outcrossing rates of any Banksia. This is probably caused by the small population sizes, which increase the probability of self-fertilisation, and may discourage visits by pollinators. It has a low rate of fruiting, with less than 1% of flowers developing into follicles, and more than half of the inflorescences failing to form any follicles at all. Seed survival rates are similarly low. Department of Environment and Conservation. More than half of a plant's seed crop may be lost to the larvae of moths and weevils, which burrow into the cobs to eat the seeds and pupate in the follicles; and further seed losses are caused by granivorous birds such as cockatoos, which break off the cobs to eat both the seeds and the insect larvae. A small proportion of follicles open and release their seed spontaneously, but most remain closed until stimulated to open by bushfire. Bushfire kills the maternal plant, which has neither thick bark nor lignotubers, but the subsequent shedding of seed allows the population to regenerate. Seed predation continues after its release: in one study, B. brownii seeds were placed on the ground in both burnt and unburnt sides; almost all were eaten by parrots within four weeks.  Conservation  Threats to B. brownii include loss of habitat due to land clearing, commercial exploitation, disease, and changes to the fire regime. The fragmentation of populations is also of concern, as it causes the genetic diversity of the species to decline, potentially reducing vigour. Climate change is also of concern: depending on the severity of change, the range of this species is predicted to contract by 30% to 50% by 2080. B. brownii has been assessed as having a very high risk of extinction. It is estimated that without protective measures in place, it would be extinct within a decade; and that extinction would be \\"not only a tragedy in itself but may have unforeseen, and potentially disastrous, consequences for the functioning of the vegetation communities of which feather-leaved banksia is an integral part.\\" The species has not yet been formally assessed for the IUCN Red List, but warrants a \\"Critically Endangered (CR)\\" ranking because populations are projected to decline by more than 80% within the next three generations. It is currently listed as \\"Endangered\\" under Australia's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act), and \\"Rare\\" under Western Australia's Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. These acts provide legislative protection against a range of potential threats, including commercial harvesting of flowers and land clearing. Further statutory protection is afforded by the fact that populations occur within the Eastern Stirling Range Montane Heath and Thicket threatened ecological community, which is listed as \\"Endangered\\" under the EPBC Act, and the Montane Mallee Thicket of the Stirling Range threatened ecology community, which has been assessed as \\"Endangered\\" by the Western Australian government; and by the presence of northern population within the Stirling Range National Park. A five-year interim management plan was put in place by the Western Australia's Department of Environment and Conservation in October 2005. Actions under that plan include regular monitoring of populations, management of the threats of fire and P. cinnamomi, and the cold storage of seed. As of December 2009 a recovery plan is being developed. There is also a translocation project underway.  Disease  The main threat to B. brownii is dieback caused by the introduced plant pathogen P. cinnamomi, a soil-borne water mould that causes root rot. Studies of the effect of P. cinnamomi on B. brownii have found it to be \\"highly susceptible\\" to dieback, with specimens \\"frequently and consistently killed in the wild\\". As of 2007, all major populations of B. brownii, and all but one minor population, are suffering from dieback. Moreover, all populations are in an area vulnerable to dieback, so even the uninfected population is considered under threat. According to Byron Lamont, \\"the demise of this species in the wild appears imminent.\\" A number of protective measures have been implemented, including site access restrictions, the collection and cold-storage of seed, and the treatment of plants with phosphite. Phosphite boosts the resistance of both infected and uninfected plants, and also acts as a direct fungicide. Aerial spraying of phosphite boosts plant survival and slows the spread of infection, but must be carefully managed as studies have shown that foliar spraying of phosphite adversely affects root and shoot growth. Direct injection of phosphite into the stem of each tree appears to lack this disadvantage, but is costly to administer and restricted to known plants. Other diseases to which B. brownii is vulnerable include the parasitic fungus Armillaria luteobubalina and the aerial canker fungus Zythiostroma.  Fire regime  Because B. brownii releases its seed in response to bushfire, it is important that fires occur at intervals that allow the plants to generate plenty of viable seed. The optimum fire interval is around 18 years. If fire occurs too frequently, plants are burned before reaching maturity or before they have produced sufficient seed to ensure regeneration of the population. This may cause populations to decline, or even local extinction. Too-infrequent fire also causes population decline, as more plants die of natural attrition without releasing their seed, resulting in seed wastage.  Ex situ conservation measures  Because of the difficulty of conserving B. brownii in its present disease-exposed locations, it is an especially suitable candidate for ex situ conservation measures, such as the cold-storage of seed, and the translocation of plants to disease-free locations. Seed of B. brownii has been collected by Western Australia's Threatened Flora Seed Centre, and placed in cold-storage both in Perth and at Kew's Millennium Seed Bank. This includes seed collected from populations that have since become extinct. In 2008, some of this seed was germinated, and seedlings were planted at a location near Albany. Genetic analysis of the seedlings revealed some genetic diversity that was not present in any extant population. The conservation of these seeds had thus preserved some of the species' genetic diversity that would otherwise have been lost through population extinction, providing a powerful example of the importance of seed banking to conservation efforts. A seed orchard was planted in 2007, and by 2010 this had yielded over 400 disease-free, healthy plants, some of which had grown more than three times the rate of those in the wild. A 2007 seedling flowered for the first time at Wakehurst Place in February 2011.  Cultivation  Cut flower spikes from Banksia brownii With large metallic red inflorescences and attractive feathery leaves that are perhaps the softest of all Banksia species, B. brownii is highly valued by Australia's horticultural and cut flower industries. Seeds and plants are readily available in Australian nurseries, and it is widely cultivated in areas not exposed to dieback. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 20 to 50 days to germinate. The plant prefers a sheltered position in soil with good drainage, and must be provided with moisture over summer. It grows quickly, but takes several years to flower. Once established, it is frost-tolerant and tolerates light pruning not below the green foliage. The flowers are attractive in late bud, but lose their colour as soon as they open. Because they are usually surrounded by branchlets, they may be partly hidden by foliage. The main obstacle to cultivation is the species' extreme sensitivity to dieback, which is widespread in suburban gardens. However, the species has been successfully grafted onto a rootstock of B. integrifolia (coast banksia), which renders it hardy on a range of soils.

The Delaware Bay Division is located in Middle Township and extends along five miles of Delaware Bay.... The Two Mile Beach Unit is a barrier island with beachfront, tidal ponds and maritime forest in Lower Township.\\" Located in the Middle Atlantic coastal forests ecoregion, the cape provides habitat for large numbers of migratory birds. Wildlife Cape May National Wildlife Refuge provides critical habitat to a wide variety of migratory birds and other wildlife. It supports 317 bird species, 42 mammal species, 55 reptile and amphibian species, and numerous fish, shellfish and other invertebrates. Its value for the protection of migratory birds and their habitat will continue to grow as wildlife habitat along the Jersey Shore is developed into roads, shopping centers and housing developments. Cape May Peninsula's unique configuration and location concentrate songbirds, raptors and woodcock as they funnel south to Cape May Point during their fall migration. Faced with of water to cross at the Delaware Bay migrants linger in the area to rest and feed until favorable winds allow them to cross the Bay or head north along the Bay's eastern shore. Shorebirds The refuge's five-mile stretch along the Delaware Bay is a major resting and feeding area for migrating shorebirds and wading birds each spring. The Delaware Bay shoreline has gained international recognition as a major shorebird staging area in North America second only to the Copper River Delta in Alaska. Each year hundreds of thousands of shorebirds-nearly 80 percent of some populations-stop to rest and feed here during their spring migration from Central and South America to their Arctic breeding grounds. The arrival at Cape May of more than twenty shorebird species-primarily red knots, ruddy turnstones, sanderlings and semipalmated sandpipers-coincides with the horseshoe crab spawning season which occurs in May/early June. The crab eggs provide an abundant food supply which these long-distance flyers use to replenish their energy reserves before moving on. (In May large numbers of red knots gather along Delaware Bay beaches.) In 1992, because of its value to migrating shorebirds and wading birds, it was designated a Wetland of International Importance as part of the Delaware Bay Estuary. Songbirds / Neotropical migrants Neotropical migrants—birds that spend their summers in Canada and the U.S. and their winters in Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America and South America—use Cape May Peninsula's varied habitats in great abundance during their long and difficult migrations. Due to loss of habitat throughout much of their range many of these species are in decline. Almost 100 neotropical songbird species stop to rest and feed along the Cape May Peninsula most often using forest habitats. Many songbird species also nest here including ovenbirds, wood thrushes and yellow-throated warblers. Raptors Cape May Peninsula is renowned for its spectacular raptor migrations each fall. During this period great numbers of 17 raptor species are commonly seen including peregrine falcons, ospreys, northern harriers, American kestrels, Cooper's and sharp-shinned hawks. Because many raptors do not choose to cross such large bodies of water as the Delaware Bay, many use the bayshore upland forest edge as a migration corridor. All raptor species found in southern New Jersey occur on the refuge. Some, like the red-tailed hawk, frequent the refuge all year. After a population decline in the 1970s, bald eagles once again nest on refuge land. Owl populations make extensive use of Cape May's woodland habitats in winter, and several species—such as the barred owl—also nest here. American woodcock Varied habitat, forest and marsh During fall migration these unique upland shorebirds concentrate in massive numbers in Cape May's moist woodlands and thickets. They use such habitats for foraging, replenishing their fat reserves by eating more than their weight in earthworms daily. On the East Coast of the United States, only Cape Charles, Virginia hosts comparable concentrations of woodcock. The refuge provides excellent resting and feeding habitat for this interesting species. Endangered and threatened species The threatened piping plover uses Two Mile Beach Unit for feeding and roosting. New Jersey State-listed species confirmed within the refuge boundary include ospreys, short-eared owls, barred owls, red-shouldered hawks, grasshopper sparrows, great and little blue herons, red-headed woodpeckers, sedge wrens, yellow-crowned night-herons, northern harriers, black rails, southern gray tree frogs, eastern tiger and mud salamanders, corn snakes and northern pine snakes. Swamp pink—a unique lily family member which is on the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Plants and Animals—also occurs on the refuge, as do 34 state-listed plant species. Fishery resources Cape May National Wildlife Refuge's marshes and tidal creeks provide important nursery areas and nutrient resources for many popular species of finfish and shellfish including summer flounder, weakfish, striped bass, blue crabs and lady crabs. These fisheries provide abundant resources for wildlife as well as for people. Seventy percent of the species sought by recreational and commercial fishermen depend on shallow water habitats such as those found on the refuge for at least part of their life cycle.

Though the full dates of his reign are unknown, it is known that he reigned around the year 550. From his reading of the Ta Prohm Stèle, George Coedès understood a lady named Kambuja-raja-lakshmi to have been Bhavavarman's queen, and that it was through her that he inherited the royal lineage. Coedès thought he was also very likely the grandson of the king of Funan, a neighbouring and more powerful Cambodian kingdom. However subsequent research by the epigraphist Claude Jacques revealed that Kambuja- raja-lakshmi was the queen of another king, Harshavarman I, who reigned in 910–923 AD, long after the Funan period and so she could not have passed on the royal lineage to Bhavavarman. According to Coedès, the main accomplishment of Bhavavarman's reign was the expansion of Kamboja into the Mekong river valley, attacking both Funan. The reasons for these attacks are not clear, but most likely revolve around the accession of Rudravarman to the Funan throne; Rudravarman killed the legitimate heir to the throne, and Bhavavarman may have seen himself as a rightful member of that lineage. It is not clear, however, if he wanted to claim the throne of Funan for himself, or to simply see Rudravarman unseated so that the next legitimate heir could take it. He was succeeded by his brother, Chitrasena, who took the reign name Mahendravarman.Higham, C., 2014, Early Mainland Southeast Asia, Bangkok: River Books Co., Ltd., Chinese records of the time indicate that Chitrasena was responsible for the conquest of Funan. The Chinese records also indicate that, around this time, the king of Funan was replaced, and that the new king was a 'wicked king' who did not support Buddhism. Bhavavarman belonged to the traditional Shivaite religion of Kamboja.

Education Bilbul studied in English at the Shammash and Alliance schools in Iraq. He graduated in 1938 and continued on to study economics and business. After emigrating to Israel in 1951, he majored in law and economics at the University of Tel Aviv, graduating from there some five later.Berg, 1996, p. 35. Career Bilbul published his first book of short stories in 1938.Rejwan, 2004, p. xvi. Entitled Al-Jamrah al-Ūla (\\"The first coal\\"), he described it as the only belletristic book published in Iraq that year. In the introduction to the book, he writes of his desire for, \\"Iraq to unfurl the banner of literature,\\" a statement interpreted by Nancy Berg as a declaration of his intent to form part of the Arab literary renaissance (known as the nahda).Berg, 1996, p. 38. Bilbul worked as a clerk in the Baghdad Chamber of Commerce, whose president between 1938 and 1945 was another poet, Meir Basri. He and Basri revived the muwashshahat, strophic forms of poetry that were popular in Andalusia. Between 1945 and 1951, Bilbul edited the Chamber's monthly journal and wrote its annual report. He wrote literary articles, as well as articles on economics and business which were published in Iraq and Egypt. Both Basri and Bilbul also wrote Shakespearean sonnets. One of Bilbul's most popular short stories was Sura Tibq al-Asl, which is included in many anthologies. Expressive of the school of social realism, of which he was considered a pioneer, it tells the story of a midwife called to confirm the pregnancy of a young woman who is then murdered by her brother to restore the family's honor. The story is critical of the traditional practice of honor killings.Berg, p. 36. It is the only story known to have been subject to pre- publication editing in Iraq, where such a practice was wholly uncommon. After two Muslim brothers who worked at the printing press expressed being offended by the assigning of obviously Muslim names to the two primitive and cruel characters in the book, while the midwife was given a common Jewish name, Bilbul changed all the names to more neutral ones to please his friends.Berg, 1996, p. 62. Reflective of his desire to present authentic accounts and to reach the masses, much of the dialogue in Bilbul's stories was written in colloquial Arabic. Praised for his short-story technique, focus and unity, and social realism, he was also criticized for naivete, lack of originality, and weakness in characterization. He is nevertheless cited as one of the 21 most important novel and short story writers from the period between 1920 and 1955. Like other Jewish writers in Iraq in the 1930s and 1940s, his literary works were targeted toward a wide audience, were influenced by both Western and Islamic traditions, and he wrote not as a Jew, but as an Iraqi. He continued to write in Arabic after his emigration to Israel in 1951.Berg, 1996, p. 50.

Levitt received the 2013 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, together with Martin Karplus and Arieh Warshel, for \\"the development of multiscale models for complex chemical systems\\". Early life and education Michael Levitt was born in Pretoria, South Africa, to a Jewish family from Plungė, Lithuania; his father was from Lithuania and his mother from the Czech Republic. He attended Sunnyside Primary School and then Pretoria Boys High School between 1960 and 1962. The family moved to England when he was 15. Levitt spent 1963 studying applied mathematics at the University of Pretoria. He attended King's College London, graduating with a first-class honours degree in Physics in 1967. In 1967, he visited Israel for the first time. Together with his Israeli wife, Rina, a multimedia artist, he left to study at Cambridge, where their three children were born. Levitt was a PhD student in Computational biology at Peterhouse, Cambridge, and was based at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology from 1968 to 1972, where he developed a computer program for studying the conformations of molecules that underpinned much of his later work. Career and research In 1979, he returned to Israel and conducted research at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, becoming an Israeli citizen in 1980. He served in the Israel Defense Forces for six weeks in 1985. In 1986, he began teaching at Stanford University, and since then has split his time between Israel and California. He went on to gain a research fellowship at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. From 1980 to 1987, he was Professor of Chemical Physics at the Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot.

Career=University of Liverpool His research into crystal structures using x-ray diffraction became his primary research interest, and in this research he teamed up with Arnold Beevers and sought advice from Professor Lawrence Bragg (who had established a major crystallographic centre in Manchester). Whilst at Liverpool, and without significant funding Beevers and Lipson made most of their own equipment and invented an aid to calculation, Beevers-Lipson Strips, which were widely used in the days before computers and which made their names well known within the field. University of Cambridge In 1936, Bragg invited Lipson to move to Manchester, and he later followed Bragg in moves to Teddington and then, when Bragg became Cavendish Professor in 1937, to Cambridge. In Teddington in 1937 he married Jenny Rosenthal (23 January 1910 – 2009) Beevers–Lipson strips, co- invented with Arnold Beevers, at the Museum of the History of Science, Oxford, part of the Crystals special exhibition in 2014. In practical terms, Lipson was in charge of the crystallography group in Cambridge, and took on a key role in nurturing young scientists. Whilst at the Cavendish he became convinced by contact with P. P. Ewald of the importance of the Fourier transform in X-ray crystallography. Manchester Institute of Science and Technology He was awarded a Liverpool DSc in 1939 and a Cambridge MA in 1942, but he never really integrated into University of Cambridge life and he moved to the Manchester College of Technology (later University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology) in 1945 as head of the physics department. The position carried no title or status, but under his direction it quickly became a world centre for crystallographic research pioneering optical approaches to x-ray diffraction based on the Fourier transform. In 1954 he was made a professor and in 1957 he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society. He officially retired in 1977 but remained active in the department. Lipson had a strong belief in the social responsibility of scientists, was an active member of Scientists against Nuclear Arms and was twice president of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society. He was appointed a CBE in 1976. Family He had three children Ann (b. 1938), Stephen (b. 1941) and Judith (b. 1943). The death of his youngest daughter from leukaemia in 1990 devastated Henry. In 1991 the Lipsons were on a family visit to Haifa, Israel, where their son was Professor of Physics at the Technion. He suffered a heart attack and died on 26 April of that year. Evolution Lipson was a proponent of evolutionary creation. He authored a paper A Physicist Looks at Evolution which was widely quote-mined by creationists.\\"The Quote Mine Project\\". Talk.Origins. Lipson was a critic of Darwinism but did not deny that species have evolved. The New Scientist quoted him as saying \\"I do not accept the Genesis account of creation as anything more than pleasing fantasy. My idea of creation is much subtler, but since it is not scientific (in the sense that it cannot be tested) I shall not expound it here.\\"Cherfas, Jeremy. (1982).

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1954, following breakthrough research with his assistant Kenneth E Machin identifying the electric field generated by the African Knife fish (Gymnarchus), and the uses which the fish makes of it. He was Reader, Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge, 1966–1977, then Reader Emeritus, and Director, Sub-Department of Animal Behaviour, 1969–1977. Life=Early years Hans Werner Lissmann was born into a wealthy German family in Mykolaiv, Ukraine which was then part of Russia. As members of the ethnic German minority the family fell under suspicion when war broke out in 1914. Lissmann and his elder brother were sent into \\"internal exile\\" in Siberia, separated from their parents, Robert and Ebba Lissmann. At the end of the war they were permitted to return home, but by 1922 the family had relocated to Hamburg in Germany, which is where Lissmann received his school- level education. Hamburg and Cambridge At the end of the 1920s he moved on to study Biology at Hamburg University. Next he worked under Jakob von Uexküll at the Hamburg Institute for Environmental Research. He received his doctorate in 1932 for work on the Siamese fighting fish. In 1933 he was sent with a travel bursary to the Hungarian Scientific Academy's biological research station at Lake Balaton. While he was there Germany underwent significant régime change. Lissmann rejected a government requirement that he should disseminate Nazi propaganda and instead chose to relocate again. He made his way to India. Here he obtained a stipendium from the recently established Academic Assistance Council which enabled him to travel to Great Britain and to obtain, in 1934, a post in the Research Department of the Cambridge University Zoological Institute, headed up by James Gray. The focus of his research during his early Cambridge years was on the interplay between the movements sequencing, the sensory organs and the nervous systems of animals. After his emigration, the police authorities in Nazi Germany identified Lissmann as a public enemy. Early in 1940 the German Security Services included him on the Special \\"British\\" list of more than 2,000 individuals who should, as a top priority, be picked out, arrested and detained by a special detachment of SS commandos, following any successful invasion and occupation of the British Isles.Lissmann's entry on the \\"Sonderfahndungsliste G.B.\\" (reproduced on the website of the Imperial War Museum in London) Fish and electricity Lissman noticed that the African knife fish, Gymnarchus niloticus, could swim equally well forwards or backwards, implying a \\"sixth sense\\", which he went on to investigate in detail. A particularly important research finding took place in 1950. The previous year, on a visit to London Zoo, Lissmann had noticed that the African knife fish (Gymnarchus) was able repeatedly to swim backwards at the same speed and with exactly the same corporeal dexterity around obstacles in its fish tank as when it swam forwards, while avoiding collision. He inferred that the fish must have what in human terms would be seen as some form of \\"sixth sense\\", something which he also thought he detected in the electric eel in another aquarium tank nearby: he thought the phenomenon might well involve electricity. Towards the end of 1949 Lissmann married, and as a wedding present from one friend he was given his own knife fish, which he now went on to study in his laboratory. He placed the fish in a large fish tank into which he inserted electrodes. With these he was indeed able to detect a naturally occurring electric current emanating from the fish, albeit a current far too weak to be felt by a person. He then found ways to increase the current to a point where it could be measured with a conventional oscilloscope. One story - not universally accepted - reports that the fish generated a measurably increased electrical charge when a student combed her hair beside the fish tank. The fish died soon after this, but replacements were acquired, and working with his exceptionally capable research assistant Kenneth E Machin (1924-1988), whose PhD had covered radio-astronomy, Lissmann was able, through observation and measurement, to demonstrate that the variable electrical charge was produced by the knife fish itself, and that the fish reacted to any change in the electric field around it, even when produced close to, but outside, the fish tank itself. They were helped in their work by a perspex model of an African knife fish constructed by Ken Machin, with two electrodes attached to it permitting the perspex fish to generate an electric field equivalent to that produced by the real fish. Machin struggled and failed to produce for the perspex fish an intricate variability in the strength and shape of its magnetic field comparable to the produced by the real fish, but observations involving the perspex fish nevertheless provided a large additional amount of valuable data. A key conclusion was that the African knife fish was using changes in resistance within the electric field with which it surrounded itself to detect changes in its surroundings, and was using the information to trigger appropriate behavioural responses. Personal Hans Lissmann married Corinne Ceresole Foster-Barham at Cambridge in 1949. Their son Martin, an amateur flautist, became a physician in Essex.

A bishop since 1971, Casaldàliga was one of the best-known exponents of liberation theology. He received numerous awards, including the Catalonia International Prize in 2006. He was a forceful advocate in support of indigenous peoples and published several volumes of poetry. Biography=Beginnings Pere Casaldàliga was born on 16 February 1928 in Balsareny, Catalonia, Spain, and grew up on his family's cattle ranch. He joined the Claretians, entering the Claretian Seminary of Vic at the age of nine. He was ordained a priest in Barcelona on 31 May 1952. Casaldàliga moved to Brazil as a missionary in 1968. On 27 April 1970, Pope Paul VI named him Apostolic Administrator of the Territorial Prelature of São Félix. On 27 August 1971, Pope Paul named him prelate of that jurisdiction and titular bishop of Altava. He received his episcopal consecration on 23 October from Fernando Gomes dos Santos, Archbishop of Goiânia. Brazilian dictatorship In the 1970s, the military regime ruling Brazil tried without success to force Casaldàliga to leave the country. His advocacy for indigenous peoples and peasants resulted in repeated death threats, and in 1976 a priest was killed standing alongside him at a march protesting the mistreatment of female prisoners. In the 1980s, he refused to make the required ad limina visits to Rome that bishops normally make every five years. He said he feared not being able to re-enter Brazil and said \\"The visits were bureaucratic and formal and did not lead to proper dialogue.\\" Casaldàliga co-founded the in 1972, an organ of the Episcopal Conference of Brazil that fights for the right to cultural diversity of indigenous peoples to strengthen its autonomy. In 1986, Casaldàliga founded a pilgrimage, Romería de los Mártires, held every five years. It centers on the site where Jesuit João Bosco Bernier was killed at Casaldáliga's side on 11 October 1976, the Sanctuary of the Martyrs of the \\"Caminhada\\". Liberation theology movement and friction with the Vatican In June 1988, as part of a Vatican effort to place restrictions on the liberation theology movement and following its 1985 silencing of Brazilian theologian Leonardo Boff, Casaldáliga was called to Rome to be examined by Cardinals Joseph Ratzinger and Bernadin Gantin on his theological writings and pastoral activity. The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) and the Congregation of Bishops produced a statement for him to sign as an acknowledgment of his errors. The statement decreed that he would not add political content to processions, would accept restrictions on his theological work, and only say Mass or preach outside of Brazil, especially in Nicaragua, with permission from the local bishop. He did not sign it. He summarized his views: \\"My attitude is a reflection of the view of the church in many regions of the world... I have criticized the Curia over the way bishops are chosen, over the minimal space given to women, over its distrust of liberation theology and bishops' conferences, over its excessive centralism. This does not mean a break with Rome. Within the family of the church and through dialogue, we need to open up more space.\\" Later years Pope John Paul II accepted Casaldàliga's resignation on 2 February 2005. Anticipating the appointment of his successor, he objected that it would happen without the people of the prelature being consulted. In retirement he continued to live in São Félix do Araguaia, and work as an ordinary priest under his successors. When the CDF criticized the work of theologian Jon Sobrino of El Salvador in 2007, Casaldáliga responded with an open letter asking that the Church confirm its “real commitment to the service of God’s poor\\" and acknowledge \\"the link between faith and politics\\". He had Parkinson's disease since at least 2012; he referred to it as \\"Brother Parkinson\\". In 2015, Pope Francis consulted Casaldàliga, among others, during the writing of the encyclical Laudato si'. Death threats Casaldàliga was the target of death threats, and even assassination attempts, throughout his life. In 1993 Amnesty International showed concern for the safety of Bishop Casaldàliga when landowners hired gunmen to kill him. In December 2012, Casaldàliga had to flee his home, and the Federal Police hid him for two months after he received death threats from landowners from the region when he helped the Xavante people regain their land. Death On 4 August 2020, Casaldàliga was admitted to the hospital for respiratory problems, being very weak due to his advanced state of Parkinson's disease. He tested negative for COVID-19. Casaldàliga died on 8 August 2020, in Batatais, in the state of São Paulo.

In the early Middle Ages, when such households were established, most court officials had either domestic or military duties; the monarch's closest advisers were those who served in the household. However, as time went by, most of these positions became hereditary, and their role in the running of the household was gradually eroded. In England, for instance, the Lord Great ChamberlainBruce, Alistair, Keepers of the Kingdom (Cassell, 2002), and the Earl Marshal were originally responsible for the running of the royal household and the royal stables respectively; however, from the late medieval period onwards, their roles became largely honorary, their places in the household being taken by the Lord Chamberlain and the Master of the Horse.

A courier car would then attempt to rendezvous with the armoured car to transfer the heroin, and the armoured car would then flee the city. Other courier cars would act as decoys. Players could elect to wait until the drug transfer was complete before intercepting the armoured car, or instead attempt to find the one genuine courier car in order to prevent the transfer from taking place. Once a drug dealer's car is found it can either be followed, destroyed with the Esprit's built-in machine gun, or repeatedly rammed until it surrenders. Different cars may need to be dealt with in different ways; for example armoured cars must be rammed as shooting has no effect, whereas randomly occurring \\"hit cars\\" are the only other vehicles that can match the Esprit for speed, so ramming them is more difficult. Following a drug dealer's car too closely may arouse suspicion and cause them to abort their mission. Points are scored by apprehending the criminals. Additional points are awarded if they are captured alive (by disabling their car rather than destroying it), and if the heroin transfer has taken place (as there is now greater evidence of their crime). Penalties are incurred for hitting scenery or other cars, and the player's car is likely to explode if it crashes into anything while travelling fast. As in real life, speeding greatly increases risk.Turbo Esprit review, CRASH, issue 28, pages 114-115. Newsfield Publications Ltd, 1986. Environment Traffic stops at the lights (Amstrad CPC version). The game features four free-roaming cities (Wellington, Gamesborough, Minster and Romford) through which the player may drive as they see fit.Turbo Esprit review, Your Sinclair, issue 6, pages 20-21. Dennis Publishing, 1986. Each city features a grid plan of roads, and each is progressively more difficult; the first city contains many six lane motorway-like roads making speeding and dodging traffic easy, whereas the later ones have more two-lane and one-way roads. The cities contain many computer-controlled cars, all of which obey basic traffic laws, such as keeping below a set speed limit, stopping at the working traffic lights, moving out of the way of obstacles such as roadworks, and attempting to avoid head-on collisions with the player. They will also stop at zebra crossings to allow waiting pedestrians to cross the road. Contact with or destruction of these cars results in score penalties. The player's car can also run out of fuel, and so the player must stop at petrol stations to refill. The Spanish version claims it to be set in the city of Manhattan,Turbo Esprit review, Microhobby (Spain), issue 76, page 15. April 1986. despite the fact that no changes were made to the game itself, which retains its British-style road markings and driving on the left.

It was developed with the cooperation of Lotus Cars Ltd., who provided \\"technical assistance\\".Turbo Esprit press advertisement, 1986, at World of Spectrum. Reception Turbo Esprit was generally well received by the gaming press, gaining positive reviews from most major gaming magazines. Sinclair User called it \\"one of the best games ever released\\",Turbo Esprit budget re-release review, Sinclair User, issue 86, page 56.

The Spectrum version was voted number 64 in the Your Sinclair Readers' Top 100 Games of All Time.

He introduced the relativistically invariant Mandelstam variables into particle physics in 1958 as a convenient coordinate system for formulating his double dispersion relations. The double dispersion relations were a central tool in the bootstrap program which sought to formulate a consistent theory of infinitely many particle types of increasing spin. Early life Mandelstam was born in Johannesburg,Array of Contemporary American Physicists South Africa to a Jewish family.William D. Rubinstein, Michael Jolles, Hilary L. Rubinstein, The Palgrave Dictionary of Anglo-Jewish History, Palgrave Macmillan (2011), p. 110 Work Mandelstam, along with Tullio Regge, did the initial development of the Regge theory of strong interaction phenomenology. He reinterpreted the analytic growth rate of the scattering amplitude as a function of the cosine of the scattering angle as the power law for the falloff of scattering amplitudes at high energy. Along with the double dispersion relations, Regge theory allowed theorists to find sufficient analytic constraints on scattering amplitudes of bound states to formulate a theory in which there are infinitely many particle types, none of which are fundamental. After Veneziano constructed the first tree-level scattering amplitude describing infinitely many particle types, what was recognized almost immediately as a string scattering amplitude, Mandelstam continued to make crucial contributions. He interpreted the Virasoro algebra discovered in consistency conditions as a geometrical symmetry of a world- sheet conformal field theory, formulating string theory in terms of two dimensional quantum field theory. He used the conformal invariance to calculate tree level string amplitudes on many worldsheet domains. Mandelstam was the first to explicitly construct the fermion scattering amplitudes in the Ramond and Neveu–Schwarz sectors of superstring theory, and later gave arguments for the finiteness of string perturbation theory. In quantum field theory, Mandelstam and independently Sidney Coleman extended work of Tony Skyrme to show that the two dimensional quantum Sine-Gordon model is equivalently described by a Thirring model whose fermions are the kinks. He also demonstrated that the 4d N=4 supersymmetric gauge theory is power counting finite, proving that this theory is scale invariant to all orders of perturbation theory, the first example of a field theory where all the infinities in Feynman diagrams cancel. Among his students at Berkeley are Joseph Polchinski, Michio Kaku, Charles Thorn and Hessamaddin Arfaei. Stanley Mandelstam died in his Berkeley apartment in June, 2016.

But he decided to switch codes and joined the Sydney Roosters rugby league club. His brother Clay is a shot put. Rugby league career Cross made his first-grade debut on 17 April 1998, scoring two tries against the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. After a promising start to his league career, including an appearance at centre in the 2000 NRL Grand Final, the Roosters' first in 20 years, he had two serious leg injuries. A broken leg saw him miss much of the 2001 NRL season. Just a few matches into the 2002 NRL season he suffered a major knee injury that kept him out for the remainder of that year. That season, Sydney Roosters won the Premiership, their first in 27 years. Cross returned in the 2003 NRL season, finishing as the club's leading try-scorer. He played at centre in the Roosters' loss to the Panthers in the 2003 NRL Grand Final. In 2004 Cross was chosen to represent City Origin. He then went on to play for the Roosters at centre in their loss to cross-Sydney rivals the Bulldogs in the 2004 NRL Grand Final. In 2005 Cross was again chosen to represent City Origin. He was suspended for six weeks for eye- gouging Parramatta's Glenn Morrison in a match which the Roosters won 12–8. His absence proved costly for the Roosters as they just missed the finals that year. Cross was named the 2005 Sydney Roosters season player of the year. In June 2006, after a period of speculation and rumour, Cross signed a two-year deal with the Australian Rugby Union and went to Perth to play for the new Super Rugby side, the Western Force. Cross left the Roosters as the fifth- highest try scorer in the club's history, with 85 tries from his 143 matches. He also played in three losing Grand Finals for the club. Rugby union career Cross made his debut Super Rugby with the Western Force on 2 February 2007, against the Highlanders. He went on to play every match that season and scored three tries. After an outstanding 2008 Super 14 season, in which he won The West Australian/Rosendorff Emirates Western Force Player of the Year Award, Cross was called up for national duty by new Wallabies coach Robbie Deans. He scored his first Wallaby try against France at the Suncorp Stadium, Brisbane in his second test on 5 July 2008, having come on as a Second-Half replacement. He followed this with another try later on in the game, both came from Matt Giteau passes. Ryan Cross got his full test debut against New Zealand on 26 July in place of the injured Stirling Mortlock. He scored the first try which contributed to the 34–19 victory over the All Blacks. In 2011 Cross signed with the NSW Waratahs and played in 15 matches during the 2011 Super Rugby season. After playing off the bench in the first few matches, Cross then played the remaining matches as the regular starting centre, including the semi final loss to the Auckland Blues in Auckland. At the conclusion of the 2011 Super Rugby season Cross signed for USA Perpignan in the French Top 14. The 3-month contract was cover for centres David Marty and Maxime Mermoz who were on 2011 Rugby World Cup duty with the French team who lost the final to host team New Zealand.

It has an area of 53.48 km². Although it contains several low peaks, the land of Apo- eup also contains a great deal of flat and fertile floodplain; local agriculture is dominated by rice cultivation. The small Gamcheon river runs along the eastern border. As of January 2005, the population is 8,799, and has fallen somewhat since 1995. It is divided among 30 ri. The region first enters historical records in the Proto–Three Kingdoms period, when it successfully rebelled against the local polity of Gammun-guk. It appears as part of Unified Silla in 757, when it made up two myeon in Gaeryeong-hyeon: Dong-myeon and Apo-myeon. This situation continued for more than a thousand years, until the massive reorganization of Korea's local governments in 1914, at which time the two myeon were united into the present-day entity of Apo-eup. Apo-eup was originally part of Gimcheon County; when the county was split into Gimcheon City and Geumneung County in 1949, it became part of Geumneung County. With the reunification of city and county in 1995, Apo-eup became part of Gimcheon once more. Apo-eup is located near the heart of the national transportation grid. The junction of the Gyeongbu Expressway and Jungbu Naeryuk Expressways is located in Apo-eup. The Gyeongbu Line railroad also passes through the eup. Although there are two stations along the railroad, Apo Station and Daesin Station, they are not served by regular trains.

Life  Born in Islington, London, he was descended from Raphael Meldola (1754–1828), a theologian who was acting minister of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews in London, 1804. Meldola was the only son of Samuel Meldola; married (1886) Ella Frederica, daughter of Maurice Davis of London. He was educated in chemistry at the Royal College of Chemistry, London. There is a portrait of Meldola (oil on canvas) by Solomon J. Solomon in the Royal Society collection; also a photograph by Maull & Fox, visiting card size.  Career  Meldola worked in the private laboratory of John Stenhouse (FRS 1848). He was appointed Lecturer, Royal College of Science (1872) and assisted Norman Lockyer with spectroscopy. Meldola was in charge of the British Eclipse Expedition to the Nicobar Islands (1875) and was Professor of Chemistry, Technical College, Finsbury (1885). He was also an entomologist and natural historian. Meldola was a member of many scientific societies: Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society; Fellow of the Institute of Chemistry; Fellow of the Chemical Society (London and Berlin); Member of the Pharmaceutical Society; The Geologists Association; The Royal Anthropological Institute; Entomological Society of London. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1886 (Charles Darwin was one of his proposers), awarded the Davy Medal in 1913, and was Vice-President of the Council from 1914–1915. Meldola was President of the Entomological Society, 1895–1897; the Chemical Society, 1905–1907; Society of Dyers and Colourists, 1907–1910; Society of Chemical Industry 1908-1909; Institute of Chemistry, 1912–1915. He was the first president of the Maccabaeans, 1891–1915. In his honour the Royal Society of Chemistry award the Meldola medal each year.  Mimicry  Meldola was a keen naturalist, spending five years eagerly collecting evidence on mimicry in butterflies, inspired by Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species. His work provided evidence for natural selection, acknowledged by the evolutionary zoologist Edward Bagnall Poulton in his book The Colours of Animals and thanked by Darwin for information on hexadactyly (a rare case of a person having six digits on each limb).  Inventions  He discovered the synthetic dye Meldola's Blue.

He was a great-great-grandson of Saul Mendelssohn, the younger brother of philosopher Moses Mendelssohn.nndb.com. Retrieved 4 May 2009. He received a doctorate in physics from the University of Berlin, having studied under Max Planck, Walther Nernst, Erwin Schrödinger, and Albert Einstein. Leaving Germany at the advent of the Nazi regime in 1933, he went to England. He worked at the University of Oxford from 1933. He was Reader in Physics there, 1955–1973, Emeritus Reader, 1973; Emeritus Professorial Fellow of Wolfson College, Oxford, 1973 (Professorial Fellow, 1971–1973). His scientific work included low temperature physics, transuranic elements, and medical physics. He was awarded the Royal Society's Hughes Medal in 1967 and the Simon Memorial Prize in 1968. In 1974, he published The Riddle of the Pyramids, in which he sought to explain the whys and wherefores of the earliest Egyptian pyramids. Though Mendelssohn himself was not an Egyptologist, the book builds on advice from experts like Sir Robert Mond and Walter Emery, as well as his own visits to Egypt and Mexico. His principal thesis was that the pyramid at Meidum had collapsed during construction, a conclusion he arrived at using his knowledge of physics and which was sparked in 1966 by images of the Aberfan disaster, where Mendelssohn saw similarities to the rubble mound surrounding the Meidum pyramid, a primary destination for his travel to Egypt the year before. Working from that conclusion, he further elaborated a theory that pyramid construction in Egypt took on a life of its own during the Third and Fourth Dynasties, more or less independently of the reigns of pharaohs. His theory has not been taken up by the Egyptological community, but the book remains a stimulating and detailed study of the Egyptian pyramids. The Pyramid Theory Mendelssohn's pyramid theory suggests explanations to a couple of mysteries in pyramid construction: # Why in the time of the fourth dynasty, when all of the large Egyptian pyramids were built, there were only three Pharaohs but (with Meidum) five pyramids built. # According to Mendelssohn the pyramids were constructed as cenotaphs, not as tombs and did not have to coincide with a Pharaoh's lifetime. # Building of the Great Pyramids must have required a large workforce. Considering the state of perfection these pyramids show, a decisive amount of this workforce must have been highly trained professionals. Furthermore, due to the geometrical constraints, the higher a pyramid grows, the fewer people are able to work on it. If the pyramids were built independently of each other and at distinct times, it would have been necessary to assemble and train the workforce for each building and lay them off as the work continued. According to Mendelssohn, as soon as a pyramid had reached about half its final size, work started on the successor to alleviate this problem. # The change of the angle seen at the Bent Pyramid can be explained as a reaction to a catastrophic collapse of the Meidum Pyramid, if these monuments were not constructed successively but with an overlap.

His father, Samuel Wilkinson Milner, was an agent, or ‘factor’ for the collieries in the district and his mother was Ann Roslington. The Milners had four daughters followed by their only son. When Milner was still young the family moved to Retford, Nottinghamshire. Milner was educated at King Edward VI School. He won the Headmaster's Prize of a microscope, but he quickly moved to studying physics. Milner later attended University College, Bristol where he met his wife Winifred Esther Walker in 1894 as Physics students. They were both active student leaders and helped open the College's Social and Debating Society to both sexes. In 1894–95 Winifred served as Vice-President and Ross as a ccommittee member. By the next year, he was President and she his Vice-President. Milner and Walker both held 1851 Exhibition Scholarships (established by Queen Victoria to support science). Walker graduated in 1898. Milner went on to study for his DSc at the University of Göttingen with Walther Nernst who went on to win a Nobel Prize for Chemistry. In 1952, Milner emigrated with his wife to Sydney, Australia to join their son, Christopher J Milner (1912–1998), who had taken up the position of Chair of Applied Physics at the University of New South Wales. Career Milner worked in plasma physics, studying the electrical conductivity of electrolytes. He developed a mathematical formula for the interionic forces between dissolved ions and solvent. He is best known for the Debye-Milner Plasma Theory. Milner's plasma theory (1912) was used by Debye and Huckel (1923) in developing their theory of electrolytes. Milner's records and papers (1944–64) are held in the National Archives. He was a lecturer at the University of Manchester and later at University of Sheffield from 1917 until his retirement in 1940.

A New South Wales State of Origin representative half back, he played in the National Rugby League for Australian clubs the Canberra Raiders, Sydney Roosters, Parramatta Eels and Melbourne Storm. Finch also played in the Super League for English club the Wigan Warriors (with whom he won the 2010 World Club Challenge and 2011 Challenge Cup Final). Background Born in Maitland, New South Wales, Australia, the son of former player Robert Finch. Finch was educated at Erindale College, where he represented 1998 Australian Schoolboys. He was a Hunter Mariners junior,Hunter Mariners 1908.com playing for Valentine Devils. Playing career At the Canberra Raiders Finch won the club's Rookie of the Year award in 1999. He debuted earlier in that year against the Melbourne Storm in round 14 as a 17-year-old. Finch joined the Sydney Roosters in 2003. As 2002 NRL premiers, the Roosters travelled to England for the 2003 World Club Challenge against Super League champions, St Helens R.F.C.. Finch played from the interchange bench in Sydney's victory. In 2004, whilst playing for the Sydney Roosters, Finch threw a bottle back into the crowd after he was pelted by a Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs fan. Finch played for the Roosters at half back in their 2004 NRL grand final loss to cross-Sydney rivals, Canterbury-Bankstown. Finch played three State of Origin games for New South Wales after crossing from Canberra. His most famous moment was when he was called into the New South Wales squad on the eve of Game 1 of the 2006 State of Origin series. He then turned out to be a hero by scoring a try, setting up two and by kicking the winning field goal to push New South Wales to a famous 17–16 victory at Telstra Stadium. However Finch had a disastrous Game II, and was dropped for the decider which New South Wales lost. They also lost the 2006 series for the first time since 2001. Finch while playing for Parramatta in 2008 The Roosters and Finch agreed on an early termination of his contract, allowing the Parramatta Eels to sign Finch on a two-year deal from the Roosters, commencing from the 2007 season. The Parramatta club then extended his contract to the end of the 2011 season, reportedly to be worth $1 million for 3 years. On 8 April 2009, Parramatta CEO, Denis Fitzgerald, confirmed that Finch would be released from his contract with Parramatta. The contract was not due to expire until the end of the 2011 season. Finch is quoted in media sources as stating that coach Daniel Anderson told him he \\"may not be the right person to take the club forward in the halfback position\\". On 14 April 2009, Finch signed a one-year contract with the Melbourne Storm, his fourth club in eleven NRL seasons. Storm coach Craig Bellamy commented: \\"He will add depth and experience to our squad and gives us further options in the halves.\\" He got his revenge beating his old team, Parramatta, in the 2009 NRL Grand Final, setting up 2 tries. However, the NRL later discovered significant salary cap breaches and stripped the Storm of this win. This made it third time unlucky for Finch, having lost two Grand Finals with the Roosters (2003 and 2004). In July 2010, Finch signed with then Super League champions, Wigan Warriors. The deal began with the 2011 season and runs through the 2012 season.http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/brett-finch-ryan-hoffman- jeff-lima-leave-melbourne-storm/story-e6frexnr-1225894283214 Finch did not make his début for Wigan until 25 March 2011 in the home defeat by Warrington Wolves in round 7 of the super league, where Finch scored Wigan's only try. Finch missed the start of the season due to a thigh injury which saw him miss 6 games for the Warriors, including 5 Super League games and the 2011 World Club Challenge defeat by St George Illawarra Dragons. Finch played in the 2011 Challenge Cup Final 28-18 victory over the Leeds Rhinos at Wembley Stadium. After his two-year stint at Wigan, Finch returned to the Melbourne Storm for the 2013 NRL season. He joined the team as a back-up to halves pairing Cooper Cronk and Gareth Widdop. Post playing After retiring at the end of 2013, Finch, between 2014 and 2016 worked as a Sideline Commentator on Channel Nine's NRL Coverage as well as semi-regular appearances as a panellist on The NRL Footy Show, However Finch departed Channel 9 at the end of 2016, citing mental health issues. In 2017, Finch began working for Fox Sports. In 2018 he married his partner of 5 years Elli Johnston and in 2019 they welcomed a baby girl, Mackenzie Grace. https://www.melbournestorm.com.au/news/2017/08/24/where-are-they-now--brett- finch/ On 24 October 2019, it was revealed by the Sydney Morning Herald that Finch checked himself into a mental health facility after an incident on an interstate flight. Concerns were reportedly raised after Finch was seen asleep with a blood nose on a flight from Sydney to the Gold Coast. One witness was quoted as saying “He looked like he couldn’t bring himself to get off the plane. White as a ghost, couldn’t control his runny nose and (appeared) paranoid, He wasn’t abusive. He just didn’t want to get off the plane, like he was scared about something\\". In late September Finch joined the YKTR Sports organisation, run by former rugby league player Isaac John. On September 30 Finch launched his podcast, Brett Finch Uncensored, with Brad Fittler featuring as his first guest.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mg7symDoYHQ&ab;_channel=YKTR ReferencesExternal links * * State of Origin Official website Rugby League Player Stats Category:1981 births Category:Australian rugby league players Category:Canberra Raiders players Category:Sydney Roosters players Category:Parramatta Eels players Category:Melbourne Storm players Category:Wigan Warriors players Category:Prime Minister's XIII players Category:Country New South Wales Origin rugby league team players Category:NRL All Stars players Category:New South Wales Rugby League State of Origin players Category:Valentine-Eleebana Red Devils players Category:Maitland Pickers players Category:Rugby league five-eighths Category:People from Maitland, New South Wales Category:Living people ","title":"Brett Finch"},{"id":"4421574","text":"Watts is a surname, and may refer to:  Arts and entertainment  * Alaric Alexander Watts, British poet and journalist * Danièle Watts, American actress * David G.

Most of the beetles of this subfamily feed exclusively on dung. However, some may feed on decomposing matter including carrion, decaying fruits and fungi. Dung beetles can be placed into three structural guilds based on their method of dung processing namely rollers, dwellers and tunnelers Dung removal and burial by dung beetles result in ecological benefits such as soil aeration and fertilization; improved nutrient cycling and uptake by plants, increase in Pasture quality, biological control of pest flies and intestinal parasites and secondary seed dispersal. Well- known members include the genera Scarabaeus and Sisyphus, and Phanaeus vindex.  Description  Adult dung beetles have modified mouth parts which are adapted to feeding on dung. The clypeus is expanded and covers the mouth parts. The elytra, which cover the wings, expose the pygidium. They also have a space between their middle legs to allow for manipulation of the dung. Dung beetles can be large beetles of a few inches in size to small beetles which are only a few millimeters in size  Guilds  Dung beetles are classified into groups based on their method of processing the dung. Rollers are beetles that construct balls of dung from the main food source. They roll away this ball from the position of the original food source and use the dung for feeding or for reproduction. Tunnelers are beetles that dig tunnels beneath the food source creating nests. They relocate food into their nest for reproduction and feeding. Lastly, dwellers are beetles that live and reproduce inside the food source rarely creating nests.  Reproduction  Pheromones are thought to aid in dung beetle reproduction. Dung beetles copulate after which both parents dig a tunnel to lay the eggs. This tunnel may have different branches leading to varying egg chambers or may not be branched depending on species. Both parents take dung inside the tunnels in the form of brood balls and the females lay the egg inside the dung. When the larva hatches it feeds on the surrounding dung and forms a pupa undergoing several instars. After this stage the pupa hatches and the newly formed adult evades the tunnel and searches for a fresh dung supply for feeding. After approximately 2 weeks the new adult beetle will be able to reproduce. Ecology Dung beetle communities are dependent on vegetation and presence of mammalian dung resource. In an area with a lot of vegetation, the dung pads are preserved longer for dung beetle utilization. Vegetation provides conditions suitable for vertebrate trafficking allowing more dung presence in the area. In areas with little vegetation, limited vertebrate fauna may be present limiting the types of dung present. Also, with little vegetation the canopy of the forest may be limiting. This causes the dung pads to be exposed to sunlight, higher temperature and wind action. These factors contribute to dung pad desiccation which decreases the period of suitable dung availability. Dung beetles of different groups may respond to changes in vegetation in different ways. A decline in dung beetle diversity associated with the conversion of native forests to open pastures is known to occur. However, some species are able to utilize dung in open pasture conditions. Tunneler species are able to utilize dung in less optimal condition because the tunnel beneath the dung and utilize it from bottom up. As desiccation occurs on the top of the dung pad, the middle and lower regions may still be suitable for the dung beetle. Also, smaller species are able to survive in such conditions as they require less dung. Larger beetles require larger amounts of dung which may not be available due to the fast desiccation of the dung pads in these conditions. Soil hardness and dryness negatively affect the tunnelers. Species able to tolerate open pasture conditions were extremely abundant. The reduction in the number of dung beetles affected the efficiency of their ecological roles and it was found that dung removal and burial declined. Dung removal and burial by dung beetles result in ecological benefits such as soil aeration and fertilization. These benefits lead to improved nutrient cycling and uptake by plants, increase in pasture quality, biological control of pest flies and intestinal parasites and secondary seed dispersal. Therefore, their role in the ecosystem is essential. Taxonomy The subfamily is split into 12 tribes. These can be grouped by their distribution, though the present classification is expected to require major revision based on recent phylogenetic analyses.

He studied chemistry at the University of Vienna and after working with Adolf von Baeyer at the University of Munich he received his PhD with Zdenko Hans Skraup at the organic chemistry department of the University of Vienna in 1910. He abandoned organic chemistry and in 1912 joined the Institute for Radium Research, Vienna radiochemistry group of Stefan Meyer. In 1913 he visited Frederick Soddy at the University of Glasgow and Ernest Rutherford at the University of Manchester. In this year he married Else Hartmann; they had a son and daughter. After his habilitation in 1913 he became assistant of Otto Hönigschmid at the University of Prague. From 1919 till 1933 he was professor in various German universities:(University of Hamburg 1919, Berlin University 1922, Königsberg University 1929. In 1927, Paneth and Kurt Peters published his results on the transformation of hydrogen to helium, now known as cold fusion. They later retracted the results, saying they had measured background helium from the air. During Hitlers Machtergreifung in 1933 he was on a lecture tour in England and did not return to Germany. In 1939 he became professor at the University of Durham where he stayed until his retirement in 1953. A call to become director at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz caused him to return to Germany. He founded the Department of Cosmochemistry there and initiated research on meteorites.

In particular it shows the lives of Ukrainian Canadian settlers from the years 1899 to 1930. Buildings from surrounding communities have been moved to the historic site and restored to various years within the first part of the twentieth century. \\"The Village\\", as it is colloquially known, has a very strong commitment to historical authenticity and the concept of living history. The Village uses a technique known as first-person interpretation which requires that the costumed performers remain in character at all times (or as much as is feasibly possible). Actors answer all questions as if it is the year their building portrays. Although this technique is startling for some visitors at first, it allows for a much stronger experience of immersion in history than traditional third-person interpretation where the actor acknowledges that he is, in fact, in a museum. Elevator, built circa 1922, restored to 1929 appearance. The village is in Lamont County on the Yellowhead highway, on the eastern edge of Elk Island National Park.

Iwan Pylypow was one of two individuals who set off the mass migration of Ukrainians to Canada at the end of the 19th century. His family was Galician. His third house in Canada is preserved at the Village. The second house is that of Mykhailo and Vaselina Hawreliak. The Hawreliaks were a large Ukrainian Bukovynian family who settled in the Shandro area. By the 1920s Mykhailo Hawreliak was quite successful, and the house preserved here has five bedrooms and a cistern that collected rainwater for use in the kitchen. The Nazar Yurko family was also from Bukovyna, but was of Romanian descent. *Pylypow House (Star, Alberta; Built 1906, depicts 1923–1929) * Hawreliak House (Shandro, Alberta; Built 1919, depicts 1925–1928) * Yurko House (Boian, Alberta; Built 1920, depicts 1932) Farmsteads The \\"burdei\\" at the Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Village.

When he was 15, Scardon debuted on stage as a contortionist in vaudeville. He progressed from that to pantomime and then joined a troupe headed by J. C. Williamson, touring New Zealand and Australia for five years. In 1905, he joined a company headed by Nance O'Neil, and that group's tour brought him to the United States. Scardon's Broadway credits include Mrs. Bumpstead-Leigh (1911), Becky Sharp (1911), The Green Cockatoo (1910), Hannele (1910), The Debtors (1909), Agnes(1908), Our American Cousin (1908), and Brigadier Gerard (1906). Scardon went to Hollywood in 1910. In motion pictures, he worked for Majestic Pictures, Reliance-Majestic Studios and Vitagraph Studios. He directed Blanche Sweet in Unwilling Husband, Bessie Barriscale in some of her most successful productions, and most of the melodramas which starred his wife, actress Betty Blythe. Retiring when sound films came in, Scardon returned to films as an actor in the 1940s, playing bit roles until he retired from the film industry in 1948.  Personal life and death  At the time of his death, Scardon was married to actress Betty Blythe. On January 18, 1954, Scardon died of a heart attack in Fontana, California, at age 79.

He was a member of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, a Prague Spring participant and dissident in the 1970s until he was not allowed to return from Austria. He was a founding member of the Charter 77 movement. Biography He was still a devoted communist upon graduating from secondary school in 1947, and graduated from Charles University in 1952, with a degree in theater and aesthetics. He then became a member of the Central Committee of the , serving until 1960. It was during this period that he began writing plays and poetry. He was also a member of the . In 1956, he was briefly employed by Czechoslovak Television as a reporter and commentator. From 1963 to 1966, he was the dramaturge at Vinohrady Theatre. While there, he became attracted to the reform movement and resigned from the Union of Writers due to questions concerning his \\"cultural-political orientation\\". In 1967, following a public reading of Solzhenitsyn's protest letter to the Union of Soviet Writers, he and several other prominent writers were subjected to disciplinary action. Because he and other dissident theater workers had been banned from working in the official theater, he formed an acting company called \\"Living- Room Theater\\" with the actors Pavel Landovský, Vlasta Chramostová, Vlastimil Třešňák, and his daughter, Tereza Boučková to covertly perform an adaptation of William Shakespeare's Macbeth in living rooms in Prague. Czech-born UK playwright Tom Stoppard's Dogg's Hamlet, Cahoot's Macbeth is inspired by these events. In 1968, he became one of the most prominent figures in the Prague Spring. The following year, he was expelled from the Communist Party and his works were subjected to strict censorship. He and his wife were allowed to travel to Austria in 1978, where he had a contract with the Burgtheater. While there, their citizenship was revoked and they could not return. In 1980, they received Austrian citizenship and settled in Vienna. In Austria he continued his work and was awarded Austrian Waldviertel Academy prize.

Black Down lies just a few miles eastward of the Bristol Channel at Weston-super-Mare, and provides a view over the Chew Valley. The summit is marked with an Ordnance Survey trig point, the base of which has been rebuilt by the Mendip Hills AONB authority. The shortest route of ascent goes from the Burrington Combe car park and is approximately 1 km long. Black Down is an open-access area mostly consisting of moors, with dense cover of associated vegetation such as heather and bracken. According to a local organization's newsletter, the name \\"Black Down\\" comes from the Saxon word 'Blac' or 'Bloec' meaning bleak, 'Dun' meaning down or fort. Geology The rocks form an anticline with the oldest being Old Red Sandstone at the summit, which was deposited during the Devonian period between 400 and 362 million years ago, with younger Portishead Beds of limestone and Black Nore Sandstone on either side. As a result of the Variscan mountain-building, the Mendip area now comprises at least four anticlinal fold structures, with an east-west trend, each with a core of older Devonian sandstone and Silurian volcanic rocks. The Devonian and Silurian rocks are generally more resistant to weathering than the limestone, and form some of the highest points on the hills, including the highest at Black Down, 325 metres (1068 ft) above sea level. Black Down is a moorland area, with its steeper slopes covered in bracken (Pteridium) and its flatter summit in heather (Calluna) and grasses rather than the pasture which covers much of the plateau. Beacon Batch round barrow cemetery The summit area of Black Down is known as Beacon Batch. It is the site of Bronze Age round barrows, one of which also anchors the concrete trig point. All of the barrows show signs of being opened in the past, but the only recorded excavation was done by Rev J. Skinner in 1820. The main group of barrows consists of nine bowl barrows, one bell barrow and one disc barrow. There is also an outlying group of three bowl barrows to the west, and a group of two bowl barrows about to the southeast of the main group.Extract from record of Scheduled Monument Bombing decoy town World War II bunker During World War II a bombing decoy town was constructed on Black Down, which was intended to represent the blazing lights of a town which had omitted to follow black-out regulations. The decoy, known under the code name Starfish from the original code SF (Special Fire) used fires of creosote and water to simulate incendiary bombs exploding. In addition glow boxes were used to simulate the streets and railways of Bristol, the light bulbs were powered by electrical generators, powered by Coventry Climax petrol engines contained in two bunkers. It was laid out by Shepperton Film Studios, based on aerial photographs of the city's railway marshalling yards.Brown, Donald (1999). Somerset v Hitler: Secret Operations in the Mendips 1939 - 1945. Newbury: Countryside Books. . pages 165-177 The decoys were fitted with dim red lights, simulating activities like the stoking of steam locomotives. Burning bales of straw soaked in creosote were used to simulate the effects of incendiary bombs dropped by the first wave of Pathfinder night bombers; meanwhile, incendiary bombs dropped on the correct location were quickly smothered, wherever possible. Drums of oil were also ignited to simulate the effect of a blazing city or town, with the aim of fooling subsequent waves of bombers into dropping their bombs on the wrong location. The site was home to a Z battery of anti aircraft rockets. The success of this endeavour is questionable, with no ground indications that the hills were used as targets. Piles of stones (known as cairns) were also created to prevent enemy aircraft from using the hilltop as a landing site. Heritage at Risk Both the World War II bombing decoy complex and round barrow cemetery are included on the Heritage at Risk Register maintained by English Heritage due to erosion from the visitors to the site. A three-year project from 2013 to 2016 has been funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, and hosted by the Mendip Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty Unit, has been established to \\"raise awareness of the importance of Black Down and the Burrington Commons\\".

In 2001 it was proposed that one of the five traffic lanes should be removed and the pavements widened to include cyclepaths. This, together with an overall facelift, was completed on 7 September 2003. Immediately there were calls for the reversal of traffic flow (see redevelopment below). Redevelopment View looking west towards the Cinquantenaire (2009) As part of plans to improve the image of the European Quarter, the eastern part of Rue de la Loi (between the small ring and Chaussée d'Etterbeek) will be rebuilt. In April 2008 the Brussels-Capital Region (the regional authority), together with the European Commission and the City of Brussels (the local authority) launched an international urban design competition to redevelop the area as an eco-district, concentrating on improving pedestrian and public transport access. They stated it should include more public spaces and have a \\"strong symbolic identity\\" with high environmental and architectural standards. Furthermore, they aimed to diversify the area by bringing in more housing, cultural and leisure areas while simultaneously increasing the area occupied by the Commission from 170,000 m2 to 400,000 m2 – doubling the building density along the street.Operation facelift begins : launch of an urban design competition on a European and international scale, relating to the rue de la Loi and its surroundings, European Commission In March 2009, a French-Belgian-British team led by French architect Christian de Portzamparc won the competition and European Commissioner for Administrative Affairs, Audit and Anti-Fraud Siim Kallas stated that the project, which would be put into action gradually rather than all at once, would create a \\"symbolic area for the EU institutions\\" giving \\"body and soul to the European political project\\" and providing the Commission with extra office space. The road would be reduced from four lanes to two, and be returned to two-way traffic (rather than all west-bound) and the architects proposed a tram line to run down the centre. A series of high-rise buildings would be built on either side with three 'flagship' skyscrapers at the east end on the north side. Brussels Minister- President Charles Picqué described the towers as \\"iconic buildings that will be among the highest in Brussels\\" and that \\"building higher allows you to turn closed blocks into open spaces.\\" Brussels' EU quarter set for 'spectacular' facelift, EurActive The tallest towers at the eastern end would be subject to a separate architectural competition and would be symbolic of the Commission. The freed-up space (some 180,000m2) would be given over to housing, shops, services and open spaces to give the area a more \\"human\\" feel. A sixth European School may also be built.

He ran for re- election in 1996 and won, but in 1997 federal investigators discovered that the Carey campaign had engaged in an illegal donation kickback scheme to raise more than $700,000 for the 1996 re-election effort.Greenhouse, Steven. \\"Behind Turmoil For Teamsters, Rush for Cash.\\" New York Times.

Carey's father had to work Sundays and Christmas Day (often without pay), which taught Ron about workplace injustice, but his father also took him to union meetings where Ron learned about workplace change and how to run a democratic union. Raised in Astoria and Long Island City, he graduated from Haaren High School in Manhattan and was offered entry into St. John's University on a swimming scholarship. But he turned down college, enlisting in the Marines in 1953 and serving until 1955.Greenhouse, Steven. \\"Ron Carey, Who Led Teamsters Reforms, Dies at 72.\\" New York Times. December 13, 2008. At the age of 18, he married Barbara Murphy, a girl who lived in the apartment above him. The Careys remained married until Ron's death; they had five children. Carey became a UPS driver and joined the Teamsters in 1956. He and his father pooled their money and bought a home for both families in Kew Gardens, Queens.Although Joseph and Loretta Carey separated when Ron Carey was in his 20s, Joseph Carey continued to live in the house until his death. Joseph and Loretta Carey died within three days of one another in 1992. See: Kilborn, \\"Carey Takes the Wheel,\\" New York Times, June 21, 1992. He ran for and was elected shop steward of the 7,000-member Local 804 in 1958 because he felt members weren't getting the services their dues paid for. He was elected secretary of the local in 1965. After several unsuccessful campaigns, Carey was elected Local 804 president in November 1967. He earned a reputation as a hard bargainer (by 1977, he had negotiated salary increases which doubled his members' 1968 hourly wages) and for being free from graft and the influence of organized crime.Brill, Steven. The Teamsters. Paperback ed. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1979. Under his leadership, in November 1967 Local 804 became one of the first Teamster locals whose members qualified for a pension after 25 years of employment regardless of age. He also led long but successful strikes in 1968, 1971, 1974, and 1982.Phalon, Richard. \\"Parcel Strike Is Spreading Into Jersey.\\" New York Times.

November 21, 1974; Goldman, Ari. \\"U.P.S. Workers State Walkout After Dispute.\\" New York Times. September 10, 1982. He was re-elected eight times, winning each campaign by landslide margins. Although Local 804 had always negotiated its own contract with UPS, the national union forced the local to participate in the national master contract in 1979. Carey was named a negotiator for the national master contract, but was not included in the Teamsters' national bargaining team. In 1987, Carey sued to overturn a provision of the union's constitution which permitted rejection of a proposed contract only by a two-thirds majority. The union changed the provision to permit a majority to reject a proposed contract. During his tenure as Local 804 president, Carey took two years of correspondence courses at home, two years of courses at the Xavier Institute for Labor Management Relations (a highly influential Catholic labor school), and six months of labor management courses at Cornell University. Steven Brill devoted an entire chapter to Carey in his 1978 book, The Teamsters, which drew attention to the local leader and launched his national career within the Teamsters. The Road to the Teamster General Presidency=Election campaign In 1989, Carey announced that he would run for president of the Teamsters union.\\"Queens Teamster Seeks Union's Top Office.\\" Associated Press. September 18, 1989. Carey was highly critical of the UPS contract that the Teamsters, led by interim General President William J. McCarthy, had negotiated in 1990.Ravo, Nick. \\"Unusual Labor Tension at U.P.S.\\" New York Times. July 28, 1990. Carey's local represented more than 6,600 members at UPS, making it largest Teamsters local within the company, and Carey's criticism of the contract carried great weight within the international union.Ravo, Nick. \\"Labor Pact Is Ratified At U.P.S.\\" New York Times. August 14, 1990. Carey also criticized McCarthy for refusing to call for a strike vote prior to ratification, for not adequately communicating the \\"concessionary\\" nature of the contract to Teamster members, and for helping oversee the loss of nearly 800,000 Teamsters members in the past decade.Johnson, Dirk. \\"All Unions Have Stake In Teamsters' Elections.\\" New York Times. January 20, 1991. In mid-October 1990, McCarthy, suffering from health problems and losing support within the union for his handling of various contract negotiations, announced he would not seek a full term as Teamsters president. Endorsed by Teamsters for a Democratic Union (TDU), a member-led reform caucus, Carey ran for General President on a pledge to eliminate corruption and organized crime's influence in the union.Carey was not a member of Teamsters for a Democratic Union. See: McFadden, \\"New Teamster Chief's Motto: Honest Work for Honest Pay,\\" New York Times, December 15, 1991; Kilborn, \\"Carey Takes the Wheel,\\" New York Times, June 21, 1992. Utilizing TDU's national mailing list, he raised $200,000 in mostly small contributions from Teamsters members and criss-crossed the country by car to meet with the union's membership. The December 1991 election was the first in which Teamsters members elected the General President by direct secret ballot rather than through delegates hand-picked by local leaders. Other candidates in the election included: R.V. Durham, leader of the Teamsters in North Carolina and generally considered the front-runner in the campaign (he had the backing of a majority of the union's executive board); Walter Shea, a veteran union staffer from Washington, D.C.; and Carey. Although James P. Hoffa, son of disappeared Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa and a long-time Teamsters union attorney, tried to enter the race for president, a federal official ruled that he did not qualify under the union's eligibility rules.\\"Hoffa's Son Ineligible for Race.\\" Associated Press. April 25, 1991. Carey and his slate (which included a candidate for secretary-treasurer and 13 vice presidencies) swept the election.Ten of the 13 candidates running on Carey's slate were members of TDU. The Carey slate did not contest three of the seats on the Teamsters executive board. See: Kilborn, \\"Carey Takes the Wheel,\\" New York Times, June 21, 1992. Carey won with 48.5 percent of the vote to Durham's 33.2 percent and Shea's 18.3 percent. But turnout was low: Less than half the membership voted, and only 16 percent of the union's total membership voted for Carey.Gerthwith, Jeff and Weiner, Tim. \\"Despite Change, Reform Is Slow In the Teamsters.\\" New York Times. June 28, 1993.Kilborn, Peter T. \\"Teamsters Chief Raids Regional Offices.\\" New York Times. March 22, 1994. Carey vowed to reduce the general president's salary, end the practice of permitting union officers to draw multiple salaries, no longer endorse Republicans for president, and seek federal legislation mandating universal health care. First term Changes and challenges came quickly during Carey's first term. Within days of his inauguration as union president, he replaced a large number of top staff at the union's headquarters, and within a few weeks sold the union's two airplanes and started charging staff for lunches in the union cafeteria.Kilborn, Peter T. \\"Teamsters Chief Expects Convention Challenges.\\" New York Times. July 15, 1996. He twice ordered his own salary cut, from $225,000 in 1991 to $175,000 in 1994. In his first few months in office, Carey defeated a disaffiliation attempt by flight attendants working for Northwest Airlines (and later refused to agree to a contract in which the Teamsters would win a 30 percent ownership stake in Northwest in return for $886 million in contract concessions), renegotiated a contract for truck drivers (carhaulers) who ferried automobiles from ports and factories to dealers, and defeated an attempt by the Safeway grocery store chain to contract out its trucking operations. Carey was also active politically. He was the first Teamsters president to testify widely in front of Congress. He vigorously opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and pledged political retaliation against members of Congress who did.Kilborn, Peter T. \\"Encouraged but Still Wary, Union Leaders Gather.\\" New York Times.

Despite Carey's pledge to eliminate corruption and the influence of organized crime in the Teamsters, there were many who claimed that he did little in his first term to tackle the problem. Federal investigators accused Carey of engaging in \\"halfhearted\\" reforms, permitting a Teamster with known organized crime links to oversee a corrupt local, hindering court-appointed trustees reforming locals, and setting up an ethical practices committee which did nothing to stop corruption. One organized crime figure, Alphonse \\"Little Al\\" D'Arco, former acting boss of the Lucchese crime family, even said he had had a relationship with Carey in the 1960s and 1970s—statements Carey vigorously denied. U.S. Department of Justice officials began an investigation into the accusations in June 1994.Raab, Selwyn. \\"Justice Department Is Reviewing Inquiry Into Teamsters Leader.\\" New York Times. June 24, 1994. There were also claims that Carey had improperly intervened in a jurisdictional dispute between two Teamster locals.Raab, Selwyn. \\"Obstacles to Cleanup.\\" New York Times. June 29, 1993. Carey was also accused of a conflict of interest for not disclosing that he had received UPS stock from his deceased father's estate. Joseph Carey bought eight shares of stock in 1935 for $320, which over the years (including stock splits) grew to 112,000 shares worth $1.9 million. The stock was sold back to the company by the estate in August 1992, and Carey was cleared of the charges.\\"Teamsters President Cleared in Issue of Conflict.\\" New York Times. August 20, 1993. In May 1994, Carey was accused of corruption regarding a number of real estate deals. The Independent Review Board (IRB), a three- member panel created under a Federal court order in 1989 designed to help supervise the union's elections and rid it of corruption,Shenon, Philip. \\"U.S. Sues to Oust Teamster Chiefs; Seeks Trustee to Oversee Election.\\" New York Times. June 29, 1988; Doyle, John M. \\"Tentative Pact Reached Before Start of Teamsters Rackets Case.\\" Associated Press. March 13, 1989. began an investigation into how Carey was able to finance hundreds of thousands of dollars in real estate investments and into who may have forged Carey's estranged wife's signature on several documents.Carey purchased and sold seven homes and condominiums from 1979 to 1992 in New York, Florida and Arizona. The largest transaction involved a $341,000 house in the Florida Keys in April 1992. See: Raab, Selwyn. \\"Teamsters President's Real-Estate Deals Are Questioned.\\" New York Times. May 2, 1994. Carey later admitted he had forged his wife's signature but claimed he did so with her permission.Raab, Selwyn. \\"Teamsters President's Real-Estate Deals Are Questioned.\\" New York Times. May 2, 1994. Carey said he financed all the investments though savings, loans from relatives, and his $1.9 million inheritance. Carey was cleared by the IRB of all charges in July 1994. The IRB said no fraudulent activity had occurred in the financing of the deals.Raab, Selwyn. \\"Panel Clears Top Teamster of Mob Link.\\" New York Times. July 12, 1994. Although Carey did forge his wife's signature and asked a union employee to lie about it, the IRB concluded that Carey's wife had given him permission to sign her name and that the forgeries were unrelated to union activities. Carey did take extensive measures to clean up the union, however. In September 1992, he trusteed 18,000-member Local 237 in New York City for corruption, which led to an extensive battle for control of the local.Gottlieb, Martin. \\"Charges Could Hurt Him, Teamsters Head Concedes.\\" New York Times.

November 8, 1995. and trusteed Local 1205 after finding that the union put non-members into its health plan, engaged in nepotism, and had violated federal pension regulations.Raab, Selwyn. \\"4 Teamsters Officials Ousted Over Insurance Fraud Charge.\\" New York Times. April 9, 1996. By mid-August 1995, Carey had trusteed 51 of the union's 651 local unions (mostly on the recommendations of the Independent Review Board). The number had risen to 67 by July 1996.Greenhouse, Steven. \\"Once Again, the Hoffa Name Rouses the Teamsters' Union.\\" New York Times. November 17, 1996. The changes did not come without a backlash. Carey received a number of death threats during his first term, and hired bodyguards to protect himself and his family. Carey also significantly restructured the union's finances. He undertook two initiatives in this area. The first was to close the international union's four regional headquarters in the U.S. Carey depicted the regional headquarters as little more than a mechanism for union officers to engage in corruption and receive multiple salaries, but his opponents claimed that the move was retaliation against Carey's political opponents (who were officers in and drew income from the regional headquarters). The fight to close the offices was a bitter one, and Carey eventually sought a federal preliminary injunction to enforce his right to physically enter and take charge of the offices.Kilborn, Peter T. \\"Teamster Chiefs Continue Fight Against Audits.\\" New York Times. March 23, 1994. The Teamsters' executive board gave him permission to close the offices by a vote of 14 to 3, and the regional headquarters were shuttered in June 1994—saving the international union $15 million in salaries and expenses.Janofsky, Michael. \\"Teamsters To Shut Down Four Offices.\\" New York Times. June 12, 1994. His second major initiative was to seek a 25 percent dues increase. Carey proposed the dues hike in February 1994.Applebome, Peter. \\"Schism and Suit After a Teamster Strike.\\" New York Times. February 10, 1994. The union's executive board had voted to raise strike benefits from $55 a week to $200, but made no provision for funding the higher benefits. A dues hike was essential, Carey said, because the strike fund anticipated running out of money in mid-1994 (and did just that during the national trucking strike in June 1994). Carey also said that the union's budget was significantly out of balance.Greenhouse, Steven. \\"Labor Unions Plan A Teamster Loan to Sustain Strike.\\" New York Times. August 13, 1997. The union had lost 500,000 members since 1979 and assets had fallen to $45 million from almost $200 million in 1990. But Teamsters members turned down the dues hike proposal by a 3-to-1 majority in March 1994,Kilborn, Peter T. \\"Leading Pickets, the Teamster Chief's Future May Also Be on the Line.\\" New York Times. April 15, 1994. and as Carey predicted the union was forced to borrow money from other unions to continue operating. Carey balanced the union's budget in 1996, but did so (in part) by reducing strike benefits back to $55 a week and warned that the union would have to use its general fund to pay strike benefits in the future. Carey negotiated two major contracts in his first term (for UPS and freight drivers), and both included concessions. He led the Teamsters through national strikes against UPS and the trucking industry, and neither strike ended well. Carey called a one-day strike on February 6, 1994, against UPS after the carrier doubled the allowable weight limit on packages. Many locals did not establish picket lines (although company operations in the Northeast were heavily disrupted), and the company refused to enforce to the lower weight limit.Applebome, Peter. \\"Teamsters and U.P.S. Settle After Short, Scattered Strike.\\" New York Times. February 8, 1994. It was the first national strike against UPS. Carey was strongly criticized by union members and leaders for mishandling the strike, and UPS eventually sued the union for $50 million in damages. A month later, Carey led the union through a long strike against the national trucking industry. Trucking Management Inc., a negotiating group representing 23 major trucking companies (including Consolidated Freightways, Yellow Freight, Roadway Express, and Carolina Freight), and the union fought over the use of part-time workers during peak freight periods and an increase in the use of rail rather than trucks to haul freight.Manegold, Catherine S. \\"Teamster Strike Stops Activity of Big Haulers.\\" New York Times. April 6, 1994. The strike was considered a major test of Carey's credibility and his control of the union. But after 17 days the strike began to slowly die, and Carey agreed to federal mediation in order to win a new contract.Manegold, Catherine S. \\"Mediation Set For Teamsters And Truckers In Walkout.\\" New York Times. April 23, 1994. Carey also beefed up the union's organizing efforts, and stanched the loss of members. By 1996, the union had reversed years of membership decline, recording a net gain of 4,000 new members. Within the AFL- CIO, Carey was considered a reformer, and he supported challenger John Sweeney's run for president of the AFL-CIO in 1996.Kilborn, Peter T. \\"Retiring Labor Chief Supports Deputy.\\" New York Times. June 13, 1995. Carey's Second Term=Re-election campaign James P. Hoffa began seeking support for a run at the Teamsters' presidency in February 1994.Kilborn, Peter T. \\"Like Old Times: A Hoffa Amid Top Labor Chiefs.\\" New York Times. February 25, 1994. Hoffa formally announced his candidacy on September 4, 1995.\\"Hoffa Opens Drive For Father's Post.\\" New York Times. September 5, 1995. Carey and Hoffa battled fiercely at the Teamsters' convention in July 1996. Hoffa introduced a resolution to deny convention voting rights to 80 delegates from the union's staff, although this right had been given to all previous presidents.Kilborn, Peter T. \\"Delegate Battle Delays Teamsters Meeting.\\" New York Times. July 16, 1996. Carey ordered a voice vote on the motion, announced that the motion was defeated, and ignored calls for a division of the house. Throughout the convention, Hoffa and his supporters introduced resolutions and constitutional amendments intended to transfer authority from the president and give it to local and regional offices. Hoffa's supporters were well-organized and highly disciplined, and they defeated Carey on several minor votes.Kilborn, Peter T. \\"Teamster Chief Outmaneuvers Foes at Meeting.\\" New York Times. July 19, 1996. But once it became clear that Hoffa had a slim majority of the 1,900 delegates, Carey used the power of parliamentary procedure to delay or defeat the proposals, and his supporters brought the convention to a halt by offering amendment after amendment to Hoffa's proposals. Shortly after the convention ended, Carey trusteed 10,000-member Local 714 in Chicago, Illinois. The IRB had concluded that Carey supporter William Hogan was running the local for his own benefit, but Carey's action led Hogan to endorse Hoffa—a serious blow to Carey's re-election chances.\\"Teamster Chief Takes Over Chicago Local.\\" New York Times. August 10, 1996. Carey's re-election campaign was an exceptionally bitter and close one. Hoffa drew strong support from Teamsters members in the Midwest and the West (with New York state a battleground), and from union leaders unhappy with Carey's anti-corruption drive and his attempt to dismantle regional and local bases of power.Greenhouse, Steven. \\"Bitter Battle for Teamsters' Leadership in New York.\\" New York Times. December 3, 1996. Hoffa attacked Carey for being a \\"chicken\\" and a \\"scaredy cat\\", and blasted Carey's campaign literature as \\"slimy pieces of half-truths\\". Carey derogatorily referred to Hoffa as \\"Junior,\\" and denounced him as a \\"flunky\\" of the \\"old guard\\", \\"the same old mobbed-up, on-the-take teamster his daddy was\\", an \\"imposter,\\" and all \\"smoke and mirrors.\\" The war of words became so heated that in late September Carey filed a libel suit against Hoffa.\\"Teamsters' President Sues Rival, Charging Campaign Libels Him.\\" New York Times. October 1, 1996. Carey repeatedly tried to link Hoffa to organized crime, and publicized the criminal past and mob ties of Hoffa associates and business partners. Hoffa accused Carey of overseeing the loss of 40,000 members, mismanaging the union's finances, agreeing to concessionary contracts, and corruption. Carey countered by claiming he had reversed the union's membership decline, balanced the union's budget for the first time in 10 years, defeated a trucking industry proposal to use part-time temporary drivers, and rooted out corruption in the union. The election was the most expensive in Teamsters history: Hoffa raised $1.3 million in contributions, while Carey raised $1.8 million and incurred $200,000 in debt.Greenhouse, Steve. \\"Asserting Illegal Donations, Hoffa Challenges Balloting.\\" New York Times. March 20, 1997. On December 16, 1996, federal election overseers announced that Carey had defeated Hoffa, 52 percent to 48 percent. More than 475,000 ballots were cast in the election.Greenhouse, Steven. \\"Counting Starts In Race to Lead The Teamsters.\\" New York Times. December 11, 1996. The vote count proceeded very slowly, leading to protests from both candidates the vote-counting rules had been violated.Greenhouse, Steven. \\"Teamster Vote Drags as Chief Clings to Lead.\\" New York Times. December 13, 1996.\\"Hoffa Protests Handling of Federal Review of Vote.\\" New York Times. December 18, 1996. Carey declared victory on December 15, 1996. Hoffa, however, refused to concede, claiming 31,000 challenged ballots remained to be counted.Greenhouse, Steven. \\"With a Clear Lead, Teamsters President Is Claiming Victory.\\" New York Times. December 15, 1996. Federal officials overseeing the election confirmed the victory the next day, and certified the election on January 10, 1997.\\"Teamster Ballot Certified.\\" New York Times. January 11, 1997. Later analyses showed that Carey drew most of his support from Teamsters locals in the East and Deep South and Canada, Hoffa led in the Midwest, and the two candidates were neck and neck in the West. Despite the victory, many observers noted that Hoffa ran a much stronger campaign than expected. Many union members were attracted by the Hoffa name, while others (particularly in the Midwest) felt Carey had negotiated weak contracts.Greenhouse, Steven. \\"Teamster Counterrevolution: Why It Nearly Won Election.\\" New York Times. December 22, 1996. But federal officials and labor movement insiders pointed out that Carey had undermined the power, income, prestige, and perks of hundreds of local union officials through his anti-corruption drive. Hoffa had the support of a large majority of these local leaders, and they ensured that the Hoffa message reached the rank and file and the Carey message did not. Accusations of financial impropriety Ron Carey served less than a year of his second term. He was accused of engaging in financial improprieties during his re-election campaign in March 1997. As an investigation by federal officials continued, Carey led the union in a nationwide strike against UPS in August 1997 which led to significant contracts gains. But just three months later, Carey took a leave of absence as president due to the ongoing investigation into his 1996 re- election campaign. Carey was barred from running for president the same day he announced his leave of absence, and he was permanently ejected from the union in July 1998. James P. Hoffa was elected president of the Teamsters in December 1998. The scandal which unseated Ron Carey as president of the Teamsters began when Hoffa accused Carey of illegal re-election campaign activities on March 19, 1997, three months after the election. Hoffa asserted that, at the direction of President Carey, the Teamsters union had paid $97,000 to Michael Ansara, owner of a Massachusetts-based direct mail firm, for get-out-the-vote work in the 1996 Presidential and Congressional elections—work which was not done. Ansara's wife, Barbara Arnold, then made a $95,000 contribution to the Carey re-election effort days later. The deal, Hoffa alleged, had been brokered by Martin Davis, owner of another direct mail business which had done work for the union and the Carey campaign. Hoffa claimed the donation was pivotal because it permitted the Carey campaign to make a last-minute anti-Hoffa mailing. The use of union funds in a race for union office is prohibited by federal law, and it is also illegal for employers or their family members to contribute to union elections.Greenhouse, Steven. \\"Teamsters' Head Returns More Disputed Campaign Donations.\\" New York Times. March 21, 1997. Carey dismissed the allegations, claiming that it was mere \\"serendipity\\" that the donation came on the heels of the payment. Nonetheless, Carey returned the donation, and a day later returned another $126,000 in donations to other contributors without explanation. The refunds constituted nearly 10 percent of Carey's total campaign fund-raising. On March 26, a Federal grand jury in Manhattan began investigating the allegations.Greenhouse, Steven. \\"U.S. Investigates Campaign Gift to Teamster Chief.\\" New York Times. March 27, 1997. On June 6, 1997, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted Davis on charges of conspiracy, embezzlement, and violations of federal labor law for masterminding the kickback scheme.Greenhouse, Steven. \\"Teamster Vote Under a Cloud In a Fraud Case.\\" New York Times. June 7, 1997. Ansara pleaded guilty to conspiracy and admitted he had used the union's money to reimburse his wife for her donations to the Carey re-election effort. The Carey campaign tried to shield its internal documents from federal investigators, arguing they were protected by attorney–client privilege, but this claim was dismissed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.Weiser, Benjamin. \\"Judge Orders Disclosure In Union Race.\\" New York Times. June 13, 1997. UPS strike As the financial scandal worsened, Carey faced a major strike against UPS. Carey had ordered Teamsters staff and local leaders to begin preparing for a strike against UPS a year before the contract expiration deadline.Greenhouse, Steven. \\"Yearlong Effort Key to Success For Teamsters.\\" New York Times. August 25, 1997. A questionnaire was sent to all Teamster-represented workers at UPS asking them what their key contract issues were, and the union made those issues the centerpiece of its negotiation strategy and strike effort. The union also circulated a petition which obtained 100,000 member signatures supporting its negotiating strategy, held numerous small rallies four months ahead of the strike deadline to identify and overcome problems with member mobilization, distributed 50,000 whistles for use at rallies, distributed hundreds of thousands of pro-union stickers, and forced local unions to build effective communications networks. Shop stewards at UPS received a seven- minute video about the negotiations, and delegates to the Teamsters convention in July 1996 received a \\"Countdown to Contract\\" booklet which outlined the union's negotiating and strike strategy and suggested ways locals could put pressure on the company. The union also established a strike Web site which it updated every few hours, established a system for faxing negotiating and strike bulletins to locals, set up a toll-free hot line for striking workers, and worked to ensure that part-timer workers supported full-timer workers and vice versa. The UPS strike preparations also fed into Carey's effort to rebuild the union's organizing capacity. Carey proposed tripling the union's organizing budget to 10 percent from 3 percent, getting 10,000 union members to be volunteer organizers, and securing a commitment from 150 of the union's 651 locals to hire full-time organizers and set aside 15 percent of their budgets for recruiting new members.Greenhouse, Steven. \\"Campaign Finance Troubles Snag Teamsters Leader.\\" New York Times. April 6, 1997. If the union could win most of its negotiating goals at the bargaining table, Carey intended to use the new UPS contract to help organize workers at Federal Express and Overnite Transportation. As the August 1, 1997, strike deadline approached, the talks broke down. On July 30, the company presented its final offer, which the union rejected. Officials with the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service met with the two sides on July 31: Both sides agreed to return to the bargaining table, and the union agreed to extend its strike deadline by four days. Carey presented a new proposal to the company on August 2, but UPS officials rejected it. Talks resumed on the evening of August 3. UPS officials later said they offered to make significant compromises similar to those contained in the eventual contract (including withdrawal of its pension proposal), but Carey disputed that account and said the company's last proposal contained little that was new. Carey's strike preparation efforts paid off when talks between the company and union broke down and 185,000 union members struck on August 4, 1997. The strike involved more workers than any other strike in the 1990s.Greenhouse, Steven. \\"For the Teamsters' Leader, U.P.S. Is an Ancient Enemy.\\" New York Times. August 7, 1997. Carey focused on just a handful of contract issues: That UPS create full-time positions rather than part-time positions in the future, convert several thousand part-time workers to full-time, increase part-time pay significantly, and remain in the union's multi-employer pension plan rather than create its own.Greenhouse, Steve. \\"No Talks, and Very Few Deliveries, in United Parcel Strike.\\" New York Times. August 6, 1997. UPS executives asked President Bill Clinton to invoke the Taft-Hartley Act, which would force the union back to work, but the President said that the conditions required by the Act had not been met. Some Hoffa supporters claimed that Carey had forced a strike to draw attention away from his legal troubles, but most observers concluded that the union could not accept the company's final offer (which included a 1.5 percent raise for full- time workers, no raise for part-timers, and withdrawal from the Teamsters' multiemployer pension plan). Because the Teamsters' strike fund had run out in 1994, UPS officials believed that the union could not sustain a strike for more than a week. But on August 12, the AFL-CIO announced it would loan the Teamsters $10 million a week until the strike ended. Pressure on UPS to end the strike increased swiftly. The company lost $30 million to $50 million a day as it continued to pay non-striking workers to keep the company running. On August 13, Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman privately intervened in the strike with the support of President Clinton, and was able to get the two sides talking again.Johnston, David. \\"United Parcel and Teamsters to Resume Talks.\\" New York Times. August 14, 1997. Carey and the Teamsters also undertook a sophisticated public relations effort. They depicted the union members as average people (the union's spokespeople were often rank and file Teamsters),Nagourney, Adam. \\"In Strike Battle, Teamsters Borrow a Page From Politics.\\" New York Times. August 16, 1997. and mobilized the public's sympathy for UPS drivers by having strikers drive their regular delivery routes to give their customers information about the strike. They also made strategic use of the Internet, using the union's Web site to issue updates and put pressure on Congress.Witt, Matt and Rand Wilson, \\"The Teamsters' UPS Strike of 1997: Building a New Labor Movement.\\" Labor Studies Journal, Vol. 24 No. 1, 58-72 (1999). UPS also engaged in a strong public relations effort (using full-page newspaper advertisements and pressuring customers to ask the President to invoke Taft-Hartley), but most observers as well as some UPS officials agreed that the union had the better P.R. effort. A Gallup poll found that 55 percent of respondents supported the union. UPS had seriously underestimated the union's capacity to wage a strike. Most importantly, UPS officials simply did not believe a strike would occur. But company officials also did not realize the importance of the union's early mobilization efforts, believed the union was too divided between the Carey and Hoffa camps to wage an effective strike, and believed thousands of Teamsters would cross the picket line to return to work. As the strike began, many UPS executives felt they could pressure Carey into offering the company's final offer to the Teamster membership and that the members would accept this offer. Carey won a major contract victory on August 18, 1997. Talks had resumed on August 7 but ended two days later. After five days of silence, talks began again on August 14 under the personal supervision of Labor Secretary Herman at the Hyatt Regency Washington hotel across the street from the Teamsters' headquarters. After two days of nearly continuous bargaining, UPS withdrew its pension demand. President Clinton personally spoke to both parties over the weekend to encourage them to continue bargaining, and a final tentative contract emerged on Monday afternoon, August 18. The pact included several major concessions by the employer: Starting pay of part-time workers would increase for the first time since 1982, 10,000 part-time jobs would be converted into full-time jobs, UPS would stay in the union's multi-employer pension plan, most workers would see significant benefit increases, and five-sixths of all new full-time jobs would be filled by existing part-timers.Greenhouse, Steven. \\"Teamsters and U.P.S. Agree on a 5-Year Contract.\\" New York Times. August 19, 1997. The union agreed to a five-year contract rather than the proposed four-year deal. The company had lost more than $600 million in business during the strike, and fears of even larger losses had finally led it to concede.Greenhouse, Steven. \\"U.P.S. Says Fears of Bigger Losses Made It Cut Deal.\\" New York Times. August 20, 1997. The 50-person Teamsters bargaining committee and conference of 200 UPS locals ratified the agreement on August 19. The UPS strike was a major boost for Ron Carey. His opponents agreed that he had emerged politically stronger from the battle. Carey quickly announced plans to boost organizing efforts at Federal Express, using the gains won in the UPS contract as a major selling point for the union.Greenhouse, Steven. \\"A Victory for Labor, but How Far Will It Go?\\" New York Times. August 20, 1997. Re-election financial scandal and expulsion from Teamsters The donation kickback scheme which led to Carey's eventual expulsion from the Teamsters was created in July 1996. Early internal Carey re-election campaign polls showed Carey losing badly to Hoffa. Hoffa was also out-raising Carey in funds by more than 4-to-1, and the Carey campaign and outside fund-raising consultants were convinced much of Hoffa's funds were coming from organized crime sources. Carey re-election campaign aides, however, were confident Carey could win if he could bypass the local leadership (which supported Hoffa) and get his message directly to Teamsters members. In late July, Carey campaign manager Jere Nash met with Martin Davis, who owned The November Group (a direct-marketing company). Nash and Davis concluded a direct mail and phone bank effort would cost $700,000, money the Carey campaign did not have. Nash agreed to raise $300,000 and Davis agreed to raise the rest. Davis sought out fund-raiser Michael Ansara to brainstorm ways to raise the funds. On October 6, Ansara went to California and met with 300 wealthy donors to liberal causes. One of those donors was a major fund-raiser for Citizen Action, a coalition of left-wing public interest organizations with chapters in 24 states. The donor and Ansara hatched a plan: In exchange for a $475,000 donation to Citizen Action, the Carey campaign would get a $100,000 donation from Citizen Action and Citizen Action would pay $75,000 to Ansara.Labaton, Stephen. \\"Federal Report Describes Teamster Money Scheme.\\" New York Times. August 23, 1997.Greenhouse, Steven and Van Natta, Don, Jr. \\"Proposed Deal With Democrats Draws Focus of Investigators in Teamsters Election.\\" New York Times. September 18, 1997.Greenhouse, Steven. \\"3 Teamster Aides Make Guilty Pleas and Hint At Plot.\\" New York Times. September 19, 1997. Meanwhile, Davis contacted AFL-CIO secretary-treasurer Richard Trumka and allegedly concocted a scheme whereby the Teamsters would donate $150,000 to the AFL-CIO for spurious get-out-the-vote efforts and the AFL-CIO would pay the same amount to Citizen Action. Citizen Action would then pay $100,000 to The November Group, which would use the cash to finance Carey's direct marketing effort. Davis also met with members of the Clinton-Gore campaign, and suggested that the Teamsters would make major donations to Democratic state parties if wealthy donors (who, for whatever reason, might be prohibited by law from donating to political parties) would make donations to the Carey re-election bid. The Teamsters donated $236,500 to Democratic state parties, but when no acceptable donations were made to the Carey campaign by the wealthy donors the scheme fell apart and no donation exchanges were made. Five days after Carey's historic victory at the bargaining table in the UPS strike, details of the donations kickback scheme were unveiled by the court- appointed federal official overseeing the union's elections. The report revealed that the donations kickback scheme included Citizen Action. The report said that Carey had approved a $475,000 donation to Citizen Action, and that Citizen Action had donated $75,000 of this money to the Carey re-election effort.The scandal led Citizen Action to cease business on October 29, 1997, although its independent state chapters continued to operate. See: Greenhouse, Steven. \\"Link to Teamsters Inquiry Forces a Liberal Group to Close Its National Office.\\" New York Times. October 30, 1997. The August 23 report also indicated that the Democratic National Committee (DNC) had been approached by Carey campaign officials.According to press reports, Davis told DNC finance director Richard Sullivan in the summer of 1996 that the Teamsters would give $1 million to the Democratic Party if the party would, in turn, get its wealthy donors to make contributions to the Carey re-election effort. Although they were never investigated for wrongdoing, a number of Clinton administration officials were interviewed regarding the kickback scheme, including former White House deputy chief of staff Harold M. Ickes, former DNC chairman Donald M. Fowler, former DNC finance chairman Marvin S. Rosen, and Clinton-Gore campaign finance chairman Terry McAuliffe. See: Greenhouse, Steven and Van Natta, Don, Jr. \\"Proposed Deal With Democrats Draws Focus of Investigators in Teamsters Election.\\" New York Times. September 18, 1997. The report did not, however, conclude that Carey knew of the transactions and referred the matter to federal prosecutors for further investigation. Based on the report's findings, federal officials overturned the 1996 Teamsters presidential election, and called for new rules that would bar non-Teamsters from contributing to union election campaigns and establish a $1,000 contribution limit.Greenhouse, Steven. \\"Teamster Voting That Chose Carey Declared Invalid.\\" New York Times. August 23, 1997. The Independent Review Board opened its own inquiry into the financial scandal on August 27.\\"Teamster Review Board Eyes Campaign Finances.\\" New York Times. August 27, 1997. The scandal widened throughout September and October. Although Carey had not been disqualified from being a candidate in the re-run election, new evidence and witnesses had caused federal officials to reconsider that opinion by mid- September.Greenhouse, Steven. \\"Doubt on Carey Spot on Teamster Ballot.\\" New York Times. September 12, 1997. As Carey kicked off his second re-election bid, a federal grand jury began investigating whether the Teamsters' donations to the Democratic Party violated federal law. Four days later, Carey accused the Hoffa campaign of also engaging in improper fund-raising in 1996, and federal investigators agreed to look into those charges.Greenhouse, Steven. \\"2 Teamsters Trade Barbs As Feud Gets More Heated.\\" New York Times. September 16, 1997. Carey repeated the charge several times over the next few months.Greenhouse, Steven. \\"Hoffa Is Faulted for Past Ties.\\" New York Times. October 21, 1997; Greenhouse, Steven. \\"Carey Campaign Says Rival Also Broke Donation Rules.\\" New York Times. November 1, 1997. Hoffa said all his donations had come in sums of less than $100, which did not have to be reported.Greenhouse, Steven. \\"Teamster Chief Contends Aides Betrayed Him.\\" New York Times. September 24, 1997. On August 17, federal prosecutors said that they had evidence that the AFL-CIO may have contributed $150,000 to Citizen Action for spurious get-out-the-vote efforts in an attempt to get Citizen Action to give $100,000 to the Carey campaign, and that AFL-CIO secretary- treasurer Richard Trumka was implicated in the scheme.The investigation later concluded that Trumka had also raised $50,000 for Carey; that Gerald McEntee, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) had pressured a printing firm to give him $20,000 to donate to Carey; and that Paul Booth, AFSCME organizing director, had raised another $27,100 in donations for Carey. All the fund-raising violated federal laws against donations from employers and from other unions. See: Greenhouse, Steven. \\"An Overseer Bars Teamster Leader From Re-Election.\\" New York Times. November 18, 1997. On September 19, Martin Davis pleaded guilty to mail fraud and embezzlement, and conspiracy to commit fraud, to make false statements, and to embezzling funds. Jere Nash, Carey's 1996 re-election campaign manager, also pleaded guilty to making false statements and conspiracy. During their plea hearing, Davis, Ansara, and Nash revealed in court that leaders of several other unions had given $20,000 to the Carey campaign in violation of federal laws barring union leaders from contributing to the election campaigns of candidates in other unions, and that Carey campaign officials had lied about these donations. Three staff members at the Teamsters testified in mid-October that they were pressured to give more than $1,000 to the Carey campaign or lose their jobs.Greenhouse, Steven. \\"Teamsters' Union Staff Members Cite Pressure For Donations.\\" New York Times. October 15, 1997. On October 22, the IRB accused William Hamilton, the union's former political director, of conspiring with Nash, Davis, Ansara, and others in the donation kickback scheme.\\"Ex-Teamster Official Accused of Campaign Plot.\\" New York Times. October 23, 1997. Carey contended he knew nothing of the donation kickback scheme. He said that he had approved the large political donations to Citizen Action, the AFL-CIO, and other groups, but that he had relied too heavily on the advice of his aides and did not notice that the donations were much larger than in the past or were being made to some groups the Teamsters did not have long-standing relationships with.Greenhouse, Steven and Van Natta, Don, Jr. \\"Carey Aware of Fraud Scheme, Some Aides Reportedly Tell U.S.\\" New York Times.

October 2, 1997. In late September, the re-run of the Teamsters presidential election was set for January 1998, albeit with much stricter limits on campaign contributions and greater disclosure requirements.\\"Federal Judge Appoints a New Overseer for Teamsters' Election.\\" New York Times. September 30, 1997. On November 17, 1997, a federal official overseeing the Teamsters disqualified Ron Carey from seeking elective office in the union, concluding that Carey knew of and approved the donation kickback scheme. Three Teamsters began to vie for the nomination to oppose Hoffa: Tom Leedham, director of the union's warehouse division; Ken Hall, Carey's chief strategist during the UPS strike; and George Cashman, president of a Boston-area truck drivers' local.Greenhouse, Steven. \\"Candidates Emerge to Take on Hoffa.\\" New York Times.

November 23, 1997. Meanwhile, Carey and the Justice Department signed an agreement in which a federal monitor would oversee the union's spending to prevent any additional improper expenditures.The monitoring agreement ended in January 2002.

November 25, 1997; Greenhouse, Steven. \\"U.S. Officials Ending Monitoring of Teamsters' Finances.\\" New York Times. January 11, 2002.

January 2, 1998; \\"Disqualification Upheld In Teamsters Election.\\" New York Times. September 19, 1998.

On November 25, 1997, Ron Carey took a leave of absence from the Teamsters, just hours before the Independent Review Board accused him of illegally using union money to fund his 1996 re-election campaign and failing to meet his fiduciary duties. Carey staunchly defended himself before the IRB, claiming that the accusations against him were based on the testimony of a single person (Jere Nash) who was trying to avoid prison time by implicating Carey.Greenhouse, Steven. \\"Overseers Are Asked To Let Ex-President Remain in Teamsters.\\" New York Times. January 21, 1998; Greenhouse, Steven. \\"Carey Denies Any Knowledge Of Teamsters Fund Diversion.\\" New York Times. January 22, 1998. He directly contradicted testimony by his former executive secretary, who said Carey knew of the kickbacks to his campaign.Greenhouse, Steven. \\"Teamster President Struggles to Rebut Charges and Keep His Post.\\" New York Times. January 23, 1998. Carey's attorney pointed out that the executive secretary had changed her testimony several times the past year, and that it had been undermined by testimony from another secretary and a mail clerk who both testified that the executive secretary admitted forging Carey's initials on donation approvals.Greenhouse, Steven. \\"Teamsters Leader Presents His Case, but Enigma Remains.\\" New York Times. January 25, 1998. However, Carey admitted that he had not adequately overseen the union's finances, and did not know that the union had spent close to $1 million in political contributions during a 10-day period in October 1996. The Independent Review Board expelled Ron Carey for life from the Teamsters union on July 27, 1998.Greenhouse, Steven. \\"Board Expels Ron Carey From Teamsters for Life.\\" New York Times. July 28, 1998. The IRB concluded Carey breached his fiduciary duty, but that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that he approved or knew about the donation kickback scheme. \\"A fair inference to be drawn from all the facts is that Carey closed his eyes because he knew or suspected that those contributions were to generate a personal benefit for him, i.e., benefits to his campaign,\\" the Board concluded. James P. Hoffa won election as President of the Teamsters union on December 5, 1998. He defeated Tom Leedham, 55 percent to 39 percent (with a third candidate garnering 6 percent).Greenhouse, Steven. \\"Hoffa Will Lead Teamsters After Chief Rival Concedes.\\" New York Times.

April 19, 2000. Carey was indicted on federal perjury charges in January 2001.

He argued that his court vindication had proven the IRB wrong for expelling him, and that a lifetime ban should be applied only to those Teamsters associated with organized crime—not officials who may have engaged in other sorts of wrongdoing.Greenhouse, Steven. \\"Longtime Teamster Fighting a Penalty: No Union Contact.\\" New York Times.

He was critical of the policies of his successor, particularly the centralization of authority in the international headquarters, business-model organizing, and giving Teamsters officials permission to draw multiple salaries again. Ron Carey died of lung cancer at New York Hospital Queens in New York City at age 72 on December 11, 2008. Other activities A Roman Catholic, Carey coached softball at Queen of Peace Roman Catholic Church in Queens, New York City, in the 1960s and 1970s. He was also very active in the American Parkinson Disease Association (he was elected its national vice president in 1971), and sat on the boards of the American Cancer Society and Boys Clubs.

It was programmed by Denton Designs, who went on to produce the similarly acclaimed Where Time Stood Still. It was published by Ocean Software in 1986 for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64,The Great Escape at Lemon64 Amstrad CPCThe Great Escape at CPCZone and DOS. Scenario The player controls an unnamed prisoner of war who has been interned in a POW camp somewhere in northern Germany in 1942. The camp itself is a small castle on a promontory surrounded on three sides by cliffs and the cold North Sea. The only entry to the camp is by a narrow road through the gatehouse and anyone passing through this must be carrying the correct papers. Everywhere else the camp is surrounded by fences or walls with guard dogs used to patrol the perimeter and guards in observation towers with searchlights posted to watch for any prisoners trying to escape. Beneath the camp there is also a maze of tunnels and drains, although these are dangerous to enter without some kind of light. The player's task is to escape from the camp. There are a number of different ways in which this can be achieved. Gameplay The gaming environment is displayed in isometric 2.5D with the player's character initially in bed at the beginning of a day in the camp. The prisoner has a daily routine, along with all the other prisoners, which includes roll call, exercising, mealtimes and bedtime. The other prisoners will follow this routine and, if the player does not control the main character for a short period of time, their character will join in the routine. There are soldiers guarding the camp and they will apprehend the player if he is seen out of routine (prison guards only arrest on touch and only detect prisoners in their line of sight or indoors).Retro Gamer issue 101, page 60 Critical reaction The ZX Spectrum version of The Great Escape was placed at number 23 in the Your Sinclair official top 100,The YS Official Top 100 Part 4 after originally being awarded 9 out of 10 in that magazine's January 1987 issue.The Great Escape review from Your Sinclair issue 13, at 'The Your Sinclair Rock 'n' Roll Years' Both the tense atmosphere and the protagonist's 'automatic daily routine' were highlighted as excellent features.

Early Life and education Ralph Raphael was born in Croydon, London on New Year's Day 1921, the son of Jack Raphael and his wife, Lily Woolfe. He attended secondary school at Wesley College, Dublin and then Tottenham County School, where a chemistry master, Edgar Ware, introduced him to the subject that would become Raphael's lifetime passion. In 1939 he won scholarships to study at Imperial College, graduating BSc with a first-class degree in 1941 and winning the Hofmann Prize for practical chemistry. During the Second World War both the undergraduate and PhD courses at Imperial College were of two year's duration and Raphael completed the latter in 1943. His doctoral work, aimed at the synthesis of vitamin A, was published in five collaborative papers on the chemistry of acetylenes and that topic became a hallmark of his subsequent research career. Career As a new PhD, Raphael was allocated to the wartime effort on the antibiotic penicillin, working from 1943 to 1946 at the May & Baker laboratories. After the war, he obtained an ICI fellowship (for 1946-1949) that allowed him to return to Imperial College to pursue independent research: an early highlight was his synthesises of penicillic acid, the major product of acid degradation of penicillin (although not containing its characteristic β-lactam substructure). Another was his collaboration with Franz Sondheimer on natural products including an insecticide extracted from Zanthoxylum clava- herculis (a diene then called herculin, now systematically named as (2E,8E)-N-isobutyl-2,8-dodecadienamide); work which led to Raphael's award of the Meldola Medal in 1948. In 1949, Raphael was appointed to his first permanent job, as a lecturer at Glasgow University. During this period he developed his teaching skills and his prodigious work rate can be judged by the fact that he also completed nine chapters in one volume of what would become a classic chemistry text. In 1954, Raphael moved to Queen's University, Belfast as its first Professor of Organic Chemistry. There he published an important book on acetylene chemistry, building on his broad experience of these compounds. In 1957, Raphael returned to the University of Glasgow as the Regius Professor of Chemistry,. In 1960 he finished work on a text-book for undergraduates, which was updated and re-issued several times. In 1972 Raphael became head of the Department of Organic, Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry at Cambridge University. This post had been made vacant by the retirement, on ill-health grounds, of Lord Todd, the previous holder of the 1702 Chair in Organic Chemistry. Raphael also became a Fellow of Christ's College. On retirement in 1988 he was granted emeritus status within his college and department, reflecting his distinguished service. Teaching and Research Despite having a slight stammer, Professor Raphael was an inspiring lecturer who engaged his undergraduate students with up-to-date material on organic chemistry, based on his extensive knowledge of the current literature. He had an excellent sense of humour, illustrated by Dudley Williams's report that > \\"he delivered spoof lectures. One on the synthesis of catenanes began with > serious chemistry and gradually — imperceptibly — became less credible; it > culminated in the description of their absorption spectra in the audible > region\\" The output of Raphael's own work and that of his research group of postgraduate and postdoctoral students was published in over 150 peer-reviewed articles. Raphael was funded by external grants, including those from the SERC, NRC Canada, Glaxo Smith Kline, Hoffmann-La Roche and ICI, for whom he was a retained consultant. He also consulted for Beecham Group, Chiroscience and Fisons. His consultancy and other work led to a number of patent filings. Synthesis of natural products Raphael studied many natural products, especially of the type that were biologically active and which would provide a challenge for synthesis but might be the realistic target of a single PhD student's thesis. He and his students published syntheses of 2-deoxyribose, aaptamine, aphidicolin, apiose, arachidonic acid, arcyriaflavin B, baikiain, bullatenone, chrysanthemic acid, clovene, cordycepose, cuparene, erythrulose, exaltolide, farnesiferol C, geiparvarin, gibberone, histamine, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, lipoic acid, pseudomonic acid, pyrenophorin, Queen bee acid, shikimic acid, staurosporinone, strigol, steganacin, steganone, trichodermin and virantmicin. Raphael also investigated the composition of the wax coating of plant leaves, describing the hydrocarbons of which they are composed. In another intriguing publication in Nature, Raphael collaborated with David Rubio to identify components used in the surface treatment of the wood of stringed instruments made by Stradivarius in Cremona and showed that a version of these substances could be used to improve the tone of modern instruments. Molecules of theoretical interest Raphael was interested in molecules of theoretical, as well as practical, interest. In the 1950s he published the first synthesis of the quasi-aromatic compound tropolone and the thujaplicin natural products which contained this unusual ring system. His interest in acetylenes led him to study macrocyclic compounds containing this functional group, and bridged ring systems that could be derived from them. Honours, awards and service to the scientific community In 1958 Raphael was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were John Monteath Robertson, James Norman Davidson, Robert Campbell Garry, and Guido Pontecorvo. In 1962 he was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London; he was the Davy Medalist for the latter in 1981. He was appointed a CBE in the Honours list of June 1982. Raphael received Honorary Doctorates from his alma mater Imperial College, in 1991, Stirling University in 1982, the University of East Anglia in 1986, and Queen's University Belfast in 1989, Among his many awards and service to learned bodies were: * Meldola Medal and Prize (1948) * Tilden Medal (1960) * Vice-President of the Chemical Society, London (1963) * Chemistry Committee Member of SRC (1968) * Pedler Award (1973) * Ciba- Geigy Sponsored Award for Synthetic Chemistry (1975) * Member of the Council of the Royal Society (1975-1977) * President of the Perkin Division of the Royal Society of Chemistry (1977-1979) * Visiting Professor, Hebrew University of Jerusalem (1981) * Honorary membership of the Royal Irish Academy (1987) * Visiting Professor, University of Hong Kong (1989) * Visiting Professor, Université of Haute Alsace (1990) Personal life In 1944 Raphael married Prudence Maguerire Anne nėe Gaffikin, who was a professional violin and viola player. They had a son, Tony, and a daughter, Sonia. By 1998 there were two grandchildren and a great-granddaughter. Ralph Raphael was keenly interested in the visual and performing arts, becoming a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the National Gallery in 1986; his favourite pastime was contract bridge. Raphael died of ischaemic heart disease, in Cambridge on 27 April 1998.

Rossmann (30 July 1930 – 14 May 2019) was a German-American physicist, microbiologist, and Hanley Distinguished Professor of Biological Sciences at Purdue University who led a team of researchers to be the first to map the structure of a human common cold virus to an atomic level. He also discovered the Rossmann fold protein motif. His most well recognised contribution to structural biology is the development of a phasing technique named molecular replacement, which has led to about three quarters of depositions in the Protein Data Bank. Education Born in Frankfurt, Germany, Rossmann studied physics and mathematics at the University of London, where he received BSc and MSc degrees. He moved to Glasgow in 1953 where he taught physics in the technical college and received his Ph.D. in chemical crystallography in 1956. He attributes his initial interest in crystallography to Kathleen Lonsdale, whom he heard speak as a schoolboy. Rossmann began his career as a crystallographer when he became a student of J. Monteath Robertson at the University of Glasgow. The title of his thesis was \\"A Study of Some Organic Crystal Structures\\". In 1956 he and his family moved to the University of Minnesota, where he worked for two years as a post-doctoral fellow with Professor William N. Lipscomb, Jr., publishing on the structure of an Iresin Diester and a terpenoid, and writing computer programs for analysing structures.  Career  Rossmann returned to the UK and to the University of Cambridge in 1958, where he worked with Max Perutz on the structure of hemoglobin as a research associate at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology. In 1964 Rossmann joined the faculty of the Department of Biological Sciences at Purdue University as an associate professor. He directed the Purdue X-ray crystallography laboratory. He became full professor in 1967 and from 1978 held the chair of Hanley Distinguished Professor of Biological Sciences at the university. He also held a joint appointment in the department of biochemistry and adjunct positions in Cornell University's Division of Biological Sciences and in Indiana University's school of medicine. In 1970 his laboratory found the structure of dogfish lactate dehydrogenase, one of the largest early proteins to be solved. In 1973 his group found the structure of Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and Rossmann immediately realized that the binding site for the NAD+ was very similar to the one in the lactate dehydrogenase. This is now called the Rossmann fold. It is found in enzymes (such as dehydrogenases or kinases) that bind molecules such as ATP or NAD+/NADH. Rossmann then turned to viruses, spending a sabbatical in 1971 with Bror Strandberg in Uppsala, Sweden, working on the structure of the satellite tobacco necrosis virus. From 1972 to 1980 Rossmann and his team worked on the southern bean mosaic virus. This required developing new software and adapting existing software for Fourier transforms. It was found that this virus had a similar \\"jelly roll fold\\" to that found previously in the tomato bushy stunt virus, which at the time was a surprise. In the early 1980s Rossmann began working on picornaviruses, and chose HRV14, one of the viruses that cause the common cold. Part of the problem was that it was very difficult at the time to produce milligram quantities of an animal virus, as needed for the X-ray crystallography. Rossmann pushed for the purchase by Purdue of a Cyber 205 supercomputer, capable of delivering hundreds of megaflops. After vectorizing the computer programs, calculations that had taken six weeks with the southern bean mosaic virus now took, for HRV14, only a fraction of a day. In 1985, he published his team's mapping in the journal Nature. The breakthrough nature of this result was such that the National Science Foundation, which provided partial funding for the research, saw fit to organize a press conference, and the news travelled in the general press. This work laid the foundation for a molecular understanding of cell entry of enteroviruses and for the development of capsid-binding inhibitors against a broad range of enteroviruses. After the success with the first cold virus, work was done on alphaviruses and flaviviruses. Using cryo-electron microscopy, in 2016 his lab reported the first known structure of the Zika virus, responsible for a severe epidemic at the time. This work was made possible by more than one decade of studies on related mosquito borne flaviviruses, including dengue virus, using a combination of cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography. Rossmann also had a long-term interest in complicated viral machines. These are exemplified by bacteriophage T4 and nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses, also referred to as giant viruses. The determination of an atomic structure of Paramecium bursaria chlorella virus 1 that infects algae has opened up new possibilities for studying giant viruses at the atomic level. Life and hobbies Rossmann was an avid hiker and sailboat enthusiast, winning M-16 Scow races on Indiana lakes. He was very energetic, which sometimes caused difficulties for his team members. Rossmann's wife, Audrey, was a potter and artist. They had three children, Martin, Alice, and Heather. Audrey died in 2009. When diagnosed with cancer, Rossmann moved into a retirement home, where he met and later married a staff member in charge of welcoming and hospitality, Karen Bogan. He was working on papers and grant proposals until shortly before his death. Rossmann died on the 14th of May, 2019. Purdue president (and former Indiana governor) Mitch Daniels said of him, \\"Still vital, still curious, still in his lab at age 88, his was a life as rich in personal example as it was in scientific achievement.” Rossmann supercomputer The Rossmann cluster is named for Michael Rossmann, Purdue's Hanley Distinguished Professor of Biological Sciences, who is a pioneer in employing high-performance computing in research to reveal the structure of viruses and their component protein molecules. Calculating electron density structure from X-ray crystallography results by Rossmann's team had long been one of the larger tasks carried out on Purdue's computing systems. Awards and honors Among other honors, Michael Rossmann was elected Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1978, Member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1984, Foreign Member of the Royal Society of London in 1996, and Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1999. In 1990, he was awarded Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University. He was awarded honorary doctorates by Uppsala University, Sweden (1983); the University of Strasbourg, France; Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium; University of Glasgow, Scotland; University of York, England; Institut Armand- Frappier, University of Québec, Canada. He was awarded the Gregori Aminoff Prize in 1994 and the Paul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedter Prize in 2001. His own employer awarded him with the Purdue University Medal of Honor in 1995. In 2016, he was awarded the Raymond and Beverly Sackler International Prize in Biophysics for pioneering contributions to high-resolution diffraction analysis of atomic structures of proteins and viruses.

It is most often performed in the outpatient setting, with the patient (usually) being discharged from the hospital or surgery center within six hours from the procedure's inception. Urethrotomy (also referred to as DVIU, or Direct Visual Internal Urethrotomy) is a popular treatment for male urethral strictures. However, the performance characteristics are poor. Success is less than 9% for the first or subsequent urethrotomies. Most patients will be expected to experience failure with longer followup and the expected long-term success rate from any urethrotomy approach is 0%. Beginning in 2003, several urology residency programs in the northeastern section of the United States began advocating the use of urethrotomy as initial treatment in the young stricture patient, versus urethral dilatation. It is theorized that the one-to-two years of relief from stricture disease will allow the practitioner and the patient to plan the most effective treatment regimen without having the concern that undergoing multiple dilatations cloud the judgment of the patient. Furthermore, should urethroplasty be selected by the patient, minimal scar tissue will have developed at the site of the stricture in the urethrotomy patient, as opposed to the patient who had undergone the more conventional (dilatation) route. The procedure Now the diagnosis has been confirmed by either cystoscopy or a prior urethrography, the patient is placed in the lithotomy position, and the urinary meatus is cleansed with an appropriate surgical cleansing agent (scrub), usually containing Povidone-iodine, then surgically draped. An IV antibiotic or other anti-infective medication is administered in conjunction with intravenous normal saline, and allowed to run until administration of the prescribed dose is completed. Most often, procedural sedation will be the chosen adjunct to patient comfort, and the patient will have received intravenous anxiolytic medication at sometime prior to, or during the surgical preparation. This medication is usually a benzodiazepine, often, diazepam or midazolam is employed. The urological surgeon or anesthesia practitioner may also choose to administer a narcotic analgesic such as fentanyl citrate, depending on the level of discomfort anticipated by the surgeon. In some cases, usually where longer strictures are present, a rapidly metabolized hypnotic agent such as propofol may be selected, as this allows for the immediate induction of short-term general anesthesia (note:endotracheal intubation will also be necessary if general anesthesia is administered). Constant monitoring of vital signs including pulse oximetry, cardiac monitoring (ECG), body temperature and blood pressure are carried out by the anesthesia practitioner until the patient is discharged post-operatively to the post-surgical recovery unit. A topical anesthetic, usually viscous lidocaine is instilled into the urethra, and a penile (crown) clamp is applied for at least five minutes, then removed immediately prior to the insertion of a cystoscope equipped with a transurethral injection system containing a local anesthetic (most often 2% (plain) lidocaine, or 0.5% (plain) bupivicaine). The urological surgeon will inject the anesthetic at the twelve o'clock, four o'clock, and eight o'clock positions at the face of the stricture using infiltrative technique, and ensuring that the entire length of the stricture has been medicated. The cystoscope (and injection system) will be withdrawn, and sufficient time will be allowed for the local anesthetic to take effect (usually five-to-ten minutes). At this time a rigid urethrotome or a flexible cystoscope/urethrotome combination will be inserted and guided to the face of the stricture and a small blade towards the tip of the instrument will be deployed using a trigger mechanism to cut the stricture at locations determined by the surgeon. Upon completion of the internal incision(s), the instrument is withdrawn and an appropriately sized Foley catheter will be inserted through the repair and into the urinary bladder, and locked into place by filling its balloon (positioned inside of the bladder near the urethral junction) with sterile water. The Foley catheter serves two purposes, first, it provides drainage of the urine produced in the kidneys, and secondly, it secures the incised areas, holding them open for three to seven days to permit thorough healing of the urethra. The catheter is then attached to a urinary catheter drainage system (large bag or leg bag) via clear polypropylene tubing. Post procedural care Prior to discharge from the surgical facility, the patient will be instructed on proper care of the urinary drainage system, how to monitor for signs of infection, and the limitations of physical activity necessary for the safety of the patient, and the success of the procedure. A course of oral antibiotics or anti-infective agents will be prescribed. Additionally, a urinary analgesic such as phenazopyridine or urinary analgesic/anti-spasmodic combination containing methanamine, methylene blue, and hyoscyamine sulfate will be offered. Palliative medications may sometimes be prescribed, but are often not necessary because there is usually minimal discomfort post-procedure. A few steps can be taken before surgery to reduce the discomfort of recovery. It is suggested to wear loose fitting undergarments after the procedure as there is a chance of having a catheter after the procedure. Men's cotton boxers work well for both comfort and containing any bleeding that may occur. (Note: bleeding after a urethrotomy is expected and can last up to 48 hours.) Purchasing cheap black or dark grey undergarments can help with post-surgery anxiety as light-colored undergarments can make the bleeding appear worse than it actually is and the undergarments can be thrown out after use. Additionally, applying water-based lubricant to the catheter and allowing it to run down and coat the opening of the urethra will prevent the catheter from rubbing and irritating the urethral opening. Lastly, preparing lean meals before surgery such as grilled chicken or salad is a good idea to ease recovery for the 48 hours after surgery. Post surgical evaluation and care The surgeon will remove the catheter three to seven days after the surgery is completed. A baseline uroflowmetric study will be performed, and the patient will be instructed to return in thirty days for a follow-up evaluation. This evaluation will include another uroflowmetric study and a complete urinalysis. Follow-up visits are scheduled at six-month intervals, as determined by the practitioner responsible for the treatment plan. It has become common practice for urologists to prescribe self-catheterization at weekly intervals for the post-urethrotomy patient. After voiding, and using sterile technique, a lubricated Foley catheter is passed into the urethra, through the surgically modified area, into the bladder and allowed to remain in place for up to ten minutes. The catheter is then carefully withdrawn and discarded, and the patient is then instructed to void as soon as possible (this helps to cleanse the urethra of any blood or water-based lubricant and lessen the possibility of infection). Although no formal studies have been conducted, there does appear to be an improvement in intervals between subsequent urethrotomies and an improvement in uroflowmetric data for most patients who have undergone this regimen. Controversy Many leading urologists in the United States consider urethrotomy to be (almost) totally ineffective at providing long-term resolution of urethral stricture disease, and advocate excision of the damaged area followed by either a surgical anastomosis of the (now) patent urethral ends, or a grafting of similar tissue harvested from elsewhere on the patients body. The cost-effectiveness of the procedure has come into question. In the May, 2006 issue of \\"Urology\\", a study undertaken by the Urology Department of the University of Washington essentially concluded that there is a statistical correlation between the length of the stricture and the cost versus benefit ratio of subsequent urethrotomies performed prior to the performance of urethroplasty in males suffering from bulbar strictures. Urethrotomy is a much simpler operation requiring much less recovery time and that open surgical excision of a simple, short stricture even if initially successful may still require the same repeated post operative self dilation that the simpler urethrotomy often requires. It may be that a longer complicated stricture may be better treated with an open procedure while the shorter simpler one with a urethrotomy.

As an A-side single it failed to reach the Billboard Top 100. However, the song has been included on compilation albums: Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Volume 3, released in 1994, and the Deluxe Edition of Dylan, released in 2007. A slightly longer mix of \\"Changing of the Guards\\", including an extended fade, was included on editions of Street-Legal released in 1999 and 2003. Critique Lyrically, this song has prompted much critique, both positive and negative. According to Oliver Trager author of Keys to the Rain: The Definitive Bob Dylan Encyclopedia, \\"Changing of the Guards\\" has been criticized as a \\"song in which Dylan unsuccessfully and cynically parodies his anthemic self in haunting fashion...\\" Conversely, several commentators have found much depth and meaning in the song's lyrics. Noted Dylan expert Michael Gray, author of The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia, commented that \\"Changing of the Guards\\" is a thorough description of Dylan's personal journey, from the beginning of his musical career, about sixteen years prior (the opening line is \\"Sixteen years\\"), through his marriage to and divorce from Sara Dylan, up to his conversion to Christianity, which was announced soon after the song's release. Indeed, much religious and biblical imagery is found in this work, especially apocalyptic imagery—not new ground for Dylan. Dylan once commented: \\"It means something different every time I sing it. 'Changing of the Guards' is a thousand years old'\\". However, even the song's greatest admirers concede the opacity of the lyrics. \\"Like much in 'Changing of the Guards', the intended meaning of this passage is opaque...\\" The seemingly deliberate ambiguity of the lyrics marked Street-Legal's effective abandonment of the narrative approach that dominated Dylan's previous album Desire. Live performance history Dylan performed \\"Changing of the Guards\\" only during the tour following its 1978 release, often as the closing song of the set; it was played significantly faster than the album version. This tour was documented on the double live album Bob Dylan at Budokan, though \\"Changing of the Guards\\" was not included.
