In October 1931, he became a member of the NSDAP party (member number 612,972) and shortly thereafter joined the SS (SS Number 23,064). After graduation, Bast worked at the county court in St. P√∂lten, but lost his job shortly afterwards due to his membership in the Nazi party. Bast then worked in his father's law office, who was an enthusiastic national socialist. After the German Reich's Anschluss with Austria, on March 20, 1938 Bast joined the Sicherheitsdienst and Gestapo. Bast was first placed to work in Graz, where he in early 1940 became the head of the department for combat and investigation of enemies. In August 1940, Bast moved to the Gestapo in Koblenz; then from January 1941, he headed the state police control center in Linz on behalf of Humbert Achamer- Pifrader. In the SS he achieved the position of Sturmbannf√ºhrer and was also promoted to the government council. Since July 1941, he was the leader of the Gestapo in M√ºnster. In this position, he was heavily involved in the deportation of Jews out of Germany and took part in the execution of Polish forced laborers.Biographie Gerhard Bast, Dr. bei Landesgeschichte O√ñ From November 1942 to December 1942 he was leader of the special unit 11a in Einsatzgruppe D and led the assassinations of Jews.Ernst Klee: Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich, Frankfurt am Main 2007, S. 30.

From June 1944 to October/November 1944, he was leader of the special unit 7a in the \\"Einsatzgruppe B\\". Later, he was deployed with his special unit in the \\"Einsatzgruppe H\\" under lead of \\"BdS Pressburg\\" to fight partisans. Bast obtained the following awards: War Merit Cross I and II class with swords, Ostvolk Medal II class in silver, as well as an armed forces cross (Heeressiegeskreuz) III class with swords. He was referred to as Alter K√§mpfer. At the end of World War II he disappeared under a false name. As an alleged farmhand and lumberjack, he found accommodation and employment at a farm in South Tyrol. In March 1947, he wanted to return to his family in Innsbruck and asked the help of a human trafficker to assist him in passing the guarded Brennerpass. Before even reaching the Brennerpass, the smuggler killed Bast with three shots, robbed him. The smuggler was convicted in 1949 of murder and robbery and was to serve a 30-year long prison sentence.

It connects the Bertoldstra√üe with the Wannerstra√üe. In doing so, it crosses the Bismarckallee, the central bus station, the main railway station Hauptbahnhof, the Wetzingerstra√üe and the St√ºhlinger Church Square. The right short individual sections make it seem like an inner-city viaduct or an elevated highway in proportion to the whole length. The S√ºhlinger bridge fulfills simultaneously three functions: it connects the Old City district with the St√ºhlinger district, it is used as a tramway station and as a pedestrian bridge overcrossing the main railway station and gives access to the railway platforms. Since 2009, the bridge needs rehabilitation because water infiltrates the concrete. As soon as the rehabilitation is carried out, the cyclists are not allowed to use the bridge anymore and have to use the neighboring Wiwil√≠ Bridge as an alternative one. The reason for this is the height of the guardrails of the bridge, which only rise up to 1,00 meter instead of the latterly legal required 1,20 meters.Joachim R√∂derer: Freiburg: Neue Regelung: Stadtbahnbr√ºcke wird radfreie Zone, Badische Zeitung. 2012-03-18. Retrieved 2012-04-05. With the start of the rehabilitation, the hitherto grandfather clause runs out and the regulation is obligatory. The rehabilitation initially planned for 2012 was deferred until August 2012 because of delays and call for bids. Since they were still at the call for bids in the year 2013, it was not possible to make a statement about when it would be rehabilitated in November 2013. Now the rehabilitation is supposed to start in the spring 2019. In the autumn 2013 the spiral stairs leading to the Freiburg Konzerthaus were underpinned with wood. Because of budget shortage of the civil engineering department of Freiburg in November 2013, it was decided to call for bids in autumn 2015 and that the rehabilitation of the stairs will start in the spring 2016. In the spring of 2016 they thought that the reparations could start at the earliest in the autumn 2017.

The European Union states that: \\"The right of access occupies a central role in EU data protection law's arsenal of data subject empowerment measures.\\" This right is often operationalised as a Subject Access Request.  Europe  The right of access is enshrined as part of the fundamental right to data protection in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. It is in fact the only one of the practical rights relating to personal data that is listed there. In the GDPR, this right is defined in various sections of Article 15. There is also a right to access in the GDPR's partner legislation, the Data Protection Law Enforcement Directive. When the EU Directive is transposed into Member State national law, the right of access may be suspended or restricted, as in the case of Germany in Article 34 of its Bundesdatenschutzgesetz. Moreover, on the European level, Europol offers a right of access. In the current Member State United Kingdom, the website of the Information Commissioner's Office states regarding Subject Access Requests (SARs): \\"You have the right to find out if an organisation is using or storing your personal data. This is called the right of access. You exercise this right by asking for a copy of the data, which is commonly known as making a ‚Äòsubject access request\\". Before the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force on 25 May 2018 organisations could charge a specified fee for responding to a SAR, of up to ¬£10 for most requests. Following the GDPR: \\"A copy of your personal data should be provided free in a commonly used and machine readable format. An organisation may charge for additional copies. It can only charge a fee if it thinks the request is ‚Äòmanifestly unfounded or excessive‚Äô. If so, it may ask for a reasonable fee for administrative costs associated with the request.\\"  Singapore  Personal data in Singapore is protected under the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (PDPA). The PDPA establishes a data protection law that comprises various rules governing the collection, use, disclosure and care of personal data. Access to personal data is laid out as part of Part IV, chapter 21 which states that on request of an individual, an organisation shall, as soon as reasonably possible, provide the individual with : * (a) personal data about the individual that is in the possession or under the control of the organisation; and * (b) information about the ways in which the personal data referred to in paragraph (a) has been or may have been used or disclosed by the organisation within a year before the date of the request  United States  Five federal laws include a right of access to personal data: * FCRA Fair Credit Reporting Act, * FERPA Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, * COPPA Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, * HIPAA Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. * Privacy Act of 1974. In addition, some state laws like the CCPA California Consumer Privacy Act have started to include this right.  Brazil  According to the Brazilian General Data Protection Law, Subject Access Requests need to be fulfilled within 15 days.  Transatlantic data flows  Transatlantic data flows (or at least those going West, towards the US) are governed by the EU‚ÄìUS Privacy Shield. One of the Privacy Shield principles is the right of access. Indeed, it is most fundamental in enabling accountability mechanisms around personal data processing. This example demonstrates that a European-style conception of privacy does not necessarily have to be perceived by American actors as unduly imposing new restrictions on free speech by data subjects. This Privacy Shield practice also shows that the case of civilian data protection (as under GDPR) is quite different from the case of criminal investigation, where a right of access is exercised as a \\"data request\\" by a government, not an individual, as in the US Supreme Court case Microsoft Corp. v. United States. The individual in criminal cases does maintain a right to know what data is being used about him/her, and of what crime s/he is accused.  United Nations  The aspirational Sustainable Development Goal 16, target 9, calls for the provision of legal identity for all human beings. \\"In the digital economy, this becomes the right to a digital identity.\\" Such an identity could help in filing Subject Access Requests.

It was established 1675 and closed in 1905. The dockyard was initially administered by the Navy Board then later the Board of Admiralty. History In 1675 the British first made use of a wharf at Port Royal and assigned a resident Naval Officer to superintend these facilities;. Following the 1692 earthquake, Port Royal never fully recovered from its preeminent position as a major commercial center. Despite this the dockyard served as the headquarters of the British Royal Navy in the Caribbean. From the eighteenth century until the nineteenth century, various refurbishments and upgrade work were undertaken to improve its docks, facilities fortifications and. From 1735 new wharves and storehouses were built at this time, as well as housing for the officers of the Yard. Over the next thirty years, more facilities were added: cooperages, workshops, sawpits, and accommodation (including a canteen) for the crews of ships being careened there. by the end of the 18th century, a small Victualling Yard had been added to the east of the yard, prior to this ships had had to go to Kingston and other settlements to take on supplies) and in 1817 a Royal Naval Hospital was constructed the west of the yard. The dockyard and continued to be an important naval base until 1905 when it was closed. . The dockyard was first administered by the Navy Board and later Board of Admiralty until 1869 after which it was administered as part of the Department of the Director Dockyards of the Admiralty. It was a component part of the Jamaica Station until 1830 then part of the North America and West Indies Station until 1838, then finally part of North America and West Indies Station until 1905. Administration of the dockyard and other key officials Port Royal and Kingston Harbours (map of 1774) The Master Shipwright was usually the key official at the royal navy dockyards until the introduction of resident commissioners by the Navy Board who were responsible for administrating naval yards; after which he became deputy to the resident commissioner. In 1832 the post of commissioner was usually replaced by the post of admiral superintendent.

History = Z√ºrichsee‚ÄìGotthardbahn = The Z√ºrichsee‚ÄìGotthardbahn (which is listed in Swiss federal statistics as the Rapperswil‚ÄìPf√§ffikon company) commenced operations over the newly built Seedamm (causeway) from Rapperswil to Pf√§ffikon on 27 August 1878. The ambitious goal of the joint stock company was the construction of a rail link from Eastern Switzerland to the Gotthard Railway (Gotthardbahn, GB) which was still under construction, and continuing along the shore of Lake Lucerne via Vitznau and K√ºssnacht to Rotkreuz. In 1879 alone, more than 160,000 Swiss francs were invested in planning a projected extension from Pf√§ffikon to . Steam train on the Seedamm, Rapperswil on the left, mountain panorama in the background The federal government contributed 100,000 francs to the cost of the causeway construction, which included a road and a footpath as well as the railway. In addition to the operation and maintenance of the railway, the ZGB was responsible for maintaining the road on the causeway. In order to be able to dispense with further investments in rolling stock and operational facilities, the ZGB transferred operations to the United Swiss Railways (Vereinigte Schweizerbahnen; VSB), which had a large rolling stock depot in Rapperswil. The operations, which always ran at a deficit, stopped at Rapperwil, where the ZGB connected with the Lake Z√ºrich left-bank railway. = S√ºdostbahn = Although the company had a concession to build a link to the Gotthard Railway, no significant effort was made to build it. When another initiative committee tried to get a concession for a Pf√§ffikon‚ÄìBrunnen or Pf√§ffikon‚ÄìArth-Goldau railway, the ZGB sold it the land surveys that it had already carried out. Finally, on 12 August 1889, the existing initiative committees, the W√§denswil-Einsiedeln-Bahn (W√§denswil-Einsiedeln Railway) and the ZGB signed a merger agreement to found the S√ºdostbahn (Swiss Southeastern Railway; SOB). The SOB started operations on 1 January 1890 and ended VSB operations on the Rapperswil‚ÄìPf√§ffikon line on 5 August 1891. When the SOB acquired the ZGB, nearly 90 percent of the share capital and 25 percent of the fixed bonds were written off. The S√ºdostbahn, to which the Rapperswil‚ÄìPf√§ffikon line now belonged, opened the Pf√§ffikon‚ÄìArth-Goldau railway on 8 August 1891, which gave Rapperswil access to the Gotthard Railway. The SOB started electric operations on 15 May 1939. A section of double-track between Pf√§ffikon Nord and Pf√§ffikon has relieved the congested line over the Seedamm since 6 June 2004. SBB S-Bahn services are now operated over the SOB line.

The intent of the campaign was to demonstrate the vulnerability of Native American villages in the Northwest Territory, to take captives who could be used for peace negotiations, and to keep the forces of the Western Confederacy off balance in preparation for a larger 1791 led by Arthur St. Clair. The name Blackberry Campaign was given because soldiers stopped to pick berries to supplement their food supplies. Campaign Following their defeat in the 1790 Harmar Campaign, the United States planned for a new campaign against Native Americans in the Northwest Territory. The main force would come from the First American Regiment and militia forces under Arthur St. Clair in Fort Washington. Leaders of the Kentucky militia were ordered to organize and lead a punitive campaign against Native Americans as a diversion from this main force. Charles Scott, a popular figure in Kentucky, quickly raised a force of nearly 1,000 mounted militia, and was therefore given command over the entire force. The purpose of Scott's campaign was to prove to the Native American nations that they were within reach of the United States, to disrupt raids against US settlements, and to divert their attention from St. Clair's campaign. United States Secretary of War Henry Knox also wanted to capture \\"as many as possible, particularly women and children,\\" whose freedom could then be a condition of future peace negotiations. St. Clair said the raid was also to \\"gratify the people of Kentucky,\\" for whom this was a chance to salvage their pride after the previous year's defeats. St. Clair's force was delayed by recruiting, training, and supply, but the militia's terms of service would soon expire, so he reluctantly gave the Kentucky militia permission to begin their campaign independently. Scott's mounted force crossed the Ohio River on 19 May 1791, near the mouth of the Kentucky River. On 23 May, the militia began their march north, burning villages along the way. Native American forces, aware of a pending invasion, presumed the target of Scott's expedition was Kekionga, as the Harmar Campaign had been the previous year. According to British agent Alexander McKee, approximately 2,000 warriors gathered at Kekionga to meet the invaders. On 1 June, a hundred miles away, Scott's forces were spotted about 5 miles from the Wea town of Ouiatenon, on the Wabash River. Having been spotted, Scott ordered his columns to advance quickly. A detachment under John Hardin split off to attack two smaller Kickapoo villages, while Scott led the main attack on Ouiatenon. An unknown number of inhabitants escaped to a Kickapoo village across the river, but Scott reached the town before the evacuation was complete. A battalion under James Wilkinson rushed to the river a fired into the crowded evacuation boats, which Scott reported \\"virtually destroyed all the occupants of five canoes.\\" Scott had the town burned and the crops destroyed. He reported 32 Native Americans killed. Only 6 prisoners were captured at Ouiatenon, but Hardin returned with an additional 52 prisoners from the two smaller villages, mostly women and children. Unaware that most warriors were waiting for him at Kekionga, Scott declared that they had fled out of fear and left their women and children undefended. He wanted to continue on to Kithtippecanunk to the north, but the militia's horses were too exhausted for the 18 mile trip. Instead, Wilkinson led a detachment of 360 dismounted men to the village and destroyed it, returning to Ouiatenon 12 hours later. Wilkinson described Kithtippecanunk as inhabited by French and Native Americans, living in about 70 \\"well finished\\" hourses, and that \\"by the books, letters, and other documents found there\\" to be in \\"close connection with, and dependent on, Detroit.\\" The militia remained in the area of Ouiatenon until 4 June, burning several villages. The arrived near Louisville 10 days later. Scott released 16 of the weakest captives, sending them with a message that the remaining prisoners could be recovered if the Native Americans would report to the U.S. fort on the Great Miami River to \\"bury the hatchet and smoke the pipe of peace.\\" 41 women and children were transferred to Captain Asheton of the First American Regiment on 15 June and sent to Fort Steuben, near the modern border of Ohio and Pennsylvania. Aftermath The gathered Native American forces at Kekionga began to disperse in mid-June when the United States force did not arrive. One group had heard rumors that Scott's forces had gone to Vincennes, instead, and discovered the destroyed villages on their journey down the Wabash River. They initially pursued the militia, but could not keep pace with Scott's mounted forces. Native American leaders complained that the British had goaded them to war without providing them with the armament to fight it. McKee sent a letter to Sir Guy Carleton, writing that \\"little attention will be now paid\\" to potential talks of peace. Joseph Brant, who had promoted a moderate position towards the United States at Niagara and Quebec before joining the rush to Kekionga, wrote that the Shawnee and Miami had vowed not to negotiate with a people \\"so wicked.\\" In Kentucky, the raid was considered a great success, and many called for a second raid before the end of Summer. That August, James Wilkinson, who had been offered a commission in the regular Army after his role in the Blackberry Campaign, led a similar expedition starting from Fort Washington, resulting in the Battle of Kenapacomaqua. Henry Knox considered the raids a success, writing \\"The consternation arising from the demonstration of their being within our reach must all tend to the great object, the establishment of peace.\\" Confidence in the main 1791 campaign increased, and shares in the Ohio Company soared. However, Beverley Randolph, the governor of Virginia, wrote that the expedition only incited the Wabash Confederacy against the United States. Both the Blackberry Campaign and the subsequent raid by Wilkinson were intended as a diversion to draw Native American forces away from the main expeditionary force led by General Arthur St. Clair in 1791. They had the opposite effect, however, rallying Native American forces against the United States and leading to St. Clair's Defeat. Members of the Wea tribe traveled to Fort Washington and Fort Knox to claim their imprisoned family, but were told that were told that peace would not be granted until all the Wabash nations came and pledged peace, and until they acted like men rather than children. The captured villagers were not released until nearly a year had passed.

She was an advocate for the Brazilian women's right to vote, writing newspapers, theater plays and poems. According to Augusto Blake's Dicion√°rio Bibliogr√°fico Brasileiro, Josefina was born in Itabora√≠ and was a half-sister of the writer √Ålvares de Azevedo. She, however, said she was Azevedo's cousin and to have born in Recife, where she lived until she was twenty-six years-old. In 1877, she moved to S√£o Paulo, where she founded 1888 the newspaper A Fam√≠lia. The following year she moved to Rio de Janeiro,and kept publishing until 1897, when she had to interrupt it, resuming the newspaper in 1898. Azevedo defended the education of women as an essential tool for their emancipation. She sought to extend the circulation of his newspaper throughout the country, traveling to the North and Northeast regions of Brazil. She promoted the feminine suffrage in the 1890 article O Direito ao Voto (The Right to Vote), a year after the proclamation of the Brazilian Republic. She wrote in the same year the comedy O Voto Feminino, (Women's Vote), staged in the Teatro Recreio Dram√°tico. Still in 1890, she gathered a series of texts that she had published in the newspaper, including poetry, and edited them in the compilation Retalhos.  A Fam√≠lia  In 1877, Azevedo publishes the newspaper A Fam√≠lia (The Family). The journal's main purpose was to address women's education, but with the political transition experienced by Brazil, it shifted to assert women's rights and to have their voices represented on political issues and to vote, for example. After six months in S√£o Paulo, the newspaper began to be published in Rio de Janeiro, since Josefina moved there. According to Karine da Rocha, coordinator of the Center for Research in Women, Literature and Society (Federal University of Pernambuco), this change took place with the intention of a greater acceptance of the newspaper due to its proximity to the Court. The newspaper ran uninterruptedly until the year 1897, always wanting to give voice to women in matters such as education and politics. After a year, in 1898, it returns to circulate, which can be concluded by the thank-you note of the magazine A Mensageira In A Fam√≠lia's first edition, Josefina says that the press can serve as a valve that can awaken an individual's conscience. Thus, through the newspaper, it was intended to show that there was no reason for the differentiation that existed at the time between men and women, with women considered inferior when compared to men. In that same edition, it is still possible to see the dissatisfaction, both of Josefina and other journalists, regarding the division that existed at the time. According to her, the two principles that existed were strength and order, where she delegates the first to men and the second to women. In this way, the female sex should also be responsible for the coordination of society, since they, unlike men, were able to coordinate the homes. With the proclamation of the Brazilian Republic in November 1889, the discourse on women's right to vote became even stronger, since greater equality was expected in this new political model. However, women's rights in this respect have not changed, causing Josefina to criticize this fact in the 7 December 1889 issue, speaking of injustice and reiterating that the only aspect to be taken into account should be intellectual capacity.  O voto feminino  In 1890, Josefina Alvares de Azevedo wrote the play O voto feminino, which, before being staged, was advertised in some issues of A Fam√≠lia. The comedy's intention, as well as that of the newspaper, was to give voice to women in the Brazilian political scene, especially in the issue of the right to vote. The play was shown at the Teatro Recreio Dram√°tico, at the time, one of the most popular in Rio de Janeiro. The play took place at the home of a couple who received their son and son-in-law for dinner. Besides them, there is another couple (the maid and her husband) and a single man. They await the \\"result of a consultation submitted to a certain Minister regarding the enactment of the law of the female vote.\\" Despite being praised by the press before it even debuted, the play was staged only once. After that, it was published two other times: in the footers of the newspaper A Fam√≠lia and also in book form.

Services were held in the Welsh language. Early history Like several other Welsh chapels, Bethesda originated in a split in the congregation at Zoar Chapel nearby. In 1807, Daniel Lewis, the minister at Zoar, visited London and other places to raise funds to clear the chapel's debts. Some members of the congregation objected, and when an independent investigation found in favour of the minister, a number left to establish a new church. Initial meetings were held in rooms and premises at various places in the town, but in 1811 it was decided to build a chapel under the guidance of Methusalem Jones, who had become the minister. During Jones's ministry, there was considerable expansion in membership and a new chapel was built in 1829. Bethesda was also the mother church of a number of chapels in the locality including Bethania, Dowlais. Later history During the 1850s, the composer Joseph Parry was a member at Bethesda. During the ministry of Rhys Gwesyn Jones between 1858 and 1867 the membership reduced owing to the closure of Penydarren Ironworks. In the late 1870s it was decided to build a larger and more comfortable chapel, and the foundation stone was laid by Mrs W T Crawshay (wife of William Crawshay, the owner of Cyfarthfa Ironworks) in 1880. John Williams of Merthyr was the architect and the chapel was built by John Francis Davies of Dowlais. It was completed in 1881 at a cost of ¬£1,200.

His uncle founded the family's photography business (), and his father was the photographer . His son Jean Reutlinger (1891‚Äì1914) was also a prominent photographer.  Life  Born in Callao, Peru, Reutlinger became a photographer like his uncle and his father. He lived in Callao until 1883 and then, at his father's insistence, entered the studio in Paris, which his father had been running alone since 1880. He took over the studio from his father after 1890. Like his uncle, he took photos of popular actresses and opera singers from the beginning. Soon he also took fashion and advertising photos and photographed stars of the entertainment venues like the Moulin Rouge and the Folies Berg√®re. The photos were either sold to magazines and newspapers or reproduced as postcards. Especially the business with pictures in postcard format, which were often clearly influenced by Art Nouveau, was successful. Some of the pictures were colored and designed as photomontages. Reutlinger had an excellent reputation at the age of 40. He clearly trumped his uncle's success. He recorded among others Mata Hari, Cl√©o de M√©rode, Sarah Bernhardt, L√©onie Yahne, Anna Held and Lina Cavalieri. Reutlinger was also one of the pioneers of erotic photography. In 1891 his son Jean was born, who worked together with his father as a photographer from 1910. Jean died in 1914 in World War I.

After education at Lord Williams's Grammar School at Thame, Oxfordshire, Roy Mackenzie Stewart entered the University of Edinburgh Medical School and graduated there MB ChB (Edin.) in 1911. After serving on the staff of the Lancashire County Asylum at Prestwich, he joined in May 1915 the RAMC and was sent to France, where the explosion of a heavy gun caused him to have tinnitus for the remainder of his life. He was then stationed as a neurologist at Moss Side Military Hospital at Maghull (near Liverpool), from 1917 in 1918 in Salonica, and from May to November 1919 at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Netley. He received in 1920 the M.D. degree from the University of Edinburgh Medical School. In 1920 he became deputy medical superintendent of Whittingham Mental Hospital. In 1922 Stewart became medical superintendent of Leavesden Mental Hospital. He introduced new standards of medical and nursing care and established regimens of training and treatment that were advanced for the era of the 1920s. The hospital housed about 2,600 patients (mostly severe subnormals with birth defects). He personally examined each patient and personally conducted post-mortem examinations with extensive histological studies. His clinical and necropsy reports were extremely thorough and detailed, so much so that his numerous published articles consisted largely of direct quotations from his routine hospital notes. Stewart was elected FRCPE in 1929 and FRCP in 1942. He was in 1942 president of the neurology section of the Royal Society of Medicine. He was from 1943 to 1946 chair of the Mental Deficiency Committee and in 1946‚Äì1947 chair of the Mental Deficiency Section of the Royal Medico- Psychological Association. He gave in 1947 the Morison lecture on Infantile Cerebral Hemiplegia to the Royal College of Physicians, Edinburgh. Family Roy M. Stewart's father was Surgeon Rear-Admiral William Henry Stewart, M.D., deputy inspector general of the Royal Naval Medical Service. In 1923 Roy M. Stewart married Agnes Maud Stirling (1900‚Äì1994), daughter of Royal Navy Commander Thomas Willing Stirling (1866‚Äì1930), O.B.E. Roy and Agnes Stewart had two daughters and two sons. Their elder son, Desmond Stirling Stewart (1924‚Äì1981), was a prolific writer on Middle Eastern history and culture ‚Äì he wrote over a dozen books, including the Time-Life book Early Islam and a biography of T.

Early life and education Charles Dubost was born in October 1914 and educated in Paris. He had completed his medical studies before the onset of the Second World War. Surgical career Dubost joined H√¥pital Broussais after the Second World War and was appointed to cardiac surgery in the blue baby unit in 1947, the same year that Alfred Blalock demonstrated the Taussig-Blalock operation, a procedure Dubost then led in Europe. In January 1951, Dubost led one of the three surgical teams that performed early kidney transplants in Paris, the others being Ren√© K√ºss and Marceau Servelle. In the same year, he resected an abdominal aortic aneurysm and replaced it with a cadaveric graft that had been preserved by freezing and stored in N. Oeconomous's laboratory. In 1954, Dubost designed and used a mechanical dilator with two parallel blades which could be passed into the atrium and into the mitral orifice under digital control. He performed the first carotid endarterectomy under cardiac bypass and later performed one of the early transplants in 1968. Awards and honours In 1940, he won the Croix de Guerre as a young medical lieutenant. He became an officer of the l√©gion d'honneur and was elected to both Acad√©mie Nationale de M√©decine and the French Academy of Sciences.

Early life and career Rawert was born in Copenhagen, the son of J√∏rgen Heinrich Rawert (1751‚Äì1823) and Anna Maria Krieger (1758‚Äì1826). He passed grammar school in 1803 and then enrolled at the University of Copenhagen, but the nature of his studies is unknown. In 1809 he was employed as a copyist in the Kommercekollegiet. He became an associated member of the board of directors of the royal manufactories (overtalligt medlem af fabrikdirektionen), and a co- editor of Handels- og Industritidende (\\"Journal of Trade and Industry\\"), and, in 1812, a full board member. Travels and publications Prudelberg bey Stonsdorf in Riesengeb√ºrge, 1816 The state bankruptcy of 1813 left the country in a difficult situation. The position of editor of Handels- og Industritidende was suspended temporarily in 1814 and the board of management of the royal manufactories was dissolved in 1816, leaving Rawert out of work and with only a small pension (ventepenge). Rawert had visited Bornholm with Gottfried Garlieb in 1815 (their description of the island was published in 1818) and now received a royal stipend to study industrial enterprises on a journey abroad in 1816‚Äì19. He visited Germany, Switzerland, Italy, France, England, and The Netherlands. A visit to Ireland in October 1818 produced five pictures from the area of Dublin and Wicklow in manuscript form (Rawerts maleriske Reisebut, VI) but were not accompanied by a travel narrative. He then travelled widely in Denmark in 1819‚Äì21, publishing the Danske Egne (\\"Regions of Denmark\\") in 1819‚Äì23, The work was richly illustrated with copper print engraving by S√∏ren Henrik Petersen (1788-1860) based on his own and Rawert's drawings. His next work, Beretning om Industriens Tilstand i de danske Provindser (\\"An account of the Condition of Industrial Wnterprises in the Provinces\\"), published in 1820, received considerable attention. It described the sorry condition of industrial enterprises around the country and argued that the situation could only be improved through the establishment of polytechnic schools and other educational facilities. Later career Rawert was appointed as accessor in 1823 and once again served as editor of Handels- og Industritidende from 1825‚Äì44. In 1829, he once again became a member (ekstrakommitteret) of kommercekollegiet. He left it in 1831 to assume a position as customs inspector in Copenhagen as well as director of factories. New travels and publications, 1844-49 Reaert retired as customs inspector and editor of Handels- og Industritidende in 1844 but remained director of factories until his death. In 1844 and 1845 he travelled in Germany and Austria with economic support from Industrifonden and Den Reiersenske Fond. It resulted in small publications about the industry of Sachsen, W√ºrttemberg, Bavaria, Hannover and Austria in 1846‚Äì47. A similar publication about Sweden was published in 1847. He published Kongeriget Danmarks industrielle Forhold fra de √¶ldste Tider indtil Begyndelsen af 1848 in 1848. Personal life Rawert married Cathrine Actonia Christine Bugge (21 March 1786 - 1 April 1849) on 29 November 1827. She was a daughter of State Council secretary (gehejmekabinetssekret√¶r) Frederik Conrad Bugge (1754‚Äì1842) and Henriette Cathrine Henrichsen (1746‚Äì1830). After his first wife's death in 1840, Rawert married her younger sister, Henriette Cathrine Bugge (8 August 1801 - 25 April 1885), on 27 November 184. Legacy The Royal Danish Library contains approximately 1,400 coloured drawings from his travels. Rawert was not only interested in strengthening industrial development but also in the industrial history of the country. This resulted in numerous articles in Handels- og Industritidende. He began the publication of a work on the history of the textile industry in Denmark in 1813 but discontinued it for \\"several reasons\\" that he fails to specify. An article in Handels- og Industrietidende from 1825 about the state of trade in Denmark resulted in an official note of displeasure. Kongeriget Danmarks industrielle Forhold fra de √¶ldste Tider indtil Begyndelsen af 1848 (1848) is considered his most significant work. It is, however, rather a compilation of his earlier articles and publications than a coherent work which provides a clear overview of the subject. The kommercekollegiet archives provided him with much valuable information. Rawert's Almindeligt Varelexicon published in two volumes in 1831 and 1834 provides detailed information on everyday goods, their place of origin, and history, etc. Gallery File:Ole J√∏rgen Rawert- Hassel Jernv√¶rk ved Modum 1805 RA001020.jpg1805: Hassel Iron Works, Norway File:Ole J√∏rgen Rawert- Udsigten fra Paradiis Bakken.

Campus Konradsberg is a 62 000 square meter big campus located by R√•lambsv√§gen on Kungsholmen in the district Marieberg in Stockholm. The buildings on Campus Konradsberg is owned and managed by Skolfastigheter i Stockholm AB.  Background  The Konradsberg area with plans of new streets and blocks, 1940. Campus Konradsberg is named after the psychiatric hospital Konradsberg which was erected 1855‚Äì1871 by plans by the architect Albert T√∂rnqvist and is thereby the oldest building in the area. Fredh√§lls folkskola, drawn by Paul Hedqvist, is located to the far left on Campus Konradsberg and was inaugurated in 1938. In the 1950s, additional school buildings were added to the elementary school. Konradsberg was used for psychiatric care until 1995. Plans to demolish the hospital buildings were already made in the 1940s. Only the elementary school would remain, the rest including the entire Konradsberg park would be converted into residential blocks. On a city plan from 1944 it's clear how this was intended. North of the newly constructed R√•lambsv√§gen, Heidenstamsgatan and Lagerl√∂vsgatan stretched along the crossroads Beskowgatan, Lenngrensgatan, and Dahlgrensgatan. The street names were named after famous authors, just like in Fredh√§ll. The blocks were named after constellations such as Delfinen, S√∂dra Korset, Tvillingarna and Stora Bj√∂rnen, Lilla Bj√∂rnen, Enh√∂rningen, and V√•gen. Hedvigsbergs malmg√•rd was demolished in the year 1943, one of the historically valuable buildings, while the rest was left standing.  A campus is created  Konradsberg from the 1860s is the areas oldest building. Here lies Stockholms International Montessori School. In 1999 a new detailed plan won legal force that preserved most of the historic buildings on the campus area and enabled extensive renovations and extensions. The area was then owned by Akademiska Hus, which was rebuilt and expanded the buildings for the Stockholm Institute of Education. Among the architects who were employed were Brunnberg & Forshed arkitektkontor and Johan Celsings. In 2003, the School of Education moved into the area, which in addition to educational premises also provided a sports facility, called \\"R√∂relsecentrum\\" (today Konradsbergs idrottshall). A total of 23 houses were prepared which are named after famous authors, psychologists, educators and philosophers, such as \\"House B\\" (Elsa Beskow), \\"House C\\" (Marie Curie), \\"House F\\" (Friedrich Fr√∂bel), \\"House G\\" (Nikolaj Frederik Severin Grundtvig), \\"House J\\" (√âmile Jaques-Dalcroze), \\"House O\\" (Elise Ottesen-Jensen) \\"House R\\" (Jean-Jacques Rousseau), \\"House S\\" (Sokrates), \\"House Q\\" (Stina Quint), and \\"House Z\\" (Laurin Zilliacus). Only a few years after the move in Stockholm University decided that the College of Teachers would be integrated into the university's other activities at Frescati and the premises at Campus Konradsberg were therefore submitted step by step. Akademiska Hus then chose to develop the Campus Konradsberg into a school campus for schools with special qualification. An agreement was signed with Special Education School Authority (specialpedagogiska skolmyndigheten) and several special schools placed their business here, including Manillaskolan, H√§llsboskolan, and Stockholm International Montessor School. The latter moved into Konradsberg's old main building. After changing to school campus, about 3,000 children and young adults from preschool to high school receive their schooling here. Akademiska Hus Campus sold Konradsberg to Skolfastigheter i Stockholm AB (SISAB) in 2014. The property value exceeded 2 billion SEK.

He now holds an emeritus position. He is best known for his work in analytic aesthetics. He has published articles on the expressive powers of music, the aesthetic appreciation of nature, and the values of art. Regarding the expressive powers of (purely instrumental) music, Budd is known for defending a type of resemblance theory, such that music resembles some feature of emotions. However unlike Peter Kivy and Stephen Davies, Budd argues that music resembles the way that emotions feel. Budd was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1995.

In Germany, the game was launched by Pegasus Games in 2017. It is thematically based on the different fighting styles of Japanese martial arts. The game had a digital release in 2018. Equipment The game is played on a 5x5 board. Each player receives five pieces, one master piece placed in the middle back row, known as the Shrine, and four pupils placed on each side of the master. 16 movement cards are provided to dictate the movement of the pieces during the game. Five of the 16 movement cards are utilized per game. Gameplay The goal of the game is to capture the opponent's master piece, known as Way of the Stone, or move your master piece into your opponent's Shrine, known as the Way of the Stream. Players shuffle the 16 movement cards and then give two movement cards to each player and one movement card is placed on the side of the board for a total of 5 movement cards in play. Each piece can be captured and captures other pieces the same way which is based on the movement provided by the movement cards. After one player moves he or she must replace the movement card at the side with the used movement card, allowing both players rotating access to all 5 movement cards in play. Expansion Packs Two expansion packs were also released \\"Sensei's Path\\" which includes 16 unique, new, cards that can be used as a standalone set of move cards instead of those found in the base game. The other expansion pack is \\"The Way of the Wind\\" which introduces a new neutral piece that can be moved by both players. The wind spirit is an impassable object, neither students nor masters may move into a space occupied by it. Also, if the wind spirit lands on a student pawn, it does not capture it, instead, it swaps places with the student.

Resistive heating of a conductive material implanted in the thermoplastic melts the thermoplastic while a pressure is applied in order to fuse two parts together. The process settings such as current and weld time are important, because affect the strength of the joint. The quality of a joint made using implant resistance welding is determined using destructive strength testing of specimens.  Applications  Implant resistance welding is used to joint thermoplastic composite components in the aerospace industry. For example, PEEK and PEI Laminate components for use in U.S. Airforce aircraft and a GF-PPS component on the Airbus A380 are joined using implant resistance welding. Electrofusion welding is a specific type of implant resistance welding used to join pipes.  Process  During the implant resistance welding process, current is applied to a heating element implanted in the joint. This current flowing through the implant produces heat through electrical resistance, which melts the matrix. Pressure is applied to push the parts together and molecular diffusion occurs at the melted surfaces of the parts, creating a joint. =Implants= Implants serve as the source of heat to melt the thermoplastic. The heat is created through resistive heating as a current is applied to the implant. Two common types of implants are carbon fiber and stainless-steel mesh.  Carbon Fiber  The carbon fiber type implants can be further separated into unidirectional and fabric type implants. The unidirectional type carbon fibers do not transfer heat across the fibers easily, therefore, the carbon fiber fabric works better to evenly heat the entire surface. This difference affects the performance of the resulting weld, the welded joints using the carbon fiber fabric can have 69% higher shear strength and 179% more interlaminar fracture toughness, when compared to unidirectional carbon fibers. For carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics, the carbon fiber heating element matches the reinforcing material, avoiding the introduction of a new material.  Stainless Steel Mesh  Welded joints with stainless steel mesh implants tend to have higher strength than welds using carbon fiber implants and results in less air trapped in the joint. Stainless steel wire can be placed in between two layers of resin, to avoid leaving spaces in the holes of the mesh. However, there are reasons to avoid using stainless steel in favor of carbon fiber including, increased weight, the metal acts as a contaminant, possibility of stress concentrations, and possibility of corrosion. =Energy Input= The amount of energy input into the system (E) depends on the resistance of the heating elements (R), the current applied to the heating elements (I), and the amount of time the current is applied (t). Alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) both work in this process. The energy produced is calculated using the following equation: E=I^2Rt Research has shown the input variable with the most impact on the performance of the resulting joint is the current. The same amount of energy can by input into the part by applying a low current for a long period of time or if a high current is applied for a short amount of time. In general, a higher shear strength of the joint is achieved using the method with a higher current for a shorter time. Longer heating times at lower currents do not heat the joint surface as evenly. This can lead to the fiber reinforcement to move within the melted matrix. If the current is too high, however, it can result in residual stresses and warpage. For a given constant electrical power, the temperature of the material surrounding the implants is directly dependent on the weld time. The longer weld time, yields a higher temperature. The lapped shear strength and the weld time are also correlated. Initially, there is a positive correlation between weld time and strength. However, the strength peaks for a certain weld time, and beyond this optimal weld time, the strength decreases. =Pressure= Pressure is applied to the joining surfaces to prevent deconsolidation, allow intermolecular diffusion, and push air out of the joint. The pressure can be applied using displacement or pressure control. Pressure also ensures good contact between the implant and the bulk material, in order to increase electrical resistance. The pressure on the implant must create good contact without being so high that it severs the implant. This is achieved with pressures of 4 to 20 MPa for carbon fiber and 2 MPa for stainless steel mesh heating elements.  Strength Testing  Implant resistance welded lap shear strength specimen Lap shear strength (LSS) testing, in accordance with ASTM D 1002, is a method of destructive testing used to determine the strength of electrofusion welds of thermoplastic composite materials. For this test, two rectangular samples of the composite are lapped at the ends and joined at the lap interface using resistance implant welding. Then, a tension strength test is performed on the welded sample, with the joint surface being loaded in pure shear, a load frame machine pulls the sample until failure and measures the maximum load. The lap shear strength is the maximum tensile load imparted on the sample by the machine divided by the lapped area.  Failure Modes  Interfacial failure or tearing is when the resin or laminate in immediate contact with the heating element on either side is pulled away, leaving the mesh or fabric heating element exposed. This type of failure is associated with low LSS of the sample and can occur as a result of inadequate heat input into the weld. Another failure mode associated with low LSS is cohesive failure, which is a failure of the welded material, either the melted base material or resin surrounding the mesh. Cohesive failure is observed in samples with too much heat input during welding, which deteriorates the thermoplastic. Samples with high LSS generally fail due to debonding of the reinforcing fiber-matrix surface or other base material failure, known as intralaminar failure.

The EAFJD is the main interlocutor promoting Armenian issues in the European Union and other international organizations.  Activities  =EU-Armenia relations= One of the goals of the EAFJD is to strengthen the ties and deepen cooperation between Armenia and the member states of the EU. In 2013, with common efforts of the Mission of Armenia to the EU and the EAFJD a friendship group with Armenia was established in the European Parliament. The group was relaunched in February 2015, after the European Parliament's elections of 2014. The friendship group is currently composed of around 50 MEPs and fosters the cooperation between the two sides. As of 2018, the organization initiated the Vahan Hovhannisyan Internship Program which gives a opportunity to young Armenian professionals to get acquainted with the work of the EAFJD, as well as that of the European institutions, in particular the European Parliament. The EAFJD often cooperates and coordinates activities with the European Friends of Armenia organization.  Armenian Genocide Recognition The EAFJD's activities also aim at the recognition of the Armenian Genocide by Turkey and reparations. Since its establishment, the EAFJD has been also advocating for the condemnation and recognition of the Armenian Genocide by the parliaments of various European countries, as well as the European Parliament. The EAFJD contributed to the adoption of European Parliament resolution in April 2015 which reaffirms EP's condemnation on the Armenian Genocide and urges Turkey to come to terms with its past. Artsakh/Nagorno- Karabakh A focal aspect of the EAFJD's activities is advocacy for the fundamental right of the people of Artsakh to decide upon their own present and future as well as live in peace and dignity. The EAFJD undertakes initiatives and projects aimed at promoting people-to-people contact and exchange with the people of Artsakh. In order to foster dialogue between the EU and Artsakh, the organization puts special emphasis on the development of the parliamentary diplomacy between the National Assembly of Artsakh and legislative bodies of the EU member states, as well as the European Parliament. During the past few years the EAFJD contributed to the establishment of friendship groups with Artsakh in several parliaments in Europe. The EAFJD organizes and facilitates fact-finding missions of public and political figures to Artsakh in order to obtain firsthand information about the reality and developments in the country. The EAFJD's aim is to overcome the stereotype of Artsakh/Nagorno-Karabakh as a conflict zone and present various aspects of its society and the daily life of the people of Artsakh, as well as its rich tourism potential and unique cultural heritage. The organization makes continuous efforts towards strengthening democracy, supporting the active civil society, contributing to the economic development and advancing human rights in Artsakh. Armenian Communities in the Middle East The European Armenian Federation for Justice and Democracy sensitizes on the issues of the Armenian communities in the Middle East, notably in Syria. In this framework the EAFJD initiated and facilitated a fact-finding mission comprising Belgian MP George Dallemagne and a number of journalists to the Syrian cities of Kessab and Lattakia to obtain up-to-date information on the situation of Christian minorities, particularly Armenians living there. =Community Activism= As an umbrella organization, the EAFJD coordinates the activities of its member organizations‚ÄîCommittees for the Defense of the Armenian Cause (ANCs) in Europe and organizes events so as to make the voice of the Armenians of diaspora heard. Every four years the EAFJD organizes the European Armenian Convention which brings together Armenian and European officials, politicians religious leaders, representatives of academia, media, civil society to discuss challenges as well as the ways ahead. The most recent convention took place in Brussels in 17‚Äì18 October 2017. More than 300 participants from different countries of Europe and the world were present at the event. Short-Term Observation Missions to Artsakh Acknowledging the crucial role of election observation in democracy-building and promoting human rights, especially in new emerging democracies, such as Artsakh, the EAFJD deploys short-term observation missions (STOs) to the electoral processes in Artsakh Republic based on the election observation methodology of the OSCE/ODIHR. In 2015 the EAFJD deployed an independent international STO mission to obverse the parliamentary elections in Artsakh. In 2017 another highly-experienced short-term international mission was deployed to observe the Referendum on the drafted Constitution of Artsakh. These two observation missions were first in their format and professionalism as they were based on the methodology of the OSCE/ODIHR. Besides, they were another step towards breaking the isolation of Artsakh Republic, as many international organizations still refrain from deploying election observation missions to Artsakh Republic due to its unrecognized status.

The spent catalyst is an osmium(VI) complex, which reacts with a reoxidant to regenerate Os(VIII). Typical reoxidants for this application include pyridine- N-oxide, ferricyanide/water, and N-methylmorpholine N-oxide. =Vanadium(III)-based alkene polymerizations= As catalysts for the polymerization of dienes, vanadium complexes are activated with alkylaluminium chlorides, e.g. diethylaluminium chloride. The organoaluminium reagent installs alkyl groups on the V(III) precatalyst. During catalysis or during catalyst activation, some vanadium(III) is reduced to inactive vanadium(II) derivatives. To correct for this reduction, reoxidants such as methyl trichloroacetate are added. The alkyl chloride functions as a source of a chlorine radical, which adds to the inactive V(II) species.

During World War I, she travelled from Serbia to the United States to secure relief packages from donors to help soldiers and orphans. When the war ended, she established an orphanage in Gu√©thary, France to care for orphans of the Spanish Civil War. She was honoured for her service with Serbia's highest award, the Order of the White Eagle. Early life Jelena Lozaniƒá was born on 12 March 1885 in Belgrade, Kingdom of Serbia to Stanka (n√©e Paƒçiƒá) and Sima Lozaniƒá. Her mother was related to the and her father was a Serbian chemist, president of the Serbian Royal Academy, and the first rector of the University of Belgrade, who also served as a minister of foreign affairs, minister of industry and diplomat. She was the youngest of three siblings after (1878-1963), who would become an academic and chemist and Ana, later Marinkoviƒá (1881-1973), who would become a noted painter. Activism In 1910, Lozaniƒá became the foreign-corresponding secretary of the National Serbian Women's Alliance (). That same year, she attended The Second International Conference of Socialist Women in Copenhagen, as a delegate for the Serbian Women's Council. Attending the 1911 International Woman Suffrage Alliance (IWSA)'s 6th Congress in Stockholm, Lozaniƒá was drawn to discussions of women's education and the links between women's issues and teaching in Serbia. Between 1912 and 1913 during the Balkan Wars, Lozaniƒá worked in \\"Saint Helena\\" orphanage and completed a nursing course to assist with tending the wounded at a convalescent center in Vraƒçar. On 4 February 1913, she wrote a letter regretting the inability of the National Serbian Women's Alliance to send delegates to the IWSA conference to be held that year in Budapest because of a diplomatic incident between Hungarians and Serbs earlier in the year. The masthead shows her name in cyrillic script and in French, as Hel√®ne Losanitch, but she signed the letter as Ellen. In 1914, with the invasion of Serbia by Austria during World War I, Losanitch fled with her family to the wartime capital in Ni≈°. Working at a hospital there, in November 1914, the Serbian Red Cross appointed her as a representative to secure humanitarian aid from the United States. She traveled in January 1915, making stops throughout the U. S. and Canada. Losanitch returned to Serbia only to participate with her family in the Albanian retreat across the Prokletije Mountains. Setting up an organization, known as the Serbian Child Welfare association, Losanitch made three trips to the Americas between 1915 and 1920 to raise funds and supplies to assist refugees, with food, clothing and medical supplies to combat typhus and tuberculosis. She also worked with the Committee for the Relief of Serbia, located in California and northern France to secure dairy cattle and grain for Serbian farmers. At home in Serbia, Losanitch was very active in setting up field hospitals. When the war ended, she was appointed to head the State Assistance Committee, and primarily focused on establishing homes for war orphans. She returned to the United States and met John Whipple Frothingham, an American Red Cross worker who had been sent to Serbia Between 1917 and 1919. Working together, the two established the Frothingham Children's Institute in Serbia and founded the Serbo-American Institute of Serbia. For her humanitarian work, she was decorated in 1920 with the Order of the White Eagle, Serbia's highest honor. By the end of 1920, Losanitch and Frothingham were engaged and the couple married on 3 January 1921 in a double ceremony held at the St. Nicholas Russian Orthodox Cathedral in Manhattan and the Church of the Saviour in Brooklyn. After their marriage, the couple continued to work together on humanitarian projects, living part of the year at their home in Greenburgh, Westchester County, New York, where their daughter Anna was born in 1923, and part of the year at an estate in Gu√©thary in the Basque Country of France. During the Spanish Civil War, the couple used their home in Gu√©thary as an orphanage and center to help reunite separated children with their families. Both Frothingham's father and husband died in 1935, and she and her daughter returned to Greenburgh. In 1941 Frothingham founded the Committee of American Friends of Yugoslavia, which would later become the Yugoslav Relief Fund. In the late 1940s she relocated her home to Greenwich, Connecticut and resumed travel between the United States and France. In 1970, she published Mission for Serbia: Letters from America and Canada, a collection of her letters which had been sent to her family during the six years she traveled doing war relief work during the First World War. Death and legacy Frothingham died in France on 6 February 1972 and is remembered as an example of patriotism and service in Serbia.

Named by the city's founder, General William Jackson Palmer, the spring honors Chief Tahama, famed Indian scout of Zebulon Montgomery Pike. When the local Parks Board commissioned a pavilion in 1926 to commemorate these early pioneers, the name ‚ÄúTahama Spring‚Äù was selected and inscribed on decorative limestone-carved cartouches above each entrance. Tahama Spring pavilion designed in the Spanish Colonial Revival style by architect Elmer L. Nieman History Zebulon Pike's Indian guide was recognized by many names including Tahama, Tahamie and Tamahaw, and was also recorded as Tamaha. Pike's memoirs and the writings of Elliott Coues, Edward D. Neill, J. Fletcher Williams and Charles A. Eastman all confirm that these names are for the same individual: Pike's honorable guide whose name distinguishes the original spring in Colorado Springs. In Pike's memoirs, the explorer refers to Tahama as L‚ÄôOrignal Leve‚Äô, which was the French translation of his native name, Rising Moose. Commentary in Pike's memoirs also notes the Indian chief's Dakota names mentioned above. Pike writes that Tahama is his friend in journal entires in 1805 and it is presumed the two men traveled together to what is now Colorado. Tahama later chose to be called by the Dakota word, ‚ÄúTamahay,‚Äù a nickname he received as a youth, because it means ‚Äúpike,‚Äù a fish. Tahama was amused by the pun, but he was equally honored to share the name of his close friend. While accounts differ on the dates of Tahama's birth and death, it appears Pike and Tahama were the same age. When the Pike expedition tried the ascent of the mountain known today as Pikes Peak, the two men were reported to be 27 years old. Each was regarded as a leader and a warrior, but being similar in age, they were peers, truly comrades, and likely shared stories and laughter during their challenging journey. They continued their rapport for many years and served together in the War of 1812. The Pike expedition opened the central-west and southwest region to trade and the growth of industry and settlements. In 1870, Palmer created the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad (D&RG;) and envisioned connecting Denver south to a new resort community and eventually to Mexico. He founded Colorado Springs along Monument Creek, due east of Pikes Peak, where mineral springs had been reported. The local newspaper detailed how mineral water was piped to the D&RG; depot in 1871, but those improvements were lost in periodic flooding along the shifting creek basin. During excavations in 1880 to accommodate a new railroad bridge for the D&RG;, Monument Creek was reconfigured in an area just north of downtown Colorado Springs. Within the newly carved creek banks, numerous chalybeate mineral springs slowly reemerged and were discovered by Dr. Charles Gatchell. Iron salts from the spring water had discolored the creek banks allowing Gatchell to trace the flow to the source. Many enjoyed the mineral springs, and Palmer often visited the area to draw water. However, continued flooding over the next few years buried the springs with sands, and the source of the mineral water was again lost for a time. With the area covered, it was neglected and became unsightly and littered with bottles and tin cans by vagrants. Intending to memorialize the community's original spring and to beautify the surrounding grounds, Palmer envisioned Monument Valley Park, a world-class public green similar to those he had seen in England. In 1904, he tasked chief engineer Edmond C. Van Diest to create a ‚Äúcharming and picturesque‚Äù network of gardens, water features and bridges. Palmer also announced plans for a handsome structure at the mineral spring, comparable to the finely crafted springhouses in neighboring Manitou Springs. To locate the spring, Palmer and his good friend, park enthusiast Mrs. Gilbert McClurg, visited the park's site and flagged the spring's approximate whereabouts. Palmer then directed his engineer team to begin an excavation. Once the spring was located, the water flow was traced inland about 50 feet from the creek bank and a cistern structure was built to a depth of 12 feet. A font was erected at grade with a pipe extending downward to the water flow, and a hand pump was installed to bring water to the surface. While many referred to the spring initially as ‚ÄúCarlsbad Spring,‚Äù Palmer preferred naming the spring after Zebulon Pike's Indian scout. This would commemorate Tahama's service in the expedition, which was crucial to opening the high plains and foothills for Palmer and his new community. Palmer had already honored Pike with a statue of the explorer near the main entrance of the Antlers Hotel, and he was eager to honor Tahama as well. The mineral spring was enjoyed by the public, and, in June 1905, Edward C. Schneider, a professor at Colorado College, published an analysis of the mineral content and proclaimed the water's purity. The source of the spring water was also documented. ‚ÄúWater flows from the west along a shale layer and empties into Monument Creek,‚Äù Schneider noted, and the water ‚Äúis not sourced or influenced by the creek, but is pure.‚Äù The mineral spring was a popular feature of Monument Valley Park, which was completed for public use in November 1907, but its name was undecided. As a placeholder, Palmer had simply noted ‚ÄúMineral Spring‚Äù on the map of the park. Tragically, Palmer was paralyzed in a horseback riding accident in 1906 and died in 1909. Some years later, community leaders sought ideas from the public to honor Palmer. It was then, in 1923, that McClurg proposed a memorial to Palmer, Pike and Tahama and to carry out Palmer's wishes in naming the mineral spring. The public agreed and embraced McClurg's proposal. Soon after, the Parks Board selected ‚ÄúTahama‚Äù as the name for the spring and commissioned the design of a pavilion. The structure was to be a memorial to ‚ÄúTahama, the native; Lieut. Zebulon Pike, the explorer, and Gen. William J. Palmer, the founder.‚Äù The pavilion and refurbished spring font opened in the summer of 1926. Designed in the Spanish Colonial Revival style by architect Elmer L. Nieman, the pavilion was octagonal in plan, constructed of masonry and embellished with limestone accents and terracotta roofing. Four opposing arches had iron railings with integral benches facing inward toward the font while the alternating four arches served as entrances. Bronze medallions were placed on the interior above each entrance with castings in the likenesses of Tahama, Pike, and Palmer and a fourth plaque offered a brief epitaph on each man. A few years later a bridge was installed to link Tahama Spring directly to the downtown area allowing pedestrians easier access from the east side of the creek. Local resident and park neighbor, Helen McCaffrey, recalled in 2015 during an interview with the Historic Preservation Alliance of Colorado Springs (HPA),Long, Jeffrey. (2015). Interview with Helen McCaffrey. [Colorado Springs]: Historic Preservation Alliance of Colorado Springs. that she often crossed that bridge to reach the spring. She also confirmed that the pavilion was a roofed structure where she and a high school sweetheart would often visit. Regrettably, the bridge was washed away in the flood of 1935 and the spring and pavilion were moderately damaged. Hoping to prevent future catastrophes, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) made substantial modifications to the park grounds by widening the channel and increasing the height of the creek banks. WPA workers also restored the pavilion and font and the community prized Tahama Spring water for the next 30 years. Even with the taller WPA creek banks, heavy rains and subsequent flooding in May 1965 badly damaged the memorial pavilion and font. The pavilion was later razed and the font was capped. With little more than a slab remaining, and being obscured by the elevated creek banks, Tahama Spring, the city's original spring and namesake, was nearly forgotten. Restoration Recently more than 150 people raised their glasses with a toast to Tahama Spring and tasted the spring's delicious mineral water. This marked the first time in 53 years that anyone had done so. Collected and polished just days before, the spring water was enjoyed and celebrated by guests at the HPA annual awards gala. This HPA event formally kicked off the full restoration of Tahama Spring, its memorial pavilion and the surrounding grounds. The reconstructed pavilion will rest above the flood plain, but will otherwise follow the original design. Tahama Spring water will flow from a limestone font and through a handcrafted pump, both replicated to match the earliest components. Inside the restored pavilion will be wall-mounted reproductions of the original bronze medallions honoring Tahama, Pike and Palmer. Tahama and Pike are represented as young men from the expedition at age 27. Palmer, who was a railroad tycoon at the age of 32, is represented as a young industrialist.

It is the final evolution of Froakie, the Water-type starter Pokemon of X and Y, with either the ability 'Torrent' or 'Protean', with 'Battle Bond' as an event ability, enabling it to become Ash-Greninja, and the immediate evolution of Frogadier. Categorized as the \\"Ninja Pok√©mon\\", Greninja is a Water- and Dark-type Pokemon who is a frog-like master of swiftness and stealth. It appeared prominently in the XY series of the Pok√©mon anime as one of Ash Ketchum's primary Pokemon, voiced by Y≈´ji Ueda. This Greninja used its bond with Ash to transform into a unique form, Ash-Greninja, which was later released to the games as an empowered form of Greninja accessible to players of the Pokemon Sun and Moon Special Demo Version. Greninja was introduced as a playable fighter to the Super Smash Bros. franchise with Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U as one of the Pokemon series' five representatives, and was integrated into manga such as Pok√©mon Adventures. Greninja has been met with a very positive reception, quickly becoming one of the most popular Pok√©mon of the sixth generation because of its endearing design and strength in competitive play. Its popularity has resulted in its integration into various merchandising and promotions of the Pok√©mon franchise. Concept and characteristics Greninja is a streamlined frog-like creature with dark blue skin and a beige underbelly, with long limbs and thin, slender physique particularly reminiscent of tree frogs. What resembles a pink scarf is actually its prehensile tongue wrapped around its head. Two long, ear-like protrusions extend from both sides of its head and connect with a smaller horn-like structure in the middle by azure blue-colored webbing. Spots of the same azure coloring can be found on each thick thigh, arguably resembling ninja stars or battle scars. Much like a frog, Greninja has webbed feet, wall-clinging suction cups on each digit, and powerful hind legs. It shoots streams of compressed ejaculate patterns from its palms. A large bubble can be found on each limb. A bipedal creature, Greninja can comfortably stand on its hind legs, but leans on one of its front limbs in a crouching stance when in battle. When at rest its eyes are white with hyphen-shaped pupils, but when engaged they gain red, oval-shapes irises, white pupils, and a narrow gaze. It only weighs 88.2 lbs. (40 kg), but is still quite tall at 4' 11\\" (1.5 m). It shares a motif of role-playing game classes with its Grass-type (Chesnaught) and Fire-type (Delphox) counterparts; while the former resemble a knight and witch respectively, Greninja draws heavy inspiration from the ninja. In Japan, frogs and toads have long been associated with ninjutsu through the folk story \\"The Tale of the Gallant Jiraiya\\" (ÂÖêÈõ∑‰πüË±™ÂÇëÁâ©Ë™û Jiraiya G≈çketsu Monogatari), a story about a ninja who can shapeshift into a large toad. Greninja is able to move with \\"a ninja's grace\\", and has a design and set of abilities associated with Ninjutsu. Among its attacks are the formerly exclusive Water Shuriken, which lets it quickly fire throwing stars made from compressed water, Shadow Sneak, and Double Team. It is also the only Pokemon to learn Mat Block, which shields the user's side with a flipped-up mat. The Protean ability, which lets the user camouflage to the type of the attack it uses, is exclusive to Greninja and the chameleon Pokemon Kecleon (as well as the former's pre- evolutions). Capable of vanishing and reappearing quickly, it enjoys toying with enemies in such a manner. It is very adaptable, learning many moves such as Bounce, Extrasensory, and Low Kick from different types. Greninja's stealth and swiftness are unique among Water-type starters, contrasting with previous designs like Blastoise and Swampert. It shoots jets of compressed water from its hands, as opposed to many other Water-types that shoot water from their mouths. It was created by Yusuke Ohmura, who designed the Water-type starters of the previous two generations as well as the mascot creatures for X and Y, Xerneas and Yveltal. Greninja's design was finalized by Ken Sugimori, Game Freak's art director. As Pok√©mon X and Y take place in Kalos, a fictional region inspired by France, Greninja's name combines the French word for frog (grenouille) and \\"ninja\\". It is used for the English, Spanish, and Italian localizations of X and Y. Ironically, a completely different name is used in the French localization, with \\"Amphinobi\\" combining the French word for amphibian (amphibie) and \\"shinobi\\". Its Japanese name is \\"Gekkouga\\", combining the Japanese word for croak („Åí„Åì„Å£ geko) and the Koga ninjutsu school (Áî≤Ë≥ÄÊµÅ K≈çga ry≈´). Appearances =In video games= Pok√©mon game series Greninja debuted in Pok√©mon X and Y, which was released internationally on October 12, 2013 for the Nintendo 3DS. As is the case for most Pokemon evolved from starters, Greninja is rare except from choosing Froakie at the game's beginning and fully training it. It can only be obtained otherwise by evolving a Friend Safari Frogadier, by fully evolving the Froakie named \\"Froabble\\" in- game rival Shauna trades to the player after the game's completion, or through trading with another player. It can be transferred to Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire through trade, or into Sun and Moon and Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon through the online storage system Pok√©mon Bank. Though very rare, Greninja has a Shiny variant obtainable in the games that is jet black with a red tongue. In X and Y, if the player chooses the Fire-type Fennekin as their starter, primary rival Serena/Calem will choose Froakie and eventually raise it into Greninja. If they choose the Grass-type Chespin, Shauna will do so instead. Greninja has been incorporated in spin-off Pok√©mon games as well. In the action game Pok√©mon Rumble World, Greninja is the back boss of Dewdrop Bay's Castle Moat, and can be recruited as a playable character. It is the boss of Area 03's fifth stage in Pok√©mon Picross, of Renegade Meadow in puzzle game Pok√©mon Battle Trozei, and of Expert Stage 24 in Pok√©mon Shuffle. Through evolving the player character of Froakie, Greninja is playable in Pok√©mon Super Mystery Dungeon, and is even included on the game's box art. Other Nintendo games Outside of the Pok√©mon series, Greninja also appears in Nintendo's Super Smash Bros. series. Greninja was included as a new fighter in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U in 2014, returning in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate in 2018. Greninja's inclusion was revealed during the Super Smash Bros. Direct on April 8, 2014, alongside returning characters Zero Suit Samus, Sheik, Yoshi, and fellow Pok√©mon Charizard. The game's director, Masahiro Sakurai, stated that he decided to include finishing development, and he working very closely with Game Freak's conceptual illustrations and making his own interpretations of the character. Its characteristics in the Pok√©mon games are reflected in Smash, being an agile fighter with ninja-like stealth capable of attacking opponents with water from its palms. Its final smash, Secret Ninja Attack, incorporates Greninja's signature move Mat Block. Its home stages include Prism Tower, the Pok√©mon Gym of Kalos' capital city, on the 3DS version and Kalos Pok√©mon League on the Wii U version. Ultimate granted Greninja its anime debuted Battle Bond form, ‚ÄúAsh-Greninja‚Äù as part of its Final Smash move, confirming the playable Greninja in this game series as a male. Through completing the challenge modes of Super Mario Maker, the player can unlock a Mystery Mushroom for Greninja that can be used in the player's customizable levels. When Mario makes contact with the Mushroom, he takes on Greninja's likeness and animations until he finishes the level, makes contact with an enemy, or loses a life. Greninja has the same sound bits as Mario, instead of those from Pok√©mon games; this is also true for Pikachu, Charizard, Jigglypuff, Mewtwo and Lucario but not for Bulbasaur, Charmander or Squirtle. =In the anime= Multiple Greninja have made appearances in the XY series of the Pok√©mon anime. While the Pok√©mon was first alluded to in the episode \\"A Rush of Ninja Wisdom!\\", it made its formal debut in the 17th Pok√©mon movie, Diancie and the Cacoon of Destruction, under the ownership of a thieving ninja named Riot. Ippei and Sanpei, two reccurring brothers in the anime, both have a Greninja. They both chose Froakie as their starter in tribute to a folkloric Greninja that saved their home village. Series protagonist Ash Ketchum's Greninja is the most prominent; he first appeared as a Froakie in the first episode \\"Kalos, Where Dreams and Adventures Begin!\\", was caught by Ash in the following episode \\"Lumiose City Pursuit!\\", and evolved from Frogadier into Greninja in \\"A Festival of Decisions!\\". Uniquely, Greninja and Ash are able to temporarily link their respective consciousnesses during battle. When such an exchange occurs, the former physically morphs to somewhat resemble Ash, a form called \\"Ash-Greninja\\". In ‚ÄúFacing in the Needs of Many!‚Äù, Ash released Greninja back in the wild so that he could protect Kalos with Squishy and Z-2, which are two Zygarde, from the evil roots which Team Flare left behind after their defeat. =In live-action films= A band of Greninja appears in the live-action film Pok√©mon Detective Pikachu, but as minor antagonists working as hired guns for Clifford Enterprises against the Tim and Harry Goodman as Detective Pikachu and Lucy Stevens until Lucy's Psyduck manages to defeat them by using its full power that has blown Greninja away from them. This is since a band of Greninja have been victims of illegal experimentation on by their mastermind Howard Clifford, but with help from any of his evil scientists, possibly like Dr. Laurent. =In printed adaptations= In the Pok√©mon Adventures literary adaptation of Pok√©mon X and Y, Yvonne has a Greninja named \\"Croaky\\". She chose it as her starter in \\"Fast- Thinking Froakie\\" from Professor Sycamore, her rival X chose Chespin, and Fennekin had its Pok√© Ball misplaced after an accidental encounter with Xerneas and Yveltal. As a Greninja, Croaky is shown to be a very serious and efficient Pok√©mon, which is an accurate portrayal of ninja-like discipline but contrasts with its implied mischievous nature in the video games. =Other media= Since its introduction, Greninja has regularly been featured in Pok√©mon merchandise. In the Pok√©mon Trading Card Game, Greninja-EX is one of the flagship cards associated with the Kalos Power Tin set and in promotion for BREAKpoint Wave Slasher Theme Deck. Ash-Greninja has also been incorporated into the trading card game and lineup of plushies. Key chains, soft toys, and figures of the Pok√©mon are all available on the online Pok√©mon Center store as well as in local toy store chains. Greninja was introduced among the fourth wave of amiibo, Nintendo's lineup of collectible toys-to-life figures. The figure is based on its appearance in Super Smash Bros. and is compatible with many different video games for the Wii U, Nintendo 3DS, and Nintendo Switch. Initially released on April 3, 2015 as a Toys \\"R\\" Us exclusive, Greninja proved to be so desirable that the figure sold out within just 30 minutes. Reception Greninja has proven to the most popular Pok√©mon introduced in X and Y. Once revealed, it was praised as \\"great and... likely to be popular just off its design alone.\\" A 2016 Japan election held by The Pok√©mon Company determined that Greninja was the most popular Pok√©mon species in the country. Ash-Greninja has been described as \\"a stylish addition\\" and a \\"huge asset\\" to the player's team. Reception to its inclusion in Super Smash Bros. has been mostly positive, with many online reviewers appreciating the uniqueness of the character and being genuinely surprised by its unveiling. The inclusion of Greninja in the Detective Pikachu film also received praise for staying true to its ninja-like portrayal in the video games and anime, though some reviewers criticized the species' \\"slimy tongue scarf\\" as \\"super disgusting\\" when rendered in CGI. Greninja was named the 2020 \\"Pok√©mon of the Year\\", based on results of a vote by fans in a poll run by Google and The Pok√©mon Company.

Some of their edifices are still standing today in the city. Franke's family members =Carl August Franke= Carl August Franke arrived in Bromberg in 1827 from Leszno, together with his wife Caroline Keymer. He established a distillery business, the C.A. Franke Spiritusraffinerie with a modest capital of 500 thalers. The workshop was located at Bruckenstra√üe 10 (in today's Mostowa street). C.A. Franke passed away in 1853 in Bydgoszcz. Advertising for CA Franke establishment ca. 1928 =Hermann Franke= The son of Caroline and Carl, Hermann, was born on June 18, 1829, in Bydgoszcz. After the death of his father, the company passed into his hands. From that moment, the firm underwent a stable and dynamic development. In 1857, he had installed the first steam engine in the city with a 3 HP strength produced by Friedrich Eberhard's workshops in Berliner Stra√üe. In 1872, he opened a new factory at Podwale Street 9 - Krƒôta 3 (now partly gone), for the production of liqueurs. Hermann Franke was known as a philanthropist, committed to work for economic, cultural and social development in the city: he was made in 1900, Honorary Citizen of the City of Bromberg. He died on July 29, 1913 in Bydgoszcz, and was buried in the Evangelical cemetery at Jagiello≈Ñska street (today's Ludowy Park). His wealthy situation allowed Hermann Franke to engage in social and public activities. From 1858 to 1875, he was a member of the city council, and from 1875 to 1905, a benevolent city councilor. He gave to the city a fund of 60 000 German gold marks for the construction of: * a nursing home; * a shelter for blighted poors; * an evangelical church in the city. He also gave scholarship funds for high school students. In 1896, he was appointed commercial counselor by state authorities and in 1903, secret commercial adviser. Between 1876 and 1906, he was the president of Bromberg Chamber of Commerce established in 1875. With a passion for local history, his personal collection of archaeological and historical craft laid the foundations for the collections of Bydgoszcz Municipal Museum. Hermann Franke was married to Minna, n√©e Elsner. He had two sons: * Georg Hermann Karla (b. 1858), a professor at the Technical University of Berlin; * Konrad Moritz Ernst (1865-1917), a city councilor. He lived in Bydgoszcz at Mostowa street 10. =Konrad Franke= After Hermann Franke's death, his son Konrad inherited the management of the entire company. He ran the business only four years, as he passed away prematurely in 1917, at age 52. Frankes' realizations =Spirit refinery= The company set up by Carl August in 1827, really developed when his son Hermann was in charge. The steady success meant that new steam-operated machines with a 1000 l capacity were set up in 1857. The growth of the population and the increasing demand for liqueur led Hermann Franke to look for alternate locations where to expand his activities. To that end, he acquired in 1872, plots at Wallstra√üe 11 (today's Podwale Street) to build a new factory with a daily production capacity of 3500 litres. In the 1880s, it was one of the first industrial place to be equipped with electrical-powered light in the city. Frankes' facilities in 1905 The colossal increase of sales required the storage of larger and larger amounts of raw alcohol within the facility downtown (Wallstra√üe). Consequently, Hermann bought in winter 1887, a parcel that used to house a bankrupt saw mill and carpentry workshop belonging to late Heinrich Mautz, located at today's Czartoryskiego street. Soon, iron tanks and cisterns were erected there, holding up to a million litres of raw spirit. Afterwards, a warehouse was also built in 1893, increasing the storage capacity to 1.75 million litres, together with a state-of-the-art alcohol refinery. The company total daily production of refined alcohol subsequently reached 10,000 litres. At that time, the firm employed almost 30 people and its working capital attained about 750 000 German gold marks. The plant operated through the interwar period and the German occupation period, but under German ownership. After World War II, the factory has been nationalized and gradually ceased its activity. =Saw mill factory= In 1901, together with his son Konrad, Hermann Franke founded a steam sawmill factory with timber trade at today's Czartoryskiego street (then Wallstra√üe). The company sold initially wood in Bydgoszcz and the surrounding area. The plant comprised two steam boilers and a steam engine with several circular saws and planers, as well as bunging and grooving machines. Thanks to its convenient location in the city, the small scale workshop (30 employees) shifted to a larger business trading beyond the province borders. This success called for a significant extension of the facility in terms of wood stocking area; to answer this need, a suitable terrain was leased, then purchased, at the third lock on the Brda river, next to the then famous Patzers Establissement (now gone, located at Swiƒôtej Trojcy street 31-33). At its heyday, as a result of an ever-increasing demand, the company introduced 24h-operations, with day and night shifts for its 65 workers, so as to fully exploit the production capability of the plant. Hermann Franke shared the management of the wood firm with his son Konrad from 1897 onwards: the trade business reached as far as Berlin, Oldenburg and into Saxony. They had two shops in town, one at Mostowa street 10 (Franke's home), the other at Gda≈Ñska street 19.

They were located both at Schloss Stra√üe 16 -at the corner of today's Podwale and Grodzka Streets- (from 1874) and at Mautzstra√üe -today's Czartoryskiego street- (from 1894). During many years, these bathing houses were the only ones downtown to meet the needs of the Bromberg residents. With the development of the urban water network, facilities gradually lost their importance after WWI. The bath house at Czartoryskiego housed twelve cabins with bathtubs (1st class) and showers - separate for men and women. The equipment was dismantled in 1935, when the Franke family immigrated to Germany, selling the property back to Polish buyers. One can still notice on an outside wall of a courtyard at Czartoryskiego 6, a bas-relief called Children in a Bath reminding this period.

The business dynasty‚Äôs founder Peter Sinebrychoff (Pyotr Sinebryukhov, 1750-1805), a second-guild merchant, settled in the region of Kymenlaakso in the late 18th century, after the region was ceded to the Russian Empire.The Sinebrychoff Brewing Family - Sinebrychoff Art Museum official website His son, Nikolai Sinebrychoff (1799-1848), was born in Gavrilov Posad but moved to the Grand Duchy of Finland, then an autonomous part of the Russian Empire, in 1817. Brewery business Paul P. Sinebrychoff and his wife Fanny Sinebrychoff Nikolai Sinebrychoff founded the Sinebrychoff brewery and soon became a supplier for a Russian regiment stationed in the Viapori fortress. He later bought exclusive rights to distill alcohol and brew beer. The Sinebrychoff distillery was based in Hietalahti on the outskirts of Helsinki. After Nikolai‚Äôs death, the business was inherited by his younger brother Paul (1799-1883). He developed the family business into a major diversified company active in many sectors of the economy. Brewing has remained the basis of the business. The business was then succeeded by Paul‚Äôs son Nicolas Sinebrychoff (1856-1896) and soon after that by Paul P. Sinebrychoff (1859-1917). The Sinebrychoff business group continued its development, becoming the biggest owner of Suomen Yhdyspankki (now part of Nordea).

Copeland is an American infrastructure engineer who has helped preserve and maintain several well-known New York City buildings and has developed innovative energy-conservation initiatives. Among the more iconic buildings are the Empire State Building, Grand Central Terminal, and the Alexander Hamilton Customs House. The energy-conserving innovations include an early (1974) solar energy rooftop installation in Manhattan and a 2015 patent for a control sequence to reduce peak utility steam demand in Manhattan buildings. He is President and CEO of Goldman Copeland Consulting Engineers, which also works with many of the nation's largest commercial property owners.  Early Life and Education  Charles Copeland was born in New York and raised in Westchester County, graduating from Ardsley High School. He earned a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering at Missouri University of Science and Technology and a master's degree in mechanical engineering at City College of New York. He is a licensed professional engineer.  Career  In 1970, Charles Copeland joined consulting engineering firm Goldman & Sokolow, founded in 1968, which became Goldman Copeland in 1991. He has overseen the firm's work on such New York City landmarks as Carnegie Hall, Columbia University, the Empire State Building, Grand Central Terminal, the Guggenheim Museum, National Museum of the American Indian, and New York University. He began addressing energy needs in 1974, designing an early, influential solar collector thermal installation for a homesteading group resurrecting an abandoned building on Manhattan's Lower East Side. A windmill on the roof occasionally created an excess of electric power, which led to a dispute with Con Edison, which at that time prohibited any connection to their electrical grid. The dispute rose to the New York State Public Service Commission, where the homesteaders ‚Äì represented pro bono by former US Attorney General Ramsey Clark ‚Äì prevailed. The ruling was a crucial forerunner of federal enactment in 1978 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act, which was key to enabling safe connections to the electrical grid.  Awards  Charles Copeland has received numerous awards and recognition. In 2018, he oversaw the preparation of a geothermal screening tool for every lot in New York City, which was honored with a Platinum Award by the Association of Consulting Engineers Council. Also in 2018, the New York Energy Consumers Council presented him with its leadership and innovation award for his legacy of creative energy solutions. In 2015, he was awarded a patent for a control sequence to reduce peak utility steam demand in New York City buildings by storing thermal energy in building hydronic systems.

An improved version followed in 1932 but only three were built in total. Design and development The NN 2 was a primary (basic), open frame (uncovered girder fuselage) glider of composite construction. Its wing was mounted on top of the fuselage and was rectangular in plan out to elliptical tips. It had a two-part structure, each part built around a single, wooden spar and fabric-covered. Its ailerons were slotted. Wing bracing on the first two NN 2s built was wire, running from the lower fuselage longeron and from a steel cabane, welded onto the upper longeron, over the wing centre section. The wires were replaced on the final version, the NN 2bis, by an inverted V-strut from the spar to the lower fuselage on each side. Both versions of the NN 2 had steel tube fuselages, tapering rearwards in depth, but the girders differed in the webs that connected their upper and lower chords or longerons. On the first two examples these consisted of vertical members assisted by wire bracing but the NN 2 instead used a form of Warren girder, with diagonal members. On the NN 2 the pilot sat, completely exposed, on a seat attached the sloping, most forward cross-member and with controls on an extension of the lower longeron. That longeron also carried the forward end of a pneumatically- sprung, broad, landing skid. In contrast, the pilot of the NN 2bis had an open cockpit within a nacelle with vertical sides which reached from nose to the wing trailing edge. The cross-member above the nacelle was faired in. The empennage of both variants was wood-framed and fabric-covered. The horizontal tail was rectangular in plan out to rounded tips, with a tailplane mounted on the upper longeron carrying elevators with cut-outs for rudder movement. A near-rectangular fin, which stretched down to the lower longeron, carried a broad, curved and slightly pointed balanced rudder. Operational history In September 1931 both NN 2s went on the sixth Lw√≥w Aeroclub expedition to Bezmiechowa G√≥rna. The following year the club returned with one NN 2 and the NN 2bis. The type's outstanding performance on this seventh expedition was a flight of 3 hr 56 min 29 s piloted by Kurowski. Variants ;NN 2: Original version with exposed seat and wire wing-bracing.

The Marlow-Hunter 37 can be confused with the 1978 Hunter 37 and the 1986 Hunter 37 Legend designs, which have similar designations. Production The design was built by Marlow-Hunter in the United States, starting in 2014 and remained in production through 2019. Design The Marlow-Hunter 37 is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of vinyl ester fiberglass, with Kevlar reinforcing and a Nida honeycomb core above the waterline. The hull has a bow hollow and a hard chine design. It has a fractional sloop B&R; rig, a nearly plumb stem, a reverse transom with a fold-down swimming platform and telescoping ladder, an internally mounted spade-type rudder controlled by a wheel and a fixed shoal draft or deep fin keel. The shoal draft model displaces and carries of cast iron ballast, while the deep fin keel version carries of ballast. Lead keels are optional. In the UK a third keel option is available, a twin keel. The below decks headroom is . The boat has a draft of with the deep-draft keel and with the shoal draft keel. The boat is fitted with a Japanese Yanmar diesel engine of , with a Yanmar optional. The fuel tank holds and the fresh water tank has a capacity of . The holding tank has a capacity of . Factory standard equipment includes a 110% jib, the mainsheet traveler mounted on a stainless steel arch, fold-down cleats, American cherry and teak interior woodwork, five flush-mounted deck hatches with bug screens, two dorade vents, folding cockpit table, electric anchor winch, marine VHF radio, knotmeter, depth sounder, stereo system, dual bow anchor rollers, LED cabin lighting, Corian countertops, fully enclosed head with shower, private forward and aft cabins, a dinette table that converts to a berth, microwave oven, dual sinks, refrigerator and freezer, and a two-burner gimbaled liquid petroleum gas stove and oven. Factory options include a roller furling genoa and mast-furling mainsail, a folding steering wheel, bow thruster, sprung mattresses and a gennaker. Operational history American reviewer, Mark Pillsbury, writing in Cruising World, noted the spacious accommodations and large galley and noted its suitability as a coastal cruising boat. In a 2015 review in Canadian Yachting, writer Robin Ball described the sailing characteristics of the design, \\"Sailing this boat is easy. The furling jib and furling main make deploying sails a pleasure. There is no lifting of sails, no sail bags to unzip and no need to leave the cockpit. Our test boat carried a vertically battened main. In 12-14 knots of true wind and a small chop the boat handled very nicely, close-hauled with 18 ‚Äî 20 apparent we were moving along nicely at 7.5 to 8 knots. The concave shape of the bow section of the hull is intended to reduce pitching by helping to cut through the waves. The chine carried from the beam all the way aft helps to provide stability. In those conditions we were heeled 10-15¬∞ with about 10¬∞ of weather helm rudder carrying full sail area. The B&R; designed rig has no backstay eliminating interference with the roach on the main. There is also no baby stay for the jib to foul on. Tacking was quick and simple and visibility was great with the 110% jib. I am a fan of boom end sheeting, I like the control it provides of the boom and the shape of the sail. As designed, the arch with its mainsheet traveller provides excellent control, within reach of the helm, and with everything overhead out of the way and with the dual ended mainsheet, the helmsman didn't have to leave the helm making this boat very easy to single hand. When we cracked off a little on a close reach, the helm was more neutral. On a beam reach with the wind down slightly, we maintained 6 ‚Äî 6.5 knots of speed and the helm was balanced. Downwind, the small jib has trouble behind this main driven rig.\\" Australian reviewer Phillip Ross, writing in Cruising Helmsman magazine, noted the generous number of cockpit cupholders, the below decks craftsmanship and fit, as well as the spacious interior. He compared the accommodations to those found on a 40-feet boat. British reviewer Rupert Holmes noted the spacious galley. Of the design he wrote: \\"it‚Äôs very much a cruiser, with no pretensions towards the performance cruising end of the spectrum.\\" See also *List of sailing boat types Similar sailboats *Alberg 37 *Baltic 37 *C&C; 37 *C&C; 110 *CS 36 *Dickerson 37 *Dockrell 37 *Express 37 *Hunter 36-2 References External links * Category:Keelboats Category:2010s sailboat type designs Category:Sailing yachts Category:Hunter Marine ","title":"Marlow-Hunter 37"},{"id":"59618495","text":"Sisir Kumar Saha was an Indian politician.

The Hans India gave 3 out of 5 stars stating \\"Having a solid story line became the biggest plus point for this movie. The entire movies revolve around the beautiful relationship between Naga Chaitanya and Venkatesh and the director has executed it in an engaging way\\". Samayam gave 3.5 out of 5 stars stating \\"Venky Mama will make you laugh, cry and please\\".(Telugu) The Times of India gave 2.5 out of 5 stars stating \\"Mediocre writing and crass humour let down this comic caper. The only saving grace for Venky Mama is the performance of its lead actors Venkatesh and Naga Chaitanya\\". India Today gave 2.5 out of 5 stars stating \\"Director had to include everything just to play to the gallery and make it please every age group. The result is nothing but a colossal disappointment and a wasted opportunity\\". The News Minute gave 2 out of 5 stars stating \\"Venky Mama is a crowd-pleaser. What they call a mass entertainer. Two songs. Two comedians. Two ‚Äúdouble-meaning‚Äù scenes, one wasted brilliant actor (Prakash Raj), one adored-as-god village head and a silly looking interview panel. Not really boring\\". Firstpost gave 2.5 out of 5 stars stating \\"This isn‚Äôt a film where one can judge how well an actor has performed, when the writing and treatment leaves a lot to be desired. The film rushes through some of its major set- pieces and there‚Äôs hardly a build up to moments where you might end up crying. The film just doesn't deliver what it sets out to achieve, and we are left to be content with bits and pieces of emotional sequences between Venkatesh and Naga Chaitanya. Venky Mama could have been so much more than what it is, but it's a missed opportunity!\\".

After the unit under his command was devastated by Luftwaffe bombing attacks, he was arrested in Bryansk charged with criminal inaction, cowardice and failure to obey orders and executed at the Kommunarka shooting ground in October 1941. He was posthumously rehabilitated in 1958.  Biography  Chernykh was born on 22 February 1912 in the city of Nizhny Tagil, then within the Russian Empire, to a working-class Russian family. After completing seven grades of school he worked as a mechanic at a local depot before he entered the Red Army in 1930 and was assigned a Komsomol travel ticket. In 1932 he became a member of the Communist party, and in 1933 he graduated from the Stalingrad Military Aviation School. Since December 1933 he served in the 107th Aviation Squadron of the Moscow Military District. He was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant in 1936 along with the position of flight commander. Starting in November that year he entered the Spanish civil war as a flight commander in a squadron of I-16 fighters. By the end of December that year he had shot down three enemy aircraft and become the first Soviet pilot to have downed a Bf-109. He returned to the Soviet Union in 1937, by then having accumulated 115 flight hours in combat and gained five individual and two shared aerial victories. On 31 December 1936 he was declared a Hero of the Soviet Union for his feats in Spain. In May 1937 he was promoted to the rank of Senior Lieutenant and appointed as commander of an aviation detachment, and that same year became a squadron commander and was promoted to the rank of Major. In 1937 Sergey Chernykh was elected into the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. By early 1938 he was promoted again and was put in charge of the 83rd Aviation Brigade (Bryansk) as a colonel. In 1938 he was made deputy commander of the Air Force of the Special Red Banner Far Eastern Army, later 1st and 2nd Red Banner Army. At these positions Chernykh participated in the Battle of Lake Khasan. In 1940, after graduating from courses for improvement of command staff of the Air Force at the General Staff Academy, he took position of deputy commander of the Air Force of Odessa Military District, becoming kombrig. He continued to rise through the ranks of the Soviet Air Forces, and was eventually made commander of the 9th Combined Aviation Division, deployed at around Bialystok, one of the largest and best- equipped aviation units of Western Special Military District.  World War II  On 22 June 1941, the first day of Operation Barbarossa, Luftwaffe bombers attacked the airfields Chernykh's division was stationed at. Despite making various attempts to resist the barrage of attacks, which included Major- general Chernykh joining the survivors of his men in flying the few usable fighters left, he was still charged with criminal inaction and cowardice later in; such charges were pressed despite the fact that the 9th Division had lost contact with headquarters during the surprise attacks, was short of desperately-needed fuel, and few pilots in the division were trained to fly the new aircraft they had just received. The 9th Mixed Aviation Division had lost 347 of its 409 aircraft, including the most if its 57 MiG-3 and 52 I-16 of 129th Fighter Regiment. On 28 June 1941 Chernykh had mistaken several Soviet aircraft landing on the Sescha airfield for an incoming Nazi airborne assault, ordered destruction of airfield equipment and left the airfield to report the situation to headquarters. Chernykh was later arrested for \\"unauthorized retreat\\" on 8 July 1941; subsequently, he was tried by a military tribunal and sentenced to death on 28 July 1941. He was executed at the Kommunarka shooting ground on 16 October 1941 along with many other Soviet military commanders who were blamed for Soviet failure to repel the unexpected German invasion. On 5 August 1958, he was posthumously rehabilitated by the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union.

Its exact location has not been identified. Location and etymology The exact location of Dayr Murran has not been identified, though the medieval sources indicate it was situated on the lower slopes of Mount Qasioun near the Bab al-Faradis gate of Damascus.Sourdel 1965, p. 198. It overlooked the orchards of the Ghouta plain that surrounded the city. The village was named after the large Christian monastery located within it, though its etymology is obscure. It translates in Arabic as the \\"ash-tree monastery\\", which historian Dominique Sourdel considered a questionable name. He also doubts that the name has Syriac roots. Dayr Murran was known for its view of the saffron fields below and for containing abundant walled gardens and orchards.Anderson, p. 124. Its monastery was decorated with numerous mosaics. History Dayr Murran was utilized by the Umayyad caliphs as a residence where they could be entertained while overseeing their capital Damascus. As early as 660, while the Umayyad Mu'awiya I was governor of Syria, his lieutenant Busr ibn Abi Artat mobilized his forces at Dayr Murran for the conquest of Mecca and Medina from Caliph Ali's control.Madelung 1997, p. 299 The future caliph Yazid I (r. 680‚Äì683) made improvements to its irrigation systems and was staying there before being dispatched to the Byzantine front in northern by his father, Caliph Mu'awiya I (r. 661‚Äì680). Later, Caliph Abd al-Malik and his entourage spent their springs there and at Jabiyah, while his son Caliph al-Walid I died there. Caliph al-Walid II established his principal residence in Dayr Murran. Following the demise of the Umayyads in 750, their Abbasid successors or their representatives lived in or visited the village. Among the caliphs who spent time there were Harun al-Rashid, al-Ma'mun and al- Mu'tasim. When Caliph al-Wathiq dispatched Raja ibn Ayyub to put down a Qaysi tribal revolt in Damascus, Raja used Dayr Murran as his headquarters.

Born in Poland, since 1994 she has lived and worked in Bellinzona in the Ticino canton of Switzerland. Biography Lafranchi was born 25 April 1961 in Szczecin, Poland. From 1980 to 1985 she studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw under Andrzej D≈Çu≈ºniewski and Henryk Wi≈õniewski. She graduated with distinction with a thesis on festive rites and ceremonies and between 1985 and 1986 Lafranchi continued her studies at the Goetheanum in Dornach, Switzerland. Her debut show organized in 1988 by Andrzej Bonarski at the SARP gallery in Warsaw. Her first sculptures shown in 1990 in the Dziekanka Gallery in Warsaw (now in the collection of \\"Pinakothek der Moderne\\", Munich) anticipated tendencies in modern sculpture. In the early 1990s she received several grants in Austria (Lenz Sch√∂nberg Collection), Spain (Ministry of Culture), and Germany (by Rosemarie Trockel), Poland ( with Marek Kijewski, Konstrukcja w Procesie, Lodz), Center of Polish Sculpture, Oronsko and Switzerland (Artest). Between 2002 and 2004 she contributed to the Peter Zumthor studio on Accademia di Archittetura in Mendrisio. From 2009 to 2011 Lafranchi undertook research for the project \\"Seduction as Art\\". Originally planned as a PhD thesis by Walter Kugler at the \\"Social Sculpture Unit\\", Oxford Brookes University, it was finalised independently as an exhibition called \\"The Shell Collector\\". In her art she often deals in ironic and playfully ways with scientific and philosophical concepts, giving them new connotations. Typical for Lafranchi's sculptures is the use of quite insignificant industrial materials in a minimalistic, reductive manner that nevertheless gives way to complex associations. 1994 she married Fiorenzo Lafranchi, a Swiss editor and educator, and in 1995 their son Olek was born.

Early life and education  Markus Feldenkirchen was educated at Albertus Magnus Grammar School in Bergisch Gladbach, where he took his Abitur examinations (A-level equivalent). Upon successful completion of his school-leaving qualifications, Feldenkirchen read Political Science, History and Literature at the University of Bonn and at New York University in the USA. He then studied at Deutsche Journalistenschule in Munich, from which he graduated in 2001.  Career  From 2001 to 2004, Feldenkirchen worked as a lobby correspondent for Der Tagesspiegel newspaper in Berlin. In 2004, he transferred to the head office of the German Der Spiegel (magazine), where he first worked as an editor. He advanced to senior political reporter in 2006 and was subsequently appointed deputy editor in 2007. Since the summer of 2010, Feldenkirchen has held the position of columnist in the head office of Der Spiegel. In 2014, he finished a one-year stint as foreign correspondent in Washington, USA. Feldenkirchen produced his first 45-minute documentary on the life and career of Wolfgang Sch√§uble. The film, It is how it is, was premiered on German television in September 2012. Feldenkirchen joined Martin Schulz to report on the five final months of the electoral campaign for the Bundestag (German Federal Parliament) in 2017. He attended fifty events, ranging from strategy meetings to social gatherings, including Currywurst Dinners (a social occasion in the evening, where bratwurst sausage is served). Der Spiegel published an exclusive about Schulz after the election results came in, as agreed with the politician beforehand. The portrayal of Barack Obama in The New Yorker served as a model for the feature story written by Feldenkirchen in November 2016.  Novels  Kein & Aber, a publishing house in Z√ºrich, released Feldenkirchen‚Äôs debut novel ‚ÄòWhat belongs together‚Äô in 2010. The book tells the story of a successful banker, who receives a letter that reminds him of first love and thus makes him feel nostalgic. The novel was reviewed favourably and, following the warm reception from the critics, Feldenkirchen published his second book, ‚ÄòNo experiments‚Äô, in the summer of 2013. The novel portrays a conservative man who falls in love with an independent young woman and wavers in his moral values. This book was equally well received.

It was directed and produced by Alex Lockwood. In 2019, it won the BAFTA Award for Best Short Film at the 72nd British Academy Film Awards. Background, production and release Jay Wilde grew up around cattle farming, though faced reservations about the ethics of raising cows for food. When he inherited the 173 acre Bradley Nook farm from his father in 2011, he moved from dairy farming to organic beef production, believing this to be less harmful to the cows. In summer 2017, after meeting with The Vegan Society, he and his wife Katja gave most of their herd to the Hillside Animal Sanctuary and took up vegan organic farming, with plans to develop a range of affiliated businesses, such as a restaurant, a cookery school, and a shop; the remaining members of the herd stayed at Bradley Nook as \\"pets\\". Alex Lockwood was introduced to the Wildes' story by his wife. He initially assumed that someone would already be making a documentary about the Wildes, and so did not contact them for some time. When he did finally contact them, he was excited to be told that he could tell their story. The Wildes were surprised to be contacted by Lockwood, as the initial publicity surrounding the cows going to Hillside had died down. Lockwood got to know the Wildes well before beginning to film, and, while he had a clear vision of the film's plot points, this changed a great deal through the production process. 73 Cows was produced by Lockwood Film. It was directed, produced, and edited by Alex Lockwood, with cinematography by Oliver Walton, and sound by John Roddy. Production assistance was provided by Nishat Raman, and title design was by Ana Orio. Lockwood said that the production crew \\"set out with no budget and a team of only four\\". The only money spent, Lockwood said, \\"was on petrol for two cars making six 90-minute journeys each way\\". 73 Cows was filmed primarily with Canon EOS C500 and Canon EOS-1D C cameras, with an AKG Blue Line microphone used for sound-capture. The team produced two hours of film of Jay, and filmed Kajta for a single hour. A one-off shot of cows running across a field at Hillside was shot with a drone. In the scene, they \\"literally jumped for joy\\", which Lockwood said \\"makes the film\\". Slow-motion is utilised throughout the film. In the eyes of one critic, this both evokes the simplicity of farming life and matches with \\"Jay‚Äôs soft-spoken and melancholy nature\\". The film premiered on 30 September 2018 at the Raindance Film Festival in London before being uploaded to the internet on 5 October. Jay did not watch an online preview of the film, seeing it for the first time at Raindance. After producing the film, Lockwood switched from a vegetarian to a vegan diet. He said this \\"was surprisingly easy to do, and this is the first winter in about eight years I haven't had a persistent cough\\". In addition to the film's vegan message, Lockwood identifies the theme of mental health: \\"Jay spent his life doing something he hated and saw no way out of. This drove him to depression, yet, he managed to overcome it. I hope that people who watch [72 Cows] will understand that they have the power to make positive change in their own lives.\\" Synopsis The film is told through interviews with Jay and Katja Wilde of Bradley Nook Farm, Ashbourne, Derbyshire, along with footage of them, their farm, and their cows. They introduce their connection to the farm: Jay inherited it from his father, but came to see cows as individuals with feelings and personalities. This made him uneasy about eating them and about raising them for food. Katja came to the UK on a two-month educational assignment, and lived and worked at Bradley Nook. Jay told her about his unease with cattle farming, and invited her to live with him. She then planned to change the farm so that cows were not slaughtered. Jay discusses his feelings about taking cows to the abattoir, and his feeling that he was betraying his cows. Katja explains that, for a decade after her arrival, cows were still slaughtered, but that this was having a very negative impact on Jay. Katja feels she was more able to harden her heart than Jay, but she, too, felt that what they were doing was horrible. Selling the farm and fields was an obvious solution, but not one they wanted to make. Jay explains that they first installed solar panels, and then unsuccessfully sought planning permission for a wind turbine. They then explored vegan organic agriculture. Katja talks about the excitement and difficulties faced by the prospect of switching to vegan organic agriculture; this was, ultimately, viable. Jay expresses his desire to support and maintain the farm, and then the challenge of what would be done with the remaining cows. Sending them to slaughter, he felt, would be a bad start to vegan farming, and so they sought space for them at animal sanctuaries. This novel possibility led to tension with other farmers. Katja explains the pressure on farmers, and how ¬£40,000-50,000 would be lost by sending the cattle to a sanctuary rather than slaughter. The process of finding sanctuary space for the cows was long and stressful, but the Hillside Animal Sanctuary, in Norfolk, agreed to take the entire herd. This was, for Jay, an ideal result. After the cattle had moved to Hillside, Katja and Jay began receiving letters of praise and support. Katja explains that sending the cattle to Hillside changed Jay. Jay and Katja visit Hillside, and Jay says how the cows are clearly no longer his. He talks of his relief at no longer being involved in beef farming, and how the cows can live out their lives peacefully. Reception 73 Cows received a very positive review from Jason Sondhi of Short of the Week. Sondhi called the film \\"a profile in courage\\", praising the film as having \\"everything you ideally want in a short documentary: it has an intriguing top-level premise, it elicits truly emotional and compelling performances from its on-camera subjects, and [it is filled] with beautifully composed and cinematic images\\". The tone and pace of the piece, he said, \\"contribute to a melancholic sense of spiritual unrest\\". His only criticism was that a few minutes could have been removed from the middle third, cutting out some repetition. Meanwhile, Catherine Shoard and Andrew Pulver, writing in The Guardian, called 73 Cows \\"a lovely little film\\". =Awards and nominations= At the 2018 Ottawa International Vegan Film Festival, 73 Cows was awarded Best Overall Film and Best Lifestyle Film. It was also nominated for Best Local Film at the 2018 Birmingham Film Festival. It won the BAFTA Award for Best British Short Film at the 72nd British Academy Film Awards in February 2019.

In 1899, the United States conducted its first census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Orocovis Pueblo (a barrio named Pueblo in Barros, as the municipality of Orocovis was called at the time) was 962. The central plaza history The central plaza, or square, is a place for official and unofficial recreational events and a place where people can gather and socialize from dusk to dawn. The Laws of the Indies, Spanish law, which regulated life in Puerto Rico in the early 19th century, stated the plaza's purpose was for \\"the parties\\" (celebrations, festivities) (), and that the square should be proportionally large enough for the number of neighbors (). These Spanish regulations also stated that the streets nearby should be comfortable portals for passersby, protecting them from the elements: sun and rain.

It depicts two men involved in a fight with knives. The sculpture was Molin's breakthrough work and was for some time well known in Europe. Multiple copies of the sculpture were made. Today, copies are located in Gothenburg in B√§ltesp√§nnarparken, in front of the Swedish National Museum in Stockholm, in V√§nersborg and in M√§starnas park in H√§llefors. The sculpture allegedly references a mythological style of duel called sp√§nna b√§lte (\\"to bind the belt\\"), in which two men fight each other while bound together with a belt. The origins of this myth are unclear, as no reliable historical sources are known for it. The sculpture furthermore contains elements of Nordic (pre-)history, including the use of runes and verses from the Poetic Edda. The Knife Wrestlers from 1867 in front of the Swedish National Museum in Stockholm.  Description  Besides the two fighting men, the sculpture consists of a rectangular socket with relief images on four sides. The relief images tell the dramatic story of the fight. On three of the four sides of the socket, there are snake ornaments which contain runic inscriptions. Some copies of the sculpture also contain a horizontal runic inscription at the top of the socket. The earliest version displayed in Gothenburg lacked that runic inscription, but later versions, including the one displayed in Gothenburg today, has a horizontal runic inscriptions which is located at the top of the socket and leads around all four sides. The analysis of Molin's private letters has shown that the inscription was meant to be there originally, and that the text consists of some verses in Old Norse taken from the Poetic Edda. As the Edda is not written in runes, Molin had to transcribe the text in runes himself. This posed a challenge for him and he asked multiple scholars for help. The text in the horizontal inscription is taken from the poem Ham√∞ism√°l. The other inscriptions contain verses from the Eddic poems Ham√∞ism√°l and H√°vam√°l. The first copy known to contain the horizontal runic inscription is the version from Stockholm made in 1867.  History  Molin began to make sketches of the sculpture in the 1840s. His friends Gunnar Wennerberg and Hans Forssell were the models for the faces of the two fighters. In 1858 he travelled to Paris and worked hard to finish the sculpture. In 1859, the first version was cast from zinc and in the same year it was shown in Paris without success. A year later, it was shown at the art academy in Stockholm, but it was only in 1862 after it had been cast from bronze in Berlin by Moritz Gei√ü that it started to draw attention. In the same year, it was shown at the 1862 International Exhibition in London where it received a lot of attention, and two copies were sold, one to the city of Cologne and one to an English art dealer. A cast in zinc was also ordered by the city of Gothenburg. Another copy was cast in bronze in N√ºrnberg in 1867. In the same year, the city of Stockholm ordered a cast which was placed in front of the National museum in Stockholm for its inauguration. Today, a cast made from zinc is also found on the Powerscourt Estate in Ireland.https://rupertharris.com/products/the-knife- wrestlers ‚Äì description of the repair of the sculpture at the Powerscourt Estate  Gallery  Molin B√§ltessp√§nnarna V√§nersborg.JPGSculpture in V√§nersborg Molin B√§ltessp√§nnarna relief 01.JPGRelief (front) on the socket of the sculpture in V√§nersborg Molin B√§ltessp√§nnarna relief 02.JPGRelief (back) on the socket of the sculpture in V√§nersborg Molin B√§ltessp√§nnarna relief 03.JPGRelief (right) on the socket of the sculpture in V√§nersborg Molin B√§ltessp√§nnarna relief 04.JPGRelief (left) on the socket of the sculpture in V√§nersborg B√§ltessp√§nnarna, Museiparken, sockel.jpgB√§ltesp√§nnarna, Museiparken in Stockholm, socket  Literature  *Bo Gustavsson/Jan Westin: B√§ltesp√§nnarnas √∂den och √§ventyr: en kr√∂nika med fokus p√• G√∂teborg, V√§nersborg och ristade runor. 2016.

This seaweed was named in honour of the Danish botanist and phycologist Frederik B√∏rgesen. Description Padina boergesenii is a distinctive small brown alga with rounded fronds growing to a length and diameter of . Fronds are thin, leafy, and flat, with narrow or wide lobes, and grow on short stems from a fibrous, bulbous holdfast. They are moderately calcified on the underside and are usually pale brown or tan. The fronds are either two or three cells thick, but the bases are usually three cells thick. The surface of the fronds bear many short hairs, giving them a matted appearance. Distribution P. boergesenii has a wide but scattered presence in shallow water in tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate oceans. In Australia, it is known only from Lord Howe Island. Other locations where this alga occurs include Mauritius, India, and Brazil. The type locality is the United States Virgin Islands, and the maximum depth at which it grows is . Ecology This seaweed reproduces by spore- producing asexual reproduction. The fronds produce tetraspores in concentric bands a millimetre () or so wide, alternately on the upper and lower surfaces of the fronds, closely situated between bands of hairs. The sporangia within the sori mature at differing rates, so that the mature sorus contains spores at very different stages of development. The species has been investigated for use as a bioindicator of heavy metal contamination; it concentrated iron and manganese by several orders of magnitude and was also successful in detecting other metals such as cadmium and zinc at trace concentrations.

It has stiff, oval, opposing leaves with one distinctive vein and entire margin. The wide flower heads are very conspicuous in colour, white with a dark purple zone at the base of the ray florets and an orange-yellow disc. Flowering occurs from late August to September, or if the rains arrive late, sometimes October. It is a rare species that is restricted to the Saldanha Bay area. It is sometimes called Saldanha felicia or tricolour felicia in English, and driekleurblommetjie in Afrikaans.  Description  The involucreFelicia elongata is an upright perennial herbaceous plant with a woody base, of up to about high. Its leaves are oppositely arranged along the stem, oval in outline and rigid, long and wide, with one central vein, rarely two additional veins can be seen. The margin of the leaf is curled downwards, densely roughly hairy on upper side, while the lower surface may lose some of its hairs over time, and is gray-green in colour. The flower heads are about across and sit individually on top of about 15 cm (rarely to 20 cm) long, dense velvety hairy stalks. The involucre is almost in diameter, and consist of two strict rows of bracts of about long, more or less fringed at the tip. The outer bracts are narrowly lance-shaped, and wide, the inner bracts are lance-shaped and about wide, one-ribbed, losing its hair with time. The numerous female ray florets have a milky white, rarely magenta strap of about long and 3 mm wide, near the base with a dark purple zone. Many bisexual, disc florets with an orange-yellow corolla of about long. In the center of each corolla are five anthers merged into a tube, through which the style grows when the floret opens, hoovering up the pollen on its shaft. Around the base of the corolla are many white pappus bristles of about long. The dark brown, dry, one-seeded, indehiscent fruits called cypsellae are ellips- to inverted egg-shaped, about long and wide, with a marginal ridge, while the surface has some weak scales and is evenly covered in long hairs. Felicia elongata is a diploid having eight sets of homologue chromosomes (2n=16).  Taxonomy  The Saldanha felicia was first described by Carl Thunberg in the year 1800, in the second volume of his book Prodromus Plantarum Capensium, based on a specimen he collected himself in 1772 during his three-year stay in the Cape Colony, and he named it Aster elongatus. In 1833, Nees von Esenbeck thought that its should be moved to another genus and he made the combination Agathaea elongata. Aster elongatus var. thunbergii was distinguished by William Henry Harvey in 1865. Karl August Otto Hoffmann reassigned Thunberg's species and made the combination Felicia namaquana in 1905. Harry Bolus and Anthony Hurt Wolley-Dod were not aware of Hoffmann's combination and claimed it for themselves in 1950. In 1973 J√ºrke Grau considered all of these name synonymous. The species is considered to be part of the section Neodetris. Aster elongatus var. candollei described by William Henry Harvey in 1865 however, has now been assigned to Felicia namaquana.  Distribution, habitat and ecology  The Saldanha felica can only be found growing on limestone ridges and coastal sands, alongside the Langebaan Lagoon, and edging the Vredenburg Peninsula to Paternoster in the north. The flower heads appear to be mainly pollinated by bees. Within one month of opening, the flower heads develop into seedheads. It may grow in the vicinity of the Cape daisy, Dimorphotheca pluvialis, blue flax, Heliophila coronopifolia or in the shade of rooi malva, Pelargonium fulgidum or dikbeen malva, P. gibbosum. After flowering and setting seed, the plants die back and survive the long hot summer as short, leafless woody stumps. These start growing as soon as the winter rains arrive. It occurs in vegetation types called Langebaan Dune Strandveld, Saldanha Flats Strandveld, Saldanha Granite Strandveld and Saldanha Limestone Strandveld.  Conservation  Felicia elongata is considered a vulnerable species, because the total population comprises less than 2000 mature individuals, divided over eight subpopulations, and is in decline due to recreational developments.  Use  Felicia elongata is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental and is can be grown quite easily. It grows very well in well-draining garden soil.

Initial Mormon converts were from the north of the United States and opposed slavery. This caused contention in the slave state of Missouri, and the church began distancing itself from abolitionism and justifying slavery based on the Bible. During this time, several slave owners joined the church, and brought their slaves with them when they moved to Nauvoo, Illinois. The church adopted scriptures which teaches against influencing slaves to be \\"dissatisfied with their condition\\" as well as scriptures which teaches that \\"all are alike unto God.\\" As mayor of Nauvoo, Smith prohibited blacks from holding office, joining the Nauvoo Legion, voting or marrying whites; but, as president of the church blacks became members and several black men were ordained to the priesthood. Also during this time, Smith began his presidential campaign on a platform for the government to buy slaves into freedom over several years. He was killed during his presidential campaign. Some slave owners brought their slaves with them to the Salt Lake Valley, though several slaves escaped. The church put out a statement of neutrality towards slavery, stating that it was between the slave owner and God. A few years later, Brigham Young began teaching that slavery was ordained of God and that equality efforts were misguided. Under his direction, Utah Territory passed laws supporting slavery and making it illegal for blacks to vote, hold public office, join the Nauvoo Legion, or marry whites. In California, slavery was openly tolerated in the Mormon community of San Bernardino, despite being a free state. In the 1860s, the US federal government freed the slaves and overturned laws prohibiting blacks from voting. After the Civil War, issues of civil rights went largely unnoticed until the civil rights movement of the 1960s. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) criticized the church's position on civil rights, led anti-discrimination marches and filed a lawsuit against the church's practice of not allowing black children to be troop leaders. Several athletes began protesting Brigham Young University over its discriminatory practices and the LDS Church policy that did not give black people the priesthood. In response, the church issued a statement supporting civil rights and changed its policy on Boy Scouts. Church apostle Ezra Taft Benson began criticizing the civil rights movement and challenging accusations of police brutality. After the reversal of the priesthood ban in 1978, the church has stayed relatively silent on matters of civil rights. Slavery =Statements on slavery from early church leaders= The period from 1830 to 1844 was of fundamental importance in shaping Mormon beliefs and customs with regard to race. Joseph Smith supported and opposed slavery at different points in his life. In 1835, he wrote an official declaration that opposed baptizing slaves against the will of their masters. In the statement, he also wrote that it was not right to make slaves \\"dissatisfied with their situations.\\" The statement became part of the Doctrine and Covenants. Smith wrote an essay in 1836, published in Latter Day Saints' Messenger and Advocate, which was strongly anti-abolitionist. In the essay, he gave five reasons for opposing the abolition of slavery: #Smith feared racial miscegenation and race war, stating that abolitionism was \\"calculated to ... set loose, upon the world a community of people who might peradventure, overrun our country and violate the most sacred principles of human society, chastity and virtue.\\" #Smith believed that any evil inherent in slavery would already have been known and realised by \\"men of piety\\" from the Southern slave states‚Äîbut they had no objection to it. #Smith \\"did not believe that the people of the North have any more right to say that the South shall not hold slaves, than the South have to say the North shall.\\" #Smith believed that abolitionism went against the \\"decree of Jehovah\\" whereby the Old Testament, in his understanding, decreed that blacks were cursed and destined to be slaves. #Smith placed great importance on biblical precedents for slavery, for example in Abraham, Leviticus, Ephesians, and Timothy; and he quoted Paul in the New Testament: \\"Servants be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, the singleness of your heart.\\" Smith probably wanted to distance Mormons from abolitionists, since many Mormons were living in Missouri, a pro-slavery state. After the Mormons were forced out of Missouri, they lived in Illinois, a free state. Smith's position on slavery changed, and he was vocally against slavery from 1842 until his death. Because of slave owners who were converting to the church in Missouri, there was much confusion regarding the church's position on slavery. These same feelings arose during the migration to Utah. In 1851, apostle Orson Hyde stated that there was no law in Utah Territory prohibiting or authorizing slavery, and that the decisions on the topic were to remain between slaves and their masters. He also clarified that individuals' choices on the matter were not in any way a reflection of the church as a whole or its doctrine. Church president Brigham Young taught that slavery was \\"of Divine institution, and not to be abolished until the curse pronounced on Ham shall have been removed from his descendants.\\" =In Utah Territory= The first known slaves to enter the Utah Territory came west with the congregations of Mississippi. By 1850, 100 blacks had arrived, the majority of whom were slaves. After the pioneers arrived in the Salt Lake Valley, they continued to buy and sell slaves as property. Many prominent members of the church were slave owners, including William Henry Hooper, Abraham O. Smoot, and Charles C. Rich. Church members would use their slaves as tithing, both lending out their slaves to work for the church as well as giving their slaves to the church. Though initially opposed to it, by the early 1850s Brigham Young was a \\"firm believer in slavery\\". Young and Heber C. Kimball used the slave labor that had been donated as tithing and then eventually granted their freedom. The church opposed slaves who wanted to escape their masters.Brigham Young told Greeley: \\"If slaves are brought here by those who owned them in the states, we do not favor their escape from the service of their owners.\\" (see Greeley, Overland Journey 211‚Äì212) quoted in Utah Territory (1850) After the Compromise of 1850 allowed California into the Union as a free state while permitting Utah and New Mexico territories the option of deciding the issue by popular sovereignty, the Utah Territorial Legislature took up the issue of legalizing slavery. At that time, Young was governor, and the Utah Territorial Legislature was dominated by church leaders. In 1852, Young addressed the joint session of the legislature advocating slavery. He made the matter religious by declaring that if members of the church believe in the Bible and the priesthood then they should also believe in slavery. Following the speech, the Utah Legislature passed an Act in Relation to Service, which officially sanctioned slavery in Utah Territory. The Utah slavery law stipulated that slaves would be freed if their masters had sexual relations with them; attempted to take them from the territory against their will; or neglected to feed, clothe, or provide shelter to them. In addition, the law stipulated that slaves must receive schooling. Utah was the only western state or territory that had slaves in 1850,Negro Slaves in Utah by Jack Beller, Utah Historical Quarterly, vol. 2, no. 4, 1929, pp. 124‚Äì126 but slavery was never important economically in Utah, and there were fewer than 100 slaves in the territory. In 1860, the census showed that 29 of the 59 black people in Utah Territory were slaves. When the American Civil War broke out in 1861, Utah sided with the Union, and slavery ended in 1862 when the United States Congress abolished slavery in Utah Territory. Biddy Mason was one of 14 blacks who sued for their freedom after being illegally held captive in San Bernardino =In San Bernardino= In 1851, a company of 437 Mormons under direction of Amasa M. Lyman and Charles C. Rich of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles settled at what is now San Bernardino. This first company took 26 slaves, and more slaves were brought over as San Bernardino continued to grow. Since California was a free state, the slaves should have been freed when they entered. However, slavery was openly tolerated in San Bernardino. Many wanted to be free, but were still under the control of their masters and ignorant of the laws and their rights. Judge Benjamin Hayes freed 14 slaves who had belonged to Robert Smith. Black suffrage As in other places in Illinois, only free white males could vote in Nauvoo. When Utah Territory was created, suffrage was only granted to free white males. At that time, only a few states had allowed black suffrage. Brigham Young explained that this was connected to the priesthood ban. He argued that black suffrage would help make blacks equal to whites, which would result in a curse. On January 10, 1867, Congress passed the Territorial Suffrage Act, which prohibited denying suffrage based on race or previous condition of servitude, which nullified Utah's ban on black suffrage.Congressional Globe, 39th Congress, 2nd Session, pp. 381‚Äì82 - See more at: http://www.blackpast.org/primarywest/territorial- suffrage-act-1867#sthash.dqdUkXeh.dpuf Civil Rights Movement Before the civil rights movement, the LDS Church's doctrine-based policy went largely unnoticed and unchallenged for around a century with the First Presidency stating in 1947 that the doctrine of the LDS Church which banned interracial marriage and black people from entering the temple or receiving the priesthood was never questioned by any of the church leaders. In 1958, apostle Joseph Fielding Smith published Answers to Gospel Questions, which stated that blacks should \\"receive all the rights and privileges [...] as declared in the Declaration of Independence.\\" He went on to say that black people should not be barred from any type of employment or education, and should be free \\"to make their lives as happy as it is possible without interference from white men, labor unions, or from any other source.\\" The church also advocated for segregation laws and enforced segregation in its facilities. Hotel Utah, a church-run hotel, banned black guests, even when other hotels made exceptions for black celebrities. Blacks were prohibited from performing in the Salt Lake Tabernacle, and the Deseret News did not allow black people to appear in photographs with white people. Church leaders urged white members to join civic groups and opened up LDS meetinghouses \\"for meetings to prevent Negroes from becoming neighbors\\", even after a 1948 Supreme Court decision against racial covenants in housing. Church leaders counseled members to buy homes so black people wouldn't move next to LDS chapels. In the 1950s, the San Francisco mission office took legal action to prevent black families from moving into the church neighborhood.Glen W. Davidson, \\"Mormon Missionaries and the Race Question,\\" The Christian Century, September 29, 1965, pp. 1183‚Äì86. A black man living in Salt Lake City, Daily Oliver, described how, as a boy in the 1910s, he was excluded from an LDS-led boy scout troop because they did not want blacks in their building. In 1959, the Utah State Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights stated that: \\"the Negro is the minority citizen who experiences the most widespread inequality in Utah. The exact extent of his mistreatment is almost impossible to ascertain\\", explaining that \\"Mormon interpretation attributes birth into any race other than the white race as a result of inferior performance in a pre-earth life and teaches that by righteous living, the dark-skinned races may again become 'white and delightsome'.\\" =NAACP involvement= In the 1960s, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) attempted to convince LDS Church leaders to support civil rights legislation and to reverse its practices in relation to African American priesthood holding and temple attendance. In early 1963, NAACP leadership attempted to arrange meetings with church leadership, but were rebuffed in their efforts.Glen W. Davidson, \\"Mormon Missionaries and the Race Question,\\" The Christian Century, September 29, 1965, pp. 1183‚Äì86. Later that year, University of Utah professor Sterling McMurrin arranged a meeting between the NAACP and church leaders. N. Eldon Tanner and Hugh B. Brown, the two counselors to David O. McKay in the First Presidency, met with the head of the Utah NAACP. The NAACP threatened to protest at the October 1963 general conference if the LDS Church did not make a statement about civil rights. Brown promised that a statement would be made. McMurrin wrote the statement, which McKay approved. McKay did not want their statement to be an \\"official pronouncement of the First Presidency,\\" perhaps because some apostles were against civil rights. During the ensuing general conference, Brown read the statement in support of civil rights legislation before beginning his talk, in a way that made the statement seem official. The NAACP did not protest at the conference. In 1965, the church leadership met with the NAACP, and agreed to publish an editorial in church-owned newspaper the Deseret News, which would support civil rights legislation pending in the Utah legislature. The church failed to follow-through on the commitment, and Tanner explained, \\"We have decided to remain silent\\". In March 1965, the NAACP led an anti-discrimination march in Salt Lake City, protesting church policies. In response, McKay agreed to let the Deseret News reprint the civil rights statement from 1963 as an \\"official\\" statement. In 1966, the NAACP issued a statement criticizing the church, saying the church \\"[had] maintained a rigid and continuous segregation stand\\" and that the church had made \\"no effort to counteract the widespread discriminatory practices in education, in housing, in employment, and other areas of life.\\" Since the early part of the 20th century, each ward of the LDS Church in the United States has organized its own Boy Scouting troop. Some LDS Church-sponsored troops permitted black youth to join, but a church policy required that the troop leader to be the deacons quorum president, which had the result of excluding black children from that role. The NAACP filed a federal lawsuit in 1974 challenging this practice, and soon thereafter the LDS Church reversed its policy. =Benson and the civil rights movement= After Hugh B. Brown's statement in support of civil rights in 1963, apostle Ezra Taft Benson began to state in speeches that the civil rights movement was a Communist plot. Ralph R. Harding, a congressman from Idaho, criticized Benson's extreme views. Soon afterward, the First Presidency appointed Benson to oversee the European mission of the church. Apostle Joseph Fielding Smith privately expressed that he hoped the appointment would help to temper Benson's extreme political views. Benson returned in 1965 and had not changed his political views. He gave an inflammatory speech in general conference, parts of which were removed when the talk appeared in official church publications. In the October 1967 general conference, Benson declared that \\"there is nothing wrong with civil rights--it is what's being done in the name of civil rights that is alarming.\\" Making comparisons to agrarian reform in China and Cuba, he claimed that the civil rights movement was being directed by Communist revolutionaries who want to \\"destroy America by spilling Negro blood.\\" He also stated that accusing law enforcement of \\"police brutality\\" should be recognized as attempts to discredit and discourage law enforcement. His talk was re-published the next year by the church's Deseret Book as a pamphlet titled \\"Civil Rights: Tool of Communist Deception\\". =Sports protests= African-American athletes protested against LDS Church policies by boycotting several sporting events with Brigham Young University. In 1968, after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., black members of the UTEP track team approached their coach and expressed their desire not to compete against BYU in an upcoming meet. When the coach disregarded the athletes' complaint, the athletes boycotted the meet., p. 1, p. 10 Also in 1968, the San Jose State basketball and football teams refused to play against BYU. In 1969, 14 members of the University of Wyoming football team were removed from the team for planning to protest the discriminatory treatment they had received in their previous match with BYU. In their 1968 match against the University of Wyoming, BYU football players refused the customary post-game handshakes after their loss and went straight to the locker rooms. They turned on the sprinklers, soaking the University of Wyoming football players. Additionally, a \\"caricature of an ape and a black man\\" awaited them in the visitors' locker room, and a local paper reported \\"BYU cleanses field of evil.\\" In November 1969, Stanford University President Kenneth Pitzer suspended athletic relations with BYU. Athletes protested Mormon racial policies at Arizona State University, San Jose State University, the University of New Mexico, and others. Equal Rights Amendment In the 1970s, the LDS Church came out against the Equal Rights Amendment. The LDS Church in Utah requested that ten women from each ward attend the Utah International Women's Year in 1977 to support the church's position on the Equal Rights Amendment and other women's issues. The fourteen thousand attendees, mostly Mormon women recruited in their wards, voted on platforms before hearing their discussion and rejected all the national resolutions‚Äîeven those that did not advocate a moral position opposed to that of the LDS Church. In 1978, the LDS Church encouraged nine thousand female members in greater Las Vegas, Nevada, to canvass their neighborhoods with anti‚ÄìEqual Rights Amendment pamphlets and encouraged all members to vote. Nevada did not ratify the amendment. Sonia Johnson fought against the church in support of the Equal Rights Amendment and was excommunicated; a December 1979 excommunication letter claimed that Johnson was charged with a variety of misdeeds, including hindering the worldwide missionary program, damaging internal Mormon social programs, and teaching false doctrine. Also in 1979, the Alice Reynolds forum was forbidden from discussing the amendment in the Alice Reynolds reading room at Brigham Young University; the club subsequently found a different place to meet. Marriage Marriage has always been an important aspect of Mormon doctrine and culture. Early Mormon communities banned interracial marriages but supported polygamous marriage. When challenged on polygamy, they often defended the practice based on the First Amendment. Later, as interracial marriage and same-sex marriage became more of a public issue, the church opposed the practice based on the laws of God. =Polygamy= The private practice of polygamy was instituted in the 1830s by founder Joseph Smith. The public practice of plural marriage by the church was announced and defended in 1852 by a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, Orson Pratt, by the request of church president Brigham Young. For over 60 years, the LDS Church and the United States were at odds over the issue: the church defended the practice as a matter of religious freedom, while the federal government aggressively sought to eradicate it, consistent with prevailing public opinion. Polygamy was probably a significant factor in the Utah War of 1857 and 1858, given the Republican attempts to paint Democratic President James Buchanan as weak in his opposition to both polygamy and slavery. In 1862, the United States Congress passed the Morrill Anti- Bigamy Act, which prohibited plural marriage in the territories. In spite of the law, Mormons continued to practice polygamy, believing that it was protected by the First Amendment. In 1879, in Reynolds v. United States,Reynolds v. United States ‚ÄúThe History of The Supreme Court‚Äù the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the Morrill Act, stating: \\"Laws are made for the government of actions, and while they cannot interfere with mere religious belief and opinion, they may with practices.\\" In 1890, church president Wilford Woodruff issued a Manifesto that officially terminated the practice of polygamy. Although this Manifesto did not dissolve existing plural marriages, relations with the United States markedly improved after 1890, such that Utah was admitted as a U.S. state in 1896. After the Manifesto, some Mormons continued to enter into polygamous marriages, but these eventually stopped in 1904 when church president Joseph F. Smith disavowed polygamy before Congress and issued a \\"Second Manifesto\\", calling for all plural marriages in the church to cease and established excommunication as the consequence for those who disobeyed. =Interracial marriage= In reference to interracial marriage, Joseph Smith taught that black and white people should be restricted by law to their own \\"species\\". As mayor of Nauvoo, Illinois, Joseph Smith held a trial and fined two black men the modern equivalent of thousands of dollars for trying to marry white women. Brigham Young publicly taught on at least three occasions (1847, 1852, and 1865) that the punishment for black-white interracial marriage was death, and that killing a black-white interracial couple and their children as part of a blood atonement would be a blessing to them. As governor of Utah Territory, he helped pass the Act in Relation to Service, which besides allowing black slavery also banned sexual intercourse between a white person and \\"any of the African race.\\" The law was expanded by the two-thirds-Mormon state of Utah in 1939 to prohibit a white person from marrying a \\"Mongolian, a member of the malay race or a mulatto, quadroon, or octoroon.\\" Unlike other states, however, Utah's law said nothing about marriage between white people and Native American people. The laws banning interracial marriage remained until they were repealed by the Utah state legislature in 1963. Church leaders consistently opposed marriage between different ethnicities. In 1954, apostle Mark E. Petersen taught that segregation was inspired by God, arguing that \\"what God hath separated, let not man bring together again\\". He warned that black people were fighting for civil rights so that they could marry white people. Apostle Boyd K. Packer publicly stated in 1977 that \\"We've always counseled in the Church for our Mexican members to marry Mexicans, our Japanese members to marry Japanese, our Caucasians to marry Caucasians, our Polynesian members to marry Polynesians. ... The counsel has been wise.\\" Nearly every decade for over a century‚Äîbeginning with the church's formation in the 1830s until the 1970s‚Äîhas seen some denunciation against miscegenation, with most focusing on black-white marriage. =Same-sex marriage= Protect Marriage Coalition lawn signs during their involvement with the pro-Prop 8 campaign. Beginning in the mid-1990s, the LDS Church began to focus its attention on the issue of same-sex marriages. It officially endorsed a federal amendment to the United States Constitution as well as Utah Constitutional Amendment 3 banning any marriages not between one man and one woman. It opposed same-sex marriage in Hawaii and California and urged its members to donate time and money towards the initiative. In California, church members accounted for 80 to 90 percent of volunteers who campaigned door-to-door and as much as half of the nearly $40 million raised during the campaign on Proposition 8. Members who did not support the church's position could be subject to church discipline, depending on circumstances and the judgement of local leadership. In reference to church involvement with legislation around LGBT people and marriage, the apostle M. Russell Ballard has said the church is \\"locked in\\" if anything interferes with the principle of marriage being between a man and a woman; Ballard also stated that a very careful evaluation is made to determine what action is appropriate.

Unlike tripods, pedestals give camera operators the ability to move the camera in any direction (left, right, forward, back, up, down). They are commonly used on shiny-floor shows, sitcoms and soap operas. Whilst pedestals are most commonly seen in self-contained television studios, they are also seen on outside broadcasts. Functionality Sony studio camera mounted on a Vinten Quattro-L pedestal Outside Broadcast camera on a Vinten pedestal. Note the pneumatic wheels. A pedestal typically consists of three main parts: a base (with wheels), the column (with steering ring), and the platform. In order to maintain stability and to keep the centre of gravity low, pedestals typically weigh roughly 30% more than their maximum weight capacity meaning that some, such as the Vinten Quattro-L, weigh over 150kg/330lbs. =Base= Manual pedestals have three wheels, allowing them to move along a floor in two ways. This is dictated by Crab/Steer controls on the base. * Crab mode has all three wheels interlinked to steer in the direction of the steering indicator on the steering ring * Steer mode locks the position of two wheels but allows the third wheel to turns as the steering ring is rotated Some pedestals have interchangeable wheels, allowing the studio wheels to be swapped out for OB wheels. On some pedestals, there is a skirt which stops cables from getting caught under the wheels or the base itself. Depending on the model, this can be set manually on each wheel, or across all three wheels. =Column= Pedestals are designed to take the weight of a pan & tilt head, television camera, zoom lens, teleprompter and vanity monitor; this is achieved by having a column balanced with pneumatics or hydraulics. The column, nowadays typically filled with compressed gas such as nitrogen, can be raised and lowered whilst \\"on-shot\\". There is a column brake which can be used to keep it at a set position. Locks on the column allow it to be locked down whilst not in use. This means that any change in pressure inside the column (due to temperature change, for example) will not result in damage to camera equipment. A steering ring, at the top of the column, rotates to control the direction the wheel(s) are pointing. The ring can also be used on some models to adjust the height of the cable skirt. Pedestals have also been adapted to have removable columns, allowing for it to be mounted directly on dolly tracks or a static base for use in environments where a pedestal would not fit Robotic pedestals Shotoku camera systems at Bloomberg London A number of manufacturers now make robotic camera pedestals, including companies like Shotoku and Vinten Radamec. These are particularly used in news broadcasting environments, where a single camera operator can control multiple cameras in different studios. The robotic pedestal can be moved around on a studio floor, and the height of the column adjusted, from a remote control panel. Typically, this panel will also control a pan-tilt head fitted on the pedestal, allowing the operator to frame the shot. Some manual pedestals can have a height drive fitted to them allowing for the height of the column to be adjusted remotely - however, someone would still need to reposition the pedestal itself.

Agriculture and Agro-processing  Chitambo District has a very good rainfall distribution throughout the rain season favoring any agriculture production. In addition, the district soil profile supports crop agriculture especially leguminous crops such as beans, soya beans and pigeon pea. Other crops that have high potential and can be grown in the district include; Ô¨Ånger millet, sweet potatoes, groundnuts, sunÔ¨Çower, pumpkins, water melons, pineapples, and vegetable crops that are grown oÔ¨Ä-season. The District boasts of having over 15,000 small-scale farmers. Therefore, with high number of small scale farmers and wide variety of crops produced in the District, opportunities exist for investment in Agro Processing and packaging of the crops produced. The many small scale farmers could easily form out-grower schemes to support sustained supply of the required input for processing to eastern markets via Tanzania, western markets via Congo DRC and locally.

He served with the Manchester Regiment and during the First World War was also seconded to the West African Frontier Force and the British Indian Army. After the war Bostock was seconded to the Egyptian Army and became commander of the Equatorial Corps of the Sudan Defence Force. In 1927‚Äì28 he led a punitive expedition against a rebellion of the Nuer people and successfully defeated a force led by Prophet Garluark. Bostock retired in 1933 but was recalled to service during the Second World War. Early life Bostock was born at Castries, Saint Lucia, on 13 February 1888 the son of John Henry Bostock, a civil engineer, and Caroline Sophia (n√©e Dew√©). He was educated in England at Windlesham House School, before going up to Marlborough College. Bostock played rugby union for Clifton in 1907-1908. After completing his studies at Marlborough he attended the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and after graduating entered the Manchester Regiment. On 25 May 1912, Bostock was promoted to lieutenant. During the early part of the First World War Bostock was seconded from his regiment to the 1st Battalion of the Nigeria Regiment of the West African Frontier Force. He received promotion to the rank of captain on 10 June 1915 and returned to the Manchester Regiment on 29 July 1915. Bostock served temporarily as second-in-command of one of the regiment's battalions from 31 August to 2 September 1916 and was granted the acting rank of major whilst he carried out this role. On 11 January 1917 he was attached to an Indian Army headquarters unit as a staff captain and on 30 December 1918 was promoted to brigade major.  Egyptian service On 15 March 1919 Bostock was seconded for service with the Egyptian Army (at that time Egypt, including Sudan, was a British protectorate) and on 3 June received the Military Cross for service on operations in that country. Bostock was in England in 1925 when he made his sole first-class cricket appearance for the British Army cricket team against Cambridge University at Fenner's. He scored 5 runs during the match, as well as taking the wickets of Hamer Bagnall and Thomas Tweed in Cambridge's first-innings. Bostock afterwards returned to Egypt where he served as commander of the Equatorial Corps of the Sudan Defence Force (Sudan was then under a joint Anglo-Egyptian condominium). During this time the Nuer people of southern Sudan opposed British rule and remained active despite several British punitive expeditions. Led by Prophet Garluark, who formerly served the British as a regional ruler, an open revolt erupted in the Western Nuer territories in December 1927 in which the British district commissioner and 18 of his men were killed. A simultaneous uprising occurred by the Nuer of the Sobat River region. The British responded by launching two expeditions, one to the Sobat River under Captain JR Chidlaw- Robert and one against Garluark under Bostock. Bostock's base of operations was at Shambe and his political officer was Captain HF Kidd, district commissioner for Yirrol. Bostock divided his force into several independent columns that successfully established a cordon around Garluark's Nuer and allowed their destruction largely by aerial attack. The operation was completed by 7 February 1928 and resulted in Garluark's capture and imprisonment at Malakal. In recognition of his service in Sudan Bostock was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire on 3 June 1929. Garluark was restored to his former position as regional ruler in 1935.  Later career  On 6 March 1931, Bostock was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel and the next year was posted to the West Indies. He retired from the army on 6 March 1933. In April 1937 Bostock, who was then residing at the Sports Club in St James's Square, was declared bankrupt but the order was rescinded by June of that year. Following the outbreak of the Second World War Bostock was recalled to the army and chose to serve in the reduced rank of major. On 9 March 1942 he was restored to the rank of lieutenant-colonel. Bostock reached the age limit for service in the reserves on 13 February 1943 and resumed his retirement. He died in Ifield, West Sussex on 30 January 1962.

This Archelaus appears to have been a king of Cilicia Trachea, certainly not the last king of Cappadocia, Archelaus of Cappadocia, for he was dead before the time to which Tacitus refers in the passage cited above. The Clitae refused to submit to the regulations of the Roman census, and to pay taxes, and retired to the heights of the Taurus Mountains. There they successfully resisted the king, until M. Trebellius was sent by Vitellius, the governor of Syria, who blockaded them in their hill forts, Cadra and Davara, and compelled them to surrender. In the reign of Claudius the Clitae again fortified themselves on the mountains, under a leader Trosobores, whence they descended to the coast and the towns, plundering the cultivators, townspeople, shipmasters, and merchants. They besieged the town of Anemurium, a place probably near the promontory, from which and the other circumstances we collect that the Clitae were a nation in Cilicia Trachea. At last Antiochus IV of Commagene, who was king of this coast, by pleasing the common sort and cajoling the leader, succeeded in putting Trosobores and a few of the chiefs to death, and pacified the rest by his mild measures.

Chang has also served on the board of China Aviation Development Foundation. Chang was nominated to the chairmanship of the Central Election Commission in June 2004. In June 2007, Kuomintang legislators criticized Chang for scheduling elections for the seventh Legislative Yuan on 12 January 2008. The 2008 Taiwanese transitional justice referendum was scheduled for the same date, and local governments affiliated with the Pan-Blue Coalition announced that voters within their jurisdiction would use two-step voting, in which legislative ballots and referendum ballots were obtained and cast separately, instead of one-step voting mandated by the Central Election Commission, in which voters would receive and cast legislative and referendum ballots at the same time. Chang spoke out against the Kuomintang's decision, and stated that ballots cast via two-step voting would be ruled invalid. Chang later stated in December 2007 that voters could receive ballots separately if, during the voting process, they did not leave the polling place. Chang stepped down from the Central Election Commission in November 2009, expressing concern that a new commission was to be sworn in a month before local elections, despite that fact that the terms of outgoing members would not expire until June 2010.

The strike, which lasted for 510 days from June 10, 2007 to November 13, 2008 called for the end of the discriminatory system of irregular employment and the reinstatement of dismissed unionized workers.  Background  = Irregularly-employed workers = Irregular employment is a precarious form of employment that provides little to no job security for irregularly-employed workers and excludes them from basic labor rights and welfare protections. Furthermore, due to the status as part-time, temporary, subcontracted, independently contracted and daily workers, irregularly-employed workers are often denied work benefits entitled to regular workers, including paid sick and vacation leave, health insurance, unemployment compensation, and seniority. Irregular employment grew rapidly after 1997 when South Korea experienced a national financial crisis, known as the \\"IMF crisis.\\" The instability of financial markets and the inability of firms to pay short-term loans created a severe debt crisis, not only in South Korea but also in Thailand and Indonesia, resulting in the South Korean government's acceptance of a bailout loan from the International Monetary Fund in the amount of $57 billion. Due to neoliberal loan conditionalities imposed by the IMF, firms were required to reduce labor costs, dismantle employment security and utilize temporary employment system to avoid bankruptcy. Thus, the number of irregularly-employed workers in South Korea increased in a progressively larger ratio. By end of 1998, the number of unemployed in South Korea reached 1.3 million, equivalent to approximately 4.6% of the unemployment rate. In addition to the increase of male unemployment, the number of women workers entering the job market as irregularly-employed workers increased. Although the IMF crisis was concluded in South Korea by the time of August 23, 2001, the irregularly-employed worker system persisted and was fully utilized by the E-Land Group. The E-Land Group enlarged their retail business in South Korea upon the end of sovereign default by purchasing New Core Co. in 2003 and the Carrefour (former name of Homever Outlet) in 2006. The majority of the workers in the E-Land stores were irregularly-employed workers, mostly consisted by married women over the age of 30 who were earning monthly wage of 800,000 Korean Won which was below the average monthly income. = Irregular Employment Protection Act = On June 2007, the E-Land Group launched a mass-downsizing by dismissing around 570 irregularly-employed workers, mostly supermarket cashiers and sales assistants. The mass-downsizing and the restructuring was a legal pathway for the E-Land Group to avoid the Irregular Employment Protection Act. Irregular Employment Protection Act was a legislative bill that become effective in 2006 which guaranteed an irregularly-employed worker to be promoted as a regular worker after two years of continuous employment. This means, upon the fulfillment of the condition, any irregularly-employed worker becomes eligible to receive job benefits, work insurances (national pension, employment insurance, health insurance and workers‚Äô compensation insurance) and job security that is fully protected by the labor rights law. However, on June 2006, only the small portion of the irregularly-employed workers were promoted as a regular worker, and around 570 irregularly-employed workers were released from New Core Co. and Homever Outlet (Around 220 irregularly-employed workers from New Core Co. and 350 from Homever Outlet) by the termination of the contract.  E-Land strike  Upon the termination of the contracts and the downsizing, the E-Land labor union, one of the first irregularly-employed workers' labor union organized by KCTU (Korean Confederation of Trade Union), initiated the first strike on June 10, 2007 (an overall strike on June 20, 2007). E-Land labor union demanded the termination of the irregular workforce system and the reinstatement of the 570 released workers. However, neither representatives of New Core Co. and Homever Outlet responded to the demand of the E-Land labor union. = Sit-down strike in Homever Outlet of Sangam-dong World Cup Stadium = On June 30, 2007, 600 union members of the E-Land labor union initiated a sit-down strike in E-Land's flagship Homever outlet of Sangam-dong World Cup Stadium shopping complex. During the occupation, the union members camped out on the mats and boxes installed next to the row of locked-down cash registers. The sit-down strike was initially planned as a short-term protest. However, the occupation prolonged when the representative of Homever Outlet continued to reject the demand of the E-Land labor union. The occupation lasted 21 days and were forced to stop when riot police intervened on the date of July 20, 2007, the day when there was an A-League Soccer Match held in the stadium. The E-Land labor union continued the protest by organizing rallies in 40 different Homever retail locations, including the regions of Yatab, Ilsan, PyungChon, Incheon, Gangnam, Sangam, etc. In front of the retail stores, the union members pitched tents and camps and held a sit- down strike. During the process of the sit-down strike, the union members organized picket lines and spread flyers to call for a consumer boycott of all E-Land products. The impact of the sit-down strike attracted attentions of the media and the public. From the conservative media outlets, E-Land Group was criticized for breaking the livelihood of the union members' family by abusing the Irregular Employment Protection Act. With the support from the media, the E-Land labor union elicited support from various organizations, including 37 different civic organizations, democratic labor party of Seoul province and international union of commerce workers like UNI. In addition, for the first time, KCTU convened a general meeting of the board members to organize a fund- raising campaign to provide financial support for the union members. = End of the protest = The protest showed signs of conclusion when Samsung Tesco purchased Homever Outlet on May 2008. On November 13, 2008, the representatives of Samsung Tesco and E-Land labor union came to an agreement of ending the protest under following condition: Samsung Tesco - Guaranteed promotion to irregularly-employed workers who have exceeded the 16-months of working period, increase of the wage, enhanced work benefits. E-Land labor union - Release of the 12 leaders of the E-Land labor union.

She works on algorithmic bias and data mining. She is an advocate for diversity in technology and is the cofounder of Black in AI, a community of black researchers working in artificial intelligence.  Early life and education  Gebru was born and raised in Jigjiga, Ethiopia. Both her parents are Eritreans. Her father and two oldest sisters are electrical engineers. Her father died when she was five years old and she was raised by her mother. She escaped potential forced deportation to Eritrea by Ethiopian government in the late 1990s and traveled to Ireland. She then immigrated to the United States to join her mother (who also fled from Ethiopia few months prior) and her two older sisters who have been living in U.S. Gebru is the youngest of three. After completing her high school in Massachusetts, she was accepted to study at Stanford University. There she earned her Bachelor's and Master's degrees in electrical engineering. Gebru worked at Apple Inc., developing signal processing algorithms for the first IPad. Gebru earned her doctorate under the supervision of Fei-Fei Li at Stanford University in 2017. She used data mining of publicly available images. She was interested in the amount of money spent by governmental and non-governmental organisations trying to collect information about communities. To investigate alternatives, Gebru combined deep learning with Google Street View to estimate the demographics of United States neighbourhoods, showing that socioeconomic attributes such as voting patterns, income, race and education can be inferred from observations of cars. If the number of pickup trucks outnumbers the number of sedans, the community are more likely to vote for the Republican party. They analysed over 15 million images from the 200 most populated US cities. The work was extensively covered in the media, being picked up by BBC News, Newsweek, The Economist and The New York Times. Gebru presented her research at the 2017 LDV Capital Vision Summit competition, where computer vision scientists present their work to members of industry and venture capitalists. Gebru won the competition, starting a series of collaborations with other entrepreneurs and investors. Both during her PhD in 2016 and in 2018, Gebru returned to Ethiopia with Jelani Nelson's programming campaign AddisCoder. After her PhD, Gebru joined Microsoft as a postdoctoral researcher in the Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics in AI (FATE) lab.  Career and research  Gebru revealing that you can predict, with some reliability, the way an American will vote from the type of vehicle they drive. Gebru works at Google on the ethics of Artificial Intelligence. She studies the implications of artificial intelligence, looking to improve the ability of technology to do social good. She collaborated with the MIT research group Gender Shades. Gebru worked with Joy Buolamwini to investigate facial recognition software; finding that black women were 35% less likely to be recognised than white men. When Gebru attended an artificial intelligence conference in 2016, she noticed that she was the only black woman out of 8,500 delegates. Together with her colleague Rediet Abebe Gebru founded Black in AI,Black in AI a community of black researchers working in artificial intelligence. Black in AI have held workshops at the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems annually since 2017. She has discussed bias in artificial intelligence in podcasts and interviews. Gebru also worked on Microsoft's Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics in the AI team. In 2017, Gebru spoke on the Fairness and Transparency conference, where MIT Technology Review interviewed her about biases that exist in AI systems and how adding diversity in AI teams can fix that issue. In her interview with Jackie Snow, Snow asked Gebru, \\"How does the lack of diversity distort artificial intelligence and specifically computer vision?\\" and Gebru pointed out that there are biases that exist in the software developers. Gebru and other artificial intelligence researchers signed a letter that reflected the systemic issues that reside in Amazon's facial recognition software. A study that was conducted by MIT researchers shows that Amazon's facial recognition system had trouble identifying darker- skinned females than any other technology companies facial recognition software. In a New York Times interview, Gebru has further expressed that she believes facial recognition is too dangerous to be used for law enforcement and security purposes right now.  Recognition  In 2017 Gebru was awarded the title \\"Alicorn of Artificial Intelligence\\" by The Selfpreneur. This award was for her research on using machine learning and deep learning to predict demographic data using Google Street View. Gebru, Joy Buolamwini and Inioluwa Raji have also won Venturebeat's 2019 AI innovations award in the category AI for Good for their research highlighting the significant problem of algorithmic bias in facial recognition.

He served in both world wars with the London Regiment and the Grenadier Guards, winning the Military Cross during the First World War. He was a first-class cricketer who played for the British Army cricket team and the Free Foresters. Early life and World War I The son of the first-class cricketer Theodore Dury and his wife Helen Isabella Ingram, Dury was born at Harrow-on-the-Hill. He was educated at Harrow School, where he played for the school cricket team in 1913 and 1914. He enlisted in the 4th Battalion, London Regiment in January 1915 as a second lieutenant. He served during World War I, firstly with the London Regiment where he gained the rank of temporary lieutenant in September 1915. He served in the later stages of the war with the 3rd Battalion of the Grenadier Guards, and was given the temporary rank of captain in April 1918. In June 1918 he received the Military Cross for \\"conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty\\". Dury ran forwards from the support trenches to direct the defence of two forward posts under heavy machine gun fire. During the Battle of Albert in August 1918 he led his company in an attack that cleared the German trenches and captured a village. Later in the day he fell victim to German gassing and was temporarily blinded. One of his men later recalled that while recovering in the bed next to Dury in hospital he was reprimanded by him for stating that he was \\"In the Grenadiers\\" rather than the more formal \\"Grenadier Guards\\". In February 1918 he was one of just twenty guests at the wedding of ballerina Phyllis Bedells to fellow Grenadiers officer Ian MacBean. Later military career Following the war, he was selected to play for H. D. G. Leveson Gower's cricket team in a first-class match against Cambridge University at Eastbourne in 1919. Having relinquished the temporary rank of captain in January 1920, Dury had his prior rank of lieutenant backdated in February 1921, with seniority to August 1917. He was selected to play first-class cricket for the British Army cricket team against Cambridge University at Cambridge in May 1922. He was promoted to the rank of captain in September 1923, having served as an adjutant vice-captain since May 1922. Dury made a third and final appearance in first-class cricket for the Free Foresters in June 1926 against Oxford University at Oxford, during which he made a half century with 51 in the Free Foresters first- innings. He retired from military service on 27 September 1931, retaining the rank of captain. Following the outbreak of World War II Dury was recalled to the army. Serving once more with the Grenadier Guards, he was promoted to the rank of brevet major in May 1942. Dury served as the first commandant of a prisoner of war camp near Penrith, Cumbria, that held the German survivors of the sinking of the Bismarck. Two Luftwaffe officers later made a daring escape from the camp in which they managed to steal an RAF training plane from RAF Kingstown. After they ran out of fuel and were recaptured near Great Yarmouth, Dury is said to have remarked: \\"One really has to take off one's hat to them ... I really regret having to lock them up.\\" He exceeded the age to be recalled in August 1948, was removed from the reserve list of officers, and was granted the honorary rank of lieutenant colonel. Personal life Dury married Rose Mary Dorothy Vernon-Harcourt (who had been a widow for 14 years) on 12 August 1949. He died at Eastbourne in August 1976.

The comparison was popularized by Larry Kramer and ACT-UP, especially the organization's French chapter, as a way to garner sympathy for AIDS sufferers and spur research into the disease. Although the comparison is now \\"commonly heard\\" with regard to AIDS, critics maintain that it is a form of Holocaust trivialization. Background Between 1941 and 1945, about six million European Jews were systematically murdered by Nazi Germany and its allies as part of a deliberately planned genocide known as the Holocaust. Gay men were also persecuted under Nazi rule, with between 5,000 and 15,000 sent to the concentration camps and forced to wear pink triangle badges. The AIDS epidemic began in 1981 when young, healthy homosexual men in the United States were diagnosed with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. This turned out to be due to immune deficiency caused by the HIV virus. More than 35 million people worldwide have died as a result of HIV infection. Usage Poster of the Silence=Death Project, also used by ACT-UP In 1985, a group of gay men in New York (including Avram Finkelstein) founded the Silence=Death Project to raise awareness about AIDS. According to Finkelstein, the group was about half Jewish. Finkelstein and others designed the well known poster at right after being horrified by William F. Buckley Jr.'s call for HIV positive individuals to be tattooed. (Following criticism, Buckley admitted that his proposal \\"reminded everyone of Auschwitz\\".) Larry Kramer is an American playwright and AIDS activist who frequently invoked the AIDS-as-Holocaust trope. Kramer considered the lack of press coverage in American newspapers of the AIDS epidemic to be similar to its tepid response to the Holocaust. He also criticized some LGBT organizations, such as Gay Men's Health Crisis, for not being militant enough in the struggle against the AIDS epidemic; in Kramer's opinion, this was comparable to the reaction of the Judenr√§te, \\"Jewish councils\\" set up by the Nazis, to the murder of their communities. Kramer believed that the slow pace of AIDS research was due to prejudice against homosexuals and constituted genocide by neglect. Officials in the administration of Ronald Reagan were \\"equal to Hitler and his Nazi doctors performing their murderous experiments in the camps‚Äînot because of similar intentions, but because of similar results\\", and Anthony S. Fauci, leader of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, was comparable to Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann. Kramer founded a new organization, ACT-UP, to agitate for AIDS sufferers. ACT-UP was known for its combative rhetoric and use of the slogan \\"Silence=Death\\" and the pink triangle. The AIDS-as-Holocaust metaphor was especially common in French AIDS activist groups. ACT UP-Paris was active in drawing parallels between a well known example of official indifference to mass death in a specific community (the Holocaust) and applied that to the perceived indifference of the government to the AIDS crisis, which affected marginalized groups. French photographer Herv√© Guibert, who died of AIDS, was known for having compared his body to that of prisoners at Auschwitz concentration camp. proposed that AIDS was a turning point in LGBT history, similar to what the Holocaust had been for the Jews. In 1997, Steven Epstein argued that the comparison of AIDS and genocide was growing less commonplace as activist groups accommodated themselves with the medical establishment. Reception According to David Caron, the comparison of AIDS and the Holocaust has inspired more anger than other comparisons relating to genocides. Arlene Stein writes that the AIDS‚ÄìHolocaust metaphor is part of a discourse in which the \\"Holocaust has become a universal symbol of injustice\\". Susan Sontag was critical of the metaphor, telling a reporter that \\"The Holocaust was inflicted by human beings on human beings. It‚Äôs wrong to compare a situation in which there was real culpability to one in which there is none... The word [Holocaust] should not be used metaphorically\\". According to a 2013 Vanity Fair article, it is a \\"commonly heard metaphor about AIDS\\". However, research by Andrea Kalmin and Katherine Bischoping in 1999 indicated that most Americans did not make comparisons between the Holocaust and the victimization of sexual minorities. Critics maintain that the AIDS‚ÄìHolocaust metaphor is a form of Holocaust trivialization.

Introduced during the show's conception in 1972, they were the main family for storylines between the 1970s and 1980s and remained as such for many years. The families original unit consisted of widowed farmer Annie Sugden (Sheila Mercier), alongside her children Peggy Skilbeck (Jo Kendall), Jack Sugden (Andrew Burt and Clive Hornby) and Joe Sugden (Frazer Hines). Subsequently these characters went on to produce more generations of Sugdens. The Sugden family are characterized as a hardworking bunch, but the family has struggled with various types of dramatic moments such as Peggy's death and the death's of the Skilbecks, Jack's affair with Rachel Hughes, Sarah Sugden's death, rivalry between Robert and Jack's adopted son Andy, Andy's abuse on his wife Jo Stiles, a house fire, Robert murdering Andy's ex-wife Katie Addyman as well as his homosexual affair with Aaron Dingle, Andy being framed for murder and going on the run, Jack's daughter Victoria's rape and Robert being sent to prison for murdering her rapist Lee Posner. As of 2020, Jack's daughter, Victoria and her son Harry Sugden, remain the only two Sugden by blood on the show. Additionally, several others may be considered Sugdens through marriage; Diane Sugden and Aaron. Andy's daughter Sarah Sugden remains on the show but she is not a Sugden by blood. Creation The Sugden family were created in 1972 by Kevin Laffan as one of the show's original family. The Sugden family were the owners of Emmerdale Farm from the programme's early days. Jacob Sugden worked as a local farmer in Emmerdale. With his wife Annie he had two sons, Jack in 1947, Joe in 1949 and a daughter Peggy in 1948. Jacob always neglected his family and was an alcoholic, whereas Annie was left to manage the farm and look after their children. Eventually their daughter Peggy married Matt Skilbeck (Frederick Pyne) and had two children Sam and Sally. Jack left the village in the spring of 1964 after an argument with father Jacob over intensive farming, wanting to see more of the world than Beckindale, and went to London. He had unknowingly got his childhood sweetheart Ruth Harker (also known as Pat) pregnant. She married local thug Tom Merrick (David Hill) that year and tricked him into thinking the baby was his, by telling him the baby was premature. Sometime in the mid-to-late 1960s Jack met and married Lynn Wallace. Shortly afterwards he wrote and published his best seller The Field Of Tares. Kevin Laffan created the character of Annie Sugden as he was said to be \\"keen on dominant women\\" and it has been said that he created a \\"memorable heroine\\" in Annie Sugden, \\"the wife of the ne'er-do-well‚Ä¶who drank himself to an early grave\\" (the first episode opened with his funeral). Actress (Sheila Mercier) ‚Äî whose career had been mainly theatrical ‚Äî was chosen to play the role and went on to be the serial's longest running original actor. Mercier has commented \\"I had done a lot of television from the stage of the Whitehall, but very little else before joining Emmerdale Farm‚Ä¶I remember, at first, playing to the Gods! Tristan de Vere Cole, one of the first directors on the programme, told me to take [my performance] down until it was so low I was almost muttering. Then, Gordon Flemyng - another of the directors - played back to me a scene I did so that I could see what I had done wrong.\\"\\" In her 1994 autobiography, Mercier recalls how on so many occasions she wanted Annie to cry but the director, David Green, said \\"Annie does not cry. She cries all her tears into the pillow at night. Peggy and her family were killed off in 1973, and Jack married Pat Merrick (Helen Weir). Robert Sugden was introduced as their child played by Richard Smith. In 1989, Christopher Smith took on the role. He remained in the show until 2001, when the character was recast to Karl Davies and he remained until 2005. After a brief return in 2009, the character was recast to Ryan Hawley in 2014. Mercier retired in 1994 appearing in only a handful of Emmerdale episodes, making guest appearances in 1995, 1996 and 2009, whilst Joe Sugden was killed off off-screen in 1995. Jack remarried Sarah Connolly (Madeleine Howard/Alyson Spiro). Their daughter Victoria Sugden (Jessica Heywood/Hannah Midgley/Isabel Hodgins) was born on-screen in 1994. Jack lastly remarried to Diane Blackstock (Elizabeth Estensen) who remains the Sugden matriarch. Apart from the blood related Sugden‚Äôs there were many others who were related to the Sugden‚Äôs and were treated like other members of the family, these were; Matt Skilbeck whose first wife was Peggy, long after she died Matt lived at Emmerdale Farm, he even brought his second wife; Dolly Skilbeck to live at Emmerdale Farm in 1978 where Dolly herself was treated by Annie, Joe & Jack like a daughter and sister, Matt & Dolly had a son of their own in 1982; Sam Skilbeck who was treated by Annie like a grandson, even after Matt left Beckindale in December 1989, Dolly & Sam were always welcome at the Farm. Sandie Merrick was Jack‚Äôs step-daughter, she is the only child of Pat and her first husband; Tom Merrick, however this didn‚Äôt stop her and Jack from being close themselves, Jack was supportive to Sandie when she fell pregnant at the age of 17 in 1983, The Sugden‚Äôs made sure that Sandie was part of their family, Joe even gave his step-niece a job at NY Estates over Eric Pollard who was more qualified. Rachel Hughes and her younger brother Mark Hughes were the children of Kate and her first husband; David, much like the Merrick family a decade before, the Hughes family would become related to the Sugden‚Äôs through Kate‚Äôs marriage to Joe who at first found it hard being a stepfather, sought Jack‚Äôs advice on how he became close to his own step-daughter; Sandie, Jack said that it would take time but admitted that Sandie was more mature than Mark when she had been his age, and easier to get on with than the Hughes siblings, eventually Rachel and Mark settled down at Emmerdale Farm and became close with other family members, Mark even got a crush on his older Step- cousin; Sandie, Joe reassured Kate that he would look after Rachel and Mark when their marriage ended in 1991, and the Hughes siblings were more or less adopted by Joe, since he had no children of his own, something which bothered him in the 1980s when he saw how settled and happy Jack and Matt were with their own families, so having Rachel and Mark gave Joe the family he always wanted. In Emmerdale The audience was introduced to farmer's wife Annie Sugden in the soap's first episode in 1972. It was a time of sadness for the Sugden family, as they were burying their recently deceased father, Jacob, who had died after spending much of his later years in the pub, The Woolpack, drinking away the family's farming profits. Early central storylines in the serial followed the Sugden family, especially Annie as she struggled to come to terms with the death of her husband, support her family, and run Emmerdale Farm, set in the Yorkshire Dales in the fictional village of Beckindale. Matriarchal Annie aimed to rebuild the ailing farm by reuniting her two feuding sons, Jack and Joe. She sold part of Emmerdale Farm to village outsider, Henry Wilks, who had made his fortune in the wool industry and brought his business acumen to Beckindale. Sad times hit the Sugden family in 1973, when Peggy died of a brain hemorrhage a few months after giving birth to twins and three years later, Peggy's twins were killed on a level crossing, leaving Annie to comfort their father Matt. Soon after Jack returned to London and Joe married Christine Sharp. Joe and Christine's marriage was short lived as Christine decided that she did not want to be a farmer's wife. Christine returned the following year to reconcile but Joe wanted a divorce and she left for good. Three years later, Jack returnee, and it was revealed he was suffering from writer's block and needed some time away from London. Annie offered him some advice and he took it onboard, before departing back to London on good terms with his family. Jack eventually returned in 1980 vowing to stay for good as he wanted to settle down. Ruth Harker, now calling herself \\"Pat\\", returned to the village with Jackie Merrick (Ian Sharrock) and her daughter, Sandie Merrick (Jane Hutcheson) after leaving her husband Tom for good and reunited with Jack. During this time, Jackie discovered that Jack was his biological father and took the news badly and there was an unease between the two. In October 1982, Jack and Pat married but less than two years into the marriage, Jack began an affair with local newspaper reporter, Karen Moore (Annie Hulley). Pat found out and demanded Jack choose between her and Karen and he chooses Pat and they reconciled. In 1985, Pat learned that she pregnant and gave birth to Jack's second son, Robert (Richard Smith), on 22 April 1986. Jack was left devastated when Pat died in a car crash four months later, leaving him to bring up Robert on his own, with the help of Annie. In 1988, Joe met divorcee Kate Hughes (Sally Knyvette), and her two teenage children, Rachel (Glenda McKay) and Mark Hughes (Craig McKay). Initially Kate and Joe argued after he shot her dog for bothering his sheep but eventually they fell in love. They married in 1989 after Joe proposed but with Mark and Rachel opposed and wanting Kate to reconcile with their father, David) (Martyn Whitby), Joe became worried. They married and Kate's children eventually came round to their mother's new marriage. In 1990, Kate accidentally ran over Pete Whiteley, killing him and was jailed for a year but was released the following January. Kate told Joe the marriage was over and returned to Sheffield. Rachel and Mark decided to stay and Joe formed a closer relationship with them. After a lengthy period of grieving, Jack began dating again when he met mobile librarian, Sarah Connolly (Madeleine Howard), in 1988; Sarah also became a mother figure to Robert. Jackie disliked Sarah at first and felt that she was trying to replace Pat but warmed to her thanks to intervention from his wife Kathy (Malandra Burrows). Jack was left bitter and angry when Jackie died in a shooting accident in August 1989 and Sarah was there for him. The couple moved in together in 1990, and Jack often proposed but she keeps turning him down. Sarah fell pregnant in 1993 and gives birth to a daughter in March 1994, Victoria (Jessica Heywood). A plane crashed into Emmerdale village and left Annie comatose and her new husband Leonard Kempinski (Bernard Archard) dead. Jack and Sarah married in May 1994 and in the same month the village was renamed Emmerdale. Joe left the village soon after and died off-screen in 1995. After moving to Spain in 1994, Annie returned to Emmerdale in 1995 to bury her son Joe, who had died in a car accident. 23 years after his first proposal, Amos Brearly (Ronald Magill) proposed to Annie again; this time she accepted. Annie and Amos returned to Spain where they married on 5 November 1995, though Annie returned briefly on 7 November 1996 to ask Jack to sell Emmerdale Farm; he refused. Jack and Sarah's marriage was tested when Jack had a fling with Sarah‚Äôs friend and Jack's former stepniece, Rachel Tate (Glenda McKay) but they reconciled. The Sugdens adopted Andy Hopwood (Kelvin Fletcher) a school friend of Robert (now Christopher Smith ). By the end of the 1990s, Jack and Sarah's marriage was in trouble again when Jack suggested that Robert and Andy work on the farm rather than attend school and money problems worsened. They took in a lodger, Richie Carter (Glenn Lamont) and Sarah, feeling neglected began an affair with Richie and left Jack. Sarah got custody of Victoria (now Hannah Midgley) and Jack got custody of Robert and Andy. Andy put the barn on fire to help Jack claim on the insurance but the plan went wrong when Sarah was killed and Jack was arrested as the chief suspect. Andy came clean to Richie about the fire and begged him to change his statement and he agreed, resulting in Jack's freedom. Jack later began dating Woolpack landlady Diane Blackstock (Elizabeth Estensen). Andy began dating Katie Addyman (Sammy Winward). Robert and Andy wnt to a nightclub with Eve Birch (Raine Davison), Marc Reynolds (Anthony Lewis), Ollie Reynolds (Vicky Binns), Donna Windsor (Verity Rushworth), Robert (now Karl Davies) and Katie. When they missed the bus, they stole a car and accidentally killed their headteacher Barbara Strickland (Alex Hall). They attempted to cover up their crime and burned the car. After living with guilt, the group confessed and everyone apart from Marc (who was driving) were given community service. Andy and Katie decided to have a baby to changed his mind, but when Brian (Katie's father) learned that Katie was pregnant, he sent her to live with her mother. She returned and moved in with Andy, but had a miscarriage. Despite this, she and Andy decided to get married and started planning their wedding. Katie, however, felt neglected by Andy working long hours and turned to Robert when he promised her excitement. When Andy discovered Robert (now Karl Davies) was having an affair with his wife, Katie (Sammy Winward), he waited for Robert in his caravan with a shotgun, intending to shoot him but accidentally shot Jack instead. Having almost died, Jack initially disowned Andy but they reconciled and Jack and Diane planned to marry but she revealed that she had colon cancer and underwent chemotherapy. The couple married and enjoyed a honeymoon in Las Vegas while Diane recovered. Andy soon got 15-year-old Debbie Dingle's (Charley Webb) pregnant and she gave birth to their daughter Sarah. After a revenge attempt against Andy for killing Sarah backfired, resulting in the death of Max King (Charlie Kemp), Robert fled from the village. Jack and Diane assumed responsibility for Andy's half-brother, Daz Eden (Luke Tittensor), as they did with Andy a decade earlier. Andy and Daz's father, Billy (David Crellin), Andy and Daz's real father, was released from prison and returned to Emmerdale much to the Ire of various residents, having robbed the Post Office and killed Vic Windsor (Alun Lewis) on Christmas Day 1998. Meanwhile, Andy saw Jo was better with Sarah and restarted their affair. Andy was about to tell Katie when she announces that she could be pregnant, which soon became clear is a false alarm. Andy told her about his and Jo's affair. Katie threw them out but they soon returned as Andy was the leaseholder so Katie moved out instead and moved her business to Home Farm. Before Katie left, she wished Jo luck, telling her she will need it. Andy and Katie subsequently divorced. Victoria (now played by Isabel Hodgins) returned from Annie in Spain, later than expected, prompting Jack and Diane to worry but returned safely. Victoria and Kayleigh went clubbing but Kayleigh left early. Victoria flirted with an older boy and he tried to force himself on her but Billy Hopwood (David Crellin) stopped him and rescued her. Billy drove her home but his brakes failed, due to Kelly Windsor (Adele Silva) sabotaging them, and they crashed into a lake. Victoria almost drowned, only escaping as Jack, Andy and Daz arrived. Jack blamed Billy until Victoria told him that Billy had saved her life. Victoria began looking for answers to the cause of Sarah Sr's death. She tracked down Richie who told her to ask Jack. In an attempt to force a confession, she doused the furniture in petrol and demanded the truth, Andy confessed but a fire soon ignited. Following Andy's confession, he was sentenced to three years imprisonment in January 2008 after confessing to manslaughter. Andy and Jo married on 19 February 2008 in prison. When Andy was released, he was not pleased to find that things had changed. He began lashing out at Jo, giving her a black eye in one instance. The abuse continued for months and culminated in Andy getting seriously injured during a confrontation in a barn. Jo eventually left after Lee Naylor (Lewis Linford) helped her sell the farm equipment to fund her escape. Jack visited Annie in Spain in 2008 and remained for several months until Annie informed the family of Jack's death of a heart attack on 5 February 2009, leaving them devastated. Robert returned briefly for the funeral and left Emmerdale again. Daz and Victoria slept together in a deserted barn. Victoria was thrilled, thinking she and Daz were a couple now but Daz told her that he wasn't going to dump Scarlett. He felt guilty about cheating on Scarlett and told Victoria that it was a mistake and they should forget about it. Victoria hoped Daz would change his mind but when he didn't, Victoria told him that she was pregnant, just as he and Scarlett were going away for a weekend. He told Victoria that she'd have to see a doctor and that people would think he was a pervert if they announced that she was expecting his baby, so Victoria admitted she'd lied. Furious, Daz moved back into Dale View with Jake. Knowing Daz would be annoyed, Victoria reconciled with Aaron Livesy (Danny Miller). In May, Aaron and Victoria slept together and, thinking Daz and Jake would be at work, she \\"borrowed\\" Jake's keys and took Aaron to Dale View. Unfortunately Daz and Scarlett went home for lunch and found them there. Angry, Daz went for Aaron and trying to stop them fighting, Victoria blurted out that Daz didn't want her any more, making Aaron and Scarlett realised Daz and Victoria's relationship was more than brother/sister. Sarah became ill and was diagnosed with Fanconi anaemia, a genetic disorder which could kill her without treatment. Debbie and Andy then started looking for donors and find one but they pulled out at the last moment. It was suggested to them that another baby or 'Saviour Sibling' could save their sick child. They applied for IVF but were turned down when the hospital learned that they were not a genuine couple as they need to be to qualify for funding for IVF. Debbie then suggested they tried artificial insemination despite their partners Cameron Murray (Dominic Power) and Alicia Gallagher (Natalie Anderson) being unhappy with this situation, they choose to go ahead regardless but were unsuccessful, despite trying repeatedly. Debbie believed the only way to conceive is for them to sleep together. Desperate to save her daughter, Debbie got Andy to meet her at a hotel and apologized for her previous actions and seduced him, telling him it was just about them and that she wanted him. Debbie discovered that she was pregnant and Andy was delighted, while Cameron felt left out but believed the baby was a result of artificial insemination. Andy took in Kerry Wyatt (Laura Norton) after her daughter Amy (Chelsea Halfpenny) threw her out. Debbie went into labour in October and gave birth to a boy and they named him Jack after Andy's late adoptive father. Andy and Amy shared a kiss and Amy eventually tells Kerry.m Andy's relationship with Kerry came to an end after Sarah and Jack are left in danger when Kerry got drunk and dropped a cigarette, starting a fire. Desperate to win Andy back, Kerry told him she was pregnant but after a hit and run incident with Adam Barton (Adam Thomas) and Robbie Lawson (Jamie Shelton), she told Andy that she was never pregnant but that she loved him. Angry at her behaviour, he rejected her and dated Amy for a while. Victoria was heartbroken to learn that Adam had slept with local vet Vanessa Woodfield (Michelle Hardwick) and had impregnated her. She went on a downward spiral. The following day, Adam notices Victoria attempting to drive her car, knowing that she has not passed her driving test and did not have a previsional license, and tried to stop her. She did not listen, and as she drove off, she ran over Ashley Thomas (John Middleton). He appeared to be fine, however, he later collapsed and was comatose. Victoria was terrified she would be imprisoned, so Adam gave her a false alibi. However, Ashley's alcoholic ex- wife Laurel (Charlotte Bellamy) drunkenly announced that Ashley has died while in hospital, unaware that he was still comatose. Victoria could not deal with her guilt and handed herself in to the police, and she is arrested. She was later released, and was delighted to hear that Ashley is alive. Adam and Victoria rekindled their relationship and decided to run away and get married, with the help of Aaron. In 2014, Andy started a romantic relationship with his stepsister, Bernice Blackstock (Samantha Giles). At the opening night of Bernice's beauty salon their affair was made public. Later in 2014, Andy suffered an accident to his arm while working at Butlers Farm which was caused by Adam. Bernice did her best to support Andy through this. Katie accompanied Andy to a hospital appointment. When they arrived back from the hospital, Andy kissed Katie which Bernice witnessed from her window. Bernice was devastated and Andy later ended the relationship and reunited with Katie. Robert (now played by Ryan Hawley) returned to Emmerdale with his fianc√©e, Chrissie White (Louise Marwood), future father-in-law Lawrence White (John Bowe) and future stepson, Lachlan White (Thomas Atkinson). Andy and Katie eventually remarried. Andy and Katie planned to buy Wylies Farm and restore it. Robert tried to sabotage the sale as his future father-in-law, Lawrence White owned the farm. Katie was also convinced that Robert was cheating on Chrissie with another woman. Robert cottoned on to this and tried to lead Katie on by pretending it was Alicia. Katie confronted Robert over his \\"other woman\\" on numerous occasions in The Woolpack, which Robert denied. In February 2015, Katie died after finally discovering that Robert had been having an affair with a man, Aaron Livesy (Danny Miller). Robert did not want Chrissie to find out so he pushed Katie and she fell through rotting floorboards, breaking her neck and killing her. Andy began a sexual relationship with Tracy Shankley (Amy Walsh), and also made a move on ex-girlfriend, Bernice. He later ended his relationship with Tracey after realizing that the relationship wasn't right, and eventually got back on the straight and narrow. Andy later discovered that Robert murdered Andy went up to Butler's Farm to get hold of a gun. Ross Barton (Michael Parr) and Andy agreed to shoot each other's brother therefore giving them an alibi with no evidence that either of them was involved in either of the shootings. Later that night, Ross shot Robert on Andy's behalf, although he survived and Andy backed out of the plan to kill Pete. Andy later went on the run after being framed. Robert was shocked when Aaron revealed that Gordon had raped him as a child. Robert learned that Chrissie had begun a relationship with his brother Andy. Robert asked Chrissie's sister, Rebecca White (Emily Head) to come to the village to help him with his vendetta against Chrissie. She sent a DNA test off to prove Lawrence was not Chrissie's biological father. After rejecting Rebecca's advances Robert confided in Victoria that he is going to propose to Aaron. Lachlan told Aaron that Robert was sleeping with Rebecca. With Lachlan back in the boot, Robert admitted to Aaron that he was bisexual and did have an affair with Rebecca before getting serious with Chrissie. Robert told Aaron that when he was 15 he had a feelings for a male farmhand. Jack caught them together and beat Robert. Robert got drunk, destroyed his and Aaron's home, and sought comfort from Rebecca, telling her that he and Aaron were over. They slept together, but Robert immediately regretted it the next morning. Rebecca became pregnant tried to force Rebecca to have an abortion, but she refused. Rebecca went into labor and, with Robert present, delivered a baby boy named Sebastian. In early 2017, Victoria and Adam decide to try for a baby. Victoria was horrified to find a man had broken into her Diddy Diner truck, and even more so when the culprit knew her. She was shocked but pleased when the man turned out to be Hannah Barton, who had transformed into a man and went by the name Matty Barton (Ash Palmisciano). Matty revealed that Moira was unaccepting about the change and threw him out. Victoria tried to convince Matty that he should give Moira a second chance as she's bound to be shocked, but the pair are disgusted when they walk into Butlers Farm to hear Moira insulting Matty. Matty makes the decision to return to Manchester, despite Victoria's offers to allow him to stay with her. She drops Matty off at the train station when Cain fails to convince him to stay. After being beaten up, Matty decides to come back and stay with Moira at Butler's farm.

Discovery of the blood‚Äìbrain barrier  Goldmann's mentor, Paul Ehrlich, was studying staining in his bacteriological studies by injecting aniline dyes in several species of animal. While most of the anatomy stained equally well, the brain tissue exhibited less staining in many species. Goldmann discovered that when the dye (namely, trypan blue) was injected directly into the central nervous system instead of into the other organs, the brain would stain equally well as other organs ‚Äî but the stain would not travel to the rest of the body. This suggested the presence of a compartmentalization between the cerebrospinal fluid and the vasculature of the rest of the body. This barrier was first hypothesized by a Berlin physician, Max Lewandowsky, in 1900 (prior to Goldmann's empirical evidence). Edwin Goldmann died from liver cancer in Freiburg on 13 August 1913.

It was formerly known as \\"husl\\".  History  The color spaces used widely for computer display, such as standard Red Green Blue (sRGB) (and the color models built on it like HSL and HSV) are irregular, which means that even though the rectangles have evenly spaced hue values, the corresponding effect is not linear to the human eye. The CIELUV color space was designed for perceptual uniformity, based on human experiments, and was adopted in 1976 by the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) as a simple-to-compute transformation of the 1931 CIE XYZ color space. CIELUV has been extensively used for applications such as computer graphics which deal with colored lights. Although additive mixtures of different colored lights will fall on a line in CIELUV's uniform chromaticity diagram (dubbed the CIE 1976 UCS), such additive mixtures will not, contrary to popular belief, fall along a line in the CIELUV color space unless the mixtures are constant in lightness. When accessed by polar coordinates, CIELUV becomes functionally similar to the HSL color space, with the problem that its chroma component doesn't fit into a specific range. Even though CIELUV and CIELAB color spaces are based on human perception, they are not intuitive when working in code. By extending CIELUV with a new saturation component, HSLuv now allows spanning all of the available chroma as a neat percentage. The HSLuv project is one of the more recent attempts at making these color spaces more intuitive. It allows you to use the CIELUV color space in the same dimensions as the HSL color model. Referred to as a human-friendly HSL, the original code was written in the Haxe programming language, but the project is now implemented in most of the popular programming languages, including JavaScript.  Implementation  The reference implementation is written in Haxe and released under the MIT license. HSLuv has been ported to the following computer languages: C, C#, Elm, Emacs, GLSL, Haskell, Haxe, Go, Java, JavaScript, Lua, Objective-C, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Rust, Sass, and Swift. Every implementation of HSLuv must provide the following four functions: * hsluvToRgb([H, S, L]) -> [R, G, B] * hpluvToRgb([H, S, L]) -> [R, G, B] * rgbToHsluv([R, G, B]) -> [H, S, L] * rgbToHpluv([R, G, B]) -> [H, S, L] These functions are implemented as a chain of color space transformations: RGB to CIE XYZ to CIELUV to CIELUV LCh to HSLuv and HPLuv.

Knopf. Set in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the novel is told from the point of view of Nora Elridge, an elementary school teacher reflecting back on her life in 2004 when she became enchanted with the Shahids, a family of intellectuals she met while teaching their young son Reza. Plot Nora Elridge is an elementary school teacher living in Cambridge, Massachusetts who was raised by her frustrated stay at home mother to have artistic ambitions, ambitions which she was never able to fulfill. In 2004, when Nora is 37, a little over a year after her mother's death, she is delighted to learn that a young Parisian boy, Reza Shahid, has been assigned to her classroom. After Reza is bullied Nora meets his mother, Sirena Shahid, who she learns is an acclaimed artist. When Nora reveals that she makes art as well, Sirena suggests that they rent a studio together. Nora agrees and begins working on her own project, a series of shoebox size dioramas of the rooms of famous women artists. Nora grows increasingly enamoured of the Shahids including Lebanese born Skandar, a professor. She crosses personal boundaries with them, not only by agreeing to rent the studio with Sirena, but by eventually agreeing to babysit Reza for free on nights when Skandar and Sirena have dinner engagements. Sirena eventually unveils her project entitled \\"Wonderland\\" a mixed media piece in which she creates, and then films, a world based on Alice in Wonderland which Nora assists her in working on. During the project Nora begins to think she has fallen in love with Sirena but hesitates to tell her so. Instead, drawn closer to Skandar, she ends up having sex with him one night at the studio, an event they quickly agree cannot be repeated. Shortly after Sirena completes all the work she can in Cambridge and must return to Paris. Nora remains obsessed with the Shahids for years and tracks Sirena's meteoric rise in the art world. Four years after they returned to Paris Nora's aunt dies leaving her an inheritance. Nora decides to take a sabbatical and plans a European vacation where she can go to Paris and spend time with the Shahids. After an uneventful dinner Nora realizes that there is an exhibit of Sirena's work being shown at a small gallery which Sirena did not mention. Nora goes there and sees that the exhibit is composed of short films made in Wonderland and that each video is being reproduced only five times. One of the videos, which is sold out, was shot in Cambridge and Nora realizes it was taken when she was drunk and alone in the studio and dressed up like Edie Sedgewick and masturbated. She also realizes the sex she had with Skandar was also likely filmed. Unsure of what it means, but furious that she has been used Nora vows to use her rage to begin living for the first time.

At a length of in length, the Florida was one of the largest wooden ships ever built; her beam was wide, and her hull was deep. She had a gross tonnage of 2103.36 tons, and a net tonnage of 1834.65 tons. She had a cargo capacity of 2400 tons. She was powered by a 650-horsepower triple expansion steam engine that was built by H.G. Trout of Buffalo, New York, and had three cylinders that had a 32 & 52 √ó 45 inch bore, and a 20-inch stroke. On October 12, 1889 the Florida ran aground at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, and was freed by the tugs Mystic and Swain after unloading several hundred tons of coal. In 1890 she was chartered to the Lackawanna Transportation Company, where she would carry cargoes of grain and coal between Buffalo, New York and Chicago, Illinois. In October 1893 the Florida went ashore near Whiting, Indiana and was raised and repaired. Final voyage In May 1897 the Florida left Chicago, Illinois with a cargo of flour, barrels of whiskey, syrup, and various manufactured goods. She then proceeded to sail up Lake Michigan, into the Straits of Mackinac and finally into upper Lake Huron. On May 20, 1897, at around 9:00 a.m., the Florida was rammed by the larger freighter George W. Roby in a dense fog off the coast of Presque Isle, Michigan. All her crew were taken aboard the Roby.

In 1994, it was taken over by the Associated Examining Board, but kept its own identity until the AEB merged with NEAB to form AQA in 2000. History In the 1970s, the UK's Department for Education and Science became increasingly committed to replacing GCE O Level and CSE exams with a single exam (later named the GCSE), which it wished to be administered by regional consortia of existing O Level and CSE exam boards. Therefore, the examination boards of southern England formed a joint working group in 1978. Its members were: * Associated Examining Board (AEB) * South-East Regional Examinations Board * Southern Regional Examinations Board * South Western Examinations Board * University of Oxford Delegacy of Local Examinations (from 1981) As the GCSE was intended to replace the CSE, the three CSE boards in the group ‚Äì the South-East, Southern and South Western boards ‚Äì would not offer any qualifications outside the group (unlike the GCE boards ‚Äì the AEB and Oxford Delegacy ‚Äì who would still offer A Levels independently). Therefore, the CSE boards pursued merging with the GCE boards. Consequently, the Southern Board merged with the Oxford Delegacy in 1985 to form the Oxford School Examinations Board and the South-East and South Western boards merged with the AEB in 1985 and 1987 respectively. This meant the five original exam boards in the group had been reduced to two: the Associated Examining Board and the Oxford School Examinations Board. The Associated Examining Board and Oxford School Examinations Board formally launched the Southern Examining Group in 1987 and it awarded its first GCSEs in 1988. Initially, SEG struggled, losing one third of its total entry compared to its members' combined entry for the final year of O Levels and CSEs, but recovered by 1994 when its entries increased by 34%. In 1994, the University of Oxford decided to exit the schools examinations market and broke up the Oxford School Examinations Board. It sold its A Level operations to the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate and its GCSE interests to the Associated Examining Board. Thus, the Associated Examining Board now controlled the Southern Examining Group entirely. The AEB retained the SEG's identity, meaning GCSEs continued to be offered under the SEG brand and A Levels under the AEB name. Though legally the AEB owned the SEG, both names were used equally, with the organisation often referred to as the Associated Examining Board and Southern Examining Group (AEB/SEG). In 1997, AEB/SEG entered into an alliance with NEAB and City & Guilds known as the Assessment and Qualifications Alliance (AQA). In 2000, the AEB/SEG and NEAB (but not City & Guilds) formally merged under the name AQA and the AEB and SEG names disappeared.

Veto cells were first described in 1979 as cells that ‚Äúcan prevent generation of cytotoxic lymphocytes by normal spleen cells against self- antigens‚Äù. Hence, veto cells delete T cells that recognize the veto cells (the responding T cells are ‚Äúvetoed‚Äù and thus removed from the system). Proposed role in homeostasis The establishment and maintenance of self-tolerance is an essential property of an immune system designed to eliminate foreign substances. Avoiding self-reactivity in the T cell compartment is maintained by: clonal deletion in the thymus and suppressive cells that eliminate or induce tolerance on autoreactive lymphocytes that escaped selection. Veto activity is thought to be a form of antigen-specific suppression that maintains continuous self-tolerance. Cells with veto activity induce a state of tolerance in T cell precursors with specificity for antigen determinants expressed on the surface of the veto-active cell. This means that T-cells with a T-cell receptor specific to antigens presented on the veto cell, bind to the veto cell, and are in-turn tolerized or eliminated. Hence veto activity is selective but is not T-cell receptor mediated. Both clonal anergy and clonal deletion have been shown to operate in vetoed T cells. The veto cell need only carry the self-MHC determinant or self-MHC determinant plus antigen. Veto- induced tolerance can be established in vitro and in vivo for both MHC class I and II as well as minor histocompatibility antigens. Types Veto activity is a functional hallmark of a cell, it is not a specific phenotype. This means that different types of white blood cells, including non-cytotoxic cells, are capable of acting as veto cells. To name some of these cell types; CD34 cells, CD33 cells, CD8 T cells, Immature dendritic cells and NK cells among others. Mature activated cytotoxic CD8+ T cells are the most potent veto cells, this is perhaps related to their distinct function as killer cells which is not related to their veto activity. Subtypes of CD8+ T cells such as Central memory T-cell are also excellent veto cells. Mechanisms of action Different veto cells possess different elimination mechanisms and tolerance induction mechanisms. Both CD34 and CD33 cells function via the TNFŒ± pathway. Mature activated cytotoxic CD8+ T cells vetoeing involves ligation of MHCI on the target cell by CD8 on the veto cell and killing can then be mediated via either the Fas/FASL pathway or the Perforin mediated apoptosis pathways. BM- derived immature dendritic cells vetoeing mechanism against CD8 T cells was found to be an MHC-dependent binding followed by mediated killing that involves TLR7, and TREM1. Veto cells in allogeneic/haploidentical transplantation Because veto cells can only suppress T-cell progenitors that are directed against antigens on the veto cells themselves, but not against third-party antigens, this specificity can be harnessed as an effective tool to create tolerance in transplantation. By isolating veto cells that express the MHC of the donor it is possible to eliminate/tolerize only T-cell precursors that recognize the donor. These are the same T-cells that mediate graft rejection. This means that the addition of donor-veto cells to the donor graft can act as a specific immunosuppressant, only eliminating the cells that mediate graft rejection, but the rest of the T cellclone s (those that do not recognize the donor MHC/antigen) can provide immunity to the host normally. CD34+ cells were serendipitously found to have veto activity when researchers were trying to solve the problem of Graft rejection of T-cell depleted Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in leukemia patients. After this discovery a new type of transplantation - megadose transplantation - using a high number of CD34 cells was established. The large number of veto cells helped overcome the graft rejection that was mediated by the host CD8 T-cell precursors. An alternative to isolation and transplantation of large amounts of CD34+ cells is to add other types of veto cells and transplant them along with the graft. This method is especially handy when using conditioning regimens that are not as toxic and immune depleting as traditional methods. These are called reduced intensity or non-myeloablative conditioning regimens and since these protocols do not completely abolish the immune system of the host, Graft rejection is the main problem. Addition of donor-veto cells to the graft can provide one solution to this problem. Veto cell administration can also be used for tolerance induction to allogeneic/haploidentical solid organ grafts. This has been tested successfully in kidney transplant model in unrelated outbred rhesus monkeys. and skin transplants in mice. Other experiments have been unsuccessful. Anti-3rd party veto cells Anti-3rd party veto cells were developed to address the need for large numbers of donor veto cells to infuse along with the graft, as a tool for the induction of donor-tolerance. These cells are produced from naive donor CD8+ cells because CD8+ cells have the best veto activity. By expanding na√Øve CD8 T cells against 3rd-party stimulators under cytokine deprivation, clones that are reactive against the host are eliminated due to lack of nutrients and signaling. The expression of a central memory T cell (Tcm) phenotype helps these host non- reactive veto cells reach the lymph nodes where they eradicate anti-donor T cell precursors. Transfer of these Anti-3rd party Tcm with megadose TCD HSCT in preclinical models was successful at preventing graft rejection without GVHD under reduced intensity conditioning. Therapy Anti-3rd party veto cells can also be manipulated to become genetically engineered T cell. In this case, veto cells from an allogeneic/haploidentical donor can exert some therapeutic function while also avoiding rejection through their veto activity. One study shows that this could be an effective solution for the production of off-the-shelf CAR T cells that will not be rejected or cause GvHD.

He had tried to obtain support for his invention in several countries, like the Austria- Hungary, the British Empire or France. Finally, in 1855, Bauer made a contract with Russia. He built his submarine at the Leutemberg Works, and it was completed on 1 November. In May 1856 it was taken to Kronstadt and testing began. The submarine made 133 successful diving runs, including a dive on 6 September 1856, when musicians played the national anthem of Russia during the coronation of Alexander II. During the 134th dive, the submarine got stuck in the sand of the seafloor and was later retrieved by a salvage crew.

Human milk was previously thought to only provide passive immunity primarily through Secretory IgA, but advances in technology have led to the identification of various immune-modulating components. Human milk constituents provide nutrition and protect the immunologically naive infant as well as regulate the infant's own immune development and growth. Immune factors and immune-modulating components in human milk include cytokines, growth factors, proteins, microbes, and human milk oligosaccharides. Immune factors in human milk are categorized mainly as anti- inflammatory primarily working without inducing inflammation or activating the complement system.  Immune factors  Bio-active constituents of human milk that have been cataloged to possess immune-modulating capabilities include immunoglobulins, Lactoferrin, Lysozyme, oligosaccharides, lipids, cytokines, hormones, and growth factors. Some of the roles of bio-actives in human milk are theorized based on their function in other parts of the body, but the mechanisms and function of their activities remain to be discovered. = IgA = Immunoglobulin A is the most well known immune factor in human milk. In its secretory form, SIgA, it is the most plentiful antibody in human milk. It constitutes between 80-90% of all immunoglobulins present in milk. SIgA provides adaptive immunity by directly targeting specific pathogens that both infant and mother have been exposed to in their environments. = Lactoferrin = Lactoferrin is an immune protein with strong anti-microbial function in human milk. Lactoferrin protects the infant intestine by binding to iron to prevent pathogens from utilizing it as a resource. It also modulates immunity by blocking inflammatory signaling cytokines. = Cytokines = Cytokines are pluripotent signaling molecules with the ability to bind to specific receptors. They can cross the intestinal barrier and mediate immune activity. Their presence in human milk may stimulate lymphocytes responsible for the development of the infant's specific immunity. Cytokines present in human milk include IL-1Œ≤, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNFŒ±, and IFN-Œ≥.  Origin and Establishment  Bio-active components in human milk are speculated to colonize in human milk in several ways including secretion by the mammary gland, epithelium cells, and by milk cells. Maternal immune factors are transferred by lymphocytes traveling from the mother's gut to the mammary gland where the secretory cells of the breast produce antibodies. The origin of the human milk microbiota, including those with immune-modulating functions, are not well established. However, several theories including skin-to-skin contact, the entero-mammary pathway, and retrograde back-flow hypothesis have been put forth to explain the microbial composition of human milk.  Known factors of influence  From Colostrum to Breastmilk in days = Lactation stage = Human milk immune composition is known to change over the course of lactation. Most notably, antibody levels are lower in mature milk than in colostrum, with SIgA measuring at up to 12 grams per liter in colostrum and decreasing to 1 gram per liter in mature milk. Studies find time postpartum to be most influential on the presence of immune factors, including growth factors and lactoferrin. = Human milk microbiome = The exposure to microbiota through mother's milk is the primary stimulus for immune development in infants. Microbiota interacts with the infant's immune system by stimulating the mucous layer, down-regulating the inflammatory response, producing antibodies and helping initiate oral tolerance. Mucosal layers protection comes from their ability to limit pathogens from attaching to the infant intestinal tract. = Human milk oligosaccharides = Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are carbohydrate components in human milk. They are mostly indigestible and work as a prebiotic to feed commensal bacteria in the infant gut. Studies show that HMOs also function as immune-modulators by blocking receptors that allow pathogenic bacteria to attach to the infant intestinal epithelium. = Delivery mode = There are observed differences in immune factor composition in the milk of mothers who delivered cesarean versus vaginally. A study of 82 women saw an increase in the levels of IgA in the colostrum of women who had cesarean births after experiencing labor when compared to women who delivered vaginally or had elected cesareans. = Maternal Characteristics =  Parity  Milk immunity levels are observably lower in women with higher parity. A study among the Ariaal women of Kenya saw that milk IgA decreased drastically only in women who had given birth to eight or more children.  Diet  Human milk composition remains relatively stable despite maternal dietary changes, except in cases of extreme maternal depletion. Seasonal changes and malnutrition influence the concentration of immune factors. In addition, intervention studies have confirmed that both fish oil and fish consumption during pregnancy can alter immune-modulating components in human milk. = Environmental factors = Differences in the maternal environment such as rural and urban environments, including exposure to farming, and exposure to pathogens have shown to affect human milk immune factor variation. = Geographic location = Geographic location is known to play a role in human milk variation, with country of residence specifically linked with immune factor variation. A study found a variation of in levels of growth factor in both mature milk and colostrum to be correlated with geographic location. However, a larger study found support for consistency in the presence of a small group of immunological factors in mature milk independent of geographic location.  Impact on health  = Health outcomes for Breastfed versus formula-fed infants = Formula Over the last century, breastfeeding has been consistently shown to reduce infant mortality and morbidity, particularly of infectious disease. Comparative research between human milk and formula has pointed towards the bio-active components in human milk as potential proponents of its immunological protection. Studies have shown that breastfed infants respond better to vaccines, and are better protected against diarrhea, otitis media, sepsis, and necrotizing enterocolitis, celiac disease, obesity, and inflammatory bowel disease than formula-fed infants. Human breast milk is seen as particularly beneficial to infants born before full term and those that are underweight at birth who are at a higher risk of infectious diseases, such as sepsis and meningitis. Also, there is a lower chance of contamination acquired through direct breastfeeding than with mixing formula with water or other animal milks which may also help explain why human milk is more protective for the infant. = Long term protection = Because various components present in human breast milk stimulate the growth of the immune system, there is a growing interest in whether breastfeeding provides a long term protective effect against auto- immune and inflammatory diseases. = Milk sharing and donor milk = The WHO infant feeding guidelines advise the use of donor milk when the mother's milk is not available. With the understanding that breast milk provides immune protection that is absent in formula, mothers have turned to milk sharing options to in order to give formula alternatives to their infants. A donation of milk without monetary benefit defines milk sharing. In addition, milk banks have emerged to regulate and pasteurize donated milk to be sold in the legal market. The main concern with bank milk is that it has lost many immune cells, commensal microbiota and bio-active proteins during the pasteurization process. Donor milk is in high demand for infants in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). who have been shown to benefit most from access to human milk Immunological consequences or benefits of milk sharing are not well documented, but it has been speculated that allo-nursing, or nursing from multiple females, may provide infants with an immune boost. The reported risk associated with unregulated sharing milk includes the possibility of the transmission of drugs, toxins, pathogenic bacteria, HIV and other viruses. However, some researchers believe that allo-nursing and milk sharing may have been part of our evolutionary past. Evidence of milk sharing history include the wet nursing practices of the 20th century, milk kinship among Islamic tradition, and documentation of allo-nursing in primates species.  Non-human milk immune profiles  = Mammalian milk = Moose calves nursing All mammalian milk contains water, sugar, fat, vitamins and protein with the variation within and between species and individuals differing mainly in the amount of these components. Other than the variation in quantity of these components, not a lot is known about bio-active or immune-modulating factors in many mammalian species. However, in comparison to other mammalian milk, human milk has the most oligosaccharide diversity.  Bovine milk  Unlike humans, ruminant mothers do not transfer immunity to their infants during pregnancy, which makes milk the first introduction to maternal immunity calves receive. Bovine milk contains both immunoglobulins A and G, but in contrast to human milk where IgA is the most abundant, IgG is more abundant. Secretory Component, IgM, both anti-inflammatory and inflammatory cytokines, and other proteins with antimicrobial functions are also present in bovine milk. = Crop milk = Crop milk is a secretion from the crop of a bird that is regurgitated to feed their offspring. Birds that produce this secretion include pigeons, flamingos, emperor penguins, and doves. Pigeon milk contains some immune-modulating factors such as microbes and IgA, as well as other components with similar biological activities to mammalian milk including pigeon growth factor, and transferrin. Evolutionary implications There is evidence of a relationship between the microbes that have co-evolved with humans as their host and the human immune system. The transfer of microorganisms from mother to offspring is universal in animals. In humans, microbial exchange occurs primarily through placental transfer and breast milk. The presence of these complex microbial communities in the human body suggests that the immune system has been selected to remember and mediate the colonization of these microorganisms within the human host. Further, microbial dysbiosis in infants is strongly associated with immune-mediated diseases such as allergies and necrotizing enterocolitis. In early life, an infant's immune system is considered immature due to its lack of resources necessary for defense against infection. An infant is not able to produce specific cytokines, IgA, and is limited to producing mostly IgM antibodies. The human infant is unable to adequately protect itself without the immune-stimulating and immune-modulating components present in human milk. This dynamic affirms the consensus among researchers that human milk evolved to provide not only nutritional but immunological benefits to the infant. Some researches have proposed that the mammary gland and milk production evolved as a part of the human innate immune system, with its immunological protective role predating its nutritional role.

She employed a precise style in which fanciful objects were juxtaposed in a manner that was seen to approach surrealism and that was often called magic realist. In 1960, a critic writing for Arts Magazine said, \\"There can hardly be any doubt that Priscilla Roberts is the most talented and accomplished Magic Realist in America.\\" Early life Roberts was born in Glen Ridge, New Jersey, but spent most of her youth in New York City. Her father, Charles Asaph Roberts, was a partner in the law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore and her mother, Mary Florence Berry Robert (known as Florence) kept house. Her only sibling, Alice Parsons Roberts, was four years older. During a period when Roberts was kept at home to recover from a bout of acidosis, her mother made a scrapbook of Good Housekeeping advertisements to help keep her occupied and this, she later said, was the probable beginning of her ambition to become an artist. Art training In the mid-1930s Roberts attended Radcliffe College for one year and transferred to the Yale School of Art for part of the next. In 1937, she began study at the Art Students League, working under Charles Courtney Curran and Sidney Dickinson. Two years later she began study at the National Academy of Design, continuing there until 1943. Artistic career Priscilla Roberts, Untitled (Man With a Broken Plate), about 1946, oil on masonite, 30 x 22 inches Priscilla Roberts, Self Portrait, 1946, oil on masonite, 29 7/8 x 14 1/8 inches Priscilla Roberts, Lay Figure, 1950, oil on masonite, 30 x 25 inches Priscilla Roberts, Tintinabulum, 1964, oil on masonite, 14 x 9 1/2 inches After completing study at the National Academy, Roberts found work as a commercial artist. An untitled painting showing a man with a broken plate (at left) shows her style in this manner. She discovered, however, that the pressure of working to deadlines did not suit her and consequently turned to fine art. Her self portrait of 1946, shown at right, was one of the first paintings she offered for sale in a commercial gallery. It has transitional style elements. The presence of a human figure (herself) and use of natural light are marks of her early style while the meticulous rendering of the stuffed birds and the heavy shadowing are marks of the mature style she adopted in later years. In 1946 Roberts signed with an artists' cooperative, the Grand Central Art Galleries, then located on the sixth floor of Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan. When in 1948 she moved from an apartment in New York's Hell's Kitchen neighborhood to suburban Wilton, Connecticut, she continued her association with the Galleries and they remained the only commercial outlet of her work for the rest of her life. Her paintings were usually purchased as soon as she completed them. However, because she worked very slowly, taking a year or more to complete a single painting, her income remained low and for many years she was unable to assemble enough work to justify a solo exhibition. In 1981 she told a reporter, \\"I do everything slowly... A teacher told me in school...that drawing is the finest spiritual exercise. And it is.\\" Her mature style is indicated in the painting of 1950, shown at left, called \\"Lay Figure.\\" It is similar to the 1946 self portrait in the presence of a draped figure and the predominance of shadow. However the work is a still life, not a portrait. The figure is a manikin clothed in an antique dress and it is surrounded by an odd assortment of objects that are themselves antiques. \\"Tintinabulum,\\" of 1964, shown at right, is typical of Roberts' late work. It shows a female manikin head with a Gay Nineties hat along with the type of doorbell formerly used by shopkeepers to announce the entrance of a customer As one source says, her mature paintings seem at first glance to be surreal but on closer observation show themselves to be hyper-realistic, both high in contrast and, on close inspection, revealing surprising details. After she had moved to Connecticut, Roberts would explore antique shops, flea markets, thrift stores, and yard sales to find unusual objects to use in her still lives. She became a familiar presence in Wilton Center and there acquired both supporters and friends, people whose help became an important factor in her life when the cottage where she lived was sold to developers and, because of her many pets, it was difficult for her to find a new place to live. She was given her first solo exhibition at Grand Central Galleries in 1961 and a second twenty years later. In neither case did she attend the opening. Although she would personally deliver her paintings to the gallery and was well known to its staff, she did not like to mix in the New York art world, saying, \\"I think the lower profile you keep the better for yourself and your work.\\" Despite her low earnings and hardships she encountered in making a living as an artist she said her devotion to her work led her to lead \\"the happiest life there could be.\\" She did not use the term magic realism to describe her work, but called her meticulous style \\"super-realism.\\" She blacked out the windows of her studio and used precisely-controlled artificial light so that she could replicate the light exactly as she saw it, consistently over many hours at her easel. Most of her paintings were easel art, made in oil paint applied with brush on masonite board. Although the tone of her work was often somber, evoking the passage of time, she would also sometimes treat her subjects in a light and playful manner, juxtaposing objects so as to make visual puns. Late in life, Roberts left Wilton for nearby Georgetown, Connecticut. The move brought her close to her sister, Alice, who had made her home there for many years. Roberts died in Georgetown on August 5, 2001, and was buried in a family plot at Kensico Cemetery, Valhalla, New York.

He appears to have been a member of Clann Domhnaill. First attested in the first decade of the fourteenth century, Domhnall appears to be last recorded in the second decade upon his death. Domhnall's attestations suggest that he was a claimant to the chiefship of Clann Domhnaill, and may have possessed the chiefship. Uncertain parentage Domhnall may have been a son of Aonghus M√≥r mac Domhnaill.Young (2018) p. 125 n. 91; McDonald (1997) pp. 187‚Äì188; Duffy (1991) p. 311; Lamont (1981) p. 165. As such he may have been a younger brother of Alasdair √ìg, and an older brother of Aonghus √ìg.Penman, M (2014) p. 102; Penman, MA (2014) p. 68, 68 n. 17; Duncan (2007) p. 148 n. 725‚Äì62; Barrow (2005) pp. 211, 378; Murray (2002) p. 228 n. 32; McDonald (1997) pp. 187‚Äì188; Munro; Munro (1986) pp. 282‚Äì283 n. 10. Another possibility is that he was a cousin of Aonghus M√≥r's sons.Penman, M (2014) pp. 102, 358 n. 67; Penman, MA (2014) p. 68, 68 n. 17. As such, Domhnall could have been a son of Aonghus M√≥r's younger brother, Alasdair M√≥r.Young (2018) p. 125 n. 91; Murray (2002) pp. 222‚Äì223 tab., 229 n. 35; McDonald (1997) pp. 187‚Äì188; Duffy (1991) pp. 311‚Äì312; Munro; Munro (1986) pp. 279 tab. 1, 282 n. 10. Alternately, it is also possible that Domhnall was a son of Alasdair OgPenman, M (2014) p. 358 n. 67; Penman, MA (2014) p. 68 n. 18; McDonald (1997) pp. 187‚Äì188; Duffy (1991) p. 311. or Aonghus Og.Penman, M (2014) p. 358 n. 67; Penman, MA (2014) p. 68 n. 18. No extant traditional genealogical source specifically accords Aonghus M√≥r and Alasdair √ìg with a son named Domhnall.McDonald (1997) p. 188; Duffy (1991) p. 311; Munro; Munro (1986) p. 283 n. 10. The fifteenth-century manuscript National Library of Scotland Advocates' 72.1.1 (MS 1467), on the other hand, accords Alasdair M√≥r a son with this name.McDonald (1997) p. 188; Duffy (1991) p. 312; Munro; Munro (1986) p. 282 n. 10; Black; Black (n.d.). Nevertheless, Domhnall appears to have had a brother named Gofraidh, and whilst Alasdair √ìg is otherwise recorded to have had a son by this name, Alasdair M√≥r is not.Duffy (1991) pp. 311‚Äì312.

The final clash in this Gallovidian campaign may have been fought near Buittle, on the banks of the River Dee, rather than the Cree as claimed by the Bruce.Barrow (2005) pp. 235, 469 n. 82. Specifically, Gesta Annalia II relates that a certain 'Domhnall of the Isles' led a host of Gallovidians to the River Dee where they were defeated by Edward Bruce, and the leader was himself captured.Young (2018) p. 125, 125 n. 91; Caldwell (2012) p. 285 n. 103; McNamee (2012b) ch. 2 ¬∂ 20; Shead; Stevenson; Watt et al (1991) p. 444 n. 54; Reid (1984) pp. 308, 342 n. 121; Lamont (1981) pp. 165‚Äì166; Skene (1872) p. 337 ch. 125; Skene (1871) p. 345 ch. 125. Whilst it is possible that the defeated man mentioned by this source might refer to Domhnall himself,Reid (1984) pp. 308, 342 n. 121; Lamont (1981) pp. 165‚Äì166. another possibility is that the account instead refers to Dubhghall Mac Dubhghaill.Lamont (1981) pp. 165‚Äì166. A later account of the battle, preserved by the fifteenth-century Scotichronicon,Young (2018) p. 125 n. 91; Penman, M (2014) p. 107; Duncan (2007) pp. 344, 344‚Äì345 n. 479; Murray (2002) p. 229 n. 35; Shead; Stevenson; Watt et al (1991) pp. 344‚Äì345, 444‚Äì445 n. 54; Goodall (1759) p. 242 bk. 12 ch. 17. confusingly identifies 'Domhnall of the Isles' as leader of the Gallovidian forces, but then includes a verse about the clash in which a 'Domhnall of Islay' is identified as an ally of Edward Bruce.Duncan (2007) p. 344 n. 479; Shead; Stevenson; Watt et al (1991) pp. 344‚Äì345, 444‚Äì445 n. 54; Goodall (1759) p. 242 bk. 12 ch. 17. As such, there is reason to suspect that the Bruce-aligned 'Domhnall' mentioned by this source is identical to Domhnall himself,Young (2018) p. 125 n. 91; Penman, M (2014) p. 107; Caldwell (2012) p. 285, 285 n. 103; McNamee (2012b) ch. 2 ¬∂ 20; Murray (2002) p. 229 n. 35; Shead; Stevenson; Watt et al (1991) pp. 444‚Äì445 n. 54. and that the Gallovidian-aligned 'Domhnall' is identical to Domhnall Mac Cana, a Gallovidian who consistently supported the English against the Bruces, and who disappears from record at about this point in history.Young (2018) p. 125 n. 91; Penman, M (2014) p. 107; Caldwell (2012) p. 285, 285 n. 103; McNamee (2012b) ch. 2 ¬∂ 20; Oram (1992) p. 40; Shead; Stevenson; Watt et al (1991) p. 444‚Äì445 n. 54. The account of Edward Bruce's campaigning against the Gallovidians, given by the Chronicle of Lanercost, states that his forces were partly composed of men from the Isles.McNamee (2012b) ch. 2 ¬∂ 19; Barrow (2005) p. 469 n. 81; Lamont (1981) pp. 165‚Äì166; Maxwell (1913) p. 188; Stevenson (1839) p. 212. The evidence of Domhnall in league with pro-Bruce forces could indicate that Gesta Annalia II was erroneous in placing him and the Islesmen against Edward Bruce's forces.Reid (1984) p. 342 n. 121. One possibility is that the account given by the Chronicle of Lanercost influenced Gesta Annalia II in its identification of Edward Bruce's foe as from the Isles. =Robert I's first parliament, 1309= Domhnall is recorded to have been present at Robert I, King of Scotland's first parliament at St Andrews, in March 1309. Domhnall's name appears immediately after that of Alasdair Mac Dubhghaill in a list of men who witnessed a letter from the parliament to the King of France.Sellar (2016) p. 104; Penman, M (2014) pp. 102, 110‚Äì111, 157, 358 n. 67; Penman, MA (2014) p. 68, 68 n. 17; McNamee (2012a) ch. 6 n. 42; McNamee (2012b) ch. 2 n. 37; Barrow (2005) pp. 240, 378, 465 n. 125; Brown, M (2004) p. 263; Murray (2002) p. 229 n. 35; Munro; Munro (1986) p. 282 n. 10; Reid (1984) p. 342 n. 121; Lamont (1981) pp. 165, 167; The Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland (1844) p. 459; Document 3/0/0 (n.d.); RPS, 1309/1 (n.d.a); RPS, 1309/1 (n.d.b). If Domhnall indeed fought against and captured by Edward Bruce in 1308, Domhnall's subsequent attestation at Robert's parliament could indicate that he had submitted to the king after the defeat.Reid (1984) p. 342 n. 120. =Royal charter witness, 1308√ó1314= Domhnall witnessed an undated charter of Robert to Melrose Abbey.Penman, MA (2014) p. 68 n. 17; Barrow (2005) p. 465 n. 125; Munro; Munro (1986) p. 282 n. 10; Lamont (1981) pp. 165, 167; Liber Sancte Marie de Melrose (1837) pp. 340‚Äì341 ¬ß 376. The charter evidently dates to some point in 1308√ó1314,Lamont (1981) p. 167. perhaps March 1309.Barrow (2005) p. 465 n. 125. =Clann Domhnaill factionalism= The attestations of Domhnall suggest that he was a contestant to the Clann Domhnaill lordship,Penman, MA (2014) pp. 67‚Äì68, 67 n. 18; McDonald (1997) pp. 187‚Äì188. and may have possessed the chiefship.Sellar (2016) p. 104; Penman, M (2014) p. 189; Duncan (2007) p. 148 n. 725‚Äì62; Murray (2002) p. 228 n. 32. At an uncertain date, perhaps 1306, 1308, or else in 1314 and/or 1315,Penman, MA (2014) p. 70; McNamee (2012b) ch. 5 ¬∂ 21; Brown, M (2004) p. 263; Sellar; Maclean (1999) p. 7; Duffy (1991) p. 311; Lamont (1981) p. 165. E√≥in Mac Dubhghaill was directed by the English Crown to bring into the king's peace Domhnall, Gofraidh‚Äîa man described as Domhnall's brother‚Äîand a certain E√≥in Mac Neacail.Cochran-Yu (2015) p. 72, 72 n. 98; Penman, M (2014) p. 157, 358 n. 67; Penman, MA (2014) pp. 68 n. 17, 70; McNamee (2012b) ch. 5 ¬∂ 21; Barrow (2005) p. 465 n. 125; Brown, M (2004) p. 263; Sellar; Maclean (1999) p. 7; Duffy (1991) p. 311; Munro; Munro (1986) p. 282 n. 10; Reid (1984) p. 342 n. 121; Lamont (1981) pp. 165‚Äì166; List of Diplomatic Documents (1963) p. 209; Bain (1888) p. 377 ¬ß 1822; Rotuli Scoti√¶ (1814) pp. 121, 139; Document 1/27/0 (n.d.). If the records of the English reaching out to Domhnall date to 1315, it would reveal that the Clann Domhnaill leadership was fractured at the onset of the Bruce campaign in Ireland.Penman, M (2014) p. 166; Penman, MA (2014) p. 70. Not only had E√≥in Mac Dubhghaill been assigned to make overtures to leading Hebrideans‚Äîlike Domhnall and Gofraidh‚Äîbut he was placed in command of the English naval forces responsible for retaking the Isle of Man.Penman, MA (2014) p. 70; McNamee (2012b) ch. 5 ¬∂ 21; Rotuli Scoti√¶ (1814) pp. 138‚Äì139. The very same year, according to the Bruce, Robert had his fleet dragged across the Tarbert isthmus between Knapdale and the Kintyre peninsula at about the very time his brother, Edward, initiated his invasion of Ireland. The poem further claims that the Islesmen were dejected as a result of Robert's action, on account of an old prophecy foretelling that whoever could sail their ships across the peninsula would hold dominion in the Isles that no other would be able to withstand.MacGregor (2018); Penman, M (2014) p. 166; Penman, MA (2014) p. 70; Duncan (2007) pp. 564‚Äì565 bk. 15; Duffy (2002) pp. 59, 193 n. 55; Mackenzie (1909) pp. 268‚Äì270 bk. 15; Eyre-Todd (1907) pp. 259‚Äì260 bk. 15. It is probable that, whilst in the region, Robert collected submissions from competing members of Clann Domhnaill. The king's visit may have also been intended to counter advances made by Clann Dubhghaill. Although no charters from Robert to members of Clann Domhnaill are extant, undated seventeenth-century indices reveal that leading members of the kindred indeed received grants.Penman, MA (2014) p. 66. Even though none are known to have been gifted to Domhnall, it is very likely that he received some. One possibility is that he gained the bulk of the Clann Domhnaill lordship of Islay and in Kintyre.Barrow (2005) p. 378. Certainly, Aonghus √ìg received a grant for the former Comyn lordship of Lochaber, and the adjacent regions of Ardnamurchan, Morvern, Duror, and Glencoe;MacDonald, IG (2014) p. 48 n. 136; Penman, M (2014) p. 102; Petre (2014) p. 272; Penman, MA (2014) p. 66; Daniels (2013) p. 25; McNamee (2012a) ch. 10 ¬∂ 25; Boardman, S (2006) pp. 45, 54 n. 52; Barrow (2005) p. 378; Brown, M (2004) p. 263; Munro, RW; Munro, J (2004); Oram (2004) p. 124; Duffy (2002) p. 62; Murray (2002) p. 223; McDonald (1997) p. 184, 184 n. 104; Duffy (1993) p. 207 n. 77; Munro; Munro (1986) p. 282 n. 6; Lamont (1981) p. 168; Thomson, JM (1912) p. 512 ¬ß¬ß 56‚Äì58. whilst a certain Alasdair of the Isles received the islands of Mull and Tiree, formerly possessed by Clann Dubhghaill.Penman, M (2014) p. 102; Penman, MA (2014) pp. 66, 67‚Äì68; McNamee (2012a) ch. 10 ¬∂ 25; Boardman, S (2006) p. 45; Barrow (2005) p. 378; Brown, M (2004) p. 263; Murray (2002) p. 224; McDonald (1997) p. 184, 184 n. 104; Duffy (1993) p. 207 n. 77; Duffy (1991) p. 312; Munro; Munro (1986) p. 281 n. 5; Lamont (1981) p. 168; Steer; Bannerman; Collins (1977) p. 203; Thomson, JM (1912) p. 553 ¬ß 653. The royal grants to Aonghus √ìg and Alasdair of the Isles could be evidence that these two were competitors for the Clann Domhnaill chiefship. The record of Domhnall's presence at Robert's 1309 parliament could likewise indicate that he represented a rival interest in the kindred.Penman, M (2014) p. 102; Penman, MA (2014) p. 68. Furthermore, the Bruce states that, when Robert fled English- aligned forces to Dunaverty Castle in 1306, Robert was fearful of treason during his stay.Penman, M (2014) pp. 102‚Äì103; Penman, MA (2014) p. 68; McNamee (2012a) ch. 5 ¬∂¬∂ 25‚Äì31; McNamee (2012b) ch. 1 ¬∂ 31; Duncan (2007) p. 144‚Äì145 bk. 3; Mackenzie (1909) p. 53 bk. 3; Eyre-Todd (1907) p. 50 bk. 3. One possibility is that this statement preserves a record of the king's vulnerability to competing regional factions. Although the Bruce specifies that the Clann Domhnaill dynast to whom the king owed his salvation was Aonghus √ìg, there is reason to question this claim.Penman, MA (2014) pp. 68‚Äì69; Duncan (2007) p. 148 n. 725‚Äì62. If Robert indeed found protection at a Clann Domhnaill fortress‚Äîlike Dunyvaig Castle‚Äîthe attestations of Domhnall could indicate that it was he who assisted the king.Duncan (2007) p. 148 n. 725‚Äì62. =Death in Ireland, 1318= Domhnall appears to be noted by the continuation of the Annales of Nicholas Trevet.Penman, M (2014) pp. 189, 372 n. 92; Murray (2002) p. 229 n. 35; Duffy (1991) p. 311, 311 n. 42, 314. If this fourteenth-century English chronicle is to be believed, Domhnall evidently died in 1318, whilst serving in the Bruce campaign in Ireland,Penman, M (2014) pp. 189, 372 n. 92; McNamee (2012b) ch. 5 ¬∂ 56; Murray (2002) p. 229 n. 35; Duffy (1991) pp. 311‚Äì312. conceivably at the Battle of Faughart.Penman, M (2014) p. 189; Duffy (1991) p. 312.

Biography and education Jan Kalicki graduated from high school in Warsaw in May 1939 just months before Germany invaded Poland on 1 September. He wanted to go to the University of Warsaw but it was closed down on 27 September when Poland surrendered. Famous mathematicians present at the University of Warsaw such as Borsuk, ≈Åukasiewicz, Mazurkiewicz, Sierpi≈Ñski, Mostowski, and Kuratowski opened up an underground University of Warsaw. This was repressed by the Nazis who wanted to stop all intellectual efforts and they imprisoned or killed several. Nevertheless, Kalicki completed his studies in mathematics and philosophy at this underground university but it would have to wait until the end of the war in 1945 before he would be awarded an MA in mathematics and philosophy. He taught for two years after the war at the Universities of ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and University of Warsaw he went to London on a British Council Scholarship for two years. There, Kalicki received his doctorate in mathematical logic in July 1948 at the University of London. While studying in London he married Mireya Jaimes- Freyre in 1947 and had a son named after his father. Feeling that going back to Poland at this time would be restrictive he decided to stay in London and lectured in mathematics at Woolwich Polytechnic. A year later he went to University of Leeds and stayed there until 1951 when he went to the US to become Visiting Assistant Professor of Mathematics in the University of California, Berkeley. Later life and death In 1953, just after a year he was appointed Assistant Professor of Mathematics at the Davis campus he returned to Berkeley, to become Assistant Professor of Philosophy. He died three months later in a car accident north of Berkeley, California. Works Kalicki published 13 papers on logical matrices and equational logic in the five years before his death.

Commissioned by Emperor Napoleon III, the church houses the tomb of his father,Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, King of Holland, as well as those of his two brothers. History The church was built in 1849 by Prince Louis-Napol√©on Bonaparte, then President of France and subsequently Emperor. It replaced an earlier church from the seventeenth century, inaugurated on November 7, 1690. The church was in turn a replacement of the original church from the twelfth century, located in the forest near Montmorency and demolished in 1686. The architect Eug√®ne Lacroix was inspired by the Italian basilicas, in particular the Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo in Ravenna. A large portal with a semicircular archivolt and a tympanum decorated with a mosaic provides access to the ship. Smaller gates flank the main entrance on both sides. The upper part of the facade of the nave is decorated with five semicircular arches. The strongly distinctive bell tower of the main building is placed in front of the lateral northeast fa√ßade. The edges between the first and second floor as well as the walls are decorated with decorative frames in the style of the Italian Renaissance. At the back of the choir, as a tribute to the Bonaparte family and especially Louis Napoleon, the brother of Emperor Napoleon I and Napoleon III's father, there is a tomb for Louis Bonaparte, King of Holland, made by Louis Petitot. On the front of the tomb are the faces of his sons Napol√©on Charles Bonaparte and Napol√©on Louis Bonaparte and his father Carlo Buonaparte. Behind the monument is a fresco by S√©bastien-Melchior Cornu with four angels carrying Saint Louis, St. Charles and St. Napoleon. This wall has recently been restored using the Napoleon Foundation. Also of interest are the graves in the chapel on the right side of the choir to commemorate the Baroness (Madame) de Broc, one of Queen Hortense de Beauharnais matrons (Head Sister) of honor, and Baroness Broc's sister, the wife of Marshal Michel Ney . The church of Saint-Gilles in St-Leu was consecrated on 31 October 1851 by Monsignor Gros, bishop of Versailles, accompanied by members of his family and other important figures in the presence of President Napoleon III. In 1869 the emperor offered a beautiful Cavaill√©-Coll organ. Napoleon III initially had plans for enormous murals, but this was postponed by the Franco-German War of 1870 and the fall of the Second French Empire.https://www.napoleon.org/en/magazine/places/imperial-chapel-ajaccio/ Family Bonaparte It was intended that the entire Bonaparte family, including Emperor Napoleon I, would be buried in the church. There are four sarcophagi in the crypt. Louis Napoleon was reburied here in 1851 after first buried in Livorno and on 29 September 1847 in the chapel of Saint Leu, of Baroness de Broc (1784-1813), as well as his sons Napoleon Charles Bonaparte, Prince of Holland, and Napoleon Louis Bonaparte, who was King of Holland from 1 July 1810 to 9 July 1810. The fourth crypt is empty. Here from 1851 Carlo Maria Buonaparte (French: Charles-Marie Bonaparte) was buried, whose remains were transferred on 28 April 1951 to the Imperial Chapel in Ajaccio. Charles- Marie (Carlo Maria) Bonaparte Born March 27, 1745, February 24, 1785 died in Montpellier from stomach cancer. He was buried in Montpellier in the vaults of the Convent of the Cordeliers.

It is the third in her series of Hercule Poirot novels, after being authorised by the estate of Agatha Christie to write new stories for the character. The previous two are The Monogram Murders (2014) and Closed Casket (2016). Plot Four people receive letters purporting to be from Hercule Poirot and accusing them each of the murder of Barnabas Pandy, a ninety-something businessman who drowned - accidentally, it seems - in his bath. Poirot has no knowledge of the letters, nor yet of the late Barnabas Pandy, until he is accosted by one of the recipients, society woman Sylvia Rule, before finding another, market trader John McCrodden, in his drawing room. As he begins to investigate the source of the letters with assistance from his young friend Edward Catchpool, a Scotland Yard detective, he comes into contact with the family of Pandy, which seems to be hiding secrets. Explanation of the novel's title Poirot refers to the case as \\"the mystery of three quarters\\" because, of the four people who received letters purporting to be from him, three are in some way connected to the late Barnabas Pandy, whose murder the letters accuse each one of. The fourth, however, is seemingly unconnected. Poirot, then, must figure out the relevance of the fourth person, or quarter. To symbolise the four quarters Poirot uses a slice of Church Window Cake, whose fourth square is separated from the other three.

Biography Voskresensky was born to a family of a poor priest, who died in 1814. He had one sister and one brother. From early ages he showed talents for sciences, and, after graduating from the St. Petersburg Institute of Pedagogy in 1836, was sent to Germany to continue his education. There he attended courses of Eilhard Mitscherlich, Heinrich Rose and Justus von Liebig, who considered Voskresensky one his most talented students. With Liebig he started his own chemical research. After returning to Russia in 1838 he was appointed as assistant to Prof. Solovyov at University of St. Petersburg. In 1839 he defended his PhD on quinic acid under supervision of Germain Henri Hess, and in 1843 was promoted to professor.

As similar to a slower ball, the bowler's intention is to deceive the batter into playing too early so that they either miss the ball completely or hit it high up in the air to offer an easy catch. The ball is bowled by the bowler positioning the ball on the knuckles of their index and middle finger, instead of in the fingers themselves. The delivery deceives the batsman as from a batter's perspective, the ball appears to be a stock delivery. However, when it is released it is slower than expected. The delivery was adopted from baseball‚Äôs knuckleball. The physics of the operation are largely the same. However, the seam on a cricket ball is equatorial, and thus the extent of erratic movement is reduced due to the symmetry (at least in the conventional release position where the planes of the ball's trajectory and the seam are nearly co-planar). Though Jeetan Sareen developed the knuckle ball for cricket as early as 1989, the Knuckle ball was first introduced by India's Zaheer Khan in 2011 world cup. Bowlers who often use the knuckleball include India's Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Australia's Andrew Tye. Tye's lethal use of the knuckleball leads to vast success in limited overs competitions, and his eventual selection for Australia. Tye's fame is largely due to his world-renowned use of the knuckleball. Jofra Archer successfully deployed the knuckleball during the 2019 Cricket World Cup and subsequent Test series against Australia.

Early years Gaughan's parents were Irish immigrants who attended the St. Vincent de Paul Church, their local parish church. He was named \\"Vincent\\". Their family home was in Lincoln Park. Education In 1964, he earned his Bachelor of Engineering (B.Eng.) at the University of Illinois. He earned his law degree at DePaul University College of Law and was admitted to the Illinois bar in September 1972. Career Gaughan joined the army after university and graduated from the Artillery Officer Candidate School in Fort Sill, Oklahoma where he was \\"commissioned as a second lieutenant. He was awarded the Bronze Star Medal for valor for his service in the Vietnam war (-1968). He worked in the Cook County public defender's office from 1973 until 1991. He started out as a courtroom lawyer. Later he was a \\"felony trial lawyer supervisor\\". In 1991, he was appointed to the Cook County, Illinois bench. He was elected as judge in 1992. In May and June 2008, he presided over the jury trial of the American singer and record producer, R. Kelly, in which Kelly was acquitted on all counts of child pornography charges. The men found guilty in the Brown's Chicken massacre case in 2007 and 2009, were convicted in Gaughan's courtroom. Judge Gaughan presided in the historic trial of Jason Van Dyke, the police officer who killed the 17-year-old African American Laquan McDonald on October 20, 2014, in Chicago, Illinois. On June 6, 2016 Judge Gaughan agreed to name a special prosecutor for this case. On October 5, 2018, Van Dyke was found guilty of second degree murder. Judge Gaughan set the sentencing hearing date for January 18, 2019 and \\"lifted a decorum order, which will allow the Chicago Police Board to move ahead with disciplinary action against Van Dyke.\\" The New York Times described it as the case that changed Chicago. A revealing February 10, 2015 article in Slate entitled \\"Sixteen Shots\\" by an independent Chicago- based journalist, placed the Chicago Police Department under public scrutiny.According to Julie Bosman's New York Times article, the key evidence in the case was a controversial police dashboard-camera video showing the accused shooting the victim, that was not presented as evidence until an independent Chicago journalist, Jamie Kalven, revealed its existence. Kalven received a tip from a source in November 2014, a month after the murder took place, which led \\"Kalven to a civilian who had seen the entire episode\\". Two months later Kalven read the autopsy report saying that McDonald had been shot 16 times. In 2015, a year after McDonald's death, Judge Gaughan forced the City of Chicago to release police dashboard-camera video showing the accused shooting the victim. On December 13, 2017, Judge Gaughan, \\"quashed a subpoena seeking the reporter Jamie Kalven's testimony, ending a battle over Mr. Kalven‚Äôs sources\\" saying that \\"the subpoena by the defense lacked specifics and sought 'irrelevant and privileged material'\\". An article in the Chicago Tribune, described the case as \\"another high-profile trial\\" for Judge M. Gaughan, an \\"idiosyncratic judge who set the standard for how Cook County handles headline-making cases\\" in his \\"ornate courtroom\\" with a \\"distant view of Chicago's skyline. According to The New York Times, Judge Gaughan \\"is viewed as a mercurial jurist.\\" Attorney Steven Greenberg said that \\"If you‚Äôre Jason Van Dyke, I don‚Äôt think you can ask for a better judge to hear this case. Judge Gaughan is unique and he‚Äôs certainly opinionated, but he will go out of his way to make sure everyone gets a fair hearing.\\" Personal life When Vincent Gaughan returned from Vietnam, he lived with his parents in Lincoln Park. In April 1970, then 28-year-old Gaughan, a law student and war hero, who suffered from anxiety after the war, faced charges including aggravated assault. Gaughan has been active in the Illinois branch of the American Legion since the 1990s when he served as its commander.

In the 16th century King Henry VIII established a naval dockyard in Erith. It became a trading hub, as spices and cotton from the East Indies were delivered onto London. A naval storehouse was constructed at Erith in 1512 that was managed by the Keeper of the Kings Storehouses who was one of the Clerks of the Kings Marine a Tudor (naval administrator). Erith Dockyard was used as an advance base for routine maintenance before ships were transferred to Deptford Dockyard. It closed due to persistent flooding in 1521. However, according to naval historian Nicholas A. M. Rodger although Erith dockyard closed it was an important center of naval administration of the English Navy from 1514 into the 1540s. Administration of the dockyard and other key officials The Master Shipwright was usually the key official at the royal navy dockyards until the introduction of resident commissioners by the Navy Board after which he became deputy to the resident commissioner.

Defining a hook-up is ambiguous because it can have a variety of meanings ranging from casual Kissing to foreplay and oral sex, or in some cases, it can mean participating in sexual intercourse. Hook-ups typically only last a short time and those involved are typically only interested in experiencing sexual intimacy and pleasure. Not all hook-ups can be classified as \\"one-night stands\\", however, since some people believe they can eventually lead to dating or more personal connections. While people have engaged in casual sex for many years, the act of \\"hooking-up\\" has become increasingly popular on college and university campuses in the United States over the last decade. Hooking up has become common for many college students, and the practice has replaced more traditional 20th century ideas about dating. Furthermore, social media sites like Facebook or Match, and phone applications like Grindr and Tinder have given users an opportunity to form connections with other people who have similar sexual interests or desires. Studying hook-up culture focuses on its influences on the formation and management of friendships and romantic relationships. The growth of hook-up culture is also shaping gender roles, specifically in regards to sexual behavior. Aside from these aspects of hook-ups, taking part in uncommitted sex can lead to potential negative physical and emotional impacts.Mobile applications have become very popular in regards to online dating, but have also served as a way for people to engage in hook-ups.  Background  The idea of hook-up culture is not a new concept. The growing popularity of hook- ups stems from the 1960s, a time when both sexual liberation and feminism were growing, and birth control options were becoming more readily available. It was at this point in time when hooking up began to shift views on romantic interactions and replaced more traditional dating practices. = Sexual liberation = Support for sexual freedom became increasingly popular as new ideas and beliefs evolved about the positive and negative aspects of engaging in sexual intercourse. It became more widely accepted that having sex was not necessarily always intended for reproduction, but rather had more emphasis on physical pleasure. This new outlook was influenced by several factors, including the eradication of 1930s censorship laws regarding sexually explicit content in media, and also a growing accessibility to birth control pills, condoms, and other forms of contraception. Before the 1960s, unmarried women were usually denied access to birth control since it was traditional for men and women to refrain from having sex until after marriage. = Feminism = Feminism grew substantially in the 1960s, with supporters arguing that a woman should have complete control over her own body. Supporters of the feminist movement also argued that women should be able to \\"pursue\\" men in the same way men traditionally approached women, and made efforts to change the negative attitudes usually associated with women that decided to have sex before marriage. = Other factors = Kathleen Bogle has stated that the growing acceptance of casual sex in the 1960s could also be attributed to a sharp rise in female student enrollment at colleges and universities. The number of women attending college in the United States in 1972 was three times larger than the number in 1960. With a greater number of females on campuses compared to males, women had to adjust to the sexual scripts outlined by men, which are based more on engaging in uncommitted sex rather than on developing relationships.  Gender and sexuality  = Gender roles = While both men and women participate in hook-ups, Bogle notes that males and females often choose casual sex for different reasons. Researchers suggest men and women have distinct sexual scripts, or ways in which cultural influences can affect an individual's sexual behaviors. Furthermore, society judges the sexual behaviors of men and women in a completely different manner. For men, sex is characterized as \\"central to male identity\\", and research suggests men tend to \\"prefer nonrelational sex\\". In contrast, women are viewed as \\"sexual objects\\" and are normally \\"sexually passive compared to men.\\" Society typically admires or glorifies men who frequently engage in casual sex, but women are scrutinized or admonished for those same behaviors. For this reason, a woman's sexual script has more focus on finding some type of commitment or relationship. Additionally, women pursue relationships to \\"protect their reputation\\" while in college, but men have more sexual freedom without the fear of reproach. Females risk being called \\"sluts\\" or being accused of \\"getting around too much,\\" since society has historically identified this as inappropriate behavior for females. Men are not held to the same standards, particularly in high school and college. Men who engage in regular sexual activity are seen as successful individuals who are \\"players\\". In fact, men are rarely reprimanded for their sexual behavior unless they are practicing abstinence, in which case their peers might say they cannot \\"get any\\". Researcher Donna Freitas challenges society's perceptions of the male sexual script. Through conversations and interviews with men on college campuses, she says they expressed a need to \\"fit in\\" with other males to be successful. Men claim to hook up more due to peer expectations rather than to meet their own desires. Men also say they cannot express disapproval for hook-up culture in the same way women can without facing criticism from their peers. To summarize, women face several risks by participating in hook-up culture, but Freitas says \\"men risk gaining a reputation by not being a part of it.\\" = Homosexuality = Stereotypes suggest most people believe homosexual men are the most likely to engage in casual or uncommitted sex on a regular basis. Studies conclude gay men participated in more frequent casual sex than individuals \\"across all genders, sexes, and sexual orientations comparison groups.\\" Overall, hook-up culture is understood to be most prominent within the gay community. Biologically speaking, sexual behavior is closely connected to someone's birth sex. Under this assumption, women are considered a \\"limiting factor in sexual encounters.\\" Gay men do not have to question the sexual desires of other men like they would if a female was involved in the scenario. Additionally, society's early negative perspectives on homosexuality along with a lack of \\"regulation\\" in gay relationships can explain the higher rate of casual sex encounters among gay men. Certain perceptions of gay men like prejudice and homophobia adversely affected the overall mental health of gay men, and they were often forced to explore their sexual needs and desires in a discreet fashion. Recent advances in technology such as dating websites and mobile apps, have also contributed to the current hook-up tendencies observed in gay men. Apps like Grindr have further advanced the sexual scripts of homosexual men. Other apps, like Tinder or Bumble, have been created to follow a similar script for heterosexual individuals. Nevertheless, because casual hook-ups and anonymous sexual encounters have been classified as more prominent in homosexuals, apps like Tinder and Bumble still maintain a broader focus on more long-term goals like dating or relationships, especially when compared to apps like Grindr.  Risks  Most people choose to take part in hook-ups to experience physical intimacy and sexual pleasure, but this type of behavior can result in a variety of negative outcomes, too. These impacts can range from \\"emotional and psychological injury, sexual violence, Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and/or unintended pregnancy.\\" Despite these known potential effects, many college students are either unaware or unbothered by these sexual risks. According to a survey focused on how students perceive the risk of contracting sexual diseases, only half of a group of 71 students reported having concerns about STI contraction while engaging in sexual intercourse. Further analysis of this survey determined that many students claimed to trust their sexual partners and communities too much, and that they were misinformed about sexual risks in general. Research suggests frequent drug or alcohol use can also lead to lower perceptions of these health risks. Engaging in hook-ups can have negative effects on a person's mental health as well, including feelings of anxiety or discomfort. One study suggests nearly 35% of surveyed students described feeling regretful or disappointed after a hook-up. Experts have used qualitative analyses to gauge both the type and level of regret a student might have after uncommitted sex. Many reported having feelings of embarrassment, emotional issues, and an overall lack of respect from their peers.  Communication theory  The majority of academic research about hook-up culture focuses on the psychological, biological, and societal influences on an individual's inclination to engage in uncommitted sex, but some scholars have examined theories of communication and how they relate to hook-up culture. = Attachment theory = The premise behind John Bowlby's attachment theory is to \\"describe the behaviors that humans use to relate to one another.\\" Attachment theory suggests people develop an attachment style during childhood and then carry it into adulthood, where it can have impacts on the relationships they form. Researcher Mary Ainsworth identified different attachment styles, and suggested they can influence someone's relational and sexual behavior. In one analysis, these attachment styles were applied to explain how homosexual men behave sexually. For example, gay men with an anxious-ambivalent attachment style (an individual made uncomfortable by \\"close emotional relationships, but will desperately try to seek out reassurance from another person\\") might be more reluctant to use condoms during sexual intercourse because they believe this will make them feel more wanted by their partner. Meanwhile a gay man with an anxious-avoidant attachment style (an individual who does not like to get close to others) will most likely try to remain disconnected from his partner for fear of becoming too close or intimate. = Sexual script theory = The way cultural norms affects someone's sexual habits and behavior is defined as sexual script theory. Researchers John Gagnon and William Simon originally developed the concept and suggested these scripts serve as \\"guides for behavior.\\" The scripts can help individuals determine what is and is not appropriate based on surrounding cultural influences. In the United States, this script includes \\"kissing, then sexual touching, and ultimately culminates in sexual intercourse (i.e., the 'bases').\\" These sexual scripts also help define gender roles and explain the actions both males and females take in hook-ups and uncommitted sexual encounters. = Cultivation theory = The concept of cultivation theory suggests \\"media influence people indirectly.\\" Researchers suggest the ways media portrays sexual activity of different age groups is disproportionate to reality. Someone who consumes a variety of media will demonstrate these influences when confronted with hook-ups or uncommitted sexual scenarios.  Application  Most research regarding hook-up culture has been reliant on conducting interviews and surveys with sexually active individuals, particularly those at a high school or college level. Each investigator's set of questions, however, has served a different purpose in the overall analysis of hook-up culture. = Research to explain a \\"hook-up\\" = Scholars have expressed the difficulty of defining a \\"hook-up\\" since it has different meanings based on cultural norms and personal preferences. Researchers like Kathleen Bogle and Donna Freitas have interviewed males and females, both separately and together, to gain a better understanding of the hook-up culture on campuses in the United States. Their studies have focused on how the growing hook-up culture has shaped the trajectory of dating and forming relationships, and have also aimed to gain a better understanding of the difference in sexual scripts between men and women. They have also used this data to help further explain what specific actions and behaviors constitute a hook-up. = Influences of dating sites and apps = Another avenue of research has studied the influences of dating websites and mobile dating apps on hook-up culture. Scholar Carey Noland suggests the advent of finding hook-ups or dates through the Internet has made talking about sex easier because you \\"skip the small talk\\" and do not have to worry about the normal \\"barriers\\" of saving face when talking to someone online. Additional research has analyzed hook-up patterns to see how mobile app developers have catered to their potential users. For example, the creators of Grindr capitalized on the increased sexual desires among gay men to base its app on locational awareness. This paved the way for apps where users can find connections and meet up with people who are often right around the corner. = Understanding the risks = Research conducted on hook-up culture has also been applied to scientific studies about sexually-transmitted infections. Knowing more information about a man or woman's behavior during casual sex has increased the understanding of how STIs are contracted, whether it is through oral sex or sexual intercourse, and how frequently or infrequently individuals take steps to prevent them. By interviewing individuals who engage in hook- ups, scholars have been able to better explain health risk perceptions or the lack thereof; researchers have also been able to apply their findings to study the potential psychological effects of hook-ups, including feelings of depression or regret.  Critique  Several scholars have critiqued how outside influences have shaped or contributed to hook-up culture as a whole. Many ideas and beliefs about the growing hook-up culture suggest the act of engaging in uncommitted sex is primarily found among teenagers or college students. While teenagers and college students may be sexually active, it is important to understand that other age and social groups are taking part in casual sex, too. One of the reasons for this disconnect is the misrepresentation of sexual activity among certain age groups in media. In television, teens are most commonly shown to be sexually active and it is rare to see any kind of sexual activity portrayed for individuals aged 65 or older. Further research shows, however, that this is opposite of the actual sexual activity reported among these age groups. The stereotypes and different sexual scripts of males and females in hook-ups have also been influenced greatly by different media, like movies, television, and Pornography. Frequently in media, women are depicted as \\"sexual objects\\" and men are portrayed as \\"there to objectify them.\\" Furthermore, media promotes the \\"boys will be boys\\" mentality. These stereotypes has shaped current hook-up culture because this is how society says men and women are \\"supposed to act.\\" On another note, scholars suggest the reality of emotional risks associated with hooking-up can be linked to a lack of conversation or discussion about them. When discussing sex with adolescents, both parents and sex education programs tend to focus on the health risks, like STIs and pregnancy, but these exchanges rarely highlight the \\"emotions that occur from sexual experiences.\\" These conversations seldom present information about motives for engaging in sex aside from reproduction, and rarely acknowledge the positive emotions associated with this type of activity, like physical pleasure. This imbalance of information regarding sexual behavior and activity has also contributed to the sexual scripts we see in hook-up culture today. = Areas for future research = Experts have suggested several areas for future research, including additional studies about how members of the LGBTQ community are impacted by hook-up culture, and how perceptions of the LGBTQ community have been affected by the hook-up culture. Researcher Kathleen Bogle highlights another area of study; she says a new focus should be on individuals who choose not to participate in hook-ups and how they are \\"affected by the dominant hookup culture that surrounds them.\\" Finally, a third avenue for future research could include an analytical view of individuals who use apps like Grindr or Tinder with hopes of finding connections or developing relationships, rather than using them for the more common casual hook-ups.

He was known for his involvement in the production of exploitation films in Italy, Hong Kong, Spain, the Philippines and England, and his career covered a wide array of genres including mondo documentaries, erotica, giallo, martial arts and slasher films. Personal life A rotund cigar-smoker, Randall was born on March 3, 1926 in the Catskill Mountains, New York. He was married to New Orleans-born singer Corliss Theresa Randall (n√©e Anselmo), who collaborated with him on several films. Career Randall's entertainment career began in the 1950s with writing gags for Milton Berle, before producing his first film, a George Jessel-narrated documentary about the 1958 World's Fair titled Holiday in Brussels, in 1959. He became saddled with debt after producing two unsuccessful Broadway plays and relocated to Italy, where he specialized in producing and distributing low-budget mondo, sexploitation and giallo films, such as Primitive Love (1964), The Wild, Wild World of Jayne Mansfield (1968), Four Times That Night (1971), The French Sex Murders (1972) and The Girl in Room 2A (1974). During his time in Europe, he often worked under the aliases Robert H. Oliver and Claudio Rainis. Having earned a reputation in being able to acquire highly-disparate sources of finance for his films, Randall spent the 1970s and early 1980s primarily between Rome, London and Hong Kong producing a wide range of films, including hardcore pornography such as Black Deep Throat (1976, starring Ajita Wilson), blacksploitation films including Death Dimension (1978, starring Jim Kelly), women-in-prison films such as Escape from Women's Prison (1978), Bruceploitation films including The Clones of Bruce Lee (1980) and slasher films such as Pieces (1982). Many of his films during this period were also mockbusters of other, popular films of the time, such as Supersonic Man (1979), For Your Height Only (1981), Invaders of the Lost Gold (1982), and The Pod People (1983). Although he frequently wrote and acted in his own films, Randall's sole directorial credit was for the gothic horror film Frankenstein's Castle of Freaks (1974). In 1981, he permanently settled in London, where he continued to work, producing Don't Open till Christmas (1984, directed by his frequent collaborator Edmund Purdom), the documentary Don't Scream: It's Only a Movie! (1985) and Slaughter High (1986). Death Randall died of a stroke in London on May 14, 1996.

Its nearest higher peak is Mount Amery, to the north-northwest. Mount Erasmus can be seen from the Icefields Parkway west of Saskatchewan Crossing, with optimum photography conditions in morning light. History Peter Erasmus Mount Erasmus was named by James Hector in 1859 during the Palliser expedition for Peter Erasmus (1833-1931), who was an interpreter and guide for that exploration into the Canadian Rockies. Peter's skills as a M√©tis interpreter opened up the west for scientists, explorers, and government officials. The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1950 by John C. Oberlin and Fred Ayres. The mountain's name was officially adopted in 1957 by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Geology Like other mountains in Banff Park, Mount Erasmus is composed of sedimentary rock laid down from the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. Climate Mount Erasmus Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Erasmus is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below -20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below -30 ¬∞C. In terms of favorable weather conditions, summer months are best for climbing. Precipitation runoff from Mount Erasmus drains into tributaries of the North Saskatchewan River.

The street was renamed in 1995 in honor of American labor leader and Latino American civil rights activist, Cesar Chavez. It was widened in the middle of the 20th century to serve as a thoroughfare between the 101 and 280 freeways to the unbuilt Mission Freeway. It starts at Pier 80 in the Bayview neighborhood and ends at Douglass Street in the Noe Valley. The intersection of Chavez and Mission is the heart of the micro-neighborhood locally known as \\"La Lengua.\\" The chase scene from the 1968 Steve McQueen film Bullitt started on Army Street.CUT TO THE CHASE / Classic scene in McQueen's 'Bullitt' unreal as ever, Peter Hartlaub, SFGate, 26 October 2003 Background Originally the street ran alongside the Precita Creek, parallel to Navy Street. Around 1900 the creek was channeled underground, and Army street was paved over the former creek. In the 1930s it was widened and meant to be a thoroughfare for automobiles. It is seen as the dividing line between the Mission District on the north, and Bernal Heights on the south. At one point it was a two-lane street with its own streetcar line, but had been widened to six lanes by 1950. It is considered an important east- west arterial, \\"... west of Third Street, [the street] is designated a major arterial and a Citywide Bicycle Route and carries 12,000 vehicles per day. It is a four-lane street that provides access to the west and connects to the central waterfront, India Basin, and Hunters Point Shipyard areas to the east. East of Third Street, it provides access to Pier 80.\\" The widening of Army Street was made as part of the development of the never constructed Southern Crossing from San Francisco to the East Bay. The name of the street was changed to honor the city's Latino community, but the change was controversial at the time. Recognizing the negative effects created by the widening of the street, in 2011 the city started an effort to make the street more pedestrian friendly. The Cesar Chavez Streetscape Project implemented measures to \\"improve pedestrian and bicyclist safety, enhance greening, promote ecology function, and make the street work better ...\\" See also *List of places named after Cesar Chavez References  External links  * Category:Places named after Cesar Chavez Category:Streets in San Francisco ","title":"Cesar Chavez Street"},{"id":"59623484","text":"Hilario kiting in his home spot in Cabarete at a river mouth.

November 11, 1899 Charlottenburg ‚Äì d. February 27, 1967 Bad Homburg vor der H√∂he) is a former German ice hockey player. Kittel played on the German men's national ice hockey team at the 1928 Winter Olympics, before switching to civil aviation in 1928. Life Kittel was the son of a medical doctor specializing in rheumatic diseases Dr. Miesko Kittel (1856-1923), operating in Franzensbad / Bohemia and Merano / Italy and his first wife Auguste Juliane Alice Reschke (1869-1925). Kittel attended school in Eger (Cheb) and Cilli (Austria). Afterwards he was trained at the Innsbruck Officer School and then joined a Kaiserj√§ger Regiment on the Isonzo battlefront. After the war he joined a \\"Freikorps\\" in the Baltic Area, before inscribing at the Munich and Berlin Technical Universities. He did not finish his studies with a degree. From 1924-1928 he worked for the Lohmann - Group. Before 1928 Kittel became a member of the \\"Berliner Schlittschuhclub\\" (ice skating /ice hockey) and thus became German Champion in the 1928 Season. He was on the German Team at the 1928 Olympic Games at St. Moritz. At the 1927 European Games he and his team were awarded a bronze medal. He took part for Germany in two International Games. Career in civil aviation In 1928 Kittel sailed to Barranquilla, Colombia, working for SCADTA-Airlines (Sociedad Colombo Alemana de Transportes Aereos) until 1938. In that year he returned to Germany for health reasons. Immediately he started to research his non-Jewish ancestors in Poland, permitting him to apply for a job with LUFTHANSA in 1939. Helping out a friend he became the company's resident (and jointly German Consul) at Bathurst, British West Gambia. In the same year he was arrested there by the British and deported to England. For further internment in Canada (due to British fear of the German Invasion) he was on the Arandora Star, that was torpedoed and sunk by the German submarine boat \\"U-47\\" with captain G√ºnther Prien on July 2, 1940 at 6.58 A.M. Kittel survived in the icy waters until saved by the Canadian destroyer St. Laurent at around 4 P.M. He was returned to England and almost immediately after this harrowing experience placed on HMT Dunera, this time for deportation to Australia. Before reaching Capetown there was a mutiny on board which Kittel helped to put down. According to his second wife Ingeborg Kittel n√©e Gerlach (1921-2018) he was disembarked at Capetown and returned to England on a civilian boat and in a first class cabin, unescorted and on his word of honour, in order to be able to testify at the inevitable courts martial. Kittel's whereabouts until Christmas of 1940 have not been documented. At that point in time he surfaced at Dunluce House, Ramsey on the Isle of Man, a villa for VIPs and diplomatists, where he met his future father and mother-in-law: professor doctor Werner Gerlach - the German Consul General at Reykjavik / Iceland, who had been deported to England by the British - with wife and two daughters - in May of 1940. This was where Wolfgang Kittel met his future second wife, Gerlach's elder daughter Ingeborg. Also interned at Dunluce house were Werner T. Schaurte, the Neuss industrialist and his companion count Lothar von Hoensbroech, who had been in Canada on a hunting expedition. Incidentally, Hoensbroech and Gerlach had met and become friends in Turkey at the end of the first world war, where Gerlach was a medical officer at the Haidar Pascha Hospital in Istanbul. Since all official documents concerning male internees on the Isle of Man during the war, have mysteriously vanished, Kittel's repatriation on 26 May 1943 via Lisbon to Berlin is documented by his \\"Foreign Ofice\\" file (see below); he then proposed marriage to Ingeborg Gerlach and they married on September 15, 1943 at the German Embassy in Paris. Kittel then became manager of the Neuss firm Bauer & Schaurte from 1943-1945 when he was again interned by the British from 1945-1947 due to the denunciation of his elder sister Elsa L√∂ffler n√©e Kittel. It took him two years to gain access to the British archive in the Camp, so that he could prove why in the first place he was interned and secondly the falseness of his sister's deposition. From 1947 to 1952 Kittel was the manager of the Matthes Fischer firm in D√ºsseldorf- Oberkassel, who produced metal boxes with printed decoration. In 1954/55 he joined the newly founded Deutsche Lufthansa at Cologne, later in Hamburg. He was General Manager of the company in New York from 1955-1959, when he became a member of the board in Cologne. Retiring in 1965 he was appointed head of the Deutsche Zentrale f√ºr Fremdenverkehr (tourism) until he died in early 1967 in Bad Homburg. Family On 17 July 1922 Kittel in Budapest married his first wife Carola Mathilde Elfriede Remy. They did not have children and the marriage was dissolved in Berlin in 1939. He married secondly on Sept. 15, 1943 in Paris Ingeborg Gerlach. They had two sons: Werner Kittel, born 3 March 1945 Garmisch-Partenkirchen, founder of the Kunstarchiv (art archive) Kittel, and Gerd Kittel, born 17 Nov. 1948 D√ºsseldorf, medical doctor, who later became a landscape photographer.

It also commonly includes p√©chay and mushrooms. The dish is commonly served in regions in the Philippines with large Chinese Filipino populations, especially in the Binondo district of Manila. Origin Pata tim, like the more common humb√†, is derived from the Chinese red braised pork. It is closer to the original dish than humb√†, in that it sometimes uses Chinese rice wine and other Chinese spices and condiments. However, it is more commonly cooked closer to the Filipino paksiw na pata, but it does not use vinegar or uses only a very small amount of it. Like humb√†, it can also add common Filipino ingredients like pineapples, banana flowers, saba bananas, and patis. The name is a shortened version of pata itim, literally \\"black pork hock\\", from pata (\\"pork hock\\" or \\"pig's trotters\\") and itim (\\"black\\"). Description Pata tim with puto and green beans from Pampanga The most basic pata tim recipe use pata (pork hock or pig's trotters). It is traditionally cooked whole and not chopped, unlike humb√†. The hock is sometimes first marinated overnight in brine. It is then seared in oil in a large pan for a few minutes with mushrooms until lightly browned, then set aside. The rest of the ingredients, namely soy sauce, muscovado sugar (or brown sugar), garlic, black peppercorns, star anise, and bay leaves are added to a large pot of water and brought to a boil. The hock is added and boiled for a few minutes. The heat is lowered and the pot is allowed to simmer for a few hours until the meat is very tender. A pressure cooker can also be used to shorten the cooking time. The mushrooms and blanched p√©chay are added last. It is served with white rice. The dish can be modified extensively. It can use other Chinese spices and condiments like sesame oil, Chinese rice wine, hoisin sauce, five spice powder, cinnamon bark, and so on. Though it can also use native condiments like patis (fish sauce). It can also include other ingredients like lettuce, green beans, shallots, sugarcane, banana flowers, saba bananas, and pineapples, among others. The sauce is naturally thick due to the gelatin in the hock, but in some recipes, cornstarch is added to achieve the same effect.

During this time, assembly mandates were awarded to candidates at the discretion of sponsoring parties or coalitions, and there was no requirement that they be assigned in numerical order; the G17 Plus list was mostly alphabetical. Homan was not initially granted a mandate but was selected to join the party's assembly delegation on 12 February 2004 as the replacement for another member.DRUGO VANREDNO ZASEDANJE, 12.02.2004., Otvoreni Parlament, accessed 9 January 2019. During this time, G17 Plus was a part of Serbia's coalition government under the prime ministership of Democratic Party of Serbia leader Vojislav Ko≈°tunica; Homan served as a supporter of ministry and became an official spokesperson for his party. He was a candidate for election to the Assembly of the City of Belgrade in the 2004 Serbian local elections, but he was ultimately not selected for a mandate.Slu≈æbeni list, City of Belgrade, Year 48 Number 24 (8 September 2004), p. 1. In August 2006, Homan said that G17 Plus would withdraw from government if the Ko≈°tunica administration did not restart negotiations to join the European Union by the beginning of October (which would have required the apprehension of Ratko Mladiƒá, at the time a war crimes suspect wanted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia).\\"Failure to capture Mladic could trigger early elections in Serbia, official says,\\" Associated Press Newswires, 8 August 2006. The deadline passed without the relaunch of negotiations, and the G17 Plus ministers duly submitted their resignations and left the government.\\"PRESS DIGEST - Serbia and Montenegro - Oct 30,\\" Reuters News, 30 October 2006. The ministers initially continued in office on an interim basis, pending the 2006 Serbian constitutional referendum. Homan defended the delay, remarking, \\"Our representatives will withdraw when the Serbian parliament verifies their resignations and the prime minister proposes their replacements. You cannot just turn around and walk away from the government.\\" New elections were held in early 2007. On this occasion, Homan received the 237th position on his party's list, which won nineteen mandates.–ò–∑–±–æ—Ä–∏ –∑–∞ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–µ –ø–æ—Å–ª–∞–Ω–∏–∫–µ –ù–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–µ —Å–∫—É–ø—à—Ç–∏–Ω–µ –æ–¥—Ä–∂–∞–Ω–∏ 21. —ò–∞–Ω—É–∞—Ä–∞ –∏ 8. —Ñ–µ–±—Ä–∞—É–∞—Ä–∞ 2007. –≥–æ–¥–∏–Ω–µ, –ò–ó–ë–û–†–ù–ï –õ–ò–°–¢–ï (–ì17 –ø–ª—É—Å - –ú–ª–∞—í–∞–Ω –î–∏–Ω–∫–∏—õ), Republika Srbija - Republiƒçka izborna komisija, accessed 15 October 2018.14 February 2007 legislature, National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia, accessed 15 October 2018.

Homan subsequently affiliated with Boris Tadiƒá's Social Democratic Party (SDS), which contested the 2016 Serbian parliamentary election in an alliance with the Liberal Democratic Party and the League of Social Democrats of Vojvodina. By this time, Serbia's electoral system had been reformed such that mandates were awarded to candidates from successful lists in numerical order. Homan received the seventy-seventh position on the list; this was too low for election to be a realistic prospect, and indeed he was not elected when the list won thirteen mandates.–ò–∑–±–æ—Ä–∏ –∑–∞ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–µ –ø–æ—Å–ª–∞–Ω–∏–∫–µ 2016. –≥–æ–¥–∏–Ω–µ ¬ª –ò–∑–±–æ—Ä–Ω–µ –ª–∏—Å—Ç–µ (–ë–û–†–ò–° –¢–ê–î–ò–ã, –ß–ï–î–û–ú–ò–† –à–û–í–ê–ù–û–í–ò–ã - –°–ê–í–ï–ó –ó–ê –ë–û–â–£ –°–†–ë–ò–à–£ ‚Äì –õ–∏–±–µ—Ä–∞–ª–Ω–æ –¥–µ–º–æ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç—Å–∫–∞ –ø–∞—Ä—Ç–∏—ò–∞, –õ–∏–≥–∞ —Å–æ—Ü–∏—ò–∞–ª–¥–µ–º–æ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–∞ –í–æ—ò–≤–æ–¥–∏–Ω–µ, –°–æ—Ü–∏—ò–∞–ª–¥–µ–º–æ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç—Å–∫–∞ —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–∫–∞), Republika Srbija - Republiƒçka izborna komisija, accessed 26 January 2017.

Known for his criticism both of communism and of terrorist activity among the Cuban exiles in Florida, he was the victim of a car-bombing attack in 1976 which left him disabled. Biography Emilio Mili√°n was born in the Las Villas Province of Cuba in September 1931. He emigrated to Mexico in 1965 with his wife and three children. After some months, the family moved to Miami, in the US state of Florida. There, Mili√°n began working for a radio station named WMIE as a sports commentator, and also bought a print shop. This station was eventually renamed WQBA, and Mili√°n rose to become its news director in 1971. He presented a Spanish program on WQBA in the 1970s, which was popular among the Cuban exile population in southern Florida. The Miami Herald stated in 1976 that Mili√°n's radio station had the largest audience of any in the Miami metropolitan area. Milian was best known for criticizing communism on his radio program \\"Habla el Pueblo\\" (The People Speak). However, he also criticized the Cuban exiles who carried out terrorist attacks against the Cuban government, and who believed themselves to be Cuban patriots. The positions he took brought him praise, but also led to him being branded a traitor, and to his receiving death threats. In April 1976, a bomb went off in Mili√°n's car when he started it to return home from work. Milian lost both his legs in the attack, which is generally attributed to his outspoken criticism of violence committed by Cuban exiles. Mili√°n also suffered injuries to his ear drums and eyes. Two Cuban exiles, Gaspar Jim√©nez and Gustavo Castillo, were indicted by a grand jury for the bombing in April 1981, nearly five years after it took place. Investigators in the case had identified Jim√©nez as a chief suspect. A witness said he saw Jim√©nez working on Milian's car shortly before the bombing. The indictments were kept secret, as the two men were serving prison sentences in Mexico on charges of having kidnapped a Cuban consul, and prosecutors were afraid they would attempt to avoid arrest if the indictments were known. However, soon after Jim√©nez was released from prison in 1983, the indictments were dropped, with the prosecuting attorney stating that there was insufficient evidence. No one was prosecuted for the bombing. Milian left his job at WQBA after the attack, but returned to working in radio in 1989. He later worked at 670-AM, another radio station, and held this position until late 2000. He died in March 2001, at the age of 69. During the later part of his life, he suffered from heart disease and diabetes. References External links *Detailed accounts of the bombing and its investigation in The Miami Herald.

Reception  = Critical response = Manoj Kumar R of Indian Express gave 2 out of 5 and wrote - Neither Mammootty nor Prithviraj can save this film. The film is crammed with characters and subplots that leave you overwhelmed. Is this the story about Ashwin Vasudev who overcame his flaws to build a school that challenges the conventional idea of education? Or is it the story of Ayyappan, who remembers his first love after taking a bullet near his chest in a gun battle at the border? Or it must be about students who abuse drugs? No wait, it is about Mammootty‚Äôs John Abraham Palakkal taking on the flawed educational system? Actually, it‚Äôs about everything and everyone. It is just too much. The background score of the film is also so confusing as it is hard to tell the heroes from the villains. Even the bad guys get to deliver lengthy punchlines, walk in slow motion, and strike action poses. S R Praveen of The Hindu called the movie an unrealistic depiction of student rivalry in schools and wrote - At the core of the film is the long-standing rivalry between student gangs belonging to two schools in Thiruvananthapuram city. It is the kind of rivalry which seems quite unreal for school students, even in a masala entertainer, mainly due to the level of violence involved. Notwithstanding the fact that some of these stylized stunts are aesthetically shot or well-choreographed, these scenes don‚Äôt belong in a movie about school students. Similarly, the five-star hangouts of the international school students, complete with an ‚Äòitem song‚Äô also looks far removed from reality. The characters of the girls are relegated to the background, with hardly any of them getting a line or two to utter. Too many characters make their appearance, but only a couple of them are written with any depth to them. The whole bunch of newcomers do show promise, lighting up the screen with their infectious energy, even as the script, written by director Shanker Ramakrishnan himself, sags.

It has been proposed that the composition of the lower mantle is pyrolitic, containing three major phases of bridgmanite, ferropericlase and calcium-silicate perovskite. The high pressure in the lower mantle has been shown to induce a spin transition of iron-bearing bridgmanite and ferropericlase, which may affect both mantle plume dynamics and lower mantle chemistry. The upper boundary is defined by the sharp increase in seismic wave velocities and density at a depth of . At a depth of 660 km, ringwoodite (Œ≥-(Mg,Fe)2SiO4) decomposes into Mg-Si perovskite and magnesiow√ºstite. This reaction marks the boundary between upper mantle and lower mantle. This measurement is estimated from seismic data and high- pressure laboratory experiments. The base of the mesosphere includes the D‚Ä≥ zone which lies just above the mantle‚Äìcore boundary at approximately . The base of the lower mantle is at about 2700 km.  Physical properties  The lower mantle was initially labelled as the D-layer in Bullen's spherically symmetric model of the Earth. The PREM seismic model of the Earth's interior separated the D-layer into three distinctive layers defined by the discontinuity in seismic wave velocities: * 660‚Äì770 km: A discontinuity in compression wave velocity (6-11%) followed by a steep gradient is indicative of the transformation of the mineral ringwoodite to bridgmanite and ferropericlase and the transition between the transition zone layer to the lower mantle. * 770‚Äì2700 km: A gradual increase in velocity indicative of the adiabatic compression of the mineral phases in the lower mantle. * 2700‚Äì2900 km: The D-layer is considered the transition from the lower mantle to the outer core. The temperature of the lower mantle ranges from 1960 K at the topmost layer to 2630 K at a depth of 2700 km. Models of the temperature of the lower mantle approximate convection as the primary heat transport contribution, while conduction and radiative heat transfer are considered negligible. As a result, the lower mantle's temperature gradient as a function of depth is approximately adiabatic. Calculation of the geothermal gradient observed a decrease from 0.47 K/km at the uppermost lower mantle to 0.24 K/km at 2600 km.  Composition  The lower mantle is mainly composed of three components, bridgmanite, ferropericlase and calcium-silicate perovskite (CaSiO3-perovskite). The proportion of each component has been a subject of discussion historically where the bulk composition is suggested to be, * Pyrolitic: derived from petrological composition trends from upper mantle peridotite suggesting homogeneity between the upper and lower mantle with a Mg/Si ratio of 1.27. This model implies that the lower mantle is composed of 75% bridgmanite, 17% ferropericlase and 8% CaSiO3-perovskite by volume. * Chondritic: suggests that the Earth's lower mantle was accreted from composition of chondritic meteorite suggesting a Mg/Si ratio of approximately 1. This infers that bridgmanite and CaSiO3-perovskites are major components. Laboratory multi-anvil compression experiments of pyrolite simulated conditions of the adiabatic geotherm and measured the density using in situ X-ray diffraction. It was shown that the density profile along the geotherm is in agreement with the PREM model. First principle calculation of the density and velocity profile across the lower mantle geotherm of varying bridgmanite and ferropericlase proportion observed a match to the PREM model at an 8:2 proportion. This proportion is consistent with the pyrolitic bulk composition at the lower mantle. Furthermore, shear wave velocity calculations of a pyrolitic lower mantle compositions considering minor elements resulted in a match with the PREM shear velocity profile within 1%. On the other hand, Brillouin spectroscopic studies at relevant pressures and temperatures revealed that a lower mantle composed of greater than 93% bridgmanite phase has corresponding shear-wave velocities to measured seismic velocities. The suggested composition is consistent with a chondritic lower mantle. Thus, the bulk composition of the lower mantle is currently a subject of discussion.  Spin transition zone  The electronic environment of two iron bearing minerals in the lower mantle (bridgmanite, ferropericlase) transitions from a high-spin (HS) to a low-spin (LS) state. Fe2+ in ferropericlase undergoes the transition between 50-90 GPa. Bridgmanite contains both Fe3+ and Fe2+ in the structure, the Fe2+ occupy the A-site and transition to a LS state at 120 GPa. While Fe3+ occupy both A- and B-sites, the B-site Fe3+ undergoes HS to LS transition at 30-70 GPa while the A-site Fe3+ exchanges with the B-site Al3+ cation and becomes LS. This spin transition of the iron cation results in the increase in partition coefficient between ferropericlase and bridgmanite to 10-14 depleting bridgmanite and enriching ferropericlase of Fe2+. The HS to LS transition are reported to affect physical properties of the iron bearing minerals. For example, the density and incompressibility was reported to increase from HS to LS state in ferropericlase. The effects of the spin transition on the transport properties and rheology of the lower mantle is currently being investigated and discussed using numerical simulations. History Mesosphere (not to be confused with mesosphere, a layer of the atmosphere) is derived from \\"mesospheric shell\\", coined by Reginald Aldworth Daly, a Harvard University geology professor. In the pre-plate tectonics era, Daly (1940) inferred that the outer Earth consisted of three spherical layers: lithosphere (including the crust), asthenosphere, and mesospheric shell. Daly's hypothetical depths to the lithosphere‚Äìasthenosphere boundary ranged from , and the top of the mesospheric shell (base of the asthenosphere) were from . Thus, Daly's asthenosphere was inferred to be thick. According to Daly, the base of the solid Earth mesosphere could extend to the base of the mantle (and, thus, to the top of the core). A derivative term, mesoplates, was introduced as a heuristic, based on a combination of \\"mesosphere\\" and \\"plate\\", for postulated reference frames in which mantle hotspots apparently exist.

The events mainly centred around the debate over whether industrial action or political activity should be the means of achieving the aims of workers and additionally to unite the \\"moderate\\" and \\"militant\\" factions within the labour movement. Whilst neither conference fully unified the labour movement, it laid a framework of co-operation that would later assist during the creation of the current New Zealand Labour Party in 1916. Background From the lead up to the 1890 general election there was considerable co-operation between trade unions and the New Zealand Liberal Party. The ensuing Liberal government enacted legislation much lauded by labourers including a basic welfare system and a pension scheme. In particular, the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1894 which encouraged more unions to form, and by 1905 they were plentiful and well- organized. However, the more radical unionists had been criticising the Liberal's declining enthusiasm for progressive workplace reform and began to question whether the Liberal Party were truly the patrons of workplace legislation that had been supposed. This instigated increasing debate amongst unionists on the issue to separate themselves from the Liberals. The popular Richard Seddon had died and his successor, Sir Joseph Ward, was seen as aloof from labourers concerns. Questions of him came to a head when Ward announced his \\"rest from legislation\\", which eventually led to many former Liberal supporters leaving to join a new splinter party dedicated to the interests of labourers, the Independent Political Labour League (IPLL), formed in 1904. The breakdown of the alliance between organized labour and the Liberal Party was centred particularly around the right to strike, with Liberals still favouring the existing arbitration legislation. Unable to reconcile with the Liberal Party the organized labour set out to create its own separate political vehicle where the first hurdle was to unite the moderate and militant factions into a singular organisation. The 1912 conference A Unity Conference was called in Wellington for April 6, 1912, to endeavour to secure the industrial and, political union of all the Labour organisations in New Zealand. It was the brainchild of American socialist Walter Thomas Mills, of Milwaukee who was accused by the far-left as a \\"stalking-horse for the bourgeoisie\\". As a result, the New Zealand Socialist Party and many other radicals boycotted the conference. Those groups in attendance were representatives of the Trades and Labour Councils, branches of the New Zealand Labour Party, Trades Unions, Fabian Society, Land Values League, Young New Zealand Party, Students' Christian Association, and some other bodies. Up to that time the conference was the largest and most representative gathering of progressive forces which had ever met in New Zealand. Tom Paul of Dunedin occupied the conference chair whilst Dan Sullivan from Christchurch was appointed secretary. After a full week of discussion and deliberation an elaborate constitution and plan was agreed upon for a combined organisation of the political and industrial movement under the name of the United Labour Party (ULP). Jack McCullough argued successfully for the ULP to have a strong union element in the governing body of the party to prevent it being \\"captured by liberals and respectables\\" whilst remaining sufficiently inclusive. The new party adopted the symbol of clasped hands as its official badge as well as resolving to join the International Socialist Bureau as signs of unity. Despite the fact that the ULP received support from a very influential circle in New Zealand and had a large following at its genesis, it was apparent after a few months that a form of organisation which combined political and industrial machinery in one body was not likely to receive anything like unanimous endorsement which it desired. The lack of radical participation still further highlighted an absence of unity in the labour movement in New Zealand. The 1913 conference In July 1913, following a conference in January when a Unity Committee was set up, and an intensive campaign, a 'Basis of Unity' congress of delegates assembled in Wellington with a numerical record number of delegates in attendance. Mills, who was the principal organiser of the 1912 Unity Conference which formed the ULP and also of both the January and July gatherings in the following year, was again the architect of the event. In addition to an attendance of well over 300 delegates, members of the United Congress Committee (elected at the January Conference), Industrial Workers of the World and the executives of the New Zealand Federation of Labour, United Labour Party and the New Zealand Socialist Party were in attendance. Prominent Socialist leaders attended such as Harry Holland, Peter Fraser and Michael Joseph Savage (leaders of the Auckland branch), Frederick Cooke of Christchurch, and Paddy Webb from the West Coast. The Unity Congress was in session for ten days and it was more noteworthy for its psychological influence than for its direct accomplishment. The chairman of the meeting was John Rigg, whose contribution to the proceedings of the conference was labeled 'masterly' and of crucial importance. This conference recommended that the political and industrial wings should be separated and central organisations established for each. At this meeting the militant leaders made a concerted effort to conciliate the moderates, and showed themselves prepared to compromise on many fundamental issues. By substantial majorities the Congress affirmed the necessity for two distinct organisations the United Federation of Labour, later known as the 'Red Feds', as the industrial and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) as the political expression, It failed to unify all the factions, but its value was seen still as high given the added emphasis to the importance of unity. During the determination of the constitution and policy of the two, the balance of advantage lay with the militants, and large groups of the moderate sections then withdrew from the conference. Over the issue that \\"strikes should be effective when used, and under central control\\", a difference of opinion arose over this leading many moderates, including such notables as Sir George Fowlds, David McLaren, Tom Paul and Bill Veitch, to leave and resolve to themselves continue on with the ULP. The somewhat imperfect degree of the unity achieved, however, was soon jeopardised by the nationwide waterfront and miners strike of October 1913. To many moderates the conflict seemed a confirmation of their worst fears. The defeat of the strike by the Reform Government, after a bitter struggle, severely weakened the UFL (whose membership declined rapidly) and significantly handicapped the SDP, for the latter became indelibly associated in the public mind with revolutionary syndicalism. These events strengthened the reflections of the militants on the merits of political, as opposed to industrial, action. Thereafter a concerted effort was made to achieve the aims of organised labour through legislative means. Outcomes Following the defeat of labour in the 1913 Great Strike the ULP and SDP co-operated during the 1914 election campaign with neither party standing opposing candidates and supporting a jointly endorsed candidate in every contested electorate. The ULP and SDP MPs and labour-aligned independents soon worked together in Parliament, with Alfred Hindmarsh of the ULP selected as the unified caucus' chairman. In August 1915, when Prime Minister William Massey formed his Liberal-Reform wartime coalition government, he extended the invitation to Labour caucus. Hindmarsh declined the offer and, as a result, the Labour MPs became the effectual opposition in Parliament. This scenario continued until July 1916 when the ULP and SDP decided to formally merge to become the modern day Labour Party, with the mutual disapproval of conscription proving to be the belief that ultimately unified New Zealand's labour movement.
