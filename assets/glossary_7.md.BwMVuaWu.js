As its first Commandant, he is considered to be the father of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets and is the namesake of the University's oldest building, Lane Hall.  Early life  Lane was born in Mathews Court House, Virginia. He graduated from the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) in 1854 and received a master's degree from the University of Virginia in 1857. He was a professor of mathematics at VMI and then of natural philosophy at the North Carolina Military Institute until the start of the Civil War.Eicher, p. 338.  Civil War  Lane joined the Confederate Army and was commissioned as a major in the 1st North Carolina Volunteers on May 11, 1861. He participated in the Battle of Big Bethel and was made lieutenant colonel. Further promotion came quickly and he was a colonel and commander of the 28th North Carolina Infantry Regiment by September 15. In the Seven Days Battles of 1862 he was twice wounded leading his regiment. He served in Major General A.P. Hill's division of Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson's Second Corps for Second Bull Run and took over brigade command following the death of Brigadier General Lawrence O. Branch at the Battle of Antietam. He was promoted to brigadier general on November 1, 1862. It was soldiers of Lane's brigade that accidentally shot General Jackson as he returned from a nighttime scouting trip in front of the Confederate lines during the Battle of Chancellorsville. Lane's command became the 2nd Brigade in W. Dorsey Pender's division of Hill's Third Corps of the Army of Northern Virginia the following May, directly before the beginning of the Gettysburg Campaign. At the Battle of Gettysburg, Lane's brigade fought on the first day (July 1, 1863) and Lane briefly assumed command of Pender's division following that officer's mortal wounding on the second day. He was replaced in division command by Major General Isaac R. Trimble and returned to lead his brigade during Pickett's Charge, during which he was wounded when his horse was shot from under him. Over the three-day battle, his brigade suffered almost 50% casualties.Warner, p. 173. When Trimble was wounded in the attack, Lane resumed temporary command of the division. In 1864, Lane continued in brigade command, through the Overland Campaign and Siege of Petersburg. In June, at the Battle of Cold Harbor, he was wounded in the groin. In February and March 1865, he commanded Cadmus M. Wilcox's division. He continued to serve during the Appomattox Campaign, where he was paroled from Appomattox Court House after Robert E. Lee's surrender on April 9.  Postbellum career  Lane Hall circa 1888-89 Lane returned to academic life, as professor of civil engineering and commerce at Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College (VAMC)--founded in 1872, name changed to Virginia Polytechnic Institute (VPI) in 1896--and from 1881 until his death, professor of civil engineering and commandant at Alabama Polytechnic Institute, now known as Auburn University. Lane served as the first commandant of the Corps of Cadets at VAMC. Before resigning, he had an argument with President Charles Minor, who wanted the college to eliminate strict military restrictions. Lane died in Auburn, Alabama, and is interred there in Pine Hill Cemetery. Honors Lane Hall, originally known as Barracks No. 1, on the Virginia Tech campus is named for General Lane. The barracks housed 130 cadets until it was converted into academic offices in 1967. Built in 1888, Lane Hall is listed on the Virginia Landmarks Register and National Register of Historic Places.https://vtnews.vt.edu/articles/2015/01/012715-vpa-lanehallhistoric.html The Lane Residence Hall, a co-ed residence hall in the Lower Quad on the Auburn University campus is named for General Lane. A klavern based in Auburn, Alabama, that was in existence by 1923 was named after General Lane.http://www.collegiatetimes.com/news/when-the-klan-came-to- blacksburg/article_38fc985c-ed72-11e7-b444-bb4b6ea93bb4.html  See also  Notes  References  * Eicher, John H., and David J.

He was the son and successor of Vonones II (r. 51). He was succeeded by his younger son Pacorus II, who continued his policies.  Name  Vologases is the Greek and Latin form of the Parthian Walaga≈° (). The name is also attested in New Persian as BalƒÅsh and Middle Persian as WardƒÅkhsh (also spelled WalƒÅkhsh). The etymology of the name is unclear, although Ferdinand Justi proposes that Walaga≈°, the first form of the name, is a compound of words \\"strength\\" (var…ôda), and \\"handsome\\" (ga≈° or ge≈° in Modern Persian).  Background  Vologases was a son of Vonones II, a Parthian prince who ruled the northern Iranian kingdom of Media Atropatene, and possibly subsequently the whole Parthian Empire for a few months. Vologases' mother was a Greek concubine of the Parthian harem. The name of the Arsacid branch established by Vologases I has been coined by the modern historian Marek Jan Olbrycht as the \\"Vologasids\\" or the \\"House of Vologases I\\", which ruled the Parthian Empire from 51 till its fall in 224.  Reign =Invasion of Armenia Map of Parthian‚ÄìRoman borders Vologases became the new Parthian king in 51. He sought to continue the policies of the prominent former Parthian king Artabanus II (), and thus, one of his first objectives was to strengthen the bolster the Parthian position in strategically and politically unstable regions which had served for decades as the source of war with the Romans. He gave the kingship of Media Atropatene to his elder brother Pacorus, while the even more politically important kingship of Armenia was given to Vologases' younger brother Tiridates after a Parthian invasion of the country in 53.; ; Vologases felt his invasion was justified due to the recent usurpation of the Armenian throne by the Iberian prince Rhadamistus, which he saw as a violation of the former settlement made between the Parthians and Romans regarding Armenia. Lack of resources and a winter epidemic forced Vologases to withdraw his troops from Armenia, allowing Rhadamistus to come back and punish locals as traitors; they shortly revolted and helped Tiridates restore his authority.; Rhadamistus himself returned to Iberia and was soon put to death by his father Pharasmanes I for having plotted against the royal power in order to prove his loyalty to Rome.Tacitus, The Annals 13.37.  War with the Romans  Corbulo's invasion and conquest of Armenia Unhappy with the Parthian reconquest of Armenia, in 54 the newly ascended Roman emperor Nero sent his general, Corbulo to restore Roman authority in the country. Vologases was unable to aid his brother, due to the rebellion of his son Vardanes II and subsequently a revolt in the eastern Parthian province of Hyrcania. Supported by Vologases, Tiridates sent flying columns to raid the Romans far and wide in 58. Corbulo responded by using the same tactics. He also emboldened the Roman client-kings Antiochus IV of Commagene, Pharasmanes I, and the Moschi tribes to attack outlying areas of Armenia. The loyalty of the Armenian population was split up between the Parthians and Romans, although overall they preferred Parthian rule, due to it being more tolerant, and also due to the similarity between Parthian and Armenian culture. Corbulo conquered the Armenian capital of Artaxata, which he had destroyed. The following year (59) he conquered Tigranocerta in southern Armenia, where he wintered. Tiridates took advantage of this situation to return to northern Armenia from Atropatene. However, by the spring of 60, he was forced to withdraw by the Roman forces once more. Pateus Nero appointed a Cappadocian prince named Tigranes on the Armenian throne. The new ruler, protected by a strong Roman force, became bold and started in 61 attacking the border areas of Adiabene, a vassal kingdom of the Parthians. The Adiabenian king, Monobazos, including Tiridates, protested in front of the entire Parthian court, complaining that Vologases did not do enough to protect his subjects. This situation was important and endangered the relations between Vologases and his subjects. During a public feast, Vologases supported Tiridates' appeals, and placed the royal diadem on his head. He also appointed a certain nobleman named Monaeses as the commander of a Parthian force that included contingents from Adiabene.Tacitus, The Annals 15.2. Monaeses was sent into Armenia, where he besieged Tigranocerta in 62. The city was strongly fortified, and had been further reinforced by two legions. The Parthians attempts to scale the city proved fruitless, with the Adiabenian contingents suffering heavy losses. At this point, Corbulo sent an envoy to Vologases, who had encamped with his court at Nisibis, near Tigranocerta and the Roman‚ÄìParthian border. The failed siege and a shortage of fodder for his cavalry forced Vologases to agree to withdraw Monaeses from Armenia.Tacitus, The Annals 15.5. At the same time, however, the Romans also left Armenia, which, according to the contemporary Roman historian Tacitus, raised suspicions as to Corbulo's motives: some whispered that he had reached an agreement of mutual withdrawal with the Parthians, and that he was unwilling to risk his reputation by renewing hostilities against them.Tacitus, The Annals 15.6. At any rate, a truce was arranged and a Parthian embassy was dispatched to Rome. The negotiations failed to reach an agreement, and war was resumed in the spring of 62.Tacitus, The Annals 15.7. The Roman government then sent Lucius Caesennius Paetus, governor of Cappadocia, to settle the question by bringing Armenia under direct Roman administration. Tacitus, Annals, 15.1‚Äì6,Dio Cassius, 62.20 Paetus was an incapable commander and suffered a humiliating defeat at the Battle of Rhandeia in 62, losing the legions of XII Fulminata commanded by Calvisius Sabinus and IIII Scythica commanded by Lucius Funisulanus Vettonianus. The command of the troops was returned to Corbulo, who, the following year, led a strong army into Melitene and beyond into Armenia, eliminating all of the regional governors he suspected were pro-Parthian. Finally in Rhandeia, Corbulo and Tiridates I met to make a peace agreement. The location of Rhandeia suited both Tiridates I and Corbulo. It appealed to Tiridates I because that is where his army had beaten the Romans and sent them away under a capitulation; on the other hand, it appealed to Corbulo because he was about to wipe out the ill repute earned before in the same location. When Tiridates I arrived at the Roman camp he took off his royal diadem and placed it on the ground near a statue of Nero, agreeing to receive it back only from Nero in Rome. Tiridates I was recognized as the vassal king of Armenia; a Roman garrison would remain in the country permanently, in Sophene while Artaxata would be reconstructed. Corbulo left his son-in-law Lucius Annius Vinicianus to accompany Tiridates I to Rome in order to attest his own fidelity to Nero. After Tiridates' visit in Rome, Nero summoned Vologases I to Rome several times, but when the invitations became burdensome to Vologases I, he sent back a dispatch to this effect: \\"It is far easier for you than for me to traverse so great a body of water. Therefore, if you will come to Asia, we can then arrange to meet each other.\\"  Later life and death  However, Vologases I was still satisfied with this result and honored the memory of Nero,Suetonius Nero, p. 57 though he stood in good relations with Vespasian also, to whom he offered an army of 40,000 horse archers during the Jewish Revolt.Si Sheppard (2013). Osprey: The Jewish Revolt AD 66‚Äì74, p. 31. . Soon afterwards the Alans, a great nomadic tribe beyond the Caucasus, invaded Atropatene and Armenia; Vologases I applied in vain for help to Vespasian, but did not achieve any decisive result. The Alans quickly withdrew with a lot of booty after plundering Armenia and Media Atropatene.Josephus, Jewish Wars 7.8.4 Vologases I later died in 78, and was succeeded by his son Pacorus II.  Government = Coinage  Silver tetradrachm of Vologases I facing left, receiving diadem from one of the female Iranian deities (yazata) Anahita or Ashi,, standing with a sceptre. Vologases was the first Arsacid ruler to have the Parthian script and language appear on his minted coins alongside the now almost illegible Greek.; see also and However, the use of Greek-alphabet legends on Parthian coins remained until the collapse of the empire. On the reverse of his silver tetradrachms, he is being invested as king by a female deity, representing one of the female Iranian deities (yazata) Anahita or Ashi. Both of these deities are closely linked with the khvarenah (\\"Divine Glory\\") of the monarch.  Trade  Vologases sought to accomplish the goal of Artabanus II, by attempting to establish a long and structured trade-route that spanned through East Asia, India and the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. This planned long trade-route would greatly improve the economy of the Parthian Empire. In order to accomplish this, Vologases strengthened relations with other powers whom he was able to establish long-distance trade with, most notably Han China. Vologases sought to impose his authority over the trade revenue of Seleucia, and was unrelenting against the Greek elites who questioned his rule. Vologases founded the town of Valashabad in the neighborhood of Ctesiphon and Seleucia, with the intention of breaking the Greek monopoly on trade.  Zoroastrianism  Vologases is an important figure in Zoroastrianism. According to the 10th-century Middle Persian Zoroastrian document Denkard (\\"Acts of Religion\\"), Vologases ordered his subjects to safeguard variants of the Avestan books and schooling, which had been scattered due to raids and plundering by the Macedonian king Alexander the Great () in the 4th-century BC.

The grid was developed by Marc Amsler, a Swiss ophthalmologist. It is a diagnostic tool that aids in the detection of visual disturbances caused by changes in the retina, particularly the macula (e.g. macular degeneration, Epiretinal membrane), as well as the optic nerve and the visual pathway to the brain. Amsler grid usually help detecting defects in central 20 degrees of the visual field. In the test, the person looks with each eye separately at the small dot in the center of the grid. Patients with macular disease may see wavy lines or some lines may be missing. Amsler grids are supplied by ophthalmologists, optometrists or from web sites, and may be used to test one's vision at home. The original Amsler grid was black and white. A color version with a blue and yellow grid is more sensitive and can be used to test for a wide variety of visual pathway abnormalities, including those associated with the retina, the optic nerve, and the pituitary gland. History In 1869, Jacob Hermann Knapp described scotoma and metamorphopsia in traumatic maculopathy with choroidal rupture using horizontal lines.Similarly in 1874, Richard Forster demonstrated metamorphopsia using a square grid. Swiss ophthalmologist Marc Amsler described the Amsler grid in the year 1945. It was the first functional test proposed to evaluate metamorphopsia. He may got the idea of the grid from Edmund Landolt, who used a similar small card with a grid pattern to be kept in the center of the visual field testing instrument perimeter. Clinical significance age related macular degeneration Amsler grid can be used in detecting central visual field defects in following conditions: * Age-related macular degeneration: The grid will help detecting the progression of AMD from dry form to wet form. Chance of metamorphopsia is more in wet AMD compared to dry form. * Choroidal neovascular membranes: Choroidal neovascular membranes cause scotoma and metamophopsia. It may be associated with many diseases like macular degeneration, POHS, myopic macular degeneration, trauma etc. * Central serous chorioretinopathy: CSCR Causes round or oval scotoma. * Macular pucker: Macular pucker also known as an epiretinal membrane cause metamorphopsia and distortions in central field of vision. * Cystoid macular edema: Due to macular edema, micropsia may occur. * Glaucoma: Amsler grid is useful in detecting central field defects in moderate to severe glaucoma. * Macular sparing: Amsler Grid can be used to detect and accurately measure macular sparing. Types Amsler grid, Chart 1 There are 7 types of amsler grid charts. All the charts measures 10 cm √ó 10 cm in size, which can be used to measure central 20 degree visual field when kept at a distance of 33 cm from the eye. Chart 1 Chart 1 is the basic version, which is the most familiar and widely used chart among all the charts. In this chart the grid consists of 0.5 cm squares (each for 1¬∞ visual field), which totally measures 10 cm X 10 cm size. Most commonly grid is in white color with black background. Grid with black lines in white background is also available (see infobox picture). Chart 2 Chart 2 is similar to chart 1, but it has diagonal cross lines, which assist correct fixation in case of central scotoma. Chart 3 Chart 3 is also identical to chart 1, but color is red on black. Stimulating long wavelength foveal cones, this type of chart may help in detecting color scotomas and desaturation which may occur in toxic maculopathies, toxic optic neuropathies and pituitary tumors etc. Chart 4 Chart 4 has no lines, only a random pattern of white dots in black background. It was intended to differentiate areas of scotoma and metamorphosia. Chart 5 Chart 5 has central white dot and horizontal white lines on black background 5mm apart, which allow detecting metamorphopsia. Chart 6 Chart 6 is similar to chart 5, but lines and central dot is in black on white background. The lines near to fixation points are closer than the chart 5. Chart 7 Chart 7 is similar to chart 1, but central squires are further divided to make 0.5 degree squires. Procedure * Before starting the test, patient's near and distance vision should be corrected to normal. If the patient is wearing spectacles, testing should be done with glasses only. * In a well illuminated room, ask the patient to hold the grid 12 to 15 inches away from the face. * Ask to cover one eye with hand or occluder and look directly at the center black dot. * While looking directly at the center dot, and observe the grid. If any lines or areas look blurry, wavy, dark or blank mark that area in chart and consult ophthalmologist. * Follow the same steps with the other eye. * Always remember to keep the Amsler‚Äôs Chart at the same distance from the eyes each time you test. * This test can be self done at home also.

Bituminous shale was mined there. Because of its abundance of fossils, it has significant geological and scientific importance. After almost becoming a landfill, strong local resistance eventually stopped these plans and the Messel Pit was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site on 9 December 1995. Significant scientific discoveries are still being made and the site has increasingly become a tourist site as well.  History  Outcrop of the Messel oil shale near the center of the pit Brown coal and later oil shale was actively mined from 1859. The pit first became known for its wealth of fossils around 1900, but serious scientific excavation only started around the 1970s, when falling oil prices made mining the quarry uneconomical. Commercial oil shale mining ceased in 1971 and a cement factory built in the quarry failed the following year. The land was slotted for use as a landfill, but the plans came to nought and the Hessian state bought the site in 1991 to secure scientific access. In the few years between the end of mining and 1974, when the state began preparing the site for garbage disposal, amateur collectors were allowed to collect fossils. The amateurs developed the \\"transfer technique\\" that enabled them to preserve the fine details of small fossils, the method still employed in preserving the fossils today. Due to the extraordinary fossils, the pit was declared a UNESCO world heritage site in 1995, one of the few sites that have ever been placed on the list exclusively due to fossils.Mayer, E., (1994): Nomination of Messel Pit for inclusion in the UNESCO World Heritage List. Hessian Minister of State for Science and Arts, Messel Many of the known specimens from the site have come from amateur collectors and in 1996, an amnesty on previously collected fossils was put in effect, in the hope of getting privately owned collections back into public ownership and available to science.

Pit fossil site, Germany article 47 million years ago in the Eocene when the Messel deposits formed, the area was 10¬∞ further south than it is now. The period was very close to the Paleocene‚ÄìEocene Thermal Maximum and the climate and ecology of the site were very different. A large series of lakes, surrounded by lush sub-tropical forests supported an incredible diversity of life. The Messel lake bed was probably a center point for drainage from nearby rivers and creeks. A fossil of the primitive mammal Kopidodon, showing outline of fur The pit deposits were formed during the Eocene Epoch of the Paleogene Period about 47 million years ago, based on dating of basalt fragments underlying fossilbearing strata.Mertz, D. F., Renne, P. R. (2005): A numerical age for the Messel fossil deposit (UNESCO World Heritage Site) derived from / dating on a basaltic rock fragment. Courier Forschungsinstitut Senckenberg no 255: pp 7‚Äì75. Oil shale, formed by the slow anoxic deposition of mud and dead vegetation on the lake bed, is the primary rock at the site. Its sediments extend downward and lie atop an older sandstone foundation. The fossils within the shale show a remarkable clarity and preservation due to the unique depositional characteristics of the lake and so the Messel pit represents a Konservat-Lagerst√§tte. The upper stratifications of the lake most certainly supported a variety of organisms, but the bottom was subject to little disturbance by current, spawning a very anoxic environment. This prevented many epifaunal and infaunal species from inhabiting this niche and thus bioturbation was kept at a minimum. Overturn of the lake layers (caused by seasonal variations) lowered oxygen content near the surface and led to a periodic \\"die-off\\" of aquatic species. Combined with a relatively low rate of deposition, per year, this provided a prime environment for the preservation of fauna and flora.  Volcanic gas releases  The area around the Messel Pit is believed to have been geologically and tectonically active during the Eocene. Leading scientists hypothesize that events much like the 1986 volcanic gas releases at Lake Nyos, Cameroon, could account for the large deposition of non-aquatic species (Franzen & Koster, 1994). Periodic subsurface shifts possibly released large concentrations of reactive gases (such as carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide) into the lake and adjoining ecosystems, killing susceptible organisms. During these releases, birds and bats might have fallen in if near the lake surface and terrestrials could be overwhelmed when near the lake shore. Since the lake was very deep, animals that fell in it drifted downwards into oxygen- and bacteria-poor water, where they were preserved remarkably well, being overlaid by successive layers of mud that petrified later, thus producing an aggregation of fossils of exceptional quality, quantity, integrity, and variety. However, other hypotheses have been postulated as well, and have suggested a Cyanobacteria bloom origin resulting in the poisoning of the animals. This last one was considered to be necessary in order to explain the occurrence of excellent fossils throughout the entire sedimentary sequence (Koenigswald & others, 2004).  Fossils  Splitting the shale with a large knife to reveal fossils The Messel Pit provides the best preserved evidence of Geiseltalian flora and fauna so far discovered. Most other sites are lucky to contain partial skeletons, but Messel boasts extensive preservation of structural integrity, even going so far as to preserve the fur, feathers and \\"skin shadows\\" of some species. Unusual preservation has sparked some closely reasoned interpretations. The symptomatic \\"dumb-bell\\"-shaped bite marks on either side of the leaf vein on a fossilised leaf have been identified as the death-grip of a carpenter ant terminally parasitized by the fungus Ophiocordyceps unilateralis, that, apparently then as today, commandeered its behavior, in order to release its spores from a favourable location; it is the earliest concrete sample of fungal behavioural manipulation.Guardian.com, \\"'Zombie ants' controlled by parasitic fungus for 48 m years\\", 18 August 2010]: accessed 21 August 2010 The diversity of species is remarkable partly as a result of the hypothesized periodic gas releases. A brief summary of some of the fossils found at the site follows: * Early primate fossils * Nine mating pairs of fossil turtles have been found. The turtles, Allaeochelys crassesculpta, were in coitus (in the act of having sex).Amos, Jonathan 2012. Turtles fossilised in sex embrace. BBC News: Science & Environment. They are male-female pairs, with the male's tail tucked under the female, which is how they copulate. Their death must have been rapid. It is supposed that the turtles had started mating in the aerated surface waters of the ancient lake. As they sank into deeper water, they were overcome by the release of toxic volcanic gas. They were then buried in the lakebed sediment. Turtles belonging to this clade are still living. They have lost their reptilian scales, and their skin absorbs oxygen from the water. Normally, this is an advantage: it helps them stay submerged for long periods. However, under anoxic conditions it is a disadvantage, because carbon dioxide and dissolved poisons are absorbed as well. * Over 10,000 fossilized fish of numerous species * Thousands of aquatic and terrestrial insects, some with distinct coloration still preserved * Innumerable small mammals including pygmy horses, large mice, primates, ground dwellers (hedgehogs, marsupials, pangolins), aardvark relatives and bats. * Large numbers of birds, particularly predatory species. * Crocodiles, frogs, turtles, salamanders and other reptiles or amphibians * Remains of over 30 distinct plant species, including palm leaves, fruits, pollen, wood, walnuts and grapevines The following is only a partial list: Darwinius masillae (holotype) showing the remarkable preservation at Messel Masillamys at the Senckenberg collection Early perch Palaeoperca proxima (structural) colour of the exoskeleton  Mammals  :Darwinius masillae, identified in 2009 as an adapiform primate :Kopidodon, an extinct arboreal cimolestan :Leptictidium, an extinct omnivorous hopping mammal (of the leptictid family) :Propalaeotherium, an early relative of horses :Ailuravus, a rodent :Peradectes, a metatherian :Palaeochiropteryx, a bat :Lesmesodon, a small hyaenodontid :Eomanis, an early pangolin :Eurotamandua, a scaleless, anteater-like pangolin :Europolemur, a primate :Hyrachyus, ancestor of rhinoceroses :Paroodectes, an early carnivorous mammal :Pholidocercus, an early hedgehog :Macrocranion, an early long-tailed hedgehog :Masillamys, an early rodent :Messelobunodon, an early artiodactyl :Godinotia, an early primate :Buxolestes, a semiaquatic, otter- like cimolestan  Birds  :Palaeotis, an early struthionid :Strigogyps sapea (formerly Aenigmavis) a cariamiform :Eocoracias, an early coraciiform with known coloration :Messelornis, the Messel-bird; a species of gruiform :Masillastega, a freshwater sulid :Lapillavis, a possible trogonid relative :Cypseloramphus, a basal apodiform :The Messelasturidae (Messelastur and Tynskya), carnivorous relatives of modern parrots :Palaeoglaux, an early owl with enigmatic breast feathers :Paraprefica, an early potoo :Paraortygoides, a galliform :Masillaraptor, an early falconiform :Parargornis, an early apodiform :Messelirrisor, a tiny bucerotiform closely related to hoopoes and wood-hoopoes :Selmes (an anagram of \\"Messel\\"), a mousebird with stubby toes :Gastornis (formerly Diatryma), a large, flightless anseriform :Hassiavis,http://www.senckenberg.de/files/content/forschung/abteilung/terrzool/ornithologie/hassiavis.pdf a member of Cypselomorphae :Quasisyndactylus, a member of Alcediniformes :Vanolimicola, a possible charadriiform :A currently unnamed lithornithid, a sandpiper-like paleognath, the first record of its kind in Middle Eocene Europe.

Under the Basic Law of Hong Kong, it exercises the judicial power of the Region and is independent of the executive and legislative branches of the Government. The courts in Hong Kong hear and adjudicate all prosecutions and civil disputes, including all public and private law matters. It is fundamental to the Hong Kong legal system that members of the judiciary are independent of the executive and legislative branches. The courts of law in Hong Kong comprise the Court of Final Appeal, the High Court (which includes the Court of Appeal and the Court of First Instance), the District Court, the Magistrates' Courts, and other special courts and tribunals set up by law. The Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal is head of the judiciary and assisted in his administrative duties by the Judiciary Administrator. A bilingual court system in which Chinese, English or both can be used was put in place, in accordance with the requirement of the Basic Law.  The Court of Final Appeal  Statue of Themis on the Court of Final Appeal Building. It was established on 1 July 1997 upon the commencement of the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Ordinance to safeguard the rule of law after 30 June 1997. It replaced the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London as the highest appellate court of Hong Kong, The Court comprises five judges ‚Äî the Chief Justice, three permanent judges and one non- permanent judge from Hong Kong or another common law jurisdiction. There is a panel of eight non-permanent Hong Kong judges and nine non-permanent judges from other common law jurisdictions.  The High Court  The High Court was established by the High Court Ordinance (Chapter 4, formerly titled the Supreme Court Ordinance), as the \\"Supreme Court of Hong Kong\\". It was renamed the \\"High Court\\" by Article 81 of the Basic Law of Hong Kong. It consists of the Court of Appeal and Court of First Instance (formally \\"The High Court of Justice\\"), both are superior courts of record. The Court of Appeal Admiralty It hears appeals on civil and criminal matters from the Court of First Instance and the District Court, as well as appeals from the Lands Tribunal. It also makes rulings on questions of law referred to it by the lower courts. There are 10 Justices of Appeal, including the Chief Judge of the High Court and three Vice-Presidents.  The Court of First Instance  It has unlimited jurisdiction in both civil and criminal matters. It also exercises jurisdiction in admiralty, bankruptcy, company winding-up, family, adoption, probate and mental health matters. The most serious criminal offences, such as murder, manslaughter, rape, armed robbery, complex commercial frauds and drug offences involving large quantities, are tried by a judge of the Court of First Instance, sitting with a jury consisting of seven or, when a judge so orders, nine. There are approximately 42 Judges and Deputy Judges of the Court of First Instance.  The District Court  The location of courts in Hong Kong The District Court, established in 1953, is the intermediate court of Hong Kong. It has limited jurisdiction in both civil and criminal matters. With effect from 3 December 2018, it has civil jurisdiction to hear monetary claims up to $3 million; or where the claims are for the recovery of land, of which the annual rent or rateable value does not exceed $320,000. In its criminal jurisdiction, the court may try the more serious cases, with the main exceptions of murder, manslaughter and rape. The maximum term of imprisonment it may impose is seven years. There are one Chief District Judge and 30 District Judges, among which three District Judges sit in the Family Court and two District Judges sit in the Lands Tribunal as Presiding Officers.  Forms of Address  District Judges are always referred to directly in court as \\"Your Honour\\", and indirectly (orally or in writing) as \\"His/Her Honour Judge ...\\". The Chief District Judge may be referred to in writing by adding the post-nominal \\"CDJ\\" and the Principal Family Court Judge by adding the post-nominal \\"PFCJ\\". Other District Court Judges are referred to in writing by adding the pre-nominal \\"HHJ ...\\". Deputy District Court Judges may be referred to directly in court as \\"Your Honour\\" but indirectly (orally or in writing) they are referred to as \\"Deputy District Judge ...\\".  Family Court  The Family Court is a division of the District Court which is assigned by the Chief Justice to deal with Family cases. Under section 10A of the Matrimonial Causes Ordinance (Cap.179), all family and matrimonial proceedings commence in the District Court (and are assigned to the Family Court). A Family judge may transfer a case to the High Court if it involves high monetary value claims and/or highly complex matters of fact or law. By section 10A(3) of the Matrimonial Causes Ordinance, the Family Court may exercise jurisdiction exceeding the District Court's monetary limits.  The Magistrates' Courts  Fanling Magistrates' Court Magistrates exercise criminal jurisdiction over a wide range of offences. Although there is a general limit of two years imprisonment or a fine of $100,000, certain statutory provisions give Magistrates the power to sentence up to three years imprisonment and to impose a fine up to $5,000,000. Prosecution of all indictable offences commences in the Magistrates' Courts, the Secretary for Justice may apply to have a case transferred to the District Court or committed to the Court of First Instance of the High Court depending on the seriousness of a case. There are approximately 70 Magistrates, sitting in various Tribunals and seven Magistrates' Courts: Eastern, Kowloon City, Kwun Tong, West Kowloon, Sha Tin, Fanling and Tuen Mun. A Principal Magistrate is in charge of each magistracy. The Chief Magistrate, whose chamber is at the Kowloon City Law Courts Building, oversees the work of all magistracies. The most junior judicial role is that of Special Magistrate, typically dealing only with minor offences such as hawking contraventions, traffic offences and other departmental summonses. Appeals against Magistrates‚Äô decisions are heard by a Judge of the Court of First Instance.  Forms of Address  The magistrate are always referred to in court as \\"Sir\\" or \\"Madam\\" or \\"Your Worship\\". Barristers do not generally use the latter to refer to magistrates. In this context, the phrase \\"Your Worship\\" is not derived from any religious meaning but from the old English word meaning 'worthy of respect'. The Chief Magistrate may be referred to in writing by adding the post-nominal \\"CM\\", and the Principal Magistrates (presiding over a particular magistrates' court) may be referred to in writing by adding the post-nominal \\"PM\\".  The Juvenile Court  Courts exercising juvenile jurisdiction are constituted, as the need arises, under the Juvenile Offenders Ordinance (Cap.226) and other statutes. A juvenile court has exclusive jurisdiction to hear charges against children (aged under 14) and young persons (aged between 14 and 16) for any offence other than homicide. Children under 10 are exempted from criminal responsibility. It also has power to deal with care and protection cases involving young people aged up to 18. A permanent magistrate may sit as a juvenile court and special procedures apply. The magistrate explains the alleged offence to the child or young person in simple language and provides assistance to the defendant in the conduct of the case. Press coverage of the proceedings in juvenile court is restricted, preventing disclosure of the identity of the defendant. The Juvenile Court sits in the Eastern, Kowloon City, West Kowloon, Fanling and Tuen Mun Magistrates‚Äô Courts.  Special courts and tribunals = The Coroner‚Äôs Court  Coroners are empowered to investigate unnatural or suspicious deaths occurring in Hong Kong (and deaths occurring outside Hong Kong if the body is found within Hong Kong). Except when death occurs while the individual is in custody, or the Secretary for Justice directs, the Coroner decides whether or not to hold an inquest with or without a jury. The inquest is mandatory with a jury where the death occurs in custody. The main purpose of an inquest is to ascertain the cause of and the circumstances connected with the death. If appropriate, a Coroner or a jury may make recommendations designed to prevent the recurrence of the fatality under investigation. The Court is situated at West Kowloon Law Courts Building.  The Lands Tribunal  One of the important functions of the Lands Tribunal is to adjudicate claims by landlords for possession of premises, the tenancies or sub-tenancies of which are under the Landlord and Tenant (Consolidation) Ordinance (Cap. 7). Starting from 9 July 2004, the Tribunal also has power to adjudicate claims for possession of premises, the tenancies or sub-tenancies of which have expired by effluxion of time even when they are outside the said Ordinance. The Tribunal also has power to grant consequential relief. Another widely used jurisdiction of this Tribunal is to determine building management disputes. Such disputes arise from, among others, the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of the Building Management Ordinance (Cap. 344) and deeds of mutual covenant, the appointment or dissolution of management committees, requisitions for owners' meetings and appointment of building management agent. The Tribunal also has unlimited jurisdiction to determine the amount of compensation payable by the Government to a person whose land has been compulsorily resumed or has suffered a reduction in value because of public developments. The Tribunal can also order the sale of land for redevelopment purpose under the Land (Compulsory Sale for Redevelopment) Ordinance (Cap. 545). The Tribunal also exercises appellate jurisdiction over (i) determinations by the Commissioner of Rating and Valuation under the Rating Ordinance (Cap. 116); (ii) determinations by the Director of Lands under the Government Rent (Assessment and Collection) Ordinance (Cap. 515); and (iii) determinations by the Director of Housing under the Housing Ordinance (Cap. 283). In exercising its jurisdiction, the Tribunal has the same powers to grant remedies and relief, legal or equitable, as the Court of First Instance of the High Court. Parties may appoint counsel or solicitors to appear before the Tribunal or, as is often the case, they may appear in person. The tribunal has a President who is a Judge of the Court of First Instance. There are currently two Presiding Officers who are District Judges, and three members.  The Labour Tribunal  The Labour Tribunal on 36 Gascoigne Road, Kowloon The Labour Tribunal was set up in 1973 to provide a quick, inexpensive and informal procedure for adjudicating disputes between employees and employers. It deals with claims arising out of a breach of a contract of employment. Claims may include wages in lieu of notice, arrears of wages, statutory holiday pay, annual leave pay, sickness allowance, maternity leave pay, bonus/double pay, severance pay, and long service payments. Claimants can also seek orders for reinstatement or re-engagement; for awards of compensation or terminal payments. Proceedings are mostly conducted in Cantonese before a Presiding Officer. Legal representation is not allowed. Any party aggrieved may appeal on a point of law to the Court of First Instance. There are approximately 8 Presiding Officers, including one Principal Presiding Officer. The tribunal is located at the South Kowloon Law Courts Building in Gascoigne Road. No statistics are provided by the Judiciary on actual waiting times from filing of a claim to first day of trial or ultimate resolution.  The Market Misconduct Tribunal  The Market Misconduct Tribunal (MMT) was established in 2003 under the provisions contained in the SFO. In accordance with the SFO, if it appears to the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) that market misconduct or a breach of a disclosure requirement under Part XIVA of the SFO has or may have taken place, the SFC may institute proceedings before the MMT. The MMT has jurisdiction to hear and determine any question or issue arising out of or in connection with the proceedings instituted under the SFO.  The Small Claims Tribunal  The Small Claims Tribunal was established in 1976. It deals with monetary claims arising from contract or tort, involving amounts not exceeding $75,000. Hearings are informal and usually conducted in Cantonese. Legal representation is not allowed. Parties may authorise a representative (other than a lawyer) to appear in court. Any party aggrieved by the decision of an Adjudicator may appeal on a point of law to the Court of First Instance. There are approximately nine Adjudicators, including a Principal Adjudicator. The Small Claims Tribunal is situated at West Kowloon Law Courts Building.  The Obscene Articles Tribunal  The Control of Obscene and Indecent Articles Ordinance came into force in 1987 providing for the establishment of the Obscene Articles Tribunal. The work of this tribunal covers two main aspects. Firstly, it is responsible for the classification of articles submitted by any public officer, author, printer, manufacturer, publisher, distributor, copyright owner etc. Secondly, the tribunal has exclusive jurisdiction to determine the question of obscenity or indecency when this issue arises in any civil or criminal proceedings in any court. The Obscene Articles Tribunal consists of a Magistrate and two or more lay adjudicators. Lay adjudicators are selected from a panel consisting of members of the public. The tribunal is situated at West Kowloon Law Courts Building.  Appointment of Judges and Judicial Officers  Judges and judicial officers are appointed by the Chief Executive of the HKSAR after receiving secret advice and recommendations from the Judicial Officers Recommendation Commission. The scope of appointees covers all those who preside over the Court of Final Appeal, Court of Appeal, Court of First Instance, District Court, Family Court, Magistrates' Courts, Lands Tribunal, Labour Tribunal, Small Claims Tribunal, Coroners' Courts and Competition Tribunal. The commission is a statutory body established under the Judicial Officers Recommendation Commission Ordinance and composed of the Chief Justice, Secretary for Justice (themselves appointed to office by the Chief Executive) and seven others appointed by the Chief Executive of the HKSAR: two judges, one barrister, one solicitor and three other persons unconnected with legal practice. Appointed members serve terms of two years and can be re-appointed for further terms. Decisions are made with a maximum of two dissenters on any vote. Apart from providing a certificate or testimonial in respect of a candidate, provision of any other unsolicited information to any member is likely to be considered an attempt to influence that member's deliberation and result in criminal prosecution and imprisonment for two years.  Judges of the Supreme Court Hong Kong judges wear British- style outfits, including wigs made of horsehair, with white gloves, girdles and scarlet-coloured robes added for official ceremonies.\\"Day in pictures.\\" BBC. 17 February 2005. In the lower courts, magistrates are addressed as \\"your Worship\\", \\"Sir\\" or \\"Madam\\", and district court judges as \\"your Honour\\". In the superior courts of record, namely the Court of Final Appeal and the High Court (which consists of the Court of Appeal and the Court of First Instance), judges are addressed as \\"my Lord\\" or \\"my Lady\\" and referred to as \\"your Lordship\\" or \\"your Ladyship\\", following the English tradition. Masters of the High Court are addressed as \\"Master\\". When trials are conducted in Chinese, judges were addressed, in Cantonese, as Faat Gwoon Dai Yan (Ê≥ïÂÆòÂ§ß‰∫∫, \\"Judge, your Lordship\\") before the transfer of sovereignty from the United Kingdom to China, and as Faat Gwoon Gok Ha (Ê≥ïÂÆòÈñ£‰∏ã, \\"Judge, your Honour\\") since 1997. For the Court of Final Appeal, the post-nominal letters CJ are used for the chief justice, PJ for permanent judges and NPJ for non-permanent judges; in the High Court, CJHC for the chief judge, JA for justices of appeal and J for full judges of the Court of First Instance. There is no similar form for the many deputy judges or the registrar of the High Court or for judicial officers of lower courts. { class=\\"prettytable\\" ----- bgcolor=\\"#FFFF99\\"  width=\\"25%\\"  Name  width=\\"30%\\"  Appointment ----- John Walter Hulme  1844Ôºç1860G.

Overview Virtual DOS machines can operate either exclusively through typical software emulation methods (e.g. dynamic recompilation) or can rely on the virtual 8086 mode of the Intel 80386 processor, which allows real mode 8086 software to run in a controlled environment by catching all operations which involve accessing protected hardware and forwarding them to the normal operating system (as exceptions). The operating system can then perform an emulation and resume the execution of the DOS software. VDMs generally also implement support for running 16- and 32-bit protected mode software (DOS extenders), which has to conform to the DOS Protected Mode Interface (DPMI). When a DOS program running inside a VDM needs to access a peripheral, Windows will either allow this directly (rarely), or will present the DOS program with a virtual device driver (VDD) which emulates the hardware using operating system functions. A VDM will systematically have emulations for the Intel 8259A interrupt controllers, the 8254 timer chips, the 8237 DMA controller, etc. Concurrent DOS 8086 emulation mode In January 1985 Digital Research together with Intel previewed Concurrent DOS 286 1.0, a version of Concurrent DOS capable of running real mode DOS programs in the 80286's protected mode. The method devised on B-1 stepping processor chips, however, in May 1985 stopped working on the C-1 and subsequent processor steppings shortly before Digital Research was about to release the product. Although with the E-1 stepping Intel started to address the issues in August 1985, so that Digital Research's \\"8086 emulation mode\\" worked again utilizing the undocumented LOADALL processor instruction, it was too slow to be practical. Microcode changes for the E-2 stepping improved the speed again. This early implementation can be seen as a predecessor to actual virtual DOS machines. Eventually, Concurrent DOS 286 was reworked from a potential desktop operating system to become FlexOS 286 for industrial use in 1986. It was also licensed by IBM for their 4680 OS in 1986. When Intel's 80386 with its virtual 8086 mode became available (as samples since October 1985 and in quantities since June 1986), Digital Research switched to use this to run real mode DOS programs in virtual DOS machines in protected mode under Concurrent DOS 386 1.0 (February 1987) and FlexOS 386 1.0 (June 1987). However, the architecture of these multiuser multitasking protected mode operating systems was not DOS-based by themselves. Concurrent DOS 386 was later developed to become Multiuser DOS (since 1991) and REAL/32 (since 1995). FlexOS 386 later became 4690 OS in 1993. DOS-based VDMs In contrast to these protected mode operating systems, DOS, by default, is a real-mode operating system, switching to protected mode and virtual 86 mode only on behalf of memory managers and DOS extenders in order to provide access to extended memory or map in memory into the first megabyte, which is accessible to normal DOS programs. DOS-based VDMs appeared with Microsoft's Windows/386 2.01 in September 1987. DOS-based virtual DOS machines were also present in Windows 3.0, 3.1x and Windows for Workgroups 3.1x running in 386 Enhanced Mode as well as in Windows 95, 98, 98 SE and ME. One of the characteristics of these solutions running on top of DOS is that the memory layout shown inside virtual DOS machines are virtual instances of the DOS system and DOS driver configuration run before the multitasker is loaded, and that requests which cannot be handled in protected mode are passed down into the system domain to be executed by the underlying DOS system. Similar to Windows 3.x 386 Enhanced Mode in architecture, EMM386 3.xx of Novell DOS 7, Caldera OpenDOS 7.01, DR-DOS 7.02 (and later) also uses DOS-based VDMs to support pre-emptive multitasking of multiple DOS applications, when the \`EMM386 /MULTI\` option is used. This component has been under development at Digital Research / Novell since 1991 under the codename \\"Vladivar\\" (originally a separate device driver \`KRNL386.SYS\` instead of a module of EMM386). While primarily developed for the next major version of DR DOS, released as Novell DOS 7 in 1994, it was also used in the never released DR DOS \\"Panther\\" and \\"Star Trek\\" project in 1992/1993. OS/2 MVDM VDMs called MVDM (Multiple Virtual DOS Machine) are used in OS/2 2.0 and later since 1992. OS/2 MVDMs are considerably more powerful than NTVDM. For example, block devices are supported, and various DOS versions can be booted into an OS/2 MVDM. While the OS/2 1.x DOS box was based on DOS 3.0, OS/2 2.x MVDMs emulate DOS 5.0. Seamless integration of Windows 3.1 and later Win32s applications in OS/2 is a concept looking similar on surface to the seamless integration of XP Mode based on Windows Virtual PC in Windows 7. A redirector in a \\"guest\\" VDM or NTVDM allows access on the disks of the OS/2 or NT \\"host\\". Applications in a \\"guest\\" can use named pipes for communication with their \\"host\\". Due to a technical limitation, DOS and 16-bit Windows applications under OS/2 were unable to see more than 2GB of hard drive space, this was fixed in ArcaOS 5.0.4. Windows NTVDM COMMAND.COM running in the NTVDM of Windows 8 NTVDM is a system component of all IA-32 editions of the Windows NT family since 1993 which allows execution of 16-bit Windows and 16-bit / 32-bit DOS applications. It is not included with 64-bit versions. The Windows NT 32-bit user-mode executable which forms the basis for a single DOS (or Windows 3.x) environment is called \`ntvdm.exe\`. In order to execute DOS programs, NTVDM loads \`NTIO.SYS\` which in turn loads \`NTDOS.SYS\`, which executes a modified \`COMMAND.COM\` in order to run the application that was passed to NTVDM as command-line argument. The 16-bit real-mode system files are stripped down derivations of their MS-DOS 5.0 equivalents \`IO.SYS\`, \`MSDOS.SYS\` and \`COMMAND.COM\` with all hard-wired assumptions on the FAT file system removed and using the invalid opcode 0xC4 0xC4 to bop down into the 32-bit NTVDM to handle the requests. Originally, NTDOS reported a DOS version of 30.00 to programs, but this was soon changed to report a version of 5.00 at \`INT 21h/AH=30h\` and 5.50 at \`INT 21h/AX=3306h\` to allow more programs to run unmodified. This holds true even in the newest releases of Windows; many additional MS-DOS functions and commands introduced in MS-DOS versions 6.x and in Windows 9x are missing. 16-bit Windows applications by default all run in their own thread within a single NTVDM process. Although NTVDM itself is a 32-bit process and pre-emptively multitasked with respect to the rest of the system, the 16-bit applications within it are cooperatively multitasked with respect to each other. When the \\"Run in separate memory space\\" option is checked in the Run box or the application's shortcut file, each 16-bit Windows application gets its own NTVDM process and is therefore pre-emptively multitasked with respect to other processes, including other 16-bit Windows applications. NTVDM emulates BIOS calls and tables as well as the Windows 3.1 kernel and 16-bit API stubs. The 32-bit WoW translation layer thunks 16-bit API routines. 32-bit DOS emulation is present for DOS Protected Mode Interface (DPMI) and 32-bit memory access. This layer converts the necessary extended and expanded memory calls for DOS functions into Windows NT memory calls. \`wowexec.exe\` is the emulation layer that emulates 16-bit Windows. Windows 2000 and Windows XP added Sound Blaster 2.0 emulation. 16-bit virtual device drivers and DOS block device drivers (e.g., RAM disks) are not supported. Inter-process communication with other subsystems can take place through OLE, DDE and named pipes. Since virtual 8086 mode is not available on non-x86-based processors (more specifically, MIPS, DEC Alpha, and PowerPC) NTVDM was instead implemented as a full emulator in these versions of NT, using code licensed from Insignia's SoftPC. Up to Windows NT 3.51, only 80286 emulation was available. With Windows NT 4.0, 486 emulation was added. Commands The following list of commands is part of the Windows XP MS-DOS subsystem. * APPEND * DEBUG * EDIT * EDLIN * EXE2BIN * FASTOPEN * FORCEDOS * GRAPHICS * LOADFIX * LOADHIGH (LH) * MEM * NLSFUNC * SETVER * SHARE Security issue In January 2010, Google security researcher Tavis Ormandy revealed a serious security flaw in Windows NT's VDM implementation that allowed unprivileged users to escalate their privileges to SYSTEM level, noted as applicable to the security of all x86 versions of the Windows NT kernel since 1993. This included all 32-bit versions of Windows NT, 2000, XP, Server 2003, Vista, Server 2008, and Windows 7. Ormandy did publish a proof-of-concept exploit for the vulnerability. Prior to Microsoft's release of a security patch, the workaround for this issue was to turn off 16-bit application support, which prevented older programs (those written for DOS and Windows 3.1) from running. 64-bit versions of Windows were not affected since NTVDM subsystem is not installed by default. Once the Microsoft security patches had been applied to the affected operating systems the VDM could be safely reenabled. Limitations A limitation exists in the Windows XP 16-bit subsystem (but not in earlier versions of Windows NT) because of the raised per-session limit for GDI objects which causes GDI handles to be shifted to the right by two bits, when converting them from 32 to 16 bits. As a result, the actual handle cannot be larger than 14 bits and consequently 16-bit applications that happen to be served a handle larger than 16384 by the GDI system crash and terminate with an error message. In an x86-64 CPU, virtual 8086 mode is available as a sub-mode only in its legacy mode (for running 16- and 32-bit operating systems), not in the native, 64-bit long mode. The NTVDM is not supported on x86-64 editions of Windows, including DOS programs, because NTVDM uses VM86 CPU mode instead of the Local Descriptor Table in order to enable 16‚Äëbits segment required for addressing and AAarch64 because Microsoft didn‚Äôt release a full emulator for this incompatible instruction set like it did on previous incompatible architecture. However, they can still be run using virtualization software, like Windows XP Mode in Windows 7, or by installing NTVDMx64, an unofficial port of the older emulated implementation of the NTVDM which was provided on NT 4 for non-x86 platforms. Another option is OTVDM (WineVDM), a 16-bit Windows interpreter based on MAME's i386 emulation and the 16-bit part of the popular Windows compatibility layer Wine. In general, VDM and similar technologies do not satisfactorily run most older DOS games on today's computers. Emulation is only provided for the most basic peripherals, often implemented incompletely. For example, sound emulation in NTVDM is very limited. NT-family versions of Windows only update the real screen a few times per second when a DOS program writes to it, and they do not emulate higher resolution graphics modes. Because software mostly runs native at the speed of the host CPU, all timing loops will expire prematurely. This either makes a game run much too fast or causes the software not even to notice the emulated hardware peripherals, because it does not wait long enough for an answer.

Dr. Christopher Newman Hall LLB (22 May 1816 ‚Äì 18 February 1902), born at Maidstone and known in later life as a 'Dissenter's Bishop', was one of the most celebrated nineteenth century English Nonconformist divines. He was active in social causes; supporting Abraham Lincoln and abolition of slavery during the American Civil War, the Chartist cause, and arranging for influential Nonconformists to meet Gladstone. Come to Jesus, first published in 1848 also contributed to his becoming a household name throughout Britain, the US and further afield - by the end of the century the book had been translated into about forty languages and sold four million copies worldwide. Early life and the Albion Chapel Photograph of Newman Hall taken c.1850 Christopher Newman Hall's father was John Vine Hall (1774‚Äì1860), proprietor and printer of the Maidstone Journal, and the author of a popular evangelical work called The Sinner's Friend. Christopher's first university degree was a London University BA in theology obtained at Highbury College, Middlesex in 1841. The following year he began his pastoral work at a Congregational chapel, the Albion Chapel, Albion Street, Hull. In 1843 he travelled through Scotland with a companion, where he found himself debating slavery with two American ladies who were slave owners themselves.Jeary, Margaret and Mulhern, Mark (Editors). From Kelso to Kalamazoo : the Life and Times of George Taylor 1803-1891 : European Ethnological Research Centre (2009) At Hull, Newman Hall engaged actively in social causes, including support for Chartism and temperance reform. To promote the latter cause he wrote The Scriptural Claims of Teetotalism, whilst his thoughts on Chartism and political causes, being influenced by the weekly Christian Socialist written by Charles Kingsley, Frederick Maurice and Thomas Hughes, was brought together in a small pamphlet entitled Divine Socialism, or The Man Christ Jesus. In 1846 Christopher Newman Hall married his first wife, Charlotte, only daughter of Dr William Gordon FLS, both of Hull. During the twelve years of his ministry at Albion Chapel, the membership increased greatly, necessitating a branch chapel. A school was also opened. His popularity led to invitations to preach at many of Yorkshire's Free Churches in Beverley, Selby, Leeds, Huddersfield, Filey, HarRogate, York, and Ripon. Surrey Chapel In 1854 Newman Hall succeeded the Rev. James Sherman as pastor of the celebrated Surrey Chapel in London, which was founded in 1783 by the Rev. Rowland Hill and by now had numerous foundations and charities associated with it. Whilst ministering at the chapel, Newman Hall won a scholarship to study law in his spare time; he was awarded an LLB degree in 1856. Abolition & American Civil War Montbard in Vanity Fair, 1872 During the 1860s, dissenting from the British government's position, Newman Hall passionately supported the north in the American Civil War. He disapproved of secession by southern states. England should side with the North, he wrote, particularly because emancipation of the slaves is just. He felt so strongly that he published one of his few non-theological books: The American War. A Lecture delivered in London, October 20, 1862. Newman Hall visited the United States during the Civil War, and published a passionate anti-slavery speech co-authored by Abraham Lincoln and Henry Ward Beecher. At the Great Union and Emancipation Meeting at Exeter Hall, London, on 29 January 1863 in support of Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, the crowning speech of the evening was given by Christopher Newman Hall. The meeting was a huge success, showing support for abolition in the United States of America, and reported by Harper's Weekly to have been one of the largest and most enthusiastic meetings ever held in London; its overspill of people who could not get into the packed meeting itself, was formed into three large, ancillary, open-air meetings. Subsequently, Newman Hall made extensive tours in the United States. At Washington, he was invited to open Congress with prayer, and in the House of Representatives he delivered an address on international relations. Christ Church, Hawkstone Hall and Lincoln Memorial Tower Christ Church in 1875 After some years at Surrey Chapel it became apparent to Newman Hall and the chapel's trustees that closure was inevitable. A considerable sum had been bequeathed by the chapel's founder for the perpetuation of his work on the expiration of the lease; but, owing to some legal flaw in the will, the bequest had to be given to the residuary legatee, Hackney Itineracy, later known as Hackney College, a non-conformist theological institution co-founded by George Collison. The trustees were faced with the prospect of raising all of the funds needed to buy a new lease on Surrey Chapel, or moving elsewhere. Surrey Chapel on Blackfriars Road was by then a popular religious, educational, and music venue with many associated foundations and charities, but was too small to house all of these. To provide sufficient space, a local temperance hall in Waterloo Road had been leased, and duly renamed Hawkstone Hall - the country seat of relatives of Rev. Rowland Hill. Were a more spacious site found for an entirely new chapel, the trustees might provide on-site facilities for some of the foundations and perhaps acquire a freehold. Costly though this would be, Newman Hall was undaunted by this challenge. Through weekly offertories and donations, and fund-raising in America, he led a campaign to raise sufficient money and loans. A grand building project emerged at the junction of the Kennington and Westminster Bridge Roads on the site of a former Orphan Asylum. It comprised a large new chapel, Christ Church, adjoined by a large lecture hall and school building to which the name Hawkstone Hall was transferred, and an international monument to Abraham Lincoln - the Lincoln Memorial Tower. The whole complex was initially designed by the architect E.C. Robins FRIBA in 1873, and then enlarged and modified by Paull & Bickerdike. Within four years of the new complex being opened by Samuel Morley MP in 1876, the total cost of about ¬£60,000 was cleared. Later life, memorial and legacy Memorial to Christopher Newman Hall and Harriet at Abney Park Cemetery London In the 1860s Newman Hall became Chairman of the Congregational Union, and was awarded a Doctorate in Divinity from Amherst College in the USA. Newman Hall became involved in W E Forster's educational bill and met with Gladstone personally. At a service conducted by Rev Henry Allon at Christ Church, on Easter Monday 1880, Newman Hall married his second wife, Miss Harriet Knipe - daughter of Henry Knipe, barrister-at-law and J.P. His first marriage had ended in a controversial divorce case which had eventually led to a decree nisi in February 1880 - a time when divorce was rare. Neither marriage was followed by children. In 1892 he received a second Doctorate of Divinity degree - from Edinburgh University. In 1892 Newman Hall resigned as pastor at Christ Church whilst continuing with his interests in social and evangelical work. Non- party, but broadly Liberal in his political views, few preachers of any denomination have exercised so far-reaching an influence. Towards the end of his life he completed an autobiography, in which he set out his philosophy in these words: The Christian Church, as tribunes of the people should be ever ready to plead the people's cause...Christians should be in the forefront of the battle of philanthropy. By this time he had many books to his name, including two books on travel The Land of the Forum and Vatican, and From Liverpool to St. Louis, and a book of poetry entitled Pilgrim Songs in Cloud and Sunshine. Christopher Newman Hall is buried with his father John Vine Hall (d.1860), and wife Harriet (d.1922), in a polished red coffin tomb at Abney Park Cemetery, the garden cemetery founded in Stoke Newington in 1840 by Congregationalists as a model for non-denominational burial.

His career began in minstrelsy and variety but progressed to the production of multi-act plays full of singing, dancing and physical comedy, making Harrigan one of the founding fathers of modern American musical theatre. Early years Harrigan was born at Corlear's Hook in Lower Manhattan, New York City. He was one of 13 children, only four of whom lived past infancy. Their father was a Protestant from Newfoundland, and their mother was described as \\"a Protestant Yankee\\".Cullen, p. 484 After Harrigan's parents divorced when he was 18, he worked at caulking ships, and his work eventually took him to San Francisco. As a pastime, he wrote new lyrics to existing melodies, and the result found popularity with his fellow workers. Harrigan and Hart partnership Harrigan made his first stage appearance in 1867 at the Olympic, a San Francisco \\"melodeon\\", as that city's variety theaters were then known. A brief partnership with comic Sam Rickey was followed by a fourteen-year stage career with Tony Hart, whom he met in Chicago in 1870. Although Harrigan wrote the lyrics and stage patter, the diminutive Hart's charm and singing talent played a large role in the duo's success. Harrigan and Hart went in 1871 to Boston, where they had their first big success at John Stetson's Howard Athenaeum. They then moved on to New York, where they first worked with Tony Pastor before beginning a long run at Josh Hart's Theatre Comique. By the mid-1870s they began moving from the variety show toward musical theatre. Harrigan's sketches on the Comique's crowded bill featured comic Irish, German and black characters drawn from everyday life on the streets of New York.Chase, p. 365 Their breakthrough hit was the 1873 song and sketch \\"The Mulligan Guard\\", a lampoon of an Irish neighborhood \\"militia\\" with music by David Braham, who would become Harrigan's musical director and father in law. It became their signature piece, and they featured it in many of their slapstick skits and plays.\\"Tony Hart\\", Internet Accuracy Project, accessed October 1, 2014 In 1876, Harrigan took over the Comique himself, along with Hart and manager Martin Hanley. right By 1878, with The Mulligan Guard Picnic, Harrigan & Hart settled down on Broadway and performed in seventeen of their shows over the next seven years.Kenrick, John. \\"Who's Who in Musicals: Hale-Harris\\", Musicals101.com Though still broad and farcical, these shows featured music that was integrated with a more literary story line, together with the dialogue and dance, and the shows began to resemble modern musical comedy. Harrigan wrote the stories and lyrics, and Braham wrote the music. Although the plays gradually became longer as more songs, dances, and stage business was added, the tickets remained the same price. Harrigan and Hart's comedy was about everyday people, and so it was fitting that working folk were able to afford to fill up the seats. These shows were very popular, especially with New York's immigrant-based lower and middle classes, who were delighted to see themselves comically (but sympathetically) depicted on stage. The action of the plays took place in downtown Manhattan and concerned real-life problems, such as interracial tensions, political corruption, and gang violence, all mixed with broad, street-smart comedy, puns and ethnic dialects. Harrigan played the politically ambitious Irish saloon owner \\"Dan Mulligan\\", and Hart played the African- American washerwoman \\"Rebecca Allup\\". One of Harrigan's most popular plays with the Mulligan Guard Series, the Mulligan Guard's Ball (1880), shows off the smooth juxtaposition of the comedy, musicality, and a healthy dose of humanity that made Harrigan's plays so distinctive. Full of laughable chaos and \\"Harrigan hilarity\\", the Irish militia and Black militia within the act butt heads in a satirical whirlwind of dance, stage violence, and buffoonery.Moody, Richard. Ned Harrigan: From Corlear's Hook to Herald Square. Chicago: Nelson-Hall Inc., Publishers, 1980. The New York Herald compared the Mulligan series to the Pickwick Papers by Charles Dickens, and one devotee wrote: \\"America has produced nothing more national, more distinctly its own, than these plays of the Irish in New York\\". People spoke of Ned Harrigan as the American Moli√®re.Cullen, passim Although the Theatre Comique was eventually shut down for financial reasons, Harrigan announced in 1881 that they would build a fresh and elegant \\"New Theatre Comique\\" several blocks further north on Broadway. The building they renovated was originally the home of the Church of the Messiah but had hosted many other theatres throughout the years.Kahn Jr., E. J. The Merry Partners: The Act and Stage of Harrigan and Hart. New York: Random House, Inc., 1955 However, this theatre was not to last; it burned to the ground in 1884.Greenleaf, pp. 375‚Äì76; and \\"New Theatre Comique\\", Internet Broadway Database Marriage and decline After the theatre collapsed, so did the partnership. Harrigan had married Annie Braham, David's daughter, on November 18, 1876. Their family continued in his footsteps, as son William Harrigan, daughter Nedda Harrigan, and granddaughter Ann Connolly all became Broadway performers. However, Harrigan's habit of hiring relatives soured his partnership with Hart. In May 1885, five months after the fire, Harrigan and Hart appeared on Broadway together for the last time. Hart's health deteriorated, and he died at age 36 in 1891, while Harrigan opened up his Harrigan's Theatre in 1890 on Herald Square. Twenty- three of his plays achieved runs of more than 100 performances each on Broadway. Harrigan continued writing plays and performing until his last public appearance on March 16, 1910. Harrigan died in 1911. Harrigan 'n Hart In 1985, a musical celebrating the partnership, Harrigan 'N Hart, opened on Broadway. The show has a book by Michael Stewart, lyrics by Peter Walker, and music by Max Showalter is based on the book The Merry Partners by Ely Jacques Kahn, Jr. and material found by Nedda Harrigan Logan. Harry Groener portrayed Harrigan, Mark Hamill (of Star Wars fame) played Hart, and Joe Layton directed.

If the processor encounters a problem when calling the double fault handler, a triple fault is generated and the processor shuts down. As double faults can only happen due to kernel bugs, they are rarely caused by user space programs in a modern protected mode operating system, unless the program somehow gains kernel access (some viruses and also some low-level DOS programs). Other processors like PowerPC or SPARC generally save state to predefined and reserved machine registers. A double fault will then be a situation where another exception happens while the processor is still using the contents of these registers to process the exception.

The organization's goals were to identify unnecessary barriers to research, craft policy guidelines and legal agreements to lower those barriers, and develop technology to make research data and materials easier to find and use. Its overarching goal was to speed the translation of data into discovery and thereby the value of research. Science Commons was located at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in the Ray and Maria Stata Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts. History Science Commons office in 2005, MIT Stata Center Creative Commons launched the Science Commons project in early 2005. The project sought to achieve for science what Creative Commons had achieved for the world of culture, art and educational material: to ease unnecessary legal and technical barriers to sharing, to promote innovation, and to provide easy, high quality tools that let individuals and organizations specify the terms under which they wished to share their material. In 2009, Creative Commons terminated the Science Commons project. Projects=Biological Materials Transfer Project The Biological Materials Transfer Project, a Material transfer agreement (MTA), developed and deployed standard, modular contracts to lower the costs of transferring biological materials such as DNA, cell lines, model animals and more. The MTA project covered transfer between non-profit institutions, as well as offering transaction solutions to transfers between non-profit entities and for-profit institutions. It integrated existing standard agreements and new Science Commons contracts into a Web-deployed suite, with the goal of developing a transaction system along the lines of Amazon or eBay by using the licensing as a discovery mechanism for materials. This metadata driven approach is based on the success of the Creative Commons licensing integration into search engines, further allowing for and facilitating the integration of materials licensing into the research literature itself and databases. The hope being that scientists would eventually be only one click away from accessing and/or ordering the materials referenced in the scholarly literature as they perform their research. Unfortunately, the MTA project's tools were not adopted by more than a very small percentage of the scientific community while Science Commons was active and, for all practical purposes, died out when the Science Commons project folded. Neurocommons Science Commons‚Äô Neurocommons project set out to create an Open Source knowledge management platform for biological research. The platform combined open access materials (making up the knowledgebase) and open source software (in the form of an analytic platform). The software was still under development when the project ended. Scholar's Copyright Project The Scholar‚Äôs Copyright was developed with Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition designed to lower the barriers to Open Access (OA) by reducing transaction costs and eliminating contract proliferation by offering tools and resources catering to both methods of achieving Open Access. The Scholar's Copyright Addendum is still in use by SPARC =Open Access Data Protocol= The Science Commons Open Access Data Protocol was a method for ensuring that scientific databases can be legally integrated with one another. The protocol was not a license or legal tool, but instead a methodology and best practices document for creating such legal tools in the future, and marking data in the public domain for machine-assisted discovery.

Adoption and accession Chamarajendra Wadiyar X was born in the old palace in Mysore on 22 February 1863, as the third son of Sardar Chikka Krishnaraj Urs of the Bettada-Kote branch of the ruling clan. His father died about a week before his birth. His mother, Rajkumari Putammani Devi, was the eldest daughter of Maharaja Krishnaraja Wadiyar III. Following the failure of heirs male, Krishnaraja Wadiyar III decided to adopt Chamarajendra. The adoption was done on 18 June 1865 and was recognised by the British Government of India on 16 April 1867. Krishnaraja Wadiyar III died on 27 March 1868, and Chamarajendra Wadiyar X ascended the throne at the royal palace, Mysore, on 23 September 1868. However, since 1831, the Kingdom of Mysore had been under the direct administration of the British Raj, which had earlier deposed Krishnaraja Wadiyar on allegations of misrule. Later, the Privy Council of the United Kingdom ordered the reversal of the British East India Company's decision to annexe Mysore. By the Rendition Act of 1881, the princely state of Mysore was reconstituted and restored to the Wadiyar dynasty. Chamarajendra Wadiyar X was groomed by the British to take charge of the administration. He was officially handed the reins of governance on 25 March 1881. Reign Although his reign proved to be a brief one, he left an indelible mark on the Kingdom of Mysore. He was aptly aided by Rangacharlu (1881-83) CE and Sheshadri Iyer (1883-1901) two of the most competent Diwans. He instituted the Representative Assembly of Mysore Kingdom in 1881. This was the first modern, democratic legislative institution of its kind in princely India. He sponsored the famous journey of Swami Vivekananda to Chicago in 1893. He gave primacy to women's education and founded the Kannada Bashojjivini School. He gave a fillip to the industrialisation of the Kingdom of Mysore by instituting several industrial schools and conducting the annual Dasara Industrial Exhibition. He facilitated the founding of Agricultural Banks to help finance farmers and initiated life insurance for government employees. Many of the most famous landmarks of Mysore and Bangalore owe their existence to him. Prominent among these are: * the Bangalore Palace, Bangalore * the Lalbagh Glass House, Bangalore * Oriental Research Institute Mysore, Mysore (established in 1891) * Maharaja's College, Mysore (1889) * Maharaja's Sanskrit School, Mysore * Government Office, Mysore * Lansdowne Bazaar, Mysore * Dufferin Tower, Mysore * Mysore Zoo, Mysore * Fern Hill Palace, Ooty Patronage Chamarajendra Wadiyar X of Mysore in 1877 Chamarajendra Wadiyar X was a great patron of arts and music; his court boasted of artists like Veena Subbanna, Veena Seshanna, K. Vasudevacharya. Veena Padmanabiah, Mysore Karigiri Rao, and Bidaram Krishnappa, among others. The maharaja was a violin virtuoso himself and used to daily provide accompaniment to Veena Subbanna's vocal and Veena Sheshanna's veena performances. His favourite kriti's included Sujana Jeevana and Lavanya Rama. He was also a connaisseur of Javali's Kritis (Javalis are a genre of Carnatic music).

In his letters written in English he refers to himself as Volusene. Early life He was born near Elgin, studied Philosophy at Aberdeen, and in the dialogue De Animi Tranquillitate says that the description of the abode of tranquillity was based on a dream that came to him after a conversation with a fellow-student on the banks of his native River Lossie. He was then a student of Philosophy of four years' standing. In Paris Proceeding to Paris, he became tutor to Thomas Wynter, reputed son of Cardinal Wolsey. He paid repeated visits to England, where he was well received by the king, and, after Wolsey's fall, he acted as one of Thomas Cromwell's agents in Paris. He was in England as late as 1534, and appears to have been Rector of Speldhurst in Kent. In Paris he knew George Buchanan, and found patrons in the cardinal Jean de Lorraine and Jean du Bellay. He was to have gone with du Bellay on his mission to Italy in 1535, but illness kept him in Paris. As soon as he recovered he set out on his journey, but at Avignon, by the advice of his friend Antonio Bonvisi (d. 1558), he sought the patronage of the bishop of the diocese, the learned and pious Paul Sadolet, who made him master in the school at Carpentras, with a salary of seventy crowns. Volusenus paid frequent visits to Lyon (where Conrad Gesner saw him, still a young man, in 1540), probably also to Italy, where he had many friends, perhaps even to Spain. A letter addressed to him by Sadolet from Rome in 1546 shows that he had then resolved to return to Scotland, and had asked advice on the attitude he should adopt in the religious dissensions of the time. He died on the journey, however, at Vienne in Dauphin√©, in 1546, or early in the next year. Work Volusenus's linguistic studies embraced Hebrew as well as Greek and Latin. His reputation, however, rests on the beautiful dialogue, De Animi Tranquillitate, first printed by S. Gryphius at Lyon in 1543. From internal evidence it appears to have been composed about that time, but the subject had exercised the writer for many years. The dialogue shows us Christian humanism at its best. Volusenus is a great admirer of Erasmus, but he criticises the purity of his Latin and also his philosophy. His own philosophy is Christian and Biblical rather than classical or scholastic. He takes a fresh and independent view of Christian ethics, and he ultimately reaches a doctrine as to the witness of the Spirit and the assurance of grace which breaks with the traditional Christianity of his time and is based on ethical motives akin to those of the German Reformers. The verses which occur in the dialogue, and the poem which concludes it, give Volusenus a place among Scottish Latin poets, but it is as a Christian philosopher that he attains distinction. The dialogue was reissued at Leiden in 1637 by the Scots writer David Echlin, whose poems, with a selection of three poems from the dialogue of Volusenus, appear, with others, in the famous Amsterdam collection Delitiae Poetarum Scotorum hujus and printed by Johannes Blaeu in 2 vols. in 1637. Later editions of the dialogue appeared at Edinburgh in 1707 and 1751 (the latter edited by G. Wishart). All the reissues contain a short life of the author by Thomas Wilson, advocate, son-in-law and biographer of Archbishop Patrick Adamson. Supplementary facts are found in the letters and state papers of the period, and in Sadolet's Letters.

The film was produced by Bill Barretta and written by Debra Frank, Steve L. Hayes, Tom Martin and Adam F. Goldberg based on a story by Frank and Hayes. A contemporary adaptation of L. Frank Baum's 1900 novel, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, the story follows young Dorothy Gale, who works in her Aunt Em's diner, but dreams of becoming a singer somewhere beyond her small Kansas town. Swept up by a tornado, in her trailer home with pet prawn Toto, she lands in Oz and embarks on a journey to meet the Wizard who can help make her dreams come true. The film was co- produced by The Muppets Studio, Touchstone Television, and Fox Television Studios, in association with The Jim Henson Company. Right after Disney bought the rights to The Muppets in 2004, pre-production took place throughout February 2004, and filming seven months later. ABC made several changes after the initial script was written, ultimately deciding to adapt plot elements from Baum's original novel rather than the 1939 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer musical film, The Wizard of Oz. As with the preceding Muppet films, The Muppets' Wizard of Oz became a musical, and included five new songs written and composed by Michael Giacchino. The special is the first Muppets special without the involvement of veteran performer Jerry Nelson following his 2004 retirement from physical performing. His characters of Lew Zealand and Floyd Pepper, were respectively performed by Bill Barretta and John Kennedy. Barretta also debuts as the new permanent performer of Dr. Teeth due to Kennedy now performing Floyd. The production also marked the feature film debut of Eric Jacobson as the performer of Sam Eagle, a character originally performed by Kevin Clash. The Muppets' Wizard of Oz premiered on April 27, 2005 at the Tribeca Film Festival, and made its television premiere on ABC on May 20, 2005, as the final ABC Movie of the Week. The film received mixed to negative reviews from critics, who felt that the film was too mature for young audiences and that the cameos and popular culture references were unnecessary. Plot Dorothy Gale (Ashanti) is an orphaned teenage girl living in a trailer park in Kansas. Her Aunt Em (Queen Latifah) and Uncle Henry (David Alan Grier) own a diner, to which Dorothy works for room and board. Her dream of becoming a singer is slim, but when waiting on some truckers Dorothy overhears that the Muppets are conducting a cross-country show called \\"Star Hunt\\" and are looking for a backup singer. Aunt Em disapproves, but with Uncle Henry's best wishes, she goes to the audition. However, the Muppets are about to end the audition, and Dorothy only manages to give them a demo CD that she created beforehand. In returning home, the civil defense sirens sound as a tornado is headed for Dorothy's trailer park. When Aunt Em and Uncle Henry run into the county storm shelter for safety, Dorothy hurries back to her family's mobile home to get Toto, her pet prawn. She does not make it out in time, and the two are swept by the tornado across the vast fields of Kansas. When Dorothy climbs out of the wreckage, she finds that Toto (Pep√© the King Prawn) can talk and that she is no longer in Kansas. Dorothy and Toto discover that they are in Munchkinland, a small town part of the vast Land of Oz. After discussing her situation with the town's people, the Munchkins (played by Rizzo the Rat and the other rats), she learns that the land's ruler the Wizard, has the power to grant her wish of becoming a famous singer. She meets the Good Witch of the North (Miss Piggy), and receives a pair of magic silver slippers from the Wicked Witch of the East (Miss Piggy), the Witch of the North's sister who was killed when Dorothy's trailer fell on her. Soon after, she embarks on a journey with Toto on the yellow brick road to meet the Wizard of Oz, who lives in the Emerald City, the capital of Oz. On her journey, she meets three creatures: a Scarecrow (Kermit), a Tin Thing (Gonzo), and a Cowardly Lion (Fozzie). They are also seeking the Wizard of Oz to give them a brain, heart, and courage, respectively. The group meets various obstacles involving a deep gorge where the Kalidah Critics (Statler and Waldorf) are heckling them and a Poppy Field Club run by Clifford which nearly puts them to sleep. After arriving at the Emerald City and meeting the Wizard, Dorothy and her friends are sent to retrieve the Wicked Witch of the West's magic eye, a tool she uses to see anything she desires in the Land of Oz. The group assumes that completing this task will result in the granting of their wishes. The Wicked Witch of the West (Miss Piggy) sees them coming and consults with her pet Foo-Foo and her henchman Johnny Fiama. When the Wicked Witch of the West plans to have either her pack of 40 great man-eating wolves, a flock of 40 crows of despair, a swarm of angry black bees, a group of vicious squirrels, or a group of bloodthirsty cockatoos to do away with them, Johnny tells her that the animals that work for her are unavailable due to various reasons. This forces her to resort to using her Magic Biker Cap to call Sal Minella and the other Flying Monkeys (played by Sweetums, Crazy Harry, Black Dog, Bobo the Bear, Calico, Old Tom, Spotted Dick, and Aretha from Fraggle Rock) to deal with them. The Witch and the Flying Monkeys capture Dorothy, Toto and Lion while Scarecrow and Tin Thing are dismantled by the Flying Monkeys. After being threatened to be killed by her, Toto calls the Munchkins, who set him and Dorothy free and hold up the witch. During the final battle, it cuts away to a scene where Quentin Tarantino is having a meeting with Kermit, discussing ideas for how Dorothy can defeat the Wicked Witch of the West. Tarantino's ideas are deemed too expensive and too violent for a Muppet movie, so they agree for Dorothy to do a powerful kick on the witch. Cutting back to the action, Dorothy kicks the witch into her own \\"bottled water bath\\" which contains tap water (to which she is severely allergic). Angel Marie admitted that he filled the water bottles with tap water to restock them. This action causes the Wicked Witch of the West to melt as Johnny averts Foo-Foo's eyes. With the Wicked Witch of the West dead, Dorothy finds the magic eye floating in the tub unharmed and grabs it. Dorothy gains control of the Flying Monkeys by giving back the group's Magic Biker Cap to Sal Minella. She has Scarecrow and Tin Thing rebuilt by the Flying Monkeys. Then she and her friends travel back to the Emerald City to have their wishes granted. When they all storm into the Wizard's room, they discover it is merely a Hollywood effects stage and that the Wizard (Jeffrey Tambor) is just an ordinary man, pretending. He asked for the witch's eye so that she could not see him for who he really was. Even so, he still proceeds to grant their wishes. Dorothy finally becomes a singer in the Land of Oz, but she realizes that all she ever really wanted was to go back home and be with her family. After traveling back to Munchkinland, she meets Glinda the Good Witch of the South (Miss Piggy), who tells her that if she clicks her heels together three times, she will be able to go anywhere she desires, contrary to how the Good Witch of the North said to get to the Emerald City. She does so, saying \\"take me home to Aunt Em\\". She is then spun by the slippers' charm into Kansas, and, much to her surprise, she finds out that Kermit was looking for her, saying that she had the best voice they heard on the whole search, and that she has been chosen to go on the Star Hunt. Dorothy, having been reunited with her aunt and uncle, and feeling that she is not ready to leave Kansas to become a real star, rejects, but Aunt Em says that she wants her to go with the Muppets on their Star Hunt, much to her even bigger surprise. She then sings \\"Good Life\\" on television with them at the Muppet Theater as the film ends.

It most commonly designates a private transaction by means of which one person, to obtain some trust, confidence or credit for another, engages to be answerable for him. It may also designate a treaty through which claims, rights or possessions are secured. It is to be differentiated from the colloquial \\"personal guarantee\\" in that a guarantee is a legal concept which produces an economic effect. A personal guarantee by contrast is often used to refer to a promise made by an individual which is supported by, or assured through, the word of (speak enough) the individual. In the same way, a guarantee produces a legal effect wherein one party affirms the promise of another (usually to pay) by promising to themselves pay if default occurs. At law, the giver of a guarantee is called the surety or the \\"guarantor\\". The person to whom the guarantee is given is the creditor or the \\"obligee\\"; while the person whose payment or performance is secured thereby is termed \\"the obligor\\", \\"the principal debtor\\", or simply \\"the principal\\". Suretys have been classified as follows: # Those in which there is an agreement to constitute, for a particular purpose, the relation of principal and surety, to which agreement the secured creditor is a party; # those in which there is a similar agreement between the principal and surety only, to which the creditor is a stranger; # those in which, without any such contract of suretyship, there is a primary and a secondary liability of two persons for one and the same debt, the debt being, as between the two, that of one of those persons only, and not equally of both, so that the other, if he should be compelled to pay it, would be entitled to reimbursement from the person by whom (as between the two) it ought to have been paid.Duncan Fox and Co. v. North and South Wales Bank, 6 App. Cas. 11 Etymology Guarantee is sometimes spelt \\"guarantie\\" or \\"guaranty\\".The guarantee (person) is sometimes distinguished from the guaranty (obligation). It is from an Old French form of \\"warrant\\", from the Germanic word which appears in German as wahren: to defend or make safe and binding. Common law=England In English law, a guarantee is a contract whereby the person (the guarantor) enters into an agreement to pay a debt, or effect the performance of some duty by a third person who is primarily liable for that payment or performance. The extent of the debt that the guarantor is liable to this debt is co-extensive to the obligation of the third-party.Joanna Benjamin, Financial Law, OUP, 2007, Chapter 4.2 It is a collateral contract, which does not extinguish the original obligation for payment or performance and is secondary to the primary obligation.Chitty on Contracts 32nd edition, Sweet & Maxwell, Volume II Chapter 45-001, Lakeman v Mountstephen [1865] LR 7 HL 17, also cf Halsbury Laws of England & Wales, Para 1013 It is rendered null and void if the original obligation fails. Two forms of guarantee exists in England, (1) Guarantees creating a conditional payment, wherein if the principal fails, the guarantor will pay. Under this form, the guarantee is not enforceable until failure occurs.Joanna Benjamin, Financial Law, OUP, 2007, Chapter 4.2 (2) A \\"See-to-it\\" obligation where the guarantor's obligation is to ensure that the principal will carry out the obligation. Failure of the principal to do so will automatically make the guarantor in breach of his contractual obligation, on which the creditor can sue.Norwich and Peterborough Building Society v McGuinness [2010] EWCA Civ 1286 The liabilities of a guarantor in law depend upon those of the principal debtor, and when the principal's obligations cease the guarantor's do too,Norwich and Peterborough Building Society v McGuinness [2010] EWCA Civ 1286. See Stacey v. Hill, I KB 666 (1901). See Bateson v. Gosling, 1871 L.R. 7, 14 except in certain cases where the discharge of the principal debtor is by the operation of the law.With regard to release of the debtor See Finley v Connell Associates [2002] Lloyds Rep PN 62 or also In re Fitzgeorge ex parte Robson, I KB 462 (1905) The co-extensive, secondary nature of the liability of the guarantor along with the fact that the guarantee is a contract to answer default, debt, or miscarriage; crucially differentiates the guarantee from an indemnity.Norwich and Peterborough Building Society v McGuinness [2010] EWCA Civ 1286 Also See Joanna Benjamin, Financial Law, OUP, 2007, Chapter 4.2 If, for example, a person wrongly supposes that someone is liable to them, and a guarantee is given on that erroneous basis, the guarantee is invalid by virtue of the law of contracts, because its foundation (that another was liable) failed.Mountstephen v. Lakeman, L.R. 7 Q.B. 202 No special phraseology is necessary to form a guarantee. What distinguishes a guarantee from insurance is not any difference between the words \\"insurance\\" and \\"guarantee\\", but the substance of the contract entered into by the parties.Seaton v. Heath-Seaton v. Burnand, I QB 782, 792, C.A. (1899); In re Denton's Estate Licenses Insurance Corporation and Guarantee Fund Ltd. v. Denton, 2 Ch. 188 (1899); see Dane v. Mortgage Insurance Corporation, I Q.B. 54 C.A. (1894) The statutory requisites of a guarantee are, in England, prescribed firstly by the statute of frauds, which provides in section 4 that \\"no action shall be brought whereby to charge the defendant upon any special promise to answer for the debt, default or miscarriages of another person, unless the agreement upon which such action shall be brought, or some memorandum or note thereof, shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged therewith, or some other person thereunto by him lawfully authorized\\". This in effect means that the guarantee are not invalid but are merely unenforceable through a chose in personam. The requirement for a signature in writing was clarified in Elpis Maritimes Co v Marti Chartering Co Inc (the \\"Maria D\\") [1992] 1 AC 21 and J Pereia Fernandes SA v Mehta [2006] EWHC 813 (Ch). In the latter, it was held that a contract was enforceable either by written agreement signed by the guarantor or his agent OR; if the guarantee was oral, a separate note or memorandum of the agreement could make the guarantee similarly enforceable. In the former, the court held it was sufficient that it was written or printed by the guarantor, an initial within an email was sufficient but a standard header name in an email was not. The court believed that the minor action was sufficient to engage the Statute as it had long been held that a single fingerprint, or \\"X\\" was sufficient. The Electronic Communications Act 2000 created a power to issue statutory instruments to modify legislation so as to be congruent with modern use of electronic communications. This is congruent with Article 9 of the EU Directive on Electronic Commerce 2000, this specifically allowed exceptions to the 'in writing' requirement of a guarantee. It has even been held that clicking a button to confirm personal details sufficiently discharges the Statute of Frauds requirement.Beale and Griffiths (2000) LMCLQ 467, 473 The second requisite is Lord Tenterden's Act9 Geo. IV. c. 14 ¬ß6 which enacts that \\"no action shall be brought whereby to charge any person upon or by reason of any representation or assurance made or given concerning or relating to the character, conduct, credit, ability, trade or dealings of any other person, to the intent or purpose that such other person may obtain credit, money or goods upon unless such representation or assurance be made in writing signed by the party to be charged therewith\\".i.e. \\"upon credit\\"Lyde v. Barnard, 1 M. & W. 104 Lord Tenterden's Act, which applies to incorporated companies and to individual persons,Hirst v. West Riding Union Banking Co., 2 K.B. 560 C.A. (1901) was rendered necessary by an evasion of the statute of frauds, treating the guarantee for a debt, default or miscarriage, when not in writing as a fraudulent representation, giving rise to damages for a tort.Pasley v. Freeman, 3 T.R. 51In Scotland, where a guarantee is called a \\"cautionary obligation\\", similar enactments to those just specified are contained in the Mercantile Law Amendment Act (Scotland) 1856 ¬ß6, while =Statute of frauds= The statute of frauds does not invalidate a verbal guarantee, but renders it unenforceable. It may therefore be available to support a defense to an action, and money paid under it cannot be recovered. An indemnity is not a guarantee within the statute, unless it contemplates the primary liability of a third person. It need not, therefore, be in writing when it is only a promise to become liable for a debt if the person to whom the promise is made should become liable.Wildes v. Dudlow, L.R. 19 Eq. 198; Harburg India-Rubber Co. v. Martin, 1902, I K.B. 786; Guild v. Conrad, 1894, 2 Q.B. 885 C.A. Neither does the statute apply to the promise of a del credere agent to make no sales on behalf of his principal except to persons who are absolutely solvent, and renders the agent liable for any loss that may result from the non-fulfilment of his promise. A promise to give a guarantee is within the statute, though not one to procure a guarantee. The general principles which determine what are guarantees within the statute of frauds are: (1) the primary liability of a third person must exist or be contemplated;Birkmyr v. Darnell, 1 Sm. L.C. Iith ed. 299; Mounistephen v. Lakeman, L.R. 7 Q.B. 196; L.R. 7 H.L. 17 (2) the promise must be made to the creditor; (3) there must be no liability by the surety independent of an express promise of guarantee; (4) the main object of the parties to the guarantee must be the fulfilment of a third party's obligation;See Harburg India-Rubber Comb Co. v. Martin, I K.B. 778, 786 (1902) and (5) the contract entered into must not amount to a sale by the creditor to the promiser of the security for a debt or of the debt itselfSee de Colyar's Law of Guarantees and of Principal and Surety, 3rd ed. pp. 65-161, where these principles are discussed in detail. As regards the kind of note or memorandum of the guarantee that will satisfy the statute of frauds, \\"no special promise to be made, by any person after the passing of this act, to answer for the debt, default or miscarriage of another person, being in writing and signed by the party to be charged, or some other person by him thereunto lawfully authorized, shall be deemed invalid to support an action, suit or other proceeding, to charge the person by whom such promise shall have been made, by reason only that the consideration for such promise does not appear in writing or by necessary inference from a written document.\\"Mercantile Law Amendment Act 1856 ¬ß3 Any writing embodying the terms of the agreement between the parties and signed by the party to be charged is sufficient; and the idea of agreement need not be present to the mind of the person signing.In re Hoyle - Hoyle v. Hoyle, I Ch., 98 (1893) It is, however, necessary that the names of the contracting parties should appear somewhere in writing; that the party to be charged, or his agent, should sign the agreement or another paper referring to it; and that, when the note or memorandum is made, a complete agreement shall exist. The memorandum need not be contemporaneous with the agreement itself.As regards the stamping of the memorandum or note of agreement, a guarantee cannot, in England, be given in evidence unless properly stamped. Stamp Act 1891. A guarantee for the payment of goods, however, requires no stamp. Nor is it necessary to stamp a written representation or assurance as to character within 9 Geo. IV. c. 14. If under seal, a guarantee may require an ad valorem stamp; and, on certain prescribed terms, the stamps can be affixed any time after execution. Stamp Act 1891, 15, amended by 15 of the Finance Act 1895 United States In the United States, but not apparently elsewhere, there is a distinction between a surety and a guarantor. A surety is usually bound with the principal, at the same time and on the same consideration, while the contract of a guarantor is his own separate undertaking and the guarantor is not liable until due diligence has been exerted to compel the principal debtor to make good any default. There is no privity of contract between a surety and the principal debtor. Rather, the surety contracts with the creditor and is not jointly liable to the creditor.Bain v. Cooper, I Dowl. R. (N.S.) 11, 14 Other common law jurisdictions In India a guarantee may be either oral or writtenIndian Contract Act ¬ß126 while in Australia, Jamaica and Sri Lanka it must be in writing. In the Irish Statute of Frauds7 Will. III. c. 12 there are provisions identical with that found in the English Statute of Frauds. Civil law According to various existing civil codes, a suretyship, when the underlying obligation is \\"non-valuable\\", is null and void unless the invalidity is the result of personal incapacity of the principal debtorCodes Civil, France and Belgium, 2012; Spain, 1824; Portugal, 822; Italy, 1899; Netherlands, 1858; Lower Canada, 1932 In some countries, however, the mere personal incapacity of a minor to borrow suffices to eliminate the guarantee of a loan made to himSpain, 1824; Portugal, 822, ¬ß2, 1535, 1536 The Egyptian codes sanction guarantees expressly entered into \\"in view of debtor's want of legal capacity\\" to contract a valid principal obligation Egyptian Codes, Mixed Suits, 605; Native Tribunals, 496 The Portuguese code retains the surety's liability, in respect of an invalid principal obligation, until the latter has been legally rescindedart. 822, ¬ßI According to several codes civil sureties are divided into conventional, legal and judicial,Codes Civil, France and Belgium, 2015, 2040 et seq.; Spain, 1823; Lower Canada, 1930 while the Spanish code further divides them into gratuitous and for valuable consideration.art. 1, 823 The German code civil requires the surety's promise to be verified by writing where he has not executed the principal obligation.art. 766 The Portuguese code renders a guarantee provable by all the modes established by law for the proof of the principal contractart. 826 According to most civil codes civil a guarantee like any other contract can usually be made verbally in the presence of witnesses and in certain cases (where for instance considerable sums of money are involved) sous signature privee or by a judicial or notarial instrument.See Codes Civil, France and Belgium 1341; Spain, 1244; Portugal 2506, 2513; Italy, 1341 et seq.; Pothier's Law of Obligations, Evans's ed. i. 257; Burge on Suretyship, p. 19; van der Linden's Institutes of Holland, p. 120 The French and Belgian Codes, moreover, provide that suretyship is not to be presumed but must always be expressedart. 2015 Contract law In England the common-law requisites of a guarantee are the same as any other contract. The mutual assent of two or more parties, competency to contract and valuable consideration.Pillan v. van Mierop and Hopkins, 3 Burr. 1666; Haigh v. Brooks, 10 A. & E. 309; Barrell v. Trussell, 4 Taunt. 117; Indian Contract Act 1872 ¬ß127If the guarantee is made \\"under seal\\" no consideration may be required. However, sealed contracts without consideration are no longer valid in most common law jurisdictions. An offer to guarantee must be accepted, either by express or implied acceptance. If a surety's assent to a guarantee has been procured by fraud by the person to whom it is given, there is no binding contract. Fraud may consist of suppression, concealment or misrepresentation. However, only facts that are really material to the risk undertaken need be spontaneously disclosed.Seaton v. Burn and Burn v. Seaton, 1900 A.C. 135 The competency of the parties to enter into a contract of guarantee may be affected by insanity or intoxication of the surety, if known to the creditor, or by any disability. The ordinary disabilities are those of minors. In some guarantees the consideration is \\"entire\\". For example, in consideration for a lease being granted, the surety becomes answerable for the performance of the covenants of the lease. In other cases it is \\"fragmentary\\" or supplied from time to time, as where a guarantee is given to secure the balance of a running account at a bank, for goods suppliedLloyd's v. Harper, 16 Ch. Div. 319 When the consideration is \\"entire\\", the guarantee runs on through the duration of the lease and is irrevocable. When the consideration is \\"fragmentary\\", unless the guarantee stipulates to the contrary, the surety may at any time terminate his liability under the guarantee. Total failure of consideration or illegal consideration by the party giving a guarantee will prevent its being enforced. Though in all countries the mutual assent of two or more parties is essential to the formation of any contract,See e.g. Codes Civil, Fr. and Bel. 1108; Port. 643, 647 et seq.; Spain, 1258, 1261; Italy, 1104; Holt. 1356; Lower Canada, 984 a consideration is not everywhere regarded as a necessary element.See Pothier's Law of Obligations, Evans's edition vol. ii. p. l9 Thus in Scotland a contract may be binding without a consideration to support it.Stair i. to. 7 Liability The liability incurred by a surety under his guarantee depends upon its terms, and is not necessarily coextensive with that of the principal debtor. It is, however, obvious that the surety's obligation cannot exceed that of the principal.de Colyar, Law of Guarantees, 3rd ed. p. 233; Burge, Suretyship, p. 5 By many existing civil codes, however, a guarantee which imposes on the surety a greater liability than that of the principal is not invalidated but is merely reducible to that of the principal.Codes Civil, France and Belgium 2013; Portugal 823; Spain, 1826; Italy, 1900; Netherlands, 1859; Lower Canada, 1933 However, in India the liability of the surety is, unless otherwise provided by contract, coextensive with that of the principal.Indian Contract Act 1872 ¬ß128 Where the liability of the surety is less extensive in amount than that of the principal debtor, questions have arisen in England and America as to whether the surety is liable only for part of the debt equal to the limit of his liability, or, up to such limit, for the whole debt.Ellis v. Emmanuel, 4 Ex. Div. 157; Hobson v. Bass, 6 Ch. App. 792; Brandt, Suretyship, sec. 219 The surety cannot be made liable except for a loss sustained by reason of the default guaranteed against. Moreover, in the case of a joint and several guarantee by several sureties, unless all sign it none are liable thereunder.National Pro. Bank of England v. Brackenbury 1906, 22 Times L.R. 797 The limit of the surety's liability must be construed so as to give effect to what may fairly be inferred to have been the intention of the parties as expressed in writing. In cases of doubtful import, recourse to parol evidence is permissible, to explain, but not to contradict, the written evidence of the guarantee. As a general rule, the surety is not liable if the principal debt cannot be enforced. It has never been actually decided in England whether this rule holds good in cases where the principal debtor is a minor and on that account is not liable to the creditor.See Kimball v. Newell 7 Hill (N.Y.) 116 When directors guarantee the performance by their company of a contract which is beyond their authority, and therefore not binding on the company, the directors' liability is enforceable against them personally.Yorkshire Railway Waggon Co. v. Maclure, 21 Ch. D. 309 C.A. Termination of liability It is not always easy to determine for how long liability under a guarantee endures. Sometimes a guarantee is limited to a single transaction, and is obviously intended to be security against one specific default only. On the other hand, it as often happens that it is not exhausted by one transaction on the faith of it, but extends to a series of transactions, and remains a standing security until it is revoked, either by the act of the parties or by the death of the surety. It is then termed a continuing guarantee. No fixed rules of interpretation determine whether a guarantee is a continuing one or not, but each case must be judged on its individual merits. Frequently, in order to achieve a correct construction, it becomes necessary to examine the surrounding circumstances, which often reveal what was the subject matter which the parties contemplated when the guarantee was given, and what was the scope and object of the transaction between them. Most continuing guarantees are either ordinary business securities for advances made or goods supplied to the principal debtor or else bonds for the good behavior of persons in public or private offices or employment. With regard to the latter class of continuing guarantees, the surety's liability is, generally speaking, revoked by any change in the constitution of the persons to or for whom the guarantee is given.Partnership Act 1890 ¬ß18, which applies to Scotland as well as England, provides that \\"a continuing guarantee or cautionary obligation given either to a firm or to a third person in respect of the transactions of a firm, is, in the absence of agreement to the contrary, revoked as to future transactions by any change in the constitution of the firm to which, or of the firm in respect of the transactions of which the guaranty or obligation was given.\\" This section is mainly declaratory of the English common law, which indicates that the changes in the persons to or for whom a guarantee is given may consist either of an increase in their number, of a diminution thereof caused by death or retirement from business, or of the incorporation or consolidation of the persons to whom the guarantee is given. In England the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury to vary the character of any security, for good behavior by the heads of public departmentsGovernment Offices (Security) Act 1875, Amended by the Statute Law Revision Act 1883 given by companies for the due performance of the duties of an office or employment in the public service. Limitation of liability Before the surety can be rendered liable on his guarantee, the principal debtor must have made default. When, however, this has occurred, the creditor, in the absence of express agreement to the contrary, may sue the surety, without informing him of such default having taken place before proceeding against the principal debtor or resorting to securities for the debt received from the latter. In those countries where the municipal law is based on the Roman law, sureties usually possess the right (which may, however, be renounced by them) of compelling the creditor to insist on the goods, etc. (if any) of the principal debtor being first \\"discussed\\", i.e., appraised and sold, and appropriated to the liquidation of the debt guaranteed before having recourse to the sureties.See Codes Civil, France and Belgium 2021 et seq.; Spain, 1830, 1831; Portugal 830; Germany, 771, 772, 773; Netherlands, 1868; Italy, 1907; Lower Canada, 1941-1942; Egypt [mixed suits] 612; ibid. [native tribunals] 502 This right \\"accords with a common sense of justice and the natural equity of mankind\\".Hayes v. Ward, 4 Johns. New York, Ch. Cas. p. 132, (opinion by Kent, Chancellor In England this right has never been fully recognized, nor does it prevail in America and Scotland.Mercantile Law Amendment Act (Scotland) 1856 ¬ß8 In England, however, before any demand for payment has been made by the creditor on the surety, the latter can, as soon as the principal debtor has made default, compel the creditor, on giving him an indemnity against costs and expenses, to sue the principal debtor if the latter is solvent and able to pay.Rouse v. Bradford Banking Company 1894, 2 Ch. 75; Wright v. Simpson, 6 Yes. 733 and a similar remedy is also open to the surety in America.See Brandt on Suretyship, p. 290 ¬∂205 Extent of surety's liability In neither of these countries nor in Scotland can one of several sureties, when sued for the whole guaranteed debt by the creditor, compel the latter to divide his claim among the sureties, and reduce it to the share and proportion of each surety. However, this beneficium divisionis, as it is called in Roman law, is recognized by many existing codes.France and Belgium 2025-2027; Spain, 1837; Portugal, 835- 836; Germany, 426; Netherlands, 1873-1874; Italy, 1911-1912; Lower Canada, 1946; Egypt [mixed suits], 615,616 Enforcement of liability The usual mode in England of enforcing liability under a guarantee is by action in the High Court or a County Court. It is also permissible for the creditor to obtain redress by means of a set-off or counterclaim, in an action brought against him by the surety. On the other hand, the surety may now, in any court in which the action on the guarantee is pending, avail himself of any set-off which may exist between the principal debtor and the creditor. Moreover, if one of several sureties for the same debt is sued by the creditor or his guarantee, he can, by means of a third- party complaint, claim contribution from his co-sureties towards the common liability. Independent proof of the surety's liability under his guarantee must always be given at the trial. The creditor cannot rely on admissions made by or a judgment or award against the principal debtor.Ex parte Young In re Kitchin, 17 Ch. Div. 668Bankruptcy Act, 1883 ¬ß37 A person liable as a surety for another under a guarantee possesses rights against the person to whom the guarantee was given. As regards the surety's rights against the principal debtor, where the guarantee was made with the debtors consent but not otherwise,See Hodgson, v. Shaw, 3 Myl. & K. 190 after he has made default, be compelled by the surety to exonerate him from liability by payment of the guaranteed debt.Antrobus v. Davidson, 3 Meriv. 569, 579; Johnston v. Salvage Association, 19 Q.B.D. 460, 461; and Wolmershausen v. Gullick, 2 Ch. 514 (1893) If the surety has paid any portion of the guaranteed debt, the surety is entitled to rank as a creditor for the amount paid and to compel repayment. In the event of the principal debtor's bankruptcy, the surety can in England act against the bankrupt's estate, not only in respect of payments made before the bankruptcy of the principal debtor, but also, it seems, in respect of the contingent liability to pay under the guarantee.See Ex parte Delmar re Herepath, 38 W.R. 752 (1889) If the creditor has already acted, the surety who has paid the guaranteed debt has a right to all dividends received by the creditor from the bankrupt in respect to the guaranteed debt, and to stand in the creditor's place as to future dividends.This right is, however, often waived by the guarantee stipulating that, until the creditor has received full payment of all sums over and above the guaranteed debt, due to him from the principal debtor, the surety shall not participate in any dividends distributed from the bankrupt's estate amongst his creditors. The rights of the surety against the creditor are in England exercisable even by one who in the first instance was a principal debtor, but has since become a surety, by arrangement with his creditor.Rouse v. The Bradford Banking Co., 1894 A.C. 586 Rights of surety against the creditor The surety's principal right against the creditor entitles him, after payment of the guaranteed debt, to the benefit of all securities which the creditor held against the principal debtor. If the creditor has lost these securities by default or laches or rendered them otherwise unavailable, the surety is discharged pro tanto. This right, which is not in abeyance till the surety is called on to pay extends to all securities, whether satisfied or not.Dixon v. Steel, 1901, 2 Ch. 602 \\"[E]very person who being surety for the debt or duty of another, or being liable with another for any debt or duty, shall pay such debt or perform such duty, shall be entitled to have assigned to him, or to a trustee for him, every judgment, specialty, or other security, which shall be held by the creditor in respect of such debt or duty, whether such judgment, specialty, or other security shall or shall not be deemed at law to have been satisfied by the payment of the debt or performance of the duty, and such person shall be entitled to stand in the place of the creditor, and to use all the remedies, and, if need be, and upon a proper indemnity, to use the name of the creditor, in any action or other proceeding at law or in equity, in order to obtain from the principal debtor, or any co-surety, co-contractor, or co-debtor, as the case may be, indemnification for the advances made and loss sustained by the person who shall have so paid such debt or performed such duty; and such payment or performance so made by such surety shall not be pleadable in bar of any such action or other proceeding by him, provided always that no co-surety, co-contractor, or co-debtor shall be entitled to recover from any other co- surety, co-contractor, or co-debtor, by the means aforesaid, more than the just proportion to which, as between those parties themselves, such last- mentioned person shall be justly liable\\".Mercantile Law Amendment Act, 1856, ¬ß5 The right of the surety to be subrogated on payment by him of the guaranteed debt, to all the rights of the creditor against the principal debtor is recognized in AmericaTobin v. Kirk, 80 New York S.C.R. 229 and many other countries.Codes Civil, France and Belgium 2029; Spain, 1839; Portugal 839; Germany, - 994; Netherlands, 1877; Italy, 1916; Lower Canada, 2959; Egypt [mixed suits], 617; ibid. [native tribunals], 505 Rights of surety against other sureties A surety is entitled to contribution from a co-surety in respect of their common liability. This particular right is not the result of any contract, but is derived from an equity, on the ground of equality of burden and benefit, and exists whether the sureties be bound jointly, or jointly and severally, and by the same, or different, instruments. There is, however, no right of contribution where each surety is severally bound for a given portion only of the guaranteed debt; nor in the case of a surety for a surety;See In re Denton's Estate, 1904, 2 Ch. 178 C.A. nor where a person becomes a surety jointly with another and at the latter's request. Contribution may be enforced, either before payment, or as soon as the surety has paid more than his share of the common debt;Wolmershausen v. Gullick, 1893, 2 Ch. 514 and the amount recoverable is now always regulated by the number of solvent sureties, though formerly this rule only prevailed in equity. In the event of the bankruptcy of a surety, proof can be made against his estate by a co-surety for any excess over the latter's contributive share. The right of contribution is not the only right possessed by co-sureties against each other, but they are also entitled to the benefit of all securities which have been taken by any one of them as an indemnity against the liability incurred for the principal debtor. The Roman law did not recognize the right of contribution among sureties. It is, however, sanctioned by many existing codes.Code Civil France and Belgium 2033; Germany, 426,474; Italy, 1920; Netherlands, 1881; Spain, 1844; Portugal 845; Lower Canada, 1955; Egypt [mixed suits], 618, ibid. [native tribunals], 506; Indian Contract Act 1872, ¬ß¬ß146-147 Discharge of liability The most prolific ground of discharge of a guarantor usually arises from the creditor's conduct. The governing principle is that if the creditor violates any rights which the surety possessed when he entered into the suretyship, even though the damage is only nominal, the guarantee cannot be enforced. The surety's discharge may be accomplished (1) by a variation of the terms of the contract between the creditor and the principal debtor, or of that between the creditor and the surety;See Rickaby v. Lewis, 22 T.L.R. 130 (2) by the creditor taking a new security from the principal debtor in lieu of the original one; (3) by the creditor discharging the principal debtor from liability; (4) by the creditor binding himself to give time to the principal debtor for payment of the guaranteed debt; or (5) by loss of securities received by the creditor in respect of the guaranteed debt. The first four of these acts are collectively termed a novation. In general whatever extinguishes the principal obligation necessarily determines that of the surety, not only in England but elsewhere.Codes Civil, France and Belgium 2034, 2038; Spain 1847; Portugal 848; Lower Canada, 1956; 1960; Egypt [mixed suits], 622, ibid. [native tribunals], 509; Indian Contract Act 1872, sec. 134 By most civil codes the surety is discharged by conduct of the creditor inconsistent with the surety's rights,See Codes Civil France and Belgium 2037; Spain, 1852; Portugal 853; Germany, 776; Italy, 1928; Egypt [mixed suits], 623 although the rule prevailing in England, Scotland, America and India which releases the surety from liability when the creditor extends without the surety's consent the time for fulfilling the principal obligation, while recognized by two existing codes civil,Codes Civil Spain, 1851; Portugal 852 is rejected by the majority of them.Codes Civil France and Belgium 2039; Netherlands, 1887; Italy, 1930; Lower Canada, 1961; Egypt [mixed suits], 613; ib. [native tribunals], 503); see Morice, English and Dutch Law, p. 96; van der Linden, Institutes of Holland, pp. 120-121 A revocation of the contract of suretyship by act of the parties, or in certain cases by the death of the surety, may also operate to discharge the surety. The death of a surety does not per se determine the guarantee, but, save where from its nature the guarantee is irrevocable by the surety himself, it can be revoked by express notice after his death, or by the creditor becoming receiving constructive notice of the death; except where, under the testator's will, the executor has the option of continuing the guarantee, in which case the executor should specifically withdraw the guarantee in order to terminate it. If one of a number of joint and several sureties dies, the future liability of the survivors continues, at least until it has been terminated by express notice. In such a case, however, the estate of the deceased surety would be relieved from liability. The statute of limitations may bar the right of action on guarantees subject to variation by statute in any U.S. state where the guarantee is sought to be enforced.

Appearing between April 30 and May 1, 1006 AD in the constellation of Lupus, this \\"guest star\\" was described by observers across the modern day countries of China, Japan, Iraq, Egypt, and the continent of Europe, and possibly recorded in North American petroglyphs. Some reports state it was clearly visible in the daytime. Modern astronomers now consider its distance from Earth to be about 7,200 light-years. Historic reports Egyptian astrologer and astronomer Ali ibn Ridwan, writing in a commentary on Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos, stated that the \\"spectacle was a large circular body, 2 to 3 times as large as Venus. The sky was shining because of its light. The intensity of its light was a little more than a quarter that of Moon light\\" (or perhaps \\"than the light of the Moon when one-quarter illuminated\\"). Like all other observers, Ali ibn Ridwan noted that the new star was low on the southern horizon. Some astrologers interpreted the event as a portent of plague and famine. The most northerly sighting is recorded in the annals of the Abbey of Saint Gall in Switzerland, at a latitude of 47.5¬∞ North.http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/fr/csg/0915/222 Monks at St Gall provide independent data as to its magnitude and location in the sky, writing that \\"[i]n a wonderful manner this was sometimes contracted, sometimes diffused, and moreover sometimes extinguished... It was seen likewise for three months in the inmost limits of the south, beyond all the constellations which are seen in the sky\\".The Arabic and Latin texts are in This description is often taken as probable evidence that the supernova was of Type Ia. Some sources state that the star was bright enough to cast shadows; it was certainly seen during daylight hours for some time. According to Songshi, the official history of the Song Dynasty (sections 56 and 461), the star seen on 1 May 1006 appeared to the south of constellation Di, east of Lupus and one degree to the west of Centaurus. It shone so brightly that objects on the ground could be seen at night. By December, it was again sighted in the constellation Di. The Chinese astrologer Zhou Keming, who was on his return to Kaifeng from his duty in Guangdong, interpreted the star to the emperor on May 30 as an auspicious star, yellow in color and brilliant in its brightness, that would bring great prosperity to the state over which it appeared. The reported color yellow should be taken with some suspicion however, because Zhou may have chosen a favorable color for political reasons. There appear to have been two distinct phases in the early evolution of this supernova. There was first a three-month period at which it was at its brightest; after this period it diminished, then returned for a period of about eighteen months. A petroglyph by the Hohokam in White Tank Mountain Regional Park, Arizona, has been interpreted as the first known North American representation of the supernova, though other researchers remain skeptical. Earlier observations discovered from Yemen may have seen SN 1006 on April 17, two weeks before its previously assumed earliest observation. Remnant SN 1006 remnant expansion comparison SN 1006's associated supernova remnant from this event was not identified until 1965, when Doug Milne and Frank Gardner used the Parkes radio telescope to demonstrate a connection to known radio source, PKS 1459-41. This is located near the star Beta Lupi, displaying a 30 arcmin circular shell. X-ray and optical emission from this remnant have also been detected, and during 2010 the H.E.S.S. gamma-ray observatory announced the detection of very-high-energy gamma-ray emission from the remnant. No associated neutron star or black hole has been found, which is the situation expected for the remnant of a Type Ia supernova (a class of explosion believed to completely disrupt its progenitor star). A survey in 2012 to find any surviving companions of the SN 1006 progenitor found no subgiant or giant companion stars, indicating that SN 1006 was most likely a double degenerate progenitor, that is, the merging of two white dwarf stars. Remnant SNR G327.6+14.6 has an estimated distance of 2.2 kpc. from Earth, making the true linear diameter approximately 20 parsecs. Effect on Earth Research has suggested that Type Ia supernovae can irradiate the Earth with significant amounts of gamma-ray flux, compared with the typical flux from the Sun, up to distances on the order of 1 kiloparsec. The greatest risk is to the Earth's protective ozone layer, producing effects on life and climate. While SN 1006 did not appear to have such significant effects, a signal of its outburst can be found in nitrate deposits in Antarctic ice.

He is best known for the comic strip Barnaby (1942‚Äì1952) and the Harold series of books beginning with Harold and the Purple Crayon. From 1965 until his death Johnson created over a hundred paintings relating to mathematics and mathematical physics. Eighty of these are found in the collections of the National Museum of American History.National Museum of American History page on Crocket Johnson, with images of paintings Biography Born in New York City, Johnson grew up in Corona, Queens, New York, attended PS 16 and Newtown High School. He studied art at Cooper Union in 1924, and at New York University in 1925.\\"Harold, Barnaby, and Dave: A Biography of Crockett Johnson\\". Philip Nel. He explained his choice of pseudonym as follows: \\"Crockett is my childhood nickname. My real name is David Johnson Leisk. Leisk was too hard to pronounce -- so -- I am now Crockett Johnson!\\" By the late 1920s, Johnson was art editor at several McGraw-Hill trade publications. With the Great Depression, Johnson became politicized and turned leftward, joining the radical Book and Magazine Writers Union. In 1934, he began his cartooning career by contributing to the Communist Party publication New Masses and subsequently joined the publication's staff, becoming its art editor and redesigning the magazine's layout. He remained with the magazine until 1940 and embarked on a career drawing comic strips in a series in Collier's magazine named \\"The Little Man with the Eyes\\". In 1942, he developed the Barnaby strip which would make him famous for the left-wing daily newspaper PM. The children's book Harold and the Purple Crayon was published in 1955. He died of lung cancer in 1975. Children's books Johnson also collaborated on four children's books with his wife, Ruth Krauss. The books were: The Carrot Seed, How to Make an Earthquake, Is This You?, and The Happy Egg. The books Harold and the Purple Crayon, Harold's Fairy Tale, and A Picture for Harold's Room have been adapted for animation by Gene Deitch. Mathematical paintings \\"Polar Line of a Point and a Circle (Apollonius)\\" Johnson created his series of more than 100 mathematical paintings inspired by geometric principles and mathematicians. He painted layered geometric shapes in the paintings, based on classic mathematical theorems and diagrams in James Newman‚Äôs The World of Mathematics as well as other mathematics books. Later, he began to construct using his own inventions. Most of Johnson's abstract images are painted with house paint on the rough side of a two-by-three foot piece of masonite, save those he enlarged to four-by-four, he explained in a letter. Johnson made an effort to differentiate his paintings from contemporary art in that his are based on the mathematics of geometry, not solely the shapes. In his 1971 article titled \\"Geometric Geometric Painting,\\" published in Leonardo, Johnson describes this type of geometric painting as using shapes and lines to experiment with color and optic illusion for decoration, the evocation of emotion, representation of ancient symbols or other purposes unrelated to geometry.

Jones was descended from Puritan, Huguenot, Quaker and Methodist ancestors. Her forefathers were among the patriots of the American Revolution. She wrote a number of war poems during the Civil War. These were published, with others, in book form. Ill health for a number of years made it impossible for her to keep up her literary work. Some of her poems appeared in Scribner's Magazine while others were published in the Century, Our Continent, and other journals. She published a volume of verse entitled A Prairie Idyl and Other Poems. She made her home in Chicago, Illinois. Early life and education Jones was born in East Bloomfield, New York, on October 19, 1835, the fourth child of Henry and Mary Alma (Mott) Jones. She attended district schools in East Bloomfield and Black Rock, New York; she completed normal school training at the East Aurora Academy in New York and began teaching at the age of fifteen. Influence of spiritualism Influenced by the writings of Thomas Dick and the spiritualism movement, Jones became a convert to spiritualism in 1854 and believed herself to be a medium. In 1869, believing that the spirits wanted her there, she moved to Chicago, where she wrote for a number of periodicals, including Western Rural, Universe, Interior, and Bright Sides. Patents and inventions ‚Äì 1872‚Äì1880 In 1872, Jones developed a vacuum canning process for preserving food, with the help of Professor Leroy C. Cooley of Albany, who was the brother-in-law of her sister Emily. The following year she obtained five patents relating to her process, of which two listed her as sole inventor. Again following the advice of the spirits she communicated with, she developed another invention, an oil burner, which she patented in 1880. However, her attempts to establish businesses based on her inventions were unsuccessful, and she returned to writing, publishing A Prairie Idyll in 1882.\\"Jones, Amanda Theodosia,\\" Notable American Women: A Biographical Dictionary, Volumes 1‚Äì3: 1607‚Äì1950. Edward T. James, Janet Wilson James, Paul Boyer, Eds. Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1974, vol. 2, pp.284‚Äì85. There is one reference (Stanley, Autumn ‚Äì See Bibliography) that maintains she has a patent for a Ready-Opener Tin Can, but that is the only, unsupported, reference to this patent. Founding of Women's Canning and Preserving Company ‚Äì 1890 A strong supporter of women's rights and suffrage, she founded the Women's Canning and Preserving Company in Chicago in 1890, which employed only women. In an address to her employees, Jones said that \\"This is a woman's industry. No man will vote our stock, transact our business, keep our books, pronounce on women's wages, supervise our factories. Give men whatever work is suitable, but keep the governing power. This is a business training school for working women ‚Äì you with all the rest. Here is a mission; let it be fulfilled.\\"Amanda Jones, A Psychic Autobiography, with introduction by James H. Hyslop. Published/Created: New York: Greaves Publishing Co., c1910., p. 414. When this venture failed in 1893, she left Chicago for Junction City, Kansas, where two of her sisters lived. Later life Jones continued to work with both of her inventions, obtaining patents on the canning process in 1903, 1905, and 1906, and additional patents relating to the oil burner in 1904, 1912, and 1914. She continued to publish occasional literary works, including the Rubaiyat of Solomon and Other Poems in 1905. Following the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War the U.S. Navy began investigating the transition from coal fired ships to oil. In 1904 they released a 489-page report which detailed extensively a comparison between coal and oil. Jones was asked to write a technical review of the report for Engineer: With which is Incorporated Steam Engineering. According to her obituary she was paid liberally for her contribution of four articles in 1904 and 1905. Those articles are online at the HathiTrust: * THE LIQUID FUEL PROBLEM Part I (Vol 41 ‚Äì 1904 ‚Äì pages 821‚Äì822) (A Review of the Completed \\"Report of the U.S. Navy Liquid Fuel Board,issued Sept., 1904).The Engineer, with which is incorporated steam engineering. 1881. http://catalog.hathitrust.org/api/volumes/oclc/2446704.html. * THE LIQUID FUEL PROBLEM ‚Äì II (Vol 41 ‚Äì 1904 ‚Äì pages 855‚Äì856) * THE LIQUID FUEL PROBLEM ‚Äì III (Vol 42 ‚Äì 1905 ‚Äì page 90) * THE LIQUID FUEL PROBLEM ‚Äì IV (Vol.42 ‚Äì 1905 pages 108‚Äì109) In 1910, she published her autobiography, A Psychic Autobiography, which focused on her interest in spiritualism. Late in her life, she moved to Brooklyn, New York, to pursue business interests, where she died of influenza in 1914.Obituary:The Junction City Daily Union (Junction City, Kansas), 1 April 1914, page 3.Most sources say influenza while obituary says pneumonia She was listed in Who's Who in America for 1912‚Äì13 and in Woman's Who's Who in America for 1914‚Äì15. She is buried in Riverside Cemetery, Cleveland, Ohio in her brother William's plot. Works She quit teaching in 1854 after her first poem was published by the Ladies' Repository of Cincinnati. In 1861, she published Ulah, and Other Poems; a second book of verse, Poems, was published in 1867. Her health had been fragile since contracting tuberculosis in 1859; after the publication of Poems, she spent a year recuperating at the home of her widowed mother in Wisconsin.

He the was the first mobster to be convicted under the RICO Act. Early life Tieri was born on February 22, 1904 in Castel Gandolfo, a little town south of Rome, to Carmela Tofano and Augustino Tieri, and had two sisters, Assunta and Antonietta. With his family, from Naples immigrated to New York in 1911. Tieri was denied US citizenship twice living as a resident alien in Brooklyn. Tieri lived in a modest home in the Bath Beach section of Brooklyn with his wife and two granddaughters. His mistress, a former opera singer from Italy, lived in a house a few blocks away. Tieri claimed to be an employee of a sportswear manufacturer. Boss In 1972, after the murder of Genovese acting boss Thomas Eboli, Tieri became the boss of the Genovese family. At that time, it was speculated that Gambino crime family boss Carlo Gambino had ordered Eboli's murder because Eboli owed him $4 million. According to this theory, Gambino wanted Tieri to be boss of the Genovese family. However, most experts now believe that Tieri was merely a front for the Genoveses' actual boss, Philip \\"Benny Squint\\" Lombardo. Luigi Angelo Martino, \\"the architect\\" for money laundering for the Genovese family, served directly under him. Tieri was considered a low-profile and diplomatic mobster, a good earner for the family who believed in sharing the wealth with his capos and soldiers. He was convicted of armed robbery when he was aged twenty but avoided further indictments until the end of his life. Given that Tieri was a front boss, it is unknown how much power Lombardo allowed him. However, Tieri did have a reputation as orderly and smart manager who used violence only as a last resort. Bruno assassination In 1980, Tieri played a key role in the assassination of Philadelphia crime family boss Angelo Bruno and the opening of Atlantic City, New Jersey to the New York crime families. The State of New Jersey had announced the introduction of legal casino gambling in Atlantic City and the New York families wanted to open operations there. However, Atlantic City belonged to the Philadelphia family and Bruno wasn't willing to share it. In March 1980, Tieri sent a message to Philadelphia capo Antonio Caponigro that the Mafia Commission would support him as boss if he assassinated Bruno. What Caponigro didn't know was that the Commission had no intention of sanctioning Bruno's murder. On March 21, 1980, Bruno was murdered in his car on a Philadelphia street. The Commission immediately summoned Caponigro to New York for a meeting; two weeks later, his body was discovered in New York with $20 bills stuffed in his orifices. However, the New York families did achieve access to Atlantic City. Conviction and death Federal prosecutors eventually charged Tieri with being the head of a crime family that was involved in racketeering, extortion and illegal gambling. On January 23, 1981, the ailing Tieri, using a wheelchair and an oxygen tank, was convicted of violating the RICO act. At the sentencing, Tieri's lawyers argued for leniency, saying that he was dying. Prosecutors told the judge it was an act, and the judge sent Tieri to prison for ten years. On March 29, 1981, Tieri died of natural causes at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. He is buried in Saint John's Cemetery, Queens, New York.

After the victory at Berryville as the month began, Union Maj. Gen. Philip H. Sheridan sought information about the troop strength of Confederate Lt. Gen. Jubal A. Early. Earlier in the year, his subordinate Union Gen. George Crook had met Rebecca Wright, a Quaker schoolteacher and Union sympathizer in Winchester, a commercial center and transportation hub at the northern end of the Shenandoah Valley with many Confederate sympathizers and which changed hands 75 times during the war. Slave Thomas Laws of Millwood (between Berryville and Winchester) had a Confederate permit to sell produce in Winchester three days per week, and agreed to act as a Union spy. On September 16, Laws took Sheridan's letter (hidden in his mouth) to Wright, who consulted her mother and then replied (in a note which Laws also hid in his mouth) that a Confederate officer recovering from his wounds had recently bragged about Confederate artillery and infantry battalions under General Joseph B. Kershaw and Lt. Col. Wilfred E. Cutshaw having left Winchester to raid the B&O; Railroad at Martinsburg, in the new state of West Virginia.https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=46960Friends Intelligencer, Vol. 69, p. 389, available at https://books.google.com/books?id=Xpg6AQAAMAAJ&pg;=PA389&lpg;=PA389 Accordingly, Sheridan advanced toward Winchester along the Berryville Pike with the VI Corps and XIX Corps, crossing Opequon Creek. The Union advance was delayed long enough for Early to concentrate his forces to meet the main assault, which continued for several hours. Casualties were very heavy. The Confederate line was gradually driven back toward the town. Mid-afternoon, the Army of West Virginia and the cavalry turned the Confederate left flank. Early ordered a general retreat. Because of its size, intensity, serious casualties on both sides (particularly among the general officers) and its result (Confederates never again controlling Winchester and President Abraham Lincoln winning re-election), many historians consider this the most important conflict of the Shenandoah Valley.NPS. Sheridan would later give much of the credit for the victory to \\"the brave Quaker girl\\", whose intelligence he thought worth a brigade of troops. Background=Military situation Sheridan was given command of the Army of the Shenandoah and sent to the Shenandoah Valley to deal with Early's Confederate threat. For much of the early fall of 1864, Sheridan and Early had cautiously engaged in minor skirmishes while each side tested the other's strength. Early mistook this limited action to mean that Sheridan was afraid to fight, and he left his army spread out from Martinsburg to Winchester. Sheridan learned of Early's dispersed forces and immediately struck out after Winchester, the location of two previous major engagements during the war, both Confederate victories. Opposing forces=UnionConfederate=Battle Map of the Third Battle of Winchester Early quickly gathered his army back together at Winchester just in time to meet Sheridan's attack on September 19. The Union forces coming in from the east had to march on the narrow road through Berryville Canyon, which soon got clogged up with supply wagons and troops, delaying the attack. This delay allowed Early to further strengthen his lines. Maj. Gen. John B. Gordon's division arrived from the north and took up position on the Confederate left. At 11:40 A.M., Sheridan attacked with Maj. Gen. Horatio G. Wright's Union VI Corps on the left flank astride the Berryville Turnpike and the XIX Corps, under Maj. Gen. William H. Emory, occupying the ground from Wright's right flank northward to Red Bud Run. The Sixth Corps was supported by well placed batteries but Emory had no artillery going into the battle due to the rugged and wooded nature of the terrain. After encountering heavy resistance from the Confederate divisions of Maj. Gen. Stephen D. Ramseur on the Berryville Pike and John B. Gordon's division (located in the Second Woods and Middle Field) in front of the XIX Corps, Sheridan succeeded in driving back the Confederates from their initial positions in confusion. Although Sheridan's initial attack was successful, the terrain and road network combined with fierce Confederate artillery created a large gap in the center of the Union battle line. Fortuitously for Early, Maj. Gen. Robert Rodes division arrived on the battle field and counterattacked into this gap, forcing both the VI and XIX Corps to retreat. Ramseur and Gordon rallied their divisions and joined in the counterattack. Shortly after Rodes's troops advanced to the attack, he was struck by a shell fragment that mortally wounded him, robbing Early of his best subordinate general. His troops continued their attacking unaware of his fall. Sheridan, however, closed the breach by advancing the reserve divisions of the VI and XIX Corps. The VI Corps division of Brig. Gen. David Russell, who like Rodes, lost his life restoring the broken battle line, restored the broken line in the vicinity of the Berryville Pike to Ash Hollow in the center. In the northern sector of the battlefield, Brig. Gen William Dwight's division held the Union right flank after much bitter fighting against Gordon and elements of Rodes's command. At this time, approximately 2:00 P.M., a lull developed over the Berryville Pike sector of the battlefield, although Gordon kept up the pressure against Emory's XIX Corps in the Middle Field near Red Bud Run. Sheridan's final charge at Winchester. When the outcome of the 11:40 A.M. attack seemed in doubt, Sheridan sent the Army of West Virginia under Brig. Gen. George Crook to locate the Confederate left flank and look out for and protect the right flank of the XIX Corps. Sheridan also ordered Brig. Gen. James H. Wilson's cavalry division to advance toward Early's right flank and cut off his line of retreat from Winchester. Wilson started late and did not succeed in his mission in spite of the weak nature of the Confederates in his front. Sheridan rode to his right flank where he found the hard pressed XIX Corps and vociferously assured General Emory that Crook was coming up and that the Union forces would whip the rebels. Crook reached the Union right flank, he found Sheridan waiting for him and advanced into the First Woods toward the Middle Field where Dwight's division was still hanging on after taking heavy losses in its fight with Gordon. Crook decided to relieve the XIX Corps with Col. Joseph Thoburn's division and then personally led Col. Isaac Duval's division on a flank march north of Red Bud Run and attack Gordon's left flank. Just before Crook's attack struck, Col. George Patton, grandfather of Gen. George Patton, and his brigade of Confederate infantry took position behind a stone wall along Hackwood Lane and covered Gordon's left flank and rear. Crook began the attack north of Red Bud Run and was soon joined by Thoburn's division. Although Duval's encountered a nearly impassable swamp, the men quickly detoured around the morass with some struggling through to continue the assault. At the same time, Thoburn's direct attack on Gordon combined with Duval's threatening presence caused the Confederate position to collapse. Patton found his brigade sandwiched between converging columns of Crook's infantry from the east and north and Col. Thomas Devin's Union cavalry brigade from the west. Patton was mortally wounded by a shell fragment during the withdrawal and his brigade was shattered, losing hundreds of men cut off and captured with every regimental battle flag being captured by the Union cavalry. Gordon rallied his men behind a stone wall that ran at right angles to his original position and checked Crook's continued advance. Rickett's division of the VI Corps attacks Rodes's division When Crook attacked, Sheridan ordered the VI Corps to join the attack. Ramseurs' and Brig. Gen. Cullen Battle's (Rodes) divisions and Col. Tom Carter's southern artillery offered stout resistance to the VI Corps attack. Sheridan rode along its battle line, rallying and inspiring the troops as he moved toward the Berryville Pike. General Emory Upton (commanding Russell's division) was driving back Battle's left flank when a Confederate shell fragment knocked him out of the battle. The surgeon was able to stop the bleeding and Upton ordered a stretcher brought forward from which he watched the closing scenes of the battle while Col. Oliver Edwards led the division in the final advance on Winchester. As the infantry pressed the stubborn Confederates back toward Winchester, Maj. Gen. Alfred Torbert's two divisions of cavalry charged down the Valley Pike shattering Early's left flank and getting behind his infantry. Early counterattacked with Brig. General Gabriel Wharton's two brigades of infantry, temporarily halting the horsemen. The division of Brig. Gen. Wesley Merritt regrouped and crushed the entrenched Confederate left while Crook's infantry hit Wharton and Gordon head on driving them back to the Smithfield Redoubt where they made another brief stand. At the same time, the division of Brig. Gen. William W. Averell charged up the western side of the Valley or Martinsburg Turnpike, driving back the remnants of Early's cavalry and capturing one piece of artillery. Averell continued his attack routing Confederate cavalry who attempted to rally at Star Fort and then pressing on toward Winchester. Col. Thomas Munford's Confederate brigade drove Averell's advance back on Fort Hill, buying enough time to allow thousands of Early's troops to avoid entrapment and capture before Colonel James Schoonmacher's brigade secured the heights. The Confederate army was in full retreat, \\"whirling through Winchester.\\" As the Southern troops raced through Winchester in confusion, a number of ladies of the town including the wife of General Gordon joined arms and attempted to shame the men back to the battlefield, but the reality of the situation rendered their efforts fruitless. Sheridan had won the Third Battle of Winchester and U. S. forces held Winchester for the balance of the war and into Reconstruction. Aftermath The battle marked a turning point in the Shenandoah Valley in favor of the North. Early's army for the most part remained intact but suffered further defeats at Fisher's Hill and Tom's Brook. Exactly a month later, the Valley Campaigns came to a close after Early's defeat at the Battle of Cedar Creek. Victory in the Valley, along with other Union victories in the fall of 1864, helped win re-election for Abraham Lincoln, as Sheridan would later point out as a male attempted to oust Wright from her government job.http://www.historynet.com/woman-worth- whole-brigade.htm The battle was particularly damaging due to the number of casualties among key commanders. In the Union army, Brig. Gen. David A. Russell was killed and Brig. Gens. Emory Upton, George H. Chapman, and John B. McIntosh were seriously wounded. Confederate Maj. Gen. Robert E. Rodes was killed and Maj. Gen. Fitzhugh Lee, Brig. Gens. William Terry, Archibald C. Godwin, and Col. William Wharton were wounded. Also among the Confederate dead was Col. George S. Patton, Sr. His grandson and namesake would become the famous U.S. general of World War II, George S. Patton, Jr. Medals of Honor During the battle, fourteen Union enlisted men and one officer received the Medal of Honor for their actions. Battlefield preservation Most of the preservation effort at the battlefield has been privately oriented. The Civil War Trust (a division of American Battlefield Trust) and its partners have acquired and preserved a total of of the 567-acre battlefield. American Battlefield Trust \\"Saved Land\\" webpage. Accessed May 29, 2018. One acquisition was made in 2009 by the Shenandoah Valley Battlefields Foundation, with participation by the Trust and the Virginia Land Conservation Foundation. At that time, these preservation groups purchased a 209-acre parcel known as the \\"Huntsberry Farm\\" tract, named for a family who lived on the land at the time of the battle, for $3.35 million. The Shenandoah Valley Battlefields Foundation is presently engaged in restoring the battlefield, focusing first on the key battle area south of Redbud Run. Restoration and interpretation of this area is underway, focusing on the infamous 30-acre Middle Field, in time for the 150th Anniversary of the battle in September, 2014.

The book is set many centuries in the future, though no dates are given. Humans have explored many worlds in a number of different galaxies. Their quest is for knowledge and to be helpful: there is a strict rule against 'interference'. The narrator, Mary, is a specialist in 'communication' - a kind of telepathy. She operates in a society where women are just as likely as men to be leaders, though she herself prefers not to lead. They also do pretty much as they please as regards sex and reproduction: Viola is a haploid human, conceived as a result of sexual interaction with a Martian - Martians being hermaphrodite. Ariel is an alien creature that could be seen either as a parasite or a kind of child. There are no space-opera thrills and fights: rather there are a number of different worlds with interesting biologies. In one case there is an ethical problem concerning some caterpillars and butterflies, both intelligent. Attitudes about sex and about alien cultures are similar to those of the New Wave, though it is not normally classed as part of it.

The historic production of jamdani was patronized by imperial warrants of the Mughal emperors. Under British colonialism, the Bengali jamdani and muslin industries rapidly declined due to colonial import policies favoring industrially manufactured textiles. In more recent years, the production of jamdani has witnessed a revival in Bangladesh. Jamdani is typically woven using a mixture of cotton and gold thread. In 2013, the traditional art of weaving jamdani was declared a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. In 2016, Bangladesh received geographical indication (GI) status for Jamdani Sari. Etymology Jamdani was originally known as Dhakai named after the city of Dhaka, one of many ancient textile weaving centers in Bengal region. Under the Mughal Empire the Persian term Jamdani came to be in popular use, since it was the court language of the Mughals. Jamdanis are popularly known as Dhakai Jamdani or simply Dhakai. The earliest mention of jamdani and its development as an industry is found into Dhaka, Bangladesh. Origin An early reference to Indian origins of muslin is found in the book of Periplus of the Erythraean Sea and in the accounts of Arab, Chinese and Italian travelers and traders. Jamdani is a hand loom woven fabric made of cotton, which was historically referred to as muslin. The Jamdani weaving tradition is of Bengali origin. It is one of the most time and labor-intensive forms of hand loom weaving, and is considered one of the finest varieties of muslin, and the most artistic textile of Bangladeshi weavers. Traditionally woven around Dhaka and created on the loom brocade, jamdani is rich in motifs. In the first half of the nineteenth century, James Taylor described the figured or flowered jamdani; in the late 19th century, T. N. Mukharji referred to this fabric as jamdani muslin. Weave Traditional way of weaving jamdani Whether figured or flowered, jamdani is a woven fabric in cotton. This is a supplementary weft technique of weaving, where the artistic motifs are produced by a non-structural weft, in addition to the standard weft that holds the warp threads together. The standard weft creates a fine, sheer fabric while the supplementary weft with thicker threads adds the intricate patterns to it. Each supplementary weft motif is added separately by hand by interlacing the weft threads into the warp with fine bamboo sticks using individual spools of thread. The result is a complex mix of different patterns that appear to float on a shimmering surface. The pattern is not sketched or outlined on the fabric, but is drawn on a graph paper and placed underneath the warp. Jamdani is a fine muslin cloth on which decorative motifs are woven on the loom, typically in grey and white. Often a mixture of cotton and gold thread was used. Varieties of jamdani work Though mostly used for saris, Jamdani is also used for scarves and handkerchiefs. Jamdani is believed to be a fusion of the ancient cloth-making techniques of Bengal (possibly 2,000 years old) with the muslins produced by Bengali Muslims since the 14th century. Jamdani is the most expensive product of Dhaka looms since it requires the most lengthy and dedicated work. Jamdani patterns are mostly of geometric, plant, and floral designs and are said to have originated thousands of years ago. Due to the exquisite painstaking methodology required, only aristocrats and royal families were able to afford such luxuries. Changes with time We do not know exactly when jamdani came to be adorned with floral patterns of the loom. It is, however, certain that in the Mughal period, most likely during the reign of either Emperor Akbar (1556‚Äì1605) or Emperor Jahangir (1605‚Äì1627), the figured or flowered muslin came to be known as the jamdani. Forbes Watson in his most valuable work titled Textile Manufactures and Costumes of the people of India holds that the figured muslins, because of their complicated designs, were always considered the most expensive productions of the Dhaka looms. Decline and fall From the middle of the 19th century, there was a gradual decline in the jamdani industry. A number of factors contributed to this decline. The subsequent import of lower quality, but cheaper yarn from Europe, started the decline. Most importantly, the decline of Mughal power in India, deprived the producers of jamdani of their most influential patrons. Villages like Madhurapur and Jangalbari, (both in the Kishoreganj district), once famous for the jamdani industry went into gradual oblivion. Current problems Jamdani Sari for sale in Sonargaon, Bangladesh According to a national daily, a senior taanti or \\"ostad\\" earns about Tk 2,500 to Tk 3,000 per month. Junior weavers get much less, around Tk 1,600. As a result, many weavers do not want their children to come to the profession, preferring the more lucrative garments industry. The government and other organizations are trying to revive the old glory of Dhakai Jamdani. In a bid to avoid the middlemen, they are trying to establish direct contact with the weavers. A Jamdani Palli has been established near Dhaka. Jamdani, one of the oldest forms of cottage industry in Bangladesh, was once a dying trade. Organizations like Radiant Institute of Design, Shanto Mariam University of creative technology,National Institute of Design (NID) and others are helping designers create new Jamdani designs. Jamdani is a symbol of aristocracy. The demand for quality Jamdani Sarees has increased exponentially over the years.  Geographical indication  In 2016, Bangladesh received geographical indication (GI) status for Jamdani Sari. It was the first GI status given to any Bangladeshi product.

Great Harwood is the major conurbation of the 'Three Towns'; the three towns being Great Harwood, Clayton-le-Moors, and Rishton. In 2001, the town had a population of 11,220,Lancashire Profile lancashire.gov.uk which decreased to 10,800 at the census of 2011. History Great Harwood is a town with an industrial heritage. The Mercer Hall Leisure Centre in Queen Street, and the town clock, pay tribute to John Mercer (1791‚Äì1866), the 'father' of Great Harwood, who revolutionised the cotton dyeing process with his invention of mercerisation.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography - subscription based, accessed 15 June 2011 The cotton industry became the main source of employment in the town, and by 1920, the Great Harwood Weavers' Association had more than 5,000 members. The town was once on the railway line from Blackburn to Burnley via Padiham ‚Äì The North Lancs or Great Harwood Loop of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. The last passenger train ran in November 1957 and goods traffic in 1964. The Martholme Viaduct on the line remains about one mile north east. Public transport links were further curtailed in 2016, when the direct bus link to Manchester was axed by Harrogate based Transdev. View of Blackburn Road, Great Harwood, circa 1910. Great Harwood used to have a lively and bustling market around the town clock in the main square. It was very popular, and drew people from across the county every week. It has declined in the last fifteen years, and almost disappeared, but having seen a small resurgence, it is now usually only a single stall which arrives every Friday with fruit, vegetables, fish, meat, clothes and pet supplies. More recently, there has been a very popular farmers market held each first Sunday of every month. Stalls include rare selections of organic meat, traditional Malkin pie, fish and shell fish stall, luxury body care stalls, European stalls, locally brewed beer stalls, art and crafts and jewelry stalls. Great Harwood has three supermarkets: Aldi, which opened in November 2010, Tesco, which opened in December 2011, and Morrisons, which was previously Co-Op, which originally opened in June 2001, which also opened in 2010. There are two petrol stations, run by Texaco, as well as Morrisons. In July 2016, Domino's Pizza announced plans to open in Great Harwood, as well as Accrington. A retained fire station is also located in the town, having opened in 1972. Sports The town football team, Great Harwood Town, closed in July 2006. Great Harwood Cricket Club, was a member of the Ribblesdale Cricket League, winning the senior division in 2008, and has seven teams, ranging from under 9s through to senior level. In 2016, the club accepted an invitation from the Lancashire League, and played in that league from the season of 2017. In 1954, and again in 1957, the Great Harwood team won the Roller Hockey National Cup.

Searle is most notable for having developed the first female birth control pill, and the artificial sweetener NutraSweet.  History  Searle was founded in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1888, by Gideon Daniel Searle. In 1908, the company was incorporated in Chicago and in 1941, the company established headquarters in Skokie, Illinois. Donald Rumsfeld served as CEO, and then as president, of Searle between 1977 and 1985. During his tenure at Searle, Rumsfeld reduced the number of employees in the company by 60%. In 1985, he engineered the acquisition of Searle by Monsanto Corporation. In April 2000, Pharmacia Corporation was created by merging Pharmacia & Upjohn (which had come about as the result of an earlier merger of the companies Pharmacia and Upjohn) with Monsanto and its Searle unit. The merged company was based in Peapack, New Jersey. Pfizer acquired Pharmacia in 2003 and retired the Searle name. Robert B. Shapiro acted as general counsel for the firm from 1979 onwards, where he went on develop Searle's aspartame product under the brand name NutraSweet.

In 1993, a team of researchers at Searle Research and Development filed a patent application for celecoxib, which Searle developed and which became the first selective COX-2 inhibitor to be approved by the FDA on December 31, 1998. Control of this blockbuster drug was often mentioned as a key reason for Pfizer's acquisition of Pharmacia.  Notable products  The company manufactured prescription drugs and nuclear medicine imaging equipment. Searle is known for its release of Enovid, the first commercial oral contraceptive, in 1960. It is also known for its release of the first bulk laxative, Metamucil, in 1934; Dramamine, for motion sickness; the COX-2 inhibitors Celebrex and Bextra; Ambien for insomnia; and NutraSweet (also known as aspartame), an artificial sweetener, in 1965. It was released in 1981 by FDA. In 1996, the FDA removed all restrictions on the use of aspartame, which enabled its use in heated and baked goods. G. D.

It had ten issues before Palmer reverted its name in 1955. It has been reprinted several times, for instance in Sturgeon's collections E Pluribus Unicorn, Starshine, and A Saucer of Loneliness. The story takes its title from the subtitle of John Dryden's verse drama All for Love. Reception The tagline for the Universe cover was \\"[His] most daring story\\".Ruminations on The World Well Lost Its sensitive treatment of homosexuality was unusual for science fiction published at that time, and it is now regarded as a milestone in science fiction's portrayal of homosexuality.Eric Garber, Lyn Paleo Uranian Worlds: A Guide to Alternative Sexuality in Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror, p 130, G K Hall: 1983 According to an anecdote related by Samuel R. Delany, when Sturgeon first submitted the story, his editor not only rejected it but phoned every other editor he knew and urged them to reject it as well.Samuel R. Delany, Introduction to Uranian Worlds: A Guide to Alternative Sexuality in Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror, p xviii, Ed. Eric Garber, Lyn Paleo G K Hall: 1983  Plot summary  In the future, two members of an alien race called the Dirbanu come to Earth. They win humanity's heart by their grace and love for each other. Earth's media has dubbed them the \\"Loverbirds,\\" and almost everyone on Earth is touched by the Loverbirds' tender displays of wonder and affection. Dirbanu heretofore had almost no contact with Earth, except for one short investigative trip in which the ambassador of Dirbanu made clear that he found Earth disgusting. However, the Dirbanu government breaks the silence with Earth in order to demand the return of the Loverbirds. Allegedly, the Loverbirds are fugitive criminals and must be extradited. Earth's government, hoping to profit by cooperation with this powerful planet, dispatches spacers Rootes and Grunty to return the Loverbirds. Rootes, the Captain of the team, is an arrogant, loquacious womanizer. Grunty serves under the Captain. He is a hulking, taciturn poet, so-named because he grunts rather than speaks. Despite their radically different personalities, the two friends are famed in space travel circles for their teamwork and efficiency. They refuse to travel with any other spacers. The faster than light propulsion employed by Earthmen has the side-effect of stunning the human nervous system to a variable degree. Rootes is deeply affected, while Grunty is almost unaffected, resulting in an extensive period of time after each \\"jump\\" in which Grunty is the only aware entity on the ship, a situation that to him is priceless. While Rootes sleeps off the first jump, Grunty realizes that the Loverbirds are telepathic and have sensed a deep personal secret of his. Grunty prepares to kill them to protect his secret. To dissuade him from committing murder, the Loverbirds sketch for him a series of four drawings. The first is of Rootes, Grunty, and a beautiful human woman, all clothed. The second depicts all three humans nude. The third sketch depicts the Loverbirds themselves and a short, round extraterrestrial, all clothed. The fourth sketch depicts the three aliens nude. When viewed in sequence, it becomes clear that the short, round alien is a Dirbanu female. Dirbanu males and females vary vastly from each other in appearance. The two Loverbirds, whom humanity had presumed to be male and female because of their physical similarity to Earth males and females, were actually both male. When Grunty realizes the significance of the sketches, he sets them free in an escape pod. The escape pod heads away from the planet, towards the outer reaches of the universe. Upon awakening, Rootes is furious that Grunty has seemingly sabotaged the mission. Grunty justifies his actions by showing Rootes the four sketches. Realizing that the Loverbirds were a pair of male lovers, the outraged Rootes declares that he would have killed them if he had known. Grunty, having known this, allows Rootes to think this is why he set the Loverbirds free, avoiding the potential consequences if it were to be discovered that an Earth operative had killed Dirbanu citizens. His anger abated, Rootes is impressed by what he perceives as Grunty's cleverness. Pondering aloud, Rootes realizes that the Dirbanu government's reluctance to interact with Earth must be based on homophobia: since human males and females both resemble Dirbanu males, the Dirbanu were presumably disgusted by the impression that Earth is a \\"planet full of queens\\". Although the Dirbanu intellectually know that this is not the case, their visceral reaction to the concept nonetheless repels them. Rootes also hypothesizes that the Dirbanu government wanted to bring the Loverbirds home, as they were ashamed to have the Loverbirds viewed as representatives of the Dirbanu planet. Upon arriving at the Dirbanu homeworld, Rootes reports that the Loverbirds died of natural causes in transit, and the Earth ship is abruptly dismissed, leaving future interactions between the two worlds questionable. On the return trip, with Rootes again fallen unconscious, Grunty ponders him lovingly. The reader realizes that Grunty is gay and secretly in love with Rootes. Earlier in the story, the omniscient narrator had noted that the only way to destroy the pair's working bond would be to attempt \\"to explain it to Rootes\\". The story's conclusion clarifies the full meaning of this statement.

The square lies along Upper Broad Street and is on the northern shore of the Careenage (\\"Constitution River\\"), found directly in the centre of Bridgetown. Name The current name of National Heroes Square was adopted on 22 April 1999 and officially took effect on 28 April 1999.The Trafalgar Square (Change of Name) Act, CARICOM Law The name refers to the Barbadian National Heroes. In 2009, the government of David Thompson opened up a proposal to rename the area as \\"Parliament Square\\", and to completely redevelop and reconfigure the Square's layout. Statue of Lord Nelson A fixture of the Square on the west-end includes a bronze statue of British naval hero Vice Admiral Horatio, Lord Nelson. The statue in Bridgetown was erected unveiled on 22 March 1813 to commemorate the anniversary of the British Royal Navy's victory in the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. The local statue of Lord Nelson in Bridgetown was erected approximately 27 years before the more famous Nelson's Column in London, which serves as the centrepiece of Trafalgar Square. As a point of reference, the statue of Nelson frequently serves as the geographic centre of Bridgetown. Since the colonial period many distances on the island from Bridgetown have historically been measured from the base of Nelson's statue, so that the statue functions as Barbados' mile zero. The use of the Bajan Nelson statue as a centring point is similar to the London statue in the British Capital; however Trafalgar Square is adjacent to the actual historic and geographic centre of London, which is actually located, immediately to the east, in Charing Cross. The monument which serves as London's exact centre is therefore not of Nelson, but the equestrian statue of Charles I, at Charing Cross, facing down Whitehall, standing where the Queen Eleanor Memorial Cross had previously stood before being moved to the Charing Cross railway station forecourt.

There's a difference between a beauty salon and a beauty parlor which is that a beauty salon is a well developed space in a private location, usually having more features than a beauty parlor could have. Usually a beauty parlor concentrates on a specific treatment or beauty features such as styling either for men, women or for both. Also, a beauty parlor is a smaller and more community friendly place which is usually located at the owner's home. In some cases the owner is not only the boss, but probably the only worker, not having any other crew members. Other variations of this type of business include hair salons and spas. There is a distinction between a beauty salon and a hair salon and although many small businesses do offer both sets of treatments; beauty salons provide extended services related to skin health, facial aesthetics, foot care, nail manicures, aromatherapy ‚Äî even meditation, oxygen therapy, mud baths and many other services. Beauty treatments Facials may include the use of a facial mask. Massage for the body is a popular beauty treatment, with various techniques offering benefits to the skin (including the application of beauty products) and for increasing mental well-being. Hair removal is offered at some beauty salons through treatments such as waxing and threading. Some beauty salons style hair instead of going to a separate hair salon, and some also offer sun tanning. Other treatments of the face are known as facials.A facial is essentially a multi- step skin treatment that is one of the best ways to take care of your skin. A facial cleanses, exfoliates, and nourishes the skin, promoting a clear, well- hydrated complexion and can help your skin look younger. Specialized beauty salons known as nail salons offer treatments such as manicures and pedicures for the nails. A manicure is a treatment for the hands, incorporating the fingernails and cuticles and often involving the application of nail polish, while a pedicure involves treatment of the feet, incorporating the toenails and the softening or removal of calluses. Industry Beauty salons have proven to be a recession-proof industry across United States. Although sales had declined from 2008 highs due to the Great Recession, they remain robust with long term positive forecast. Even though during recessions, consumers tend to be more price conscious, spending continues to increase. With rising per capita incomes across the United States since 2015, beauty salons are booming with the industry generating $56.2 billion in the United States. Hair care is the largest segment with 86,000 locations. Skin care is expected to have revenue of almost $11 billion by 2018. This growth is being driven in part by a generally increasing awareness of the importance of skin care among American woman, but also specifically due to an increase in the market for men. The market is distributed widely across America, with a concentration in the Northeast and Midwest. There is also a growing trend in boutique salons popping up and leveraging online marketing to gain customers and compete with the franchise chains. The US Labor Department estimates employment in the United States will increase 20% between 2008‚Äì2014, with greatest employment growth from skin care specialists.Beauty salons employ cosmetologists specializing in general beautification techniques. Cosmetology licensing requirements vary from state to state, and depending on which specific type of license is desired; general cosmetologist, hair stylist, esthetician, manicurist, barber, electrologist, or other.

His official title is Chairman of the Board of the Religious Technology Center (RTC), a corporation that controls the trademarks and copyrights of Dianetics and Scientology. Miscavige was a deputy to Church founder L. Ron Hubbard (a \\"Commodore's messenger\\") while he was a teenager. He rose to a leadership position by the early 1980s and was named Chairman of the Board of RTC in 1987, the year after Hubbard's death. Official church biographies describe Miscavige as \\"the ecclesiastical leader of the Scientology religion\\". Since he assumed his leadership position, there have been a number of allegations made against Miscavige. These include claims of forced separation of family members, coercive fundraising practices, harassment of journalists and church critics, and emotional and physical abuse of subordinates by Miscavige. Miscavige and church spokespersons deny the majority of these claims, often criticizing the credibility of those who bring them.  Early life  David Miscavige was born in 1960 in Bristol Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, to the Roman Catholic Polish-Italian family of Ronald and Loretta Miscavige. Miscavige and his twin sister, Denise, were raised primarily in Willingboro Township, New Jersey.Nark, Jason. \\"From here to Scientology: Worldwide leader David Miscavige's Philly-area roots\\", The Philadelphia Inquirer, January 3, 2012.

Ron Hubbard.\\" As a child, Miscavige played baseball and football, but he suffered from asthma and severe allergies. His father, a trumpet player, became interested in Scientology, and he sent the younger Miscavige to see a Scientologist. According to both father and son, a 45-minute Dianetics session cured his ailments. Miscavige's family joined the Church of Scientology in 1971 and eventually moved to the church's world headquarters in Saint Hill Manor, England. By the age of twelve, Miscavige was conducting Scientology auditing sessions. Saint Hill served as his own training ground as an auditor, and he is remembered by the Church as the \\"12-year-old prodigy\\" who became the youngest professional Scientology auditor. The family returned to Philadelphia within a few years, where Miscavige attended Marple Newtown High School. In 1976, on his sixteenth birthday, Miscavige left high school with his father's permission to move to Clearwater, Florida and joined the Sea Org, a Scientologist religious order established in 1968 by Church founder L. Ron Hubbard. Some of his earliest jobs in the Sea Org included delivering telexes, groundskeeping, food service and taking photographs for Scientology brochures. Miscavige then joined a group of young Scientologists called the Commodore's Messenger Organization (CMO). The group started with running Hubbard's errands, but as they grew into adolescence, Hubbard increased their influence.Sappell, J., & Welkos, R. W. (June 24, 1990). The man in control series: The scientology story. today: The making of L. ron hubbard. first in a six-part series.NEXT: Part two-- the selling of scientology. Los Angeles Times (Pre-1997 Fulltext)  Leadership in Scientology  L. Ron Hubbard, science fiction author and founder of Scientology, appointed Miscavige as an assistant and groomed him for leadership. By 1977, Miscavige was living in La Quinta, California and working directly under Hubbard as a cameraman for Scientology training films. Hubbard appointed Miscavige to the CMO, responsible for enforcing Hubbard's policies within the individual Scientology organizations; Miscavige became head of the CMO in 1979. By 1980, Hubbard was no longer appearing at public functions related to Scientology, and by some accounts Miscavige took effective control of the organization at this time. In 1981, Miscavige was placed in charge of the Watchdog Committee and the All Clear Unit, with the task of handling the various legal claims against Hubbard. He also became in charge of Author Services, Inc., an entity to manage Hubbard's literary and financial affairs, which was established in the same year. After the Guardian's Office's (GO) criminal involvement in Operation Snow White, Miscavige persuaded Mary Sue Hubbard to resign from the GO and purged several top GO officials through ethics proceedings. The St. Petersburg Times, in a 1998 article \\"The Man Behind Scientology\\", says: \\"During two heated encounters, Miscavige persuaded Mary Sue Hubbard to resign. Together they composed a letter to Scientologists confirming her decision ‚Äì all without ever talking to L. Ron Hubbard.\\" She subsequently changed her mind, believing that she had been tricked. Despite this, Miscavige claims he and Mary Sue Hubbard remained friends thereafter. In 1982, Miscavige set up a new organizational structure to release Hubbard from personal liability and to handle the Scientology founder's personal wealth through a corporate entity outside of the Scientology organization. He established the Religious Technology Center (RTC), in charge of licensing Scientology's intellectual property, and Author Services Inc. to manage the proceeds. Miscavige has held the title of Chairman of the Board of the RTC since the organization's founding. The Church of Spiritual Technology (CST) was created at the same time with an option to repurchase all of RTC's intellectual property rights. In a 1982 probate case, Ronald DeWolf, Hubbard's estranged son, accused Miscavige of embezzling from and manipulating his father. Hubbard denied this in a written statement, saying that his business affairs were being well managed by Author Services Inc., of which Miscavige was also Chairman of the Board. In the same document, Hubbard called Miscavige a \\"trusted associate\\" and \\"good friend\\" who had kept his affairs in good order. A judge ruled the statement was authentic. The case was dismissed on June 27, 1983. In October 1982, Miscavige required Scientology Missions to enter new trademark usage contracts which established stricter policies on the use of Scientology materials. Over the two years following the formation of the RTC, Miscavige and his team replaced most of Scientology's upper and middle management. A number of those ousted attempted to establish breakaway organizations, such as the Advanced Ability Center led by David Mayo, a former RTC board member who had also been Hubbard's personal auditor. The Advanced Ability Center closed in 1984, two years after opening. When Hubbard died in 1986, Miscavige announced Hubbard's death to Scientologists at the Hollywood Palladium. Shortly before Hubbard died, an apparent order from him circulated in the Sea Org that promoted Scientologist Pat Broeker and his wife to the new rank of Loyal Officer, making them the highest-ranking members; Miscavige asserted this order had been forged. After Hubbard's death, Miscavige assumed the position of head of the Scientology organization. Miscavige holds the rank of Captain, and is the highest-ranking member of the Sea Org.  Relationship with the IRS  In 1991, Miscavige, together with Marty Rathbun, visited the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) headquarters in Washington, D.C. to arrange a meeting with Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg, Jr.. For more than two decades, the IRS had refused to recognize Scientology as a nonprofit charitable organization, a status granted to most established religious organizations. Prior to this meeting, Scientology had filed more than fifty lawsuits against the IRS and, according to The New York Times: At the meeting with Commissioner Goldberg, Miscavige offered to cease Scientology's suits against the IRS in exchange for tax exemptions. This led to a two-year negotiating process, in which IRS tax analysts were ordered to ignore the substantive issues because the issues had been resolved prior to review. Ultimately, Scientology was granted recognition as a nonprofit religious or charitable organization in the U.S., which creates a tax exemption for the Church of Scientology International and its organizations, and tax deductions for those who contribute to their programs. Senior Scientology officials and the IRS later issued a statement that the ruling was based on a two-year inquiry and voluminous documents that showed the Church was qualified for the exemptions. To announce the settlement with the IRS, Miscavige gathered a reported 10,000 members of Scientology in the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, where he delivered a two-and-a-half-hour address and proclaimed, \\"The war is over!\\" The crowd gave Miscavige an ovation that lasted more than ten minutes.  Current role in Scientology  Miscavige in Amsterdam, 2017 As Chairman of the Board of the RTC, Miscavige works primarily from Scientology's Gold Base near Hemet, California. Scientologists often refer to him as \\"DM\\", or \\"C.O.B.\\", for Chairman of the Board. In their 2007 book, Extraordinary Groups: An Examination of Unconventional Lifestyles, W. W. Zellner and Richard T. Schaefer noted that, \\"David Miscavige has been the driving force behind the Church of Scientology for the past two decades\\" and that, \\"Miscavige's biography and speeches are second only to Hubbard in dominating the official Scientology Web site. [...] He is acknowledged as the ultimate ecclesiastical authority regarding the standard and pure application of L. Ron Hubbard's religious theories.\\" Miscavige is portrayed within Scientology as \\"a servant of Hubbard's message, not an agent in his own right\\". Official Scientology websites describe him as Hubbard's \\"trusted friend\\". Miscavige uses Church publications as well as professionally produced videos of gala events, at which he acts as master of ceremonies, to communicate with Scientologists worldwide. As the RTC's Chairman of the Board, his primary task is to \\"preserve, maintain and protect\\" the Scientology religion. Among Miscavige's initiatives is a long-term project of issuing unreleased and corrected editions of Hubbard's books and restoring L. Ron Hubbard lectures, including translating many works into other languages. Another initiative by Miscavige, launched in 2003, is to build new or remodeled churches of Scientology, called \\"Ideal Orgs\\", in every major city in the world. Since then, over seventy new or remodeled churches have been opened, including facilities in Washington, D.C., Madrid, New York City, London, Berlin, Mexico City, Rome, Tel Aviv, Atlanta, Miami, and San Diego. In 2012, Miscavige also opened Scientology's \\"National Affairs Office\\" in Washington, D.C., which he declared to be, \\"An office designed to give back to a United States government that steadfastly guaranteed our religious rights, the very freedom that allows us to do what we are doing today.\\" Scientology says the National Affairs Office was built \\"to oversee programs around the country and the world dealing with human rights, drug addiction, literacy and disaster response\\". The Flag Building in Clearwater, Florida is one of Miscavige's flagship projects. The building contains a Sea Org museum and training facilities. One of the largest projects of Miscavige's career is the Flag Building, also called the \\"Super Power Building\\", which is described as the spiritual headquarters for the Scientology religion. It is the largest of Scientology's properties in Clearwater, Florida. The 377,000 square foot structure is reportedly outfitted with custom-built equipment designed to administer the supposedly perception-enhancing \\"Super Power Rundown\\" to high- level Scientologists.Farley, Robert (June 6, 2006). \\"Scientology nearly ready to unveil Super Power\\". St. Petersburg Times.\\"Cornerstone Newsletter\\", Church of Scientology Religious Trust, undated but published 2007 The building was scheduled for completion in 2003, but underwent ten years of delays and re- designs as Scientology completed two other major construction and restoration projects in the same area ahead of it, the Fort Harrison Hotel and the Oak Cove Hotel. Miscavige inaugurated the Flag Building on November 17, 2013. Scientology launched the Scientology Network, a DIRECTV broadcast and OTT streaming service on March 12, 2018, with Miscavige introducing its inaugural broadcast in a rare on-camera appearance. The network is produced by Scientology Media Productions in Los Angeles, a facility opened by the Church in May 2016. Addressing the crowd at the SMP opening, Miscavige called the channel, \\"Our uncorrupted communication line to the billions. Because as the saying goes, if you don't write your own story, someone else will.\\"  Media coverage and criticism  Since Miscavige assumed his leadership role in Scientology, the press has reported accounts alleging illegal and unethical practices by the Church or by Miscavige himself. A 1991 Time magazine cover story on Scientology described Miscavige as \\"ringleader\\" of a \\"hugely profitable global racket that survives by intimidating members and critics in a Mafia-like manner\\". Miscavige stated in a 1992 interview on Nightlinehis only live televised interview to datethat the publication of the article resulted from a request by Eli Lilly, because of \\"the damage we had caused to their killer drug Prozac\\". According to a 1994 article in Regardies magazine by journalist Patrick J. Kiger, Eli Lilly's public relations agency Hill & Knowlton, which is owned by the British conglomerate the WPP Group, was pressured by Eli Lilly to drop Scientology as a client just before the Time article was published.http://www.patrickjkiger.com/regardies_scientology_story.pdf After the Time article, Miscavige stated that, \\"Eli Lilly ordered a reprint of 750,000 copies of Time magazine before it came out.\\" Scientology filed a suit against Lilly, J. Walter Thompson, Hill & Knowlton and the WPP Group. The case was settled for an undisclosed amount. In 1998, the St. Petersburg Times published \\"The Man Behind Scientology\\", a story based on six hours of interviews with Miscavige. In this first-ever newspaper interview, Miscavige talked about his rise to leadership, creating peace and resolving conflicts, and Scientology in Clearwater. The reporters, Tom Tobin and Joe Childs, said of Miscavige that he was \\"not only the founder's protege and trusted aide, he is to Scientologists what the pope is to Catholics ‚Äì a leader who sets the tone, establishes goals and ensures that Hubbard's practices and teachings are followed with precision\\". Tobin and Childs have continued to report on Miscavige in subsequent years. In 2009, the St. Petersburg Times published a series titled \\"The Truth Rundown\\", which featured allegations by former high- ranking executives of Scientology that Miscavige had repeatedly humiliated and physically beaten his staff, and had confined Scientology staff members in degrading conditions in a Church-owned property known as \\"The Hole\\". The series included interviews with Mike Rinder, former official spokesperson for Scientology and director of the Church's Office of Special Affairs, and Mark Rathbun, the former Inspector General of the RTC. Rinder has said that he was physically assaulted by Miscavige on about fifty occasions. These allegations have been supported by other former Scientologists: Lawrence Wright, author of Going Clear, interviewed twelve individuals who reported having been personally attacked by Miscavige and twenty-one people who say they have witnessed such attacks. Scientology denies all of these reports. Similar charges have been reported in previous years. In 1987, the BBC Panorama program Scientology: The Road to Total Freedom? featured an interview with former member Don Larson, who described Miscavige's physical violence towards a staff member. In a 1995 interview for ITV, Stacy Young, Miscavige's former secretary and the ex-wife of Hubbard's former spokesman, Robert Vaughn Young, asserted that Miscavige emotionally tormented staff members on a regular basis. \\"His viciousness and his cruelty to staff was unlike anything that I had ever experienced in my life\\", she said. \\"He just loved to degrade the staff.\\" In an incident also witnessed and supported by Amy Scobee, Jeff Hawkins, a former marketing guru for Scientology, claimed to have attended a meeting where Miscavige \\"jumped up on the conference room table, like with his feet right on the conference room table, launched himself across the table at me‚ÄîI was standing‚Äîbattered my face, and then shoved me down on the floor\\". Scientology representatives have consistently denied such accusations, insisting that the allegations come from apostates motivated by bitterness or attempting to extract money from the Church.Tobin, Thomas C; Childs, Joe (January 13, 2013). \\"Scientology defectors describe violence, humiliation in \\"the Hole\\"\\". Tampa Bay Times. Hawkins' claims were responded to by Scientology when he reiterated them in a documentary, saying they were \\"fabricated\\" and referring to him as \\"a discredited anti-Scientology media source\\". Scientology executive David Bloomberg claimed that it was Hawkins who became belligerent and attacked Miscavige. An issue of the Church's Freedom magazine was dedicated to praising Miscavige and attacking the \\"Truth Rundown\\" series, featuring articles titled \\"Merchants of Chaos: Journalistic Double-dealing at the St. Petersburg Times\\" and \\"The Bigotry Behind the Times Facade of Responsible Journalism.\\" Miscavige sent an open letter to the newspaper challenging the integrity of the reporters and labeling their sources as \\"lying\\" after the persons in question had been removed from the organization for \\"fundamental crimes against the Scientology religion\\". Scientology also commissioned an independent review of the Timess reporting, but have not, to date, released those findings. \\"Inside Scientology: The Truth Rundown\\" was recognized with journalistic honors, including the 2010 Gold Medal for Public Service award from the Florida Society of News Editors. The series was cited as a basis for subsequent journalistic investigations, including a weeklong series hosted on CNN by Anderson Cooper. Though Miscavige and Scientology have been the subject of much press attention, he has rarely spoken directly to the press. Exceptions include the aforementioned 1992 interview on Nightline, the aforementioned 1998 newspaper interview with the St. Petersburg Times, and a 1998 appearance in an A&E; Investigative Reports installment called \\"Inside Scientology\\".  Family and personal life  Miscavige is married to fellow Sea Org member Michele Diane \\"Shelly\\" Miscavige, who has not been seen in public since August 2007 and is presumed dead. Multiple sources have alleged she disappeared from Gold Base shortly after she \\"filled several job vacancies without her husband's permission\\". In July 2012, responding to press accounts of speculation on Shelly's whereabouts, lawyers who said they represented her informed two UK newspapers that \\"she is not missing and devotes her time to the work of the Church of Scientology\\". In 2013, in the Los Angeles Times, Andrew Blankstein reported, based on anonymous sources from the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), that the department had closed their investigation following a missing-persons report filed by former Scientologist and actress Leah Remini, having \\"located and spoke[n]\\" to Shelly Miscavige. The LAPD declined to answer questions about the details of the report. Lawrence Wright reports that \\"former Sea Org members\\" say Shelly is being held under guard at Gold Base.Wright, Lawrence, Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood and the Prison of Belief: New York: Knopf, 2013 Miscavige's elder brother Ronald Miscavige Jr. served as an executive in the Sea Org for a time, but left Scientology in 2000. Miscavige's twin sister, Denise Licciardi, was hired by major Scientology donor Bryan Zwan as a top executive for the Clearwater, Florida- based company Digital Lightwave, where she was linked to an accounting scandal. Ronald Jr.'s daughter Jenna Miscavige Hill, niece of David Miscavige, remained in the Sea Org until 2005. She has since become an outspoken critic of Scientology, publishing a book about her experiences in 2013. In the book, titled Beyond Belief: My Secret Life Inside Scientology And My Harrowing Escape, she stated that her grandfather Ronald Miscavige Sr. left the Church in 2012 and is living with her father in Virginia. In July 2013, Wisconsin police confronted Dwayne S. Powell after a suspicious person report. Powell said he had been hired at $10,000 a week to conduct full-time surveillance on the elder Miscavige for Scientology, which he said he had been doing for over a year. Los Angeles Times reporter Kim Christensen reports that David Miscavige and Scientology denied any connection to Powell. Gary Soter, a Church attorney, stated that the allegations were \\"blatantly false\\". Powell told police that on one occasion, he witnessed what he believed to be Ronald Sr. undergoing cardiac arrest. According to Powell, after immediately reporting the perceived emergency to his superiors, he received a call for further instructions from a man who identified himself as David Miscavige. According to the police report, Powell was instructed not to intervene in any way. Church spokesperson Karin Pouw asserted in an email that \\"no such conversation with Mr. Miscavige ever took place.\\" Ron Miscavige and Dan Koon wrote Ruthless: Scientology, My Son David Miscavige, and Me, which was published in May 2016. Miscavige is close to actor Tom Cruise and served as best man at Cruise's wedding to Katie Holmes. Miscavige is a firearms enthusiast who enjoys skeet shooting. In the 1998 St. Petersburg Times interview he named playing the piano, underwater photography, and trail biking as being among his hobbies.

He traveled extensively between the American East Coast and France, more specifically the artists colony Grez-sur-Loing. Biography Robert William Vonnoh was born on 17 September 1858 in Hartford, Connecticut. He studied in Boston at the Massachusetts Normal Art School now called Massachusetts College of Art and Design,Student Academic Records, Archives of Massachusetts College of Art and Design then in Paris at the Acad√©mie Julian under Gustave Boulanger and Jules Joseph Lefebvre. He taught at the Massachusetts Normal Art School (1879-1881),\\"Members of the School Faculty, 1873-1938,\\" Fiftieth Anniversary Record, 1888-1938 (Boston: Massachusetts School of Art Alumni Association, 1938). p. 104 at the Cowles Art School in Boston (1884‚Äì1885), at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (1883‚Äì1887), and at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (1891‚Äì1896). Vonnoh became a member of the National Academy of Design in 1906. In Flanders Field (Coquelicots) by Robert Vonnoh, 1890 His most well-known work In Flanders Field (also known as Where Soldiers Sleep and Poppies Grow or Coquelicots) was painted in 1890 in the fields of Grez-sur-Loing. This large oil on canvas, 59 x 104 inches, employed active and expressive brushstrokes to evoke the fiery cadmium red of poppies, a subject matter that was popular during that time among many painters. A young woman crouches in the foreground, settling down to pick poppies in a vast field with two figures in the background. Although this was considered Vonnoh's most ambitious work, garnering great acclaim at fairs and exhibits, the painting never sold. It was not until 1919 when it was purchased directly by Joseph G. Butler, founder of The Butler Institute of American Art that In Flanders Field would find a permanent home. The painting is part of the permanent collection to this day in Youngstown, Ohio. Apple bloom by Robert Vonnoh, 1903 A retrospective exhibit of his works was displayed at Madron Gallery in Chicago and The Butler Institute, March 1 to April 9, 2010 and May 2 to June 27, 2010, respectively. The show included photographs of the artists' colony in Grez-sur-Loing along with accompanying images of the artist as well as a bronze relief made by his wife, the sculptor, Bessie Potter Vonnoh (1872-1955). The show was curated by Yen Azzaro and a catalogue was written by Wendy Greenhouse, PhD. His paintings belong to collections at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Indianapolis Museum of Art, The Art Institute of Chicago among many others. While Vonnoh never became a household name, he is cited for his experimental style within the world of American Impressionism. Death Vonnoh died on 28 December 1933 in Nice and is buried alongside his wife in the Duck River Cemetery in Old Lyme, Connecticut.

During the latter part of his reign, he extended his rule as far as Taxila in north India, minting coins with the title of King of Kings. Vonones was a rival of the first Indo-Scythian monarch Maues (), who also claimed the title of King of Kings. Both of them fought for power over the regions of Arachosia, the Kabul Valley, Ghadhara and Taxila. Vonones' origins are uncertain. His name (lit. meaning \\"victor\\") was of Parthian origin, used by the royal Arsacid family of Iran. Because of this, arguments have been made in favour of a Parthian Surenid origin. According to the Iranologist Khodadad Rezakhani, Vonones belonged to the royal Arsacid family. Others, however, claim that he was an Indo-Scythian, regardless of his Parthian name. The legend of Vonones' coins also had the name of two of his commanders Spalahores and Spalirisos, who are referred to as \\"brother of the king\\". Scholars such as R.C. Senior and Rezakhani consider the two figures to indeed be Vonones' brothers, while others such as K.W. Dobbins argue that it was a honorific title given to them, whom he considered to be Saka satraps. A major argument against the proposal of a blood relationship between Vonones and the two commanders was due to both of them having Saka names, contrary to Vonones' Parthian name. Saghi Gazerani has suggested that after the Arsacid re-conquest of Sakastan (sometime between 124 BCE and 115 BCE), which was given as a fiefdom to the Surenid general that led the expedition, the Surenids (who became independent after 88 BCE) and the Sakas became closely connected, presumably through alliances and intermarriages. Indeed, the Parthians and Sakas are often confused in Indian literature. The mythological Iranian hero Rostam (who was from Sakastan), is mentioned in Iranian traditions as both Parthian and Saka, thus supporting this dual-identity. Vonones was succeeded by Spalahores. The latter's son and successor, Spalagadames, has been suggested by Rezakhani to be the same figure as the first Indo-Parthian king, Gondophares ().

Episodic in character, it covers a period of 20 years in the life of the first person narrator, an attractive nameless Englishwoman in search of perfect happiness, a state she equates with life with a perfect partner. Ten Men is a serious treatment of the common \\"chick lit\\" motif of \\"waiting for Mr Right\\". In her late thirties and childless at the end of the novel, the heroine has had relationships with a succession of men but has not been able to achieve the happiness and peace of mind she has been longing for all her adult life. According to WorldCat, the book is found in over 200 United States libraries .WorldCat Plot introduction Ten Men is a picaresque novel in that the heroine is constantly \\"moving on\\", time and again leaving behind the people she has been intimate with and associating with a new set in some other part of the world. The novel asks the basic question of how many men a woman \\"needs\\" until she has found the right partner and thus fulfilment in life--a question which, although frequently discussed in the wake of the sexual revolution, has turned out to be largely unanswerable. Plot summary The protagonist is born in the mid-1960s. After her father's premature death when she is seven, she and her sister are brought up in England by their mother, who is a French Catholic. Conditioned to believe that pre-marital sex is a sin(it is), at 18 the heroine is forced into an early marriage with a teacher, who works literally day and night at a remote boarding school for boys. Stripped of her privacy and her youthful ways, she clings to her husband, hoping he will take a job elsewhere. When he does not she deserts him and embarks on a series of affairs with wealthy men who are not interested in a long-term relationship with her: a lawyer, a capitalist (\\"the Billionaire\\"), a Lord. Similar to Caroline Meeber in Dreiser's Sister Carrie, the protagonist is not prepared to earn a living through honest work dependent on her qualifications. Accordingly, she always has to rely financially on the men in her life. In particular, it is the billionaire who, as a kind of parting present, volunteers to pay for her very expensive university education at some exclusive New York college as well as for her Upper East Side apartment. After her graduation the protagonist eventually moves back to London. An affair with a sexually inexperienced man (\\"the Virgin\\") leads to her first pregnancy ever and a subsequent miscarriage. Having trained as an actress, she gets a few jobs in TV commercials. When she meets her ex-husband again it is only to find out that he is going to get married again. At the end of the novel, aged about 38 and still indecisive, she meets a single father who might become her future partner.

It is also known as yellow squash, though other squashes, such as crookneck squash, may also be known by that name. It has mildly sweet and watery flesh, and thin tender skins that can be left on the fruit for many types of recipes. It was almost certainly domesticated in the eastern United States, although other variants of the same species (zucchini and pumpkin) were domesticated in Mesoamerica. This squash grows on vined plants reaching in height that thrive in mild weather. It is well known as an item in American cooking where it is fried, microwaved, steamed, boiled, or baked. It is often used in recipes interchangeably with zucchini. A good yellow summer squash will be small and firm with tender skin free of blemishes and bruising.

They differ from typical electric and acoustic guitars in that internal electronics process the sound from individual strings to model (replicate) the sound of specific guitars and other instruments. The maker claims it is the first guitar family that can emulate the tones of other notable electric and acoustic guitars. It also provides a banjo and a sitar tone. The Variax is currently available as an electric guitar, but modeling acoustic guitars and modeling electric bass guitars have been available in the past.  James Tyler Variax electric guitars  In 2010, Line 6 released three new models of Variax electric guitars (replacing the old models), with updated technology and bodies designed by luthier James Tyler.Variax Story * JTV59 is inspired by the archetypal single-cutaways and features time-tested tonewoods, Tyler-designed PAF-style alnico humbuckers and stoptail bridge. * JTV69 is a classic three- pickup solid-body with alder body, vintage-style Tyler neck and custom tremolo bridge. * JTV89 has a 3-piece maple neck with reverse headstock, 24-fret rosewood fingerboard and Tyler's Fast 'n' Flat neck profile. * JTV89F is the same guitar with the addition of a licensed Floyd Rose locking tremolo. Each model comes in a US-made or Korean-made version. The Tyler Variax guitars all come with standard pickups as well as the electronic modeling capabilities, whereas the earlier Variaxes had no magnetic pickups. New models include the Yamaha-designed \\"Standard\\" and \\"Shuriken\\"  Electronic Models  Models in all Variaxes are based on the following guitars:Guitar Models Based On * 1960 Fender Telecaster Custom * 1968 Fender Telecaster * 1968 Fender Telecaster Thinline * 1959 Fender Stratocaster * 1958 Gibson Les Paul Standard * 1952 Gibson Les Paul \\"Goldtop\\" * 1961 Gibson Les Paul Custom (3 PU) * 1956 Gibson Les Paul Junior * 1976 Gibson Firebird V * 1955 Gibson Les Paul Special * 1959 Gretsch 6120 * 1956 Gretsch Silver Jet * 1968 Rickenbacker 360 * 1966 Rickenbacker 360-12 * 1961 Gibson ES-335 * 1967 Epiphone Casino * 1957 Gibson ES-175 * 1953 Gibson Super 400 * 1959 Martin D-28 * 1970 Martin D 12-28 * 1967 Martin O-18 * 1966 Guild F212 * 1995 Gibson J-200 * 1935 Dobro Alumilite * Danelectro 3021 * Coral/Dano Electric Sitar * Gibson Mastertone Banjo * 1928 National Style 2 \\"Tricone\\"  Variax electric guitars  The earlier solid body Variax electric guitars made by Line 6 were available in four models: * The original 500 did not have a model number when it came out in 2002, but the manufacturer relabeled it the 500 when they introduced the 700 in 2004. They discontinued the 500 about a year later. It was manufactured in Korea. * The \\"budget\\" model 300 came out in 2005, was in limited supply by 2007 and was finally discontinued in early 2009. It was manufactured in Indonesia. * The 600 featured a vibrato bridge and all-maple neck with six-on-a-side tuners. It was manufactured initially in Korea, then China. * The upmarket 700 had a carved top, either a hardtail or vibrato bridge, maple neck, and rosewood fingerboard. It had three-on-a-side tuners and diamond shaped mother of pearl inlays with an abalone \\"V\\" at the 12th fret. It was manufactured in Japan. The bridge of a Variax electric guitar has an individual piezoelectric pickup for each string. The instrument's electronics converts each of these six signals to a digital signal, and digitally processes each to emulate the selected sound. Since the system processes the strings separately, it can model the effects that one string of a target emulation might cause on another. It can also shift individual string pitches to digitally create alternate tunings instead of pitch-shifting all strings at once. Some enthusiasts have transplanted Variax electronics and hardware into different instruments. These \\"transplants\\" can look like almost any popular guitar, yet produce all the Variax emulations.  Variax acoustic guitars  Line 6 marketed four models of Variax acoustic modeling guitars: the 300 Nylon String and 300 Steel String, which allow varying virtualbody size and mic placement‚Äîand the more expensive steel stringed, cedar (later spruce)-topped 700, which pitch-shifts individual strings to provide alternate tunings. The 700 emulates over a dozen rare and desirable acoustic instruments, including an acoustic Indian sitar, rather than the Coral electric sitar modeled in the electric Variaxes. Line 6 produced a rare and final model dubbed the 900, of which only 50 were produced and distributed by Line 6. The 900s were made in Japan rather than Korea as the 700s were. The 900s had a solid body with a semi hollow acoustic style facade sound hole, maple neck, and rosewood fingerboard was adorned with diamond shaped mother of pearl inlay instead of the cross design the 700s had, it also had an abalone inlay \\"V\\" at the 12th fret. The most publicly recognized Variax Acoustic 900 was used by recording artist James Taylor, while singing the American National Anthem at the opening ceremony of the NBA Finals of 2008, as well as an event hosted at Borders Bookstore. Line 6 discontinued the acoustic models in 2010.  Variax bass guitars  Line 6 offered the same technology for electric bass guitars with the 4-string Variax 700 bass and the model 705 5-string bass, but discontinued them in 2007.  Workbench Software  Variax guitars have a Variax Digital Interface (VDI) port that connects them via an Ethernet cable to compatible hardware like the Line 6 POD amp modelers, or through the Workbench interface via USB to a computer. Note that the (300-700) guitar cannot be connected directly to the computer but requires a Line 6 USB interface or POD Live / Vetta. Workbench is also the name of the software that lets users customize the electronic models‚Äîchange body type, change and move pickups, and adjust volume and tone knobs function. Users can create customized models and tunings and then save them back to the guitar.

Early life He was born Jean Gilbert Tabaud on July 5, 1914, in the small town of Saujon, France, on the Southwest Atlantic coast, north of Bordeaux. He was the son of Lucien Tabaud and Ernestine Tabaud Hillairet. His father was a butcher by profession, who served in World War I, where he was wounded and gassed during the conflict. World War II A first career in classical dance with the Ballets Russes, dancing in Paris, Berlin, Geneva, Belgium, Switzerland, Rio de Janeiro, Tangier, Casablanca, and Argentina was interrupted by a spine injury which forced him to give up dancing altogether. He returned to France to seek treatment for his back but instead met up with the outbreak of World War II. He was immediately drafted into the French Army, witnessed the fall of France to Germany, and was taken prisoner in 1941. Painter beginnings His second career as an artist started while he was a prisoner during World War II. While there, he passed the time sketching portraits of his fellow prisoners, and was shortly asked to do the same by guards, as well as the Commandant of the camp. His escape from prison led him back to Paris where he made his living as a peripatetic artist, in the evenings going from one caf√© to another, drawing portraits of German soldiers, sailors, airmen of all ranks, charging but a few francs each. He plied his trade not only in Paris but traveled to the Normandy coast and Le Havre - often on bicycle. All the portraits he executed during this time had to be signed with the name Juvee. By the time of Germany's defeat, Tabaud had executed over 5,000 portraits between 1942 and 1944. Following the end of the war, almost one year later, Tabaud, seeking the sun and escape from war-torn Europe, traveled to Majorca and then to Morocco, where he lived for eight years. In Tangier and Casablanca he established a school of dance, gave recitals, choreographed ballets, wrote articles on art and the dance. During this period he painted many Moroccan landscapes, as well as studies of the local people. Move to the US In 1953 he was encouraged to try his luck in the United States. He began in Hollywood, where he was immediately successful, receiving commissions for portraits from such stars as Charles Boyer, Deborah Kerr, Pier Angeli, Zizi Jeanmaire, to name a few. The French Ambassador to Mexico, while visiting Hollywood, suggested an exhibit of his works - particularly his Moroccan landscapes - in Mexico City. It was met with considerable success and was followed by two more exhibits. One in Monterrey and one in Acapulco. Following several more critically acclaimed exhibits in Los Angeles and San Francisco, Tabaud moved to New York City in 1957, where he established his studio at 440 East 79th Street. Over the next ten years he traveled extensively, executing portrait commissions in the United States and Europe of the rich and famous, as well as the not so rich nor famous. Among his innumerable clients were such subjects as the Mrs. Henry Fords, (both Anne and Christina) as well as his children, Anne, Charlotte, and Edsel. Mrs. Ted Kennedy, Mrs. Stavros Niarchos (Eug√©nie) and her children. Mrs. Pierre S. DuPont, Jr., Henry Miller, Lady Sarah Russell, Lady Sarah Crichton Stuart, Mrs. T. Jefferson Coolidge, Mrs. Clint Murchison, Jr., and her daughter. Suzy Parker, Peter and Lili Pulitzer and their children, Mrs. John Warner (daughter of Paul Melon) and their children. John Kenneth Galbraith, Baroness Fiona von Thyssen, Mrs. Howard Cushing, Jr., and her children. In addition to portrait painting, Tabaud experimented with various schools of art, most notably cubism, and with several different techniques, such as oil on canvas as well as on board, colored pen, watercolors, pastels, charcoal and pencil, melted crayon with scratched pen technique, etc. He was strongly influenced by the artists of the impressionist era, especially Renoir, Monet, Corot, Van Gogh, and later Modigliani. The influence of Gauguin can be detected in his Moroccan paintings. At the height of his career, Tabaud executed several paintings under the name of Leret, but was unsuccessful at marketing them. What sold was a Tabaud. What clients wanted was a Tabaud and nothing less. For several years he was featured in Portraits, Inc., in New York in their annual exhibits of portraits by well-known artists. His work appeared regularly in their New Yorker and other magazine ads, as well in their New Year's greetings to their clients, featuring the portraits he did of the founders of Portraits, Inc., - Lois Shaw and Helen Appleton Read. These cards sometimes included the portrait he did of Andrea Erickson Gehringer as well. It was only in 1980 that he gave up his studio in New York altogether and settled permanently in Pawling, traveling but once a year to France to visit old friends. He had no family. He never had any children. Tabaud also excelled in painting children. Though he never had any of his own, he enjoyed painting them. After seeing one of Tabaud's exhibits in 1956, the art critic of the Los Angeles Examiner said: \\"He gives their faces marvelous expressions: as if they are, in a spiritual sense, on the threshold of adult experiences, as if some unknown force is pulling their thoughts into a world they would much rather back off from.\\" In Pawling, Tabaud pleased friends and neighbors by drawing their portraits, free of charge. Whole days and evenings were spent reading the works of philosophers whose thoughts he had long wished to examine but had never had the time to do so before. Later in life Jean spent the last five years of his life battling Lyme disease. But this debilitating disease was not diagnosed until three years before his death, when treatment by antibiotics was of little use. In addition, Jean Tabaud was afflicted with cancer of the prostate, loss of hearing, and failing eyesight. He died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to his headThe Jean Tabaud Project on December 3, 1996. Two years after his death the Village of Pawling changed the name of the winding dirt road leading to his home from Gristmill Lane to Frenchman's Lane.

In addition, the psalms beginning each of the liturgical divisions of the Psalter are given major initials. The beginning letters of the other Psalms have smaller \\"minor\\" initials which are decorated or zoomorphic and are done in what is called the \\"antenna\\" style. The only surviving full-page miniature shows King David with his court musicians, and is now folio 30 verso. It is possible that this miniature was originally the frontispiece or opening miniature of the psalter, and that a decorated incipit page at the start of the Psalms is missing, as well as a carpet page at the end.Brown Sir Robert Cotton pasted a cutting from the Breviary of Margaret of York on folio 160 verso. He also inserted a miniature from a 13th-century liturgical psalter as folio 1. History The manuscript was produced during the second quarter of the 8th century, and probably the earliest of the Tiberius group.BL database in 2017 says \\"2nd quarter\\". A date as early as 720 has been proposed by David Wright, but most scholars prefer a slightly later date, see Wilson, 91; Brown gives \\"c. 725\\" The script of the Old English gloss is typical of the script produced in Canterbury scriptoria from about 820 to 850. Eadui Basan, who made additions to the manuscript, was a monk at Christ Church, Canterbury during the early 11th century. Thomas of Elmham recorded a Psalter at Canterbury which may have been the Vespasian Psalter. The manuscript was at Canterbury in 1553. By 1556 it was owned by Sir William Cecil, who lent it to Matthew Parker, Archbishop of Canterbury. By 1599 it was the possession of Sir Robert Cotton, who signed it on folio 12 recto. It became national property, along with the rest of the Cotton library in 1702 and was incorporated into the British Museum when it was founded in 1753.Brown The volume was the first in the Vespasian shelf section in the part of the library indexed by the names from a set of busts of the Roman Emperors on top of the shelves. Its current binding, with metal clasps, was provided by Cotton.

New features included the ability to slice and play as female players such as Monica Seles, Serena Williams, Venus Williams and Lindsay Davenport and the males such as Patrick Rafter, Magnus Norman, Thomas Enqvist and Carlos Moya and mixed doubles matches. The game was created and produced by Hitmaker, with Acclaim Entertainment publishing it in Europe for the PS2. This was the last Virtua Tennis game to be released for the Dreamcast following its discontinuation. Game Modes=Tournament The player must win 5 matches played on different surfaces and venues to win a tournament. If the player performs well enough, he is challenged by either King or Queen, the game's bosses, depending whether the selected player is male or female. Exhibition This is a single match in which the options are customizable. World Tour This is the main mode of the game. For the first time in the Virtua Tennis series, the World Tour mode features yearly based and calendarized seasons. Users have to play and win tournaments throughout the seasons, as well as to complete training exercises, in order to progress. Also, unlike any other Virtua Tennis game in the series, the World Tour mode on Virtua Tennis 2 requires the user to play and train both a male and a female players simultaneously, who can also team up to play in mixed doubles tournaments. The user enters with a rank of 300th for both male and female players, which improves as matches and tournaments are won. In addition, the players' abilities can be improved by completing different training exercises. The focus of the training exercises are to be fun, rather than realistic. Each exercise has four levels, with the difficulty increasing progressively. By completing the hardest difficulty with a certain amount of time left or points scored, an outfit is unlocked, which players can wear in all modes. Reception The Dreamcast version received \\"universal acclaim\\", while the PlayStation 2 version received \\"favorable\\" reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave the former console version a score of 31 out of 40. In Japan, Game Machine listed Virtua Tennis 2 on their December 1, 2001 issue as being the seventh most-successful arcade game of the year.

The band is currently signed to Nuclear Blast. Biography=Demos and Willowtip era (2000‚Äì2006) Arsis was started by James Malone and Michael ‚ÄúMike‚Äù Van Dyne in 2000, who met while attending the Berklee College of Music in Boston. They recorded two demos independently in 2001 and 2002, which were later officially released by Negative-Existence Records in 2007. Arsis signed to Willowtip Records in 2003, and released their debut album, A Celebration of Guilt, in 2004. This was followed by the release of A Diamond for Disease in 2005, and United in Regret in 2006. During this time, Arsis toured heavily, sharing national stages with Misery Index, Incantation, Necrophagist, Cattle Decapitation, Dead to Fall, Misery Signals, The Faceless, All Shall Perish, and Napalm Death, and performed on the main stage at the 2004 Maryland Deathfest, the 2006 New England Metal and Hardcore Festival, and the First Annual California Metalfest. The band's main composer, singer/guitarist/songwriter James Malone, wrote and performed all the guitar, vocal, and bass work on the first studio album, A Celebration of Guilt, as well as the follow-up, A Diamond for Disease. Malone also composed and performed a score for the off-Broadway ballet company Ballet Deviare. He has a signature model for Washburn Guitars. Mike Van Dyne performed drums on all of Arsis' releases and tours up until early 2007, and recorded/toured again with the band from 2009 until 2011. Van Dyne is the current drummer for The Final Sleep. We Are the Nightmare and line-up changes (2007‚Äì2008) The band signed to Nuclear Blast just before original drummer Van Dyne departed; he was replaced by Darren Cesca. Noah Martin, who played bass on United in Regret, and Ryan Knight were also added to the line-up to record We Are the Nightmare (2008), their first album with Nuclear Blast. That summer 2008, Arsis played on the Thrash & Burn tour. Cesca was let go in 2008, with differences in musical direction provided as the reason; he was replaced on tour by Alex Tomlin of Battlemaster and later by Shawn Priest. Martin quit the band in the fall of 2008 to finish his college degree. In late 2008, Nick Cordle (guitar) and David Kinkade (drums) joined the band, and in December Knight left Arsis to join The Black Dahlia Murder. On March 18, 2009, Malone issued a statement explaining and apologizing for recent tour cancellations and lineup changes, citing personal reasons. Soon after, it was announced that original drummer Mike Van Dyne would return (although due to career commitments, his ability to tour with the band may be limited). Starve for the Devil (2009‚Äì2011) In July, 2009, it was announced that work was ongoing for their next record, Starve for the Devil. In September, recording sessions began with Nathaniel Carter performing bass and production being handled again by Zeuss. The record was released on February 9, 2010, and landed at No. 13 on the Billboard Top New Artist Albums (Heatseekers) chart, making Starve for the Devil the highest charting Arsis album. In October and November, 2009, Arsis toured Europe with Behemoth, DevilDriver, and Scar Symmetry on the Neckbreakers Ball Tour. In January, 2010, Arsis released a music video for \\"Forced to Rock\\", the first track off Starve for the Devil. In January and February, 2010, Arsis toured the U.S. and Canada with Arch Enemy, Exodus, and Mutiny Within on the Tyrants of Evil North American Tour. On March 6, 2010, Arsis performed at the Eye Scream Metal Fest II in Mexico City (the band's first ever performance in Latin America) with Sacred Reich, Cynic, Municipal Waste, and Dying Fetus. This festival, the Tyrants of Evil Tour, and the Neckbreakers Ball Tour are the only times the full Starve for the Devil recording lineup performed live. On May 13, 2010, Noah Martin rejoined the band, despite staying enrolled in college, following the departure of Nathaniel Carter. In November 2010, the lineup of Malone, Cordle, Martin, and Van Dyne toured Europe extensively with Misery Index, Grave, The Last Felony, and The Rotted, followed by a U.S. headlining tour in December with Powerglove and Conducting from the Grave. During their headlining dates, Arsis performed the 12+ minute track \\"A Diamond for Disease\\" in its entirety for the first time ever. On August 9, 2011, Willowtip Records reissued Arsis' acclaimed debut album A Celebration of Guilt with two bonus tracks and expanded artwork. Unwelcome (2011‚Äì2017) News of demos and samples of a new full-length record starting pouring out in early 2012. Not long after, however, guitarist Nick Cordle left the band to join Arch Enemy. Shortly after that, longtime drummer and founding member Mike Van Dyne departed Arsis to concentrate on his career full-time. On March 13, 2012, Arsis released a demo song entitled \\"Choking on Sand\\" featuring Malone on vocals and both guitars and Noah Martin on bass. On April 6, Arsis announced Shawn Priest as Mike Van Dyne's replacement and reposted the demo song \\"Choking on Sand\\" with Shawn on the recording. Tracking for the as-of-then still untitled full-length record produced by Mark Lewis began on June 4. Raw video footage from the recording sessions was posted by the band on Facebook on July 19. On July 27, 2012, the album art and title for Unwelcome were made public. On December 4, 2012, Arsis released an EP entitled Lepers Caress preceding the release of Unwelcome containing new songs that would be on the full-length record as well as some re-recordings from their earlier catalog. On April 30, 2013, Arsis released Unwelcome. In 2014, Willowtip Records reissued Arsis' A Diamond for Disease EP and United in Regret album with bonus live video tracks and expanded artwork. In 2015, Arsis supported Sepultura on their 30th Anniversary tour, they were also joined by Destruction and Starkill. In 2016, Arsis released their pre-production demo which is titled \\"As Deep As Your Flesh\\". They also opened up for Scar Symmetry once again on their North American tour alongside Shattered Sun and Painted in Exile. Visitant (2018‚Äìpresent) In November 2018, Arsis released Visitant.

It covers , of which are marine areas. The park was established in 1966, and was the first coastal national park of Thailand. The park includes Thailand's largest freshwater marsh. Geography The limestone hills are a sub-range of the Tenasserim Hills that arise at the shore of the Gulf of Thailand, with the highest elevation being Khao Krachom at . Between the hills are freshwater marshes. Several of these marshes were converted into shrimp farms, as only of the total of marshes are part of the national park. A portion, , of these marshes are scheduled to be declared a Ramsar site. Two white sand beaches are in the park, Hat Laem Sala and Hat Sam Phraya. Hat Laem Sala is 17 km from park headquarters and can be reached from the village Ban Pu either by boat or by climbing up and down over a hill for nearly 30 minutes. The park is approximately south of Hua Hin. The origin of the name \\"Khao Sam Roi Yot\\" is undetermined. Local lore has it that it means \\"mountain with 300 peaks,\\" or the range had been an island where 300 survivors from a sinking Chinese junk sought refuge, or the range was named after a local plant called sam roi yot. Phraya Nakhon Cave Khuha Kharuehat pavilion, Phraya Nakhon Cave Phraya Nakhon Cave () is about from Laem Sala Beach, approximately north of park headquarters. Visitors can go to the cave by renting a boat or by walking across Tian Mountain. After that, there is a climb up the mountain about to reach Phraya Nakhon Cave. Its most famous early visitor was King Chulalongkorn. There is a water well at the foot of the mountain known as Phraya Nakhon Well. It is made of baked clay bricks in a trapezoidal shape. Phraya Nakhon is a large cave which has a hole in the ceiling allowing sunlight to penetrate. At the top of the hole, there is a stone bridge known as \\"death bridge\\" because many wild animals have fallen to their deaths from it. Khuha Kharuehat Pavilion () is a historic site built for King Chulalongkorn's visit in 1890. At certain times during certain months, the sun will shine directly on it. The pavilion has since become the symbol of Prachuap Khiri Khan Province. Later kings also visited the cave, including King Vajiravudh and King Bhumibol Adulyadej. Klong Khao Daeng Klong Khao Daeng is a stream running deep into mangrove forests at one end and at its mouth freshwater and seawater collide. The mangroves consist of the samae thalay (grey mangrove), kongkang bai lek (true mangrove), kongkang bai yai (red mangrove), and chakhram (herbaceous seepweed). Fauna The park is home to a variety of birds, including the common kingfisher, the black-capped kingfisher, the collared kingfisher, the little heron, the little egret, and the Javan pond-heron. Wildlife found in the mangroves includes pla teen ([mudskippers]), pu kam dab (fiddler crabs), ling samae (the crab-eating macaque), collared kingfisher (nok kin pieo), snapping shrimp (kung deed khan), mud creeper (hoi khika), and oysters (hoi nangrom). Rare animals in the park include the mainland serow (Nemorhaedus sumatraensis), dusky langurs (Trachypithecus obscurus), fishing cats (Prionailurus viverrinus) (; ), as well as many bird species. At sea, Irrawaddy dolphins (Orcaella brevirostris) are sometimes seen. History Khao Sam Roi Yot was probably where King Mongkut hosted European guests on 18 August 1868 to observe a total solar eclipse. The king was interested in astronomy and had calculated the date and location of the eclipse himself. His calculations proved better‚Äîby about two seconds‚Äîthan those of French astronomers, who acknowledged his accuracy. He contracted malaria, possibly during that event, and died on 1 October. The national park was created on 28 June 1966. It was enlarged on 1 April 1982.  Archaeology  The discovery of 3,000 years old cave paintings was announced by archaeologists from the Fine Arts Office in May in 2020. Some of the depicted pictures are still visible and clear, while some paintings were damaged by limestone etching. According to archeologist Kannika Premjai, paintings describe humanlike figures with accessories on their bodies, hunting scenes with bow and arrow. Moreover, there is also an animal figure seems to be serow (a goat-like mammal found regionally) found among the drawings. In October 2020, more rock art was discovered in unmapped caves in Sam Roi Yot National Park, dates back to between 2,000 and 3,000 years old. Khao Sam Roi Yot legends According to Thai folklore, the giant Mong Li and his wife lived on the west coast of the Gulf of Thailand. Each had independently promised their daughter to Chao Lai and the emperor of China. When the daughter was old enough to marry, both future husbands arrived on the same date. Mong Li then cut his daughter into two halves. Chao Lai turned himself into a hill, while the traditional fruit basket to be presented to a Buddhist monk was turned into the Khao Sam Roi Yot mountains. Islands The island of Ko Kho Ram on the other side of the gulf was the elephant and the ox cart with the wedding presents.Ko Kho Ram - Mapcarta Nom Sao Island is the daughter's breasts. Ao Sam Roi Yot, Kho Ram Island and Nom Sao Island's silhouette, seen from certain angles, look like a person resting in the middle of the sea. There is a goddess shrine on Nom Sao Island that is a popular attraction.Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park - Activities Other islands in the same area are Ko Sattakut, Ko Rawang, and Ko Rawing.

His touchdown total was second on the team behind only Isaac Bruce's 12, while Hakim's 18.8 average also remains a personal best. Hakim also added his first punt return touchdown on the season. Hakim had the best game of his career against the Cincinnati Bengals on October 3, becoming only the fourth player in team history to score four touchdowns in a game. The feat tied the mark previous reached by Bob Shaw, (1949) Elroy Hirsch (1951), and Harold Jackson (1973). His 84-yard punt return for a touchdown tied for the fifth longest in team history and was the third longest in the league during the 1999 season. He also set the team record for punt return yards in a game with 147. All three of his receptions went for touchdowns (9, 51, 18), and he became the first Rams‚Äô player with three receiving touchdowns in a game since December 15, 1996 when Eddie Kennison accomplished the feat against the Atlanta Falcons. In addition to his career game, Hakim also posted his first 100-yard receiving game against the Carolina Panthers on December 5. Hakim's four receptions, 122 yards and two scores helped St. Louis clinch the division that day. 2000 Hakim continued his impressive production in 2000, setting career highs in multiple statistical categories. His 53 catches, 734 yards, long reception of 80 yards and 32 receptions for first downs remain personal bests. His four touchdowns on the year also represent the second-best total of his career. On special teams, Hakim's 15.8 punt return average led the NFC and was second in the NFL. He also returned his second punt for a score during the season. The best game of the season for Hakim came in the regular season opener against the Denver Broncos on September 4. During the game, Hakim racked up five catches, 116 yards and two touchdowns. He set a career best with an 80-yard touchdown grab, and also took a punt 86 yards for a score. Hakim was one of three Rams players to surpass 100 yards on offense during the game (wide receiver Torry Holt and running back Marshall Faulk being the others), marking just the second time in franchise history the feat had been accomplished. Other highlights on the season for Hakim include a November 5 contest against the Panthers when he had eight catches for 116 yards and a touchdown, as well as a 65-yard punt return in the NFC Wild Card playoff game against the New Orleans Saints on December 30. That game also featured a lowlight for Hakim, as he muffed a Saints' punt in the closing minute, allowing the Saints to retain possession and run out the clock, killing what was nearly an impressive Rams comeback. 2001 In his last season as a member of the Rams, Hakim totaled 39 receptions for 374 yards and three touchdowns. He appeared in all 16 games for the second straight season and started two of them. His punt return average took a significant dive from the year before, dropping from 15.3 in 2000 to just 9.2 in 2001. In late September, Hakim joined Henry Ellard, LeRoy Irvin, and Eddie Kennison as the only Rams players to amass more than 1,000 career punt return yards. He passed Kennison to move into third place all-time the following month. Also during the season, Hakim completed his first career pass with a 51-yard touchdown to Isaac Bruce. Hakim also had 90 receiving yards and five rushing yards in a Super Bowl XXXVI loss to the New England Patriots. 2002 Hakim joined the Detroit Lions as a free agent in 2002 and proceeded to have a rebound season in terms of receiving yards and in the punt return game. He started all 10 games in which he appeared during the season, catching 37 passes for 541 yards and three touchdowns. He also posted a 14.8 punt return average and had his third career return touchdown. It did not take long for Hakim to make a splash with his new team, as he holds the honor of scoring the first touchdown at Ford Field following the team's move from the Pontiac Silverdome. Other season highlights include a career-high nine receptions against the Miami Dolphins and seven catches for 143 yards against and a score on the first offensive play of the game against the Green Bay Packers. Hakim suffered a hip injury on a shuffle pass against the New York Jets on November 17. He would miss the rest of the season due to the injury, and was the team's leading receiver when he was placed on Injured Reserve on November 10. 2003 Despite missing the first two games of the 2003 season recovering knee surgery, Hakim went on to start 12 of the 14 games he appeared in and become Detroit's leading receiver during the season. He finished the year with 49 catches for 449 yards and four touchdowns. Highlights from the season include a 21-yard pass to fellow wideout Charles Rogers (the second pass and completion of his career), a two-point conversion on a pass from Joey Harrington against the Chicago Bears, and a crucial 18-yard catch on a game-winning drive in another contest against the Bears. He had 19 catches over a three-game span during the year, which was the most ever for him in that amount. However, his best game of the season came against his former team, as he totaled 101 yards on offense and scored a touchdown against the Rams. 2004 In 2004, Hakim finished second on the team in both receiving yards and receiving touchdowns despite missing four games due to ankle, back and groin injuries during the season. He finished with 31 receptions for 533 yards and three touchdowns. Early in the season against the Houston Texans, Hakim eclipsed the 3,000-yard receiving mark for his career. In a game against the Minnesota Vikings, he and Roy Williams became the first Lions duo to each reach 100 receiving yards in the same game in nearly five years. 2005 Hakim was released by the Lions in April 2005. He received interest from multiple teams before and on June 15 it was believed he had signed with the Kansas City Chiefs. The move would have reunited him with former Rams head coach Dick Vermeil. However, some provisions in the contracts caused the league to void the deal, and Hakim and Vermeil decided it would be best if he did not join the team. Hakim signed a one-year deal with the New Orleans Saints on June 19. During the season, Hakim was the team's third best receiver and finished with 34 catches for 489 yards and two touchdowns. He set a career-high with nine kickoff returns, while his punt return average was the lowest of his career at just 7.6 yards. 2006 Despite receiving some interest in the 2006 offseason, Hakim remained unsigned until the regular season began. He signed a one-year deal to return to the Lions in 2006, despite new head coach Rod Marinelli in charge. Not all was unfamiliar to Hakim, however, as this time around with the Lions he would be working with former Rams offensive coordinator and head coach Mike Martz, who was now the offensive coordinator in Detroit. Hakim's second tenure with the Lions was not nearly as productive or long as the first. In six games with the team, he caught just 17 passes for 147 yards. He was eventually released on October 30, and remained unsigned until joining the San Diego Chargers on December 14 after wide receiver Malcom Floyd was placed on Injured Reserve. Hakim was inactive for all three games as a Charger, resulting in the first season of his professional career in which he did not score a touchdown. 2007 After his contract expired following the 2006 season, Hakim once again became a free agent. On March 22, he signed a one-year contract with the Miami Dolphins. The move reunited him with new Dolphins head coach Cam Cameron, who was offensive coordinator in San Diego the previous season. 2009 Hakim signed a contract in the UFL and the Las Vegas Locomotives. Coaching career In November 2018, Hakim was named the wide receivers coach for the San Diego Fleet of the Alliance of American Football. The following year, he joined the St. Louis BattleHawks of the XFL in the same position.

He was the leader of the Democratic Party and an anti-war Copperhead during the American Civil War. Childhood and Early Career He was born in Liberty Township, Butler County, Ohio, of Dutch and Irish descent. He was the son of Stephen Pieter Voorhees and Rachel Elliott.International Genealogical Index, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, copyright c. 1980, 1997 During his infancy his parents moved to Fountain County, Indiana, near Veedersburg. He graduated at Indiana Asbury University (now DePauw University), Greencastle, Indiana, in 1849; was admitted to the bar in 1850, and began to practice in Covington, Indiana, whence in 1857 he moved again to Terre Haute. From 1858-61, Voorhees was U.S. district-attorney for Indiana. Representative From 1861-66 and 1869‚Äì73, Voorhees was a Democratic representative in Congress. During the American Civil War he was an anti-war Copperhead and enemies alleged him as affiliated with the Knights of the Golden Circle, which‚Äîas it was more an imaginary organization than one of any substance‚Äîseems quite unlikely. In any case, he was not so radical as Clement Vallandigham and others. Historian Kenneth Stampp has captured the Copperhead spirit in his depiction of Voorhees of Indiana: > There was an earthy quality in Voorhees, \\"the tall sycamore of the Wabash.\\" > On the stump his hot temper, passionate partisanship, and stirring eloquence > made an irresistible appeal to the western Democracy. His bitter cries > against protective tariffs and national banks, his intense race prejudice, > his suspicion of the eastern Yankee, his devotion to personal liberty, his > defense of the Constitution and state rights faithfully reflected the views > of his constituents. Like other Jacksonian agrarians he resented the > political and economic revolution then in progress. Voorhees idealized a way > of life which he thought was being destroyed by the current rulers of his > country. His bold protests against these dangerous trends made him the idol > of the Democracy of the Wabash Valley. [Stampp, p. 211] After the Civil War, Voorhees condemned what he perceived to be the unjust treatment of the vanquished South: Personality Partisan Democrat though he was, Voorhees became widely liked on both sides of the aisle in the Senate. He had struck up a warm friendship with Abraham Lincoln in their circuit-riding days before the war, and that friendship outlasted their political differences and to the end Lincoln's life. President Grant also got along well with Voorhees, and it was said of President Chester Alan Arthur that Voorhees had as much influence with him as any Republican could hope to have.Leonard S. Kenworthy, The Tall Sycamore of the Wabash: Daniel Wolsey Voorhees (Boston, 1936), 46. Republican senator George F. Hoar of Massachusetts, who rarely agreed with his Indiana colleague about anything, declared him \\"a very kind- hearted man indeed, always willing to do a kindness to any of his associates, or to any person in trouble. If he could not be relied on to protect the Treasury against claims of doubtful validity, when they were urged by persons in need, or who in any way excited his sympathy, it ought to be said in defence of him, that he would have been quite as willing to relieve them to the extent of his power from his private resources.\\"George F. Hoar, Autobiography, 2:62-63. That was very likely true. Stories abounded about Voorhees's freehandedness with anyone telling a hard luck story. \\"Uncle Dan is the most unsophisticated person in the use of money you ever saw,\\" an old friend commented in 1894. \\"He will lend or give away a pocketful of money in a day, and at night he will not have the least idea what he has done with it. I have been with him when he would feel in his pocket and suddenly discover that he had not enough to pay his restaurant bill or buy a newspaper.\\"Washington Post, August 3, 1894. After Voorhees's death, Senator Vest of Missouri declared that if every one for whom Voorhees did a good deed \\"would but bring a single leaf to his grave and lay it there, the Indiana Senator would sleep tonight beneath a mountain of foliage.\\"O. O.Stealey, 63-64. That same generosity meant that Voorhees rarely met a pension bill that he could oppose. The Treasury, as far as he was concerned, was open to whoever needed help. As Vest once told him, Voorhees \\"would have put Aladdin's Lamp in the hands of a receiver within thirty days.\\"Leonard S. Kenworthy, The Tall Sycamore of the Wabash: Daniel Wolsey Voorhees (Boston, 1936), 47. Senator Voorhees served in the U.S. Senate from 1877-97. He was a member of the powerful Finance Committee throughout his service in the Senate, and his first speech in that body was a defence of the free coinage of silver and a plea for the preservation of the full legal tender value of greenback currency. He had an active part in bringing about the building of the new Congressional Library. On tariff matters, he voted dutifully with his party, but he was no enthusiast for free trade, and his frankness could be embarrassing, at least from a Democrat. \\"Why, the cow and the goose are the greatest fools in the world,\\" he blurted out once, \\"except the man who thinks that a tariff can be laid without protection.\\"Chicago Tribune, July 9, 1884. Voorhees made a fascinating speaker, if somewhat careless in his use of facts. \\"The readers of the News are aware that it has been repeatedly forced, by the variety and brilliance of his misinformation, to compliment Senator Voorhees on the unfailing inaccuracy of his historical statements, whether political, social, or literary,\\" an Indianapolis newspaper remarked.Indianapolis News, August 20, 1884. He was widely known as an effective advocate, especially in jury trials. In allusion to his unusual stature he was called \\"the Tall Sycamore of the Wabash.\\" In 1893, Voorhees came in for serious controversy when President Grover Cleveland called Congress into extra session to repeal the silver purchase clause of the 1890 Sherman Act. As chair of the Senate Finance Committee, the senior senator from Indiana could prevent action, and three years before, he had stood among the leading supporters for an unlimited coinage of silver. His views, in fact, had not changed. He remained, to the end of his days, a believer in bimetallism: the use of both silver and gold to back up the United States currency. But Indiana was less friendly to an inflated currency than it had been twenty years before, and manufacturers and industrialists were much more decisive in their demand for a gold standard. From members of the Indiana House delegation, Voorhees found an intense desire that he do nothing to risk their own political futures, as any blockage of the repeal bill would be sure to do. Finally, the senator had to reckon with the other big issue pending, on which he and the president would have to part company: tariff reduction. Realizing that he would have to pick his fights, and sweetened with great dollops of patronage by the Administration, Voorhees agreed to carry the repeal bill through, and he kept absolute faith. In late October, when a compromise was proposed that would delay the silver purchase act's repeal until July 1, 1894, thirty seven of the forty-four Democratic senators signed a letter endorsing it. Voorhees's name was not among them. He refused to consider any halfway measures, and saw to it that unconditional repeal went through within the month.Kenworthy,Tall Sycamore of the Wabash: Daniel Wolsey Voorhees,106-09. Vooorhees delivered his last speech in the Senate in January 1896, a plea on behalf of silver coinage and denouncing the tariff protectionists and centralizers of government power. He meant it as something of a valedictory. His health was in steep decline, and in any case the Indiana legislature had gone heavily Republican, and Democrats' chance of regaining it that fall were slim. The following winter, when the lawmakers assembled, Voorhees was replaced with a Republican, though every Democratic vote went for him.Leonard S. Kenworthy, The Tall Sycamore of the Wabash:Daniel Wolsey Voorhees (Boston, 1936), 125-26. Retirement and death Voorhees returned to Indiana, preparing lectures that he intended to deliver on the lyceum circuit, should his health permit, and writing a memoir, \\"The Public Men of My Times,\\" that he hoped would be completed and would sell, as General Grant's memoirs did; without it, he would be leaving his daughter with no estate at all. Only three sections of it were completed before his death in Washington, D.C., in April 1897 at the age of 69.Leonard S. Kenworthy, The Tall Sycamore of the Wabash:Daniel Wolsey Voorhees (Boston, 1936), 127-28. His generosity or profligacy was such that his estate could not even afford his funeral expenses.

It is named after Montmorillon in France. Montmorillonite, a member of the smectite group, is a 2:1 clay, meaning that it has two tetrahedral sheets of silica sandwiching a central octahedral sheet of alumina. The particles are plate-shaped with an average diameter around 1 Œºm and a thickness of 0.96 nm; magnification of about 25,000 times, using an electron microscope, is required to \\"see\\" individual clay particles. Members of this group include, amongst others, saponite, nontronite, beidellite, and hectorite. Montmorillonite is a subclass of smectite, a 2:1 phyllosilicate mineral characterized as having greater than 50% octahedral charge; its cation exchange capacity (CEC) is due to isomorphous substitution of Mg for Al in the central alumina plane. The substitution of lower valence cations in such instances leaves the nearby oxygen atoms with a net negative charge that can attract cations. In contrast, beidellite is smectite with greater than 50% tetrahedral charge originating from isomorphous substitution of Al for Si in the silica sheet. The individual crystals of montmorillonite clay are not tightly bound hence water can intervene, causing the clay to swell. The water content of montmorillonite is variable and it increases greatly in volume when it absorbs water. Chemically, it is hydrated sodium calcium aluminium magnesium silicate hydroxide (Na,Ca)0.33(Al,Mg)2(Si4O10)(OH)2¬∑nH2O. Potassium, iron, and other cations are common substitutes, and the exact ratio of cations varies with source. It often occurs intermixed with chlorite, muscovite, illite, cookeite, and kaolinite. Cave conditions Montmorillonite can be concentrated and transformed within cave environments. The natural weathering of the cave can leave behind concentrations of aluminosilicates which were contained within the bedrock. Montmorillonite can form slowly in solutions of aluminosilicates. High HCO3 ‚àí concentrations and long periods of time can aid in its formation. Montmorillonite can then transform to palygorskite under dry conditions and to halloysite-10√Ö (endellite) in acidic conditions (pH 5 or lower). Halloysite-10√Ö can further transform into halloysite-7√Ö by drying. Uses Structure of montmorillonite Montmorillonite is used in the oil drilling industry as a component of drilling mud, making the mud slurry viscous, which helps in keeping the drill bit cool and removing drilled solids. It is also used as a soil additive to hold soil water in drought-prone soils, used in the construction of earthen dams and levees, and to prevent the leakage of fluids. It is also used as a component of foundry sand and as a desiccant to remove moisture from air and gases. Montmorillonite clays have been extensively used in catalytic processes. Cracking catalysts have used montmorillonite clays for over 60 years. Other acid-based catalysts use acid-treated montmorillonite clays. Similar to many other clays, montmorillonite swells with the addition of water. Montmorillonites expand considerably more than other clays due to water penetrating the interlayer molecular spaces and concomitant adsorption. The amount of expansion is due largely to the type of exchangeable cation contained in the sample. The presence of sodium as the predominant exchangeable cation can result in the clay swelling to several times its original volume. Hence, sodium montmorillonite has come to be used as the major constituent in nonexplosive agents for splitting rock in natural stone quarries in an effort to limit the amount of waste, or for the demolition of concrete structures where the use of explosive charges is unacceptable. This swelling property makes montmorillonite-containing bentonite useful also as an annular seal or plug for water wells and as a protective liner for landfills. Other uses include as an anticaking agent in animal feed, in papermaking to minimize deposit formation, and as a retention and drainage aid component. Montmorillonite has also been used in cosmetics. In a fine powder form, it can also be used as a flocculant in ponds. Tossed on the surface as it drops into the water, making the water \\"clouded\\", it attracts minute particles in the water and then settles to the bottom, cleaning the water. Koi and goldfish (carp) then actually feed on the \\"clump\\" which can aid in the digestion of the fish. It is sold in pond supply shops. Sodium montmorillonite is also used as the base of some cat litter products, due to its adsorbent and clumping properties. Calcined clay products Montmorillonite can be calcined to produce arcillite, a porous material. This calcined clay is sold as a soil conditioner for playing fields and other soil products such as for use as bonsai soil as an alternative to akadama. Medicine and pharmacology Montmorillonite is effective as an adsorptive of heavy metals, however the impact this has on human health is unknown. It's assumed that heavy metal adsorption would only be applicable when the clay has direct contact. Hence it will not help when ingested, as it almost certainly doesn't pass through the intestinal mucous membranes. For external use, montmorillonite has been used to treat contact dermatitis. Pet food Montmorillonite clay is added to some dog and cat foods as an anti-caking agent and because it may provide some resistance to environmental toxins, though research on the subject is not yet conclusive. Discovery Montmorillonite was first described in 1847 for an occurrence in Montmorillon in the department of Vienne, France, more than 50 years before the discovery of bentonite in the US. It is found in many locations worldwide and known by other names. Recently, a new source of Montmorillonite has been explored in Sulaiman Mountains of Pakistan. See also  References *Papke, Keith G.

She is the black-haired wife of caveman Barney Rubble and the adoptive mother of Bamm- Bamm Rubble. Her best friend is her next-door neighbor Wilma Flintstone. Betty lives in the fictional prehistoric town of Bedrock, a world where dinosaurs coexist with cavepeople and the cavepeople enjoy primitive versions of modern conveniences such as telephones, automobiles and washing machines. She speaks with an Midwestern accent. Betty's personality was based on the stock character of the lead character's best friend's wife, commonly seen in 1950s television (other prominent examples including Trixie Norton of The Honeymooners, which by conflicting accounts was a major inspiration for The Flintstones, and Ethel Mertz of I Love Lucy). Much like Trixie or Ethel, Betty spent a lot of her time socializing with Wilma, and the two would often end up working together to bail their husbands out of whatever scheme of Fred's had landed them in trouble, sometimes scheming with each other. Character Betty typically follows the lead of Barney or Wilma, so may appear to be the least developed character in the show. In spite of this, Betty is portrayed as having a distinctly emotional marriage with Barney, which often includes pet names and more obvious affection than the dynamic and energetic interaction between Fred and Wilma. Occasions when Betty leads the action are extremely scarce: one episode centers around her working undercover as a gentle old lady to earn money for a present for Barney; in another, the plot focuses on her and Wilma's suspicions of Barney being involved with another woman (who turns out to be Fred in a disguise in order to attend a ball game free of charge). This lack of protagonism (her continuous presence almost becoming a backdrop for supporting characters Pebbles, Bamm-Bamm and Dino) makes Betty less of the lead than the show's general concept might imply. Biography Betty is a friend of Wilma since their childhood. As a child, she lived with her parents who ran a convenience store and her older brother Brad. She also has a married sister with a baby son named Marblehead Standstone \\"The Surprise\\" As young adults, Betty and Wilma were employed as cigarette girls/waitresses at a resort. There, they first met and fell in love with their future husbands, Fred and Barney. Eventually, Betty and Barney were married, presumably not long after Fred and Wilma.\\"Bachelor Daze\\", The Flintstones, season 4 Betty became a homemaker, keeping house with such prehistoric aids as a baby mammoth vacuum cleaner, pelican washing machine, and so forth. Betty, much like Wilma, also enjoyed volunteering for various charitable/women's organizations in Bedrock, shopping, and (occasionally) meeting the celebrities of their world, including \\"Stony Curtis\\", \\"Cary Granite\\", and \\"Ann-Margrock\\". Betty at one time also had a job working for an 'old lady' who turned out to be a young lady in disguise and who was using Betty to pass counterfeit money; this was the only episode centered principally around Betty.\\"Old Lady Betty\\", The Flintstones, season 4 Despite her cheerful nature she has occasions to be angry at Barney \\"The Flintstone Flyer\\"; \\"The Diner\\"; \\"Peek a Boo camera\\" and once knocked out crooks with her stone purse who tried to kill BarneyThe Soft Untouchables In the fourth season of the original series, Betty and Barney found an abandoned infant on their doorstep, by the name of \\"Bamm-Bamm.\\" After a court battle for possession of Bamm-Bamm (in which the Rubbles faced the opposition's noted prehistoric lawyer \\"Perry Masonry\\"), the couple were allowed to adopt Bamm-Bamm.\\"Little Bamm-Bamm\\", The Flintstones, season 4 The Rubbles never had biological children. When Bamm-Bamm was a teenager, Betty gained employment as a reporter for one of Bedrock's newspapers, the Daily Granite (presumably a parody of the Daily Planet of Superman fame), under the editorial guidance of Lou Granite (presumably a parody of Lou Grant of the contemporaneous eponymous series, and formerly of The Mary Tyler Moore Show). While employed there, she shared various adventures with prehistoric superhero Captain Caveman, who (in a secret identity) also works for the newspaper. Later still, after Bamm-Bamm grew up and left home, Betty started a successful catering business with her neighbor and friend Wilma, before becoming a grandmother to Bamm-Bamm's twin children, Chip and Roxy. Portrayal June Foray voiced Betty in a 1959 Flintstones pilot titled The Flagstones, but Bea Benaderet was cast for the series and voiced Betty for the first 4 seasons before stepping down in 1964 (due to her scheduling conflicts with Petticoat Junction). Gerry Johnson took over the role for the last 2 seasons. B.J. Ward has since performed the role in later Flintstones media since 1986‚Äì2000. Grey DeLisle started voicing Betty in The Flintstones: On the Rocks and voiced her in The Flintstones & WWE: Stone Age SmackDown!. In the 1994 film, Betty was portrayed by Rosie O'Donnell, who reportedly won the role because she captured the high pitch laugh at her audition. Jane Krakowski replaced O'Donnell in the 2000 prequel The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas, in which Betty's maiden name is \\"O'Shale\\".

The game was later published by Sony Computer Entertainment (SCEA) in North America on March 25, 1998. It is the seventh game in the SaGa series, the first to be released on the PlayStation, and the first to be released under the SaGa brand outside Japan (previous overseas releases had used the Final Fantasy brand instead). SaGa Frontier was developed by the then-Square Production Team 2 (referred to as 2nd Division in the game) with Akitoshi Kawazu as director and producer, Koichi Ishii as planning chief, Kenji Ito as composer, and Tomomi Kobayashi as illustrator. Square Production Team 2 included Kyoji Koizumi, Miwa Shoda, Kazuko Shibuya, and Minoru Akao among others. The musical score for SaGa Frontier was composed and arranged by Kenji Ito, who provided music for many previous entries in the SaGa franchise. When development began, the game's title was intended to be Romancing SaGa 4. The focus shifted from the traditional SaGa style and began to focus on several different character on their own journeys. Nine stories were crafted, but two of them were dropped for being too comedic. The plot of SaGa Frontier takes place in a science fantasy universe called \\"The Regions\\", a group of worlds with varying degrees of culture, unique races, technology, and magic. The game allows the player to follow the exploits of one of seven protagonists, each with his or her own storyline and goal. The game's \\"Free Scenario System\\" offers a large amount of non-linear gameplay, allowing the player to freely travel between many of the Regions, interact with other characters, and take part in turn-based combat. SaGa Frontier enjoyed commercial success, having sold over one million copies. The game was generally well received in Japan and has been re-released under a few best- seller labels, as well as the PlayStation Store. However, it received largely mixed and average reviews in North America, mostly due to its ambitious Free Scenario System. Gameplay Playable characters fighting enemies while the player chooses one of battle skills (on the left) The basic concept of SaGa Frontier is based on its Free Scenario System, in which one can play as any of seven different protagonists, all of whom exist in the same setting: a solar system known as The Regions, a group of planets, each with its own culture, game-level of technology, and form of magic. The game is considered non- linear, in that from the beginning many of the characters are free to go almost anywhere and interact with almost anyone. Travel through most of the Regions is easy due to inter-regional ships traveling regularly between them. The player controls the protagonist on the field screen, a set of interconnecting pre-rendered backgrounds, and is able to speak with a slew of other characters in order to gather information, recruit party members, and initiate quests. Each character has his or her own storyline and a main quest to fulfill, but there are also several optional quests that any of the characters can participate in. Some of the main characters even encounter each other during their quests. The storyline of each character also changes depending on who is chosen, what is said in conversation, what events have already occurred, and who the protagonist has in his or her party, a concept first introduced in Romancing SaGa 2. Combat in SaGa Frontier pits players against groups of enemies encountered on the field screen. The battle screen depicts 2D-animated sprites amidst a 3D-rotating background. Battles are turn- based, in which the player chooses his or her actions and allow them, along those of the enemies, to play out. A variety of weapons, special skills, and magic spells are at the player's disposal. Most skills are learned mid-battle, while many spells are purchased in the game's shops. If certain conditions are met within the battle, party members on either side can create combination attacks for added damage. Winning battles will increase player character statistics such as hit points (HP), life points (LP), strength, and quickness. Outside of combat, players can equip and unequip (or \\"seal\\") weapons, armor, skills, spells, and items. First introduced in the Game Boy incarnations of the SaGa series, the game contains different races that exist within the Regions: the Humans, the Mystics, the Half-Mystics (half Human and half Mystic), Monsters, and the Mecs (robots). The player is encouraged to complete each of the seven scenarios one after the other. For added incentive, beating a character's game and saving its completion to the system data adds some bonuses. After beating one character's game, essentially every character in the following game starts off stronger and with better gear than before, and may depend on how many battles players fought in their previous quest that they saved on the system data. Fulfilling all seven main quests allows the player access to the \\"2nd Division\\" room, in which the player can fight all final bosses and talk to the game's programmers. Plot At the outset, the player can choose any one of seven main characters to play as, each with their own storyline: *, formerly a human girl, was run over by a carriage and given a blood transfusion by the Mystic Lord Orlouge. Chosen as the Charm Lord's heir, she is despised by human and mystic alike due to her status as the only half-Mystic in existence. She escapes Orlouge's castle with the help of the Princess White Rose. Asellus and White Rose remain on the run from Orlouge's many servants, but after White Rose sacrifices herself to save Asellus's life and freedom, Asellus decides to return and defeat Orlouge, to end the struggle once and for all. Depending on the actions the player does, there are three endings, in which she lives on as a human, half Mystic, or complete Mystic. * is a young mage fresh out of magic school. His quest is to collect the \\"Gift\\" for as many magics as possible. After that he is destined to fight his twin Rouge who has gained the opposite magics. Whichever brother survives obtains the other's magic and receives the sacred \\"Life\\" magic. It is revealed they were created artificially to produce the only wizard who could master all magical powers, even the conflicting pairs, and the duel is a mere formality to establish the dominant persona. Afterwards, Blue/Rouge descends into Hell to fight the demons who attacked his home. * is a blond ex-con and secret agent formerly working as a model. Her story began when her fianc√© Ren was murdered by a mysterious villain known as the \\"Joker\\". Wrongfully accused of the crime, she was sentenced to imprisonment in Despair, where she met Annie and Liza. With their help, they complete a competition the warden created to receive a full pardon for their crimes. After their escape, Emelia was recruited by the two to join the secret organization Gradius, which was also hunting for the \\"Joker\\". * is a carefree bard whose mother kicked him out of the house until Lute found a decent job. He stumbles face-first into a plot involving Trinity general Mondo and resistance leader Captain Hamilton, and the legacy of Lute's deceased father, who was betrayed and killed by Mondo. * is a teenage boy whose family is destroyed by the criminal syndicate called Black X. After being rescued from the same fate by the masked superhero named Alkarl, he is granted the identity of the superhero Alkaiser. After destroying several Black X bases and their main stronghold, Red stands at his father's grave, and Alkarl appears to take Red's powers away, making him a normal man again. It turns out that Alkarl was Red's father's friend, Hawk, and Red will not be able to live a \\"normal\\" life for long. * (Known as in the Japanese release) is a Lummox, a fox-like creature, and one of the last remaining inhabitants of the mysterious world, Margmel. Determined to save his homeworld, he seeks the Rings of Margmel. In his search, he starts out in Scrap, where he finds the researcher Mei-ling. Riki's quest takes him around the regions to gather the Rings until he comes face to face with Virgil, a Mystic Lord. Following the battle, Riki returns home to attempt to restore Margmel. *T260G is an ancient Mec, a model constructed from junk parts, awakened in modern times. Originally part of a combat ship with a secret mission against the RB3 (Region Buster 3), it lost its memory when it crashed into Junk. With help of Leonard, a human who transferred his memories into a Mec, and Gen, a master swordsman, it recovers its memory and finishes the job. Development SaGa Frontier was developed by the then-Square Production Team 2 (referred to as 2nd Division in the game) with Akitoshi Kawazu as director and producer, Koichi Ishii as planning chief, Kenji Ito as composer, and Tomomi Kobayashi as illustrator. Square Production Team 2 included Kyoji Koizumi, Miwa Shoda, Kazuko Shibuya, and Minoru Akao among others. The musical score for SaGa Frontier was composed and arranged by Kenji Ito, who provided music for many previous entries in the SaGa franchise. Production began in December 1995. Originally, the title of this game was \\"Romancing SaGa 4\\" during early development. Due to a change in hardware from Super Famicom to PlayStation, Kawazu changed the title. The team did not use 3D graphics as they were unaware of the hardware capacities at the time. Pre-release screenshot of the game's title screen showing Fuse (bottom left) as a main scenario In the earliest stages of development, two more heroes' quests were also being planned, in addition to the existing seven lead characters. One of them was Fuse, the IRPO agent who may be enlisted as a playable character in the actual release. In his quest, Fuse was supposed to be able to take part in other characters' scenarios, and the ultimate goal of his quest might be determined by what the player did in the course of gameplay. The \\"ninth\\" protagonist was to be the daughter of a channellers family who is engaging in a controversy as to who of them shall inherit the property of their former patriarch. This scenario seems to be dropped during the early development because of being too comedic. Due to time constraints, some plot points of Asellus story were removed. During those events, Asellus was supposed to visit Dr. Nusakan's clinic, Bio Research Lab, Lambda Base, and Furdo's Workshop so that she would find her true identity so that she would decide to live as a human being or as a mystic. These quests were also intended to affect her scenario's ending. Kawazu later noted both time constraints and disc space issues as the main reasons for cut content, although the notorious ending of Blue's scenario in the middle of his final boss was always planned. Release Due to its popularity in Japan, the game has been re-released a number of times at a budget price: in 2000 as part of the Square Millennium Collection, in 2002 as part of the PSone Books best-seller range, and again in 2004 as a part of Square Enix's Ultimate Hits line. Most recently in 2008, the game was released on the PlayStation Store in Japan. Soundtracks SaGa Frontier Original Sound Track comprises 75 tracks spanning three compact discs. It was released in Japan on April 21, 1999 by DigiCube and was later reprinted by Square Enix on February 1, 2006. On disc 3 of the soundtrack, there is a hidden track, in the pregap, which can only be heard when rewinding the CD from the beginning; this was originally supposed to be Riki's theme. There also are alternate titles for those pieces of music which can be seen in the songlist in the in-game \\"2nd Division\\". It≈ç states that he wanted to create an arranged album for the game as well, although one has yet to be released. Merchandise Two guidebooks for SaGa Frontier have been published in Japan by ASCII: The Essence of SaGa Frontier and The Complete of SaGa Frontier. Another companion book titled SaGa Frontier How To Walk In Regions was published by Kodansha. BradyGames released its own Saga Frontier: Official Strategy Guide in North America in 1998. When the game was re-issued in Japan in 2000 as part of the Square Millennium Collection, it included a collectible teacup set and a tee-shirt depicting the character Blue. Reception SaGa Frontier received mostly mixed or average reviews in North America. The game currently holds a 73% on GameRankings. Although many publications disagreed on positive aspects of the game, much criticism arose from its Free Scenario System. GameSpot called the game a \\"solid, if not exactly stellar, RPG that'll certainly keep you busy for a while‚Äîor at least until you tire of its occasional lack of focus\\". The website found the combat refreshing and many of its pre-rendered visuals to be well-done, but had many negative comments, specifically concerning the game's nonlinear nature and unfocused scenarios. IGN proclaimed SaGa Frontier to be \\"the only bruised apple in Square's current collection of role-playing games\\", similarly stating that the game's Free Scenario System can become confusing and easily cause the player to become lost. However, it labelled the story and sprite-based graphics its strong points. Game Informer notably found that the plot of SaGa Frontier is more of an outline than a descriptive formula as seen in other Square titles such as Final Fantasy VII and Chrono Trigger: the publication also criticized the game's graphics, but praised its length and gameplay. Staff reviewers at RPGFan and RPGamer agreeably noted the game's battle system to be its highlight; both websites mention that discovering combinations attacks to be \\"fun\\" and \\"exciting\\". Next Generation reviewed the PlayStation version of the game, rating it one star out of five, and stated that \\"With the potential for a deep and involving adventure, SaGa Frontier is a depressing misfire from a company praised for its innovation and high-end titles.\\" Saga Frontier sold over 1.05 million copies in Japan by the end of 1997, which had not appreciably increased by 2008. It was the 5th top-selling game in Japan in 1997 and is currently the 15th top-selling PlayStation game for the region. In 2000, SaGa Frontier was voted the 18th best PlayStation game of all time by the editors of Famitsu magazine.

It is 1 km in length. The Roman governor at Ambleside built a villa on the island. In 1250 it was the seat of the district's Lord of the Manor. It was also a Royalist stronghold during the English Civil War. Island House was built in 1774 to designs by John Plaw. It is unusual in that it is circular in plan, built of brick, three floors high with a four column portico; it draws closely on the Pantheon, Rome. The house was sold along with the island to the wealthy Curwen family who renamed the island after their daughter, Isabella. It was then sold on to Isabella Curwen by her family in 1781 for ¬£1,720 and was permanently renamed after her. The descendants of Isabella and her husband John Christian Curwen lived on the island until 1993. It is called 'Bell Island' not 'Isabella Island' because of use of the shortened form of Isabella- Bella, which lost the 'a' to become 'Bell', spelt 'Belle' by the Ordnance Survey map of 1925 over the years. It was known locally as the Great Island or Long Holme and formerly known as Longholm, before its renaming in 1774. In 1996 (some records suggest 23 December 1994), Belle Isle House suffered serious damage following a large fire. However, it was repaired and is once again a place of residence.

Apple's iBooks Store went on to reject Full Screen as containing prohibited explicit or objectionable content, as reported in Keighley News and Telegraph & Argus. Photography Peter Paul Hartnett initially made his name as a photographer on the underground LGBT club scene, developing and printing his own work. Hartnett took his first nightclub photograph of punk icon Soo Catwoman at Bang Disco, London, in October 1976. He worked at London hotspots such as Leigh Bowery's Taboo, publishing his photography in publications such as i-D, Dazed & Confused, V-Man, Vision, XLR8R, Fused, The Observer Magazine, The Independent Magazine, The Sunday Telegraph Magazine and The Sunday Times Magazine, among others. Hartnett's access to non-mainstream alternative spaces offered a view into a previously unseen part of this undocumented subculture. Although his work was journalistic in approach, he claims he has always attempted to capture real life from a moral perspective, saying, 'I tend not to take photographs that are in any way manipulative or exploitative. When I have, for example, photographed someone who has been drunk or drug-fucked, I will often edit these out of a presentation as they can be demeaning. I do not do nudes. Sometimes I have photographed dancers who look so lost, and these images tend not to get published as I feel a camera can be invasive and that is not my intention. I feel very protective about my subjects.' Hartnett regularly documents London Fashion Week, Graduate Fashion Week, Free Range, plus music festivals, with his favourite being the annual Rebellion Punk Festival. As a collector of vintage photography, Hartnett has until very recently been a major contributor to the Photographic Youth Music Culture Archive, with his work now represented by Lee Dalton at Photoshot / Avalon. His broadcasting work has included MTV, VH1, RTL, BBC, Channel 4 and Discovery / TLC. Awards and honours Hartnett has won a North West Arts Award. In 2007, Hartnett was also declared winner of The Manchester Monologues Manchester Metropolitan University Literary Competition, in collaboration with Urbis Offcut at The Manchester Fringe Festival.

Foulney Island is one of the Islands of Furness in Morecambe Bay, northern England. For local government purposes the island is in the borough of Barrow-in-Furness. It has an area of about 40 acres (16 ha). In earlier times it was known as Fowle Island. The island is connected to the mainland via a shingle and rock causeway which was built in Victorian times as a tidal protection measure. The Foulney causeway leaves the Roa Island causeway halfway along its length on the eastern side. The maximum elevation on the island is no more than 10 feet (3 metres) above the high tide level. At the time of highest tides much of the island can be inundated. There are no permanent inhabitants on the island.

These exopolymers include the biofilms produced by bacteria to anchor them and protect them from environmental conditions. One type of expolymer, Transparent Exopolymers (TEP), found in both marine and aquatic ecosystems, are planktonic acidic polysaccharides of a gel-like consistency, originally defined by their ability to be stained visible by acidic Alcian Blue. Their free-floating characteristic sets TEPs aside from other extracellular polymeric substance subgroups where exopolymers exists as cell coating, dissolved slime or as part of biofilm matrices. The formation of Transparent Exopolymer Particles(TEP) is mainly due to the abiotic coagulation of dissolved carbohydrates, which is secreted by the phytoplankton communities. Transparent Exopolymer Particles ((TEP) have the ability to form larger aggregates because of their strong surface active properties or ‚Äústickiness‚Äù. This particular property of TEP allows them to perform as a glue matrix for other solid particles including detritus. Transparent Exopolymer Particles (TEP) is also a carbon source for bacteria, which plays a significant role in affecting the food web structure and the carbon cycle in the ocean. Additionally, the conversion of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to particulate organic carbon (POC) is an aggregation process that is due to TEP formation.

It was probably used in the ritual sprinkling of the bride with water before the wedding. In form, it has a large bowl-like body and a stand that can be long or short. Painted scenes are placed on either the body of the vessel or the stand. One of the earliest lebetes gamikoi was painted by, apparently, a follower of Sophilos (c. 580 - 570). The lebes gamikos had the typical wedding procession, accompanied by the unique addition of chariots bearing Helen and Menelaos and the bride's brothers. A typical lebes gamikos shows wedding scenes (including mythic weddings such as the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, but the iconography can also be related to scenes such as mimes.

Value Under the barter system that existed in early Iron Age Greece, goods and services were directly exchanged without the use of an exchange medium (money). However, such transactions were aided by conventionally accepted reference values. Certain commodities were often used as reference points for evaluating the relative values of different goods. Cattle was common as such a reference in many early cultures. In Greece during this period, in addition to cattle, bronze and iron items‚Äîspecifically lebetes‚Äîwere also common. Remnants of stone inscriptions preserve numerous examples of fines and compensatory damages denominated in bronze lebetes from ancient Crete, as early as the 7th century BCE. For example, in one instance, a bronze tripod \\"of [worth] ten lebetes\\" was recorded as payment for a fine. In the Iliad, a bronze lebes was valued at one ox. By the Hellenistic period, long after the introduction of coin based money, the lebes survived as a term for a quantity of silver coinage.

He also wrote the books The Timewaster Letters, Return of The Timewaster Letters and The Timewaster Diaries under the pseudonym Robin Cooper. Television and film Popper began his career in British television working for The Comic Strip under Peter Richardson. He then worked on the Channel 4 show, The Big Breakfast, writing for comedy puppets, Zig and Zag. He also made his first appearance as a comedian on The Eleven O'Clock Show as character Simon Michael Simon. Later, he was employed as a Commissioning Editor for Entertainment and Comedy at Channel 4. His commissioning credits include the series Bo' Selecta!, Black Books, Spaced and Bremner, Bird and Fortune. He also commissioned three series of the Comedy Lab whilst at the channel. He left the role to work on the first series of Look Around You (2002) with Peter Serafinowicz. Look Around You was a spoof educational science comedy which ran on BBC2. It was written and produced by Popper (who featured onscreen in one episode as \\"Jack Morgan\\" also performing the rock song \\"Little Mouse\\") and Serafinowicz (who appeared more frequently). The pair also wrote and played all the music in the series. Look Around You was nominated for a BAFTA and a British Comedy Award. In 2003, Popper co-wrote the short film Hello Friend with Graham Linehan. In 2005, Popper returned to the screen with a second series of Look Around You, again co-written by himself and Peter Serafinowicz. Made up of six half-hour shows, Look Around You 2 resembled an early-80s Tomorrow's World . Popper appeared in all six episodes as Jack Morgan. Besides Popper and Serafinowicz, the series featured Josie D'Arby and Olivia Colman as presenters. Look Around You 2 won the Rose D'Or TV Award in 2006 for Best Comedy Series. Popper was a programme consultant and co-writer for the TV sketch comedy The Peter Serafinowicz Show (2007), in which he also made several brief on-screen appearances. Popper was the producer for the third and fourth series of Channel 4's Peep Show. Both series won the British Comedy Award for Best Comedy, and Popper won a BAFTA for series 4. Popper was the script editor on all three series of The Inbetweeners. He was also script editor on Graham Linehan's The IT Crowd and the BBC3 comedy Him & Her. In 2009 Popper and Serafinowicz wrote, produced and performed in a 30-minute podcast entitled The Other Side. The comedy purported to be a radio show coming from the only radio station (\\"Radio Spiritworld\\") to broadcast from the afterlife. Robert and Peter also created the online world religion, \\"Tarvuism\\", making a variety of shorts. The pair created a number of web videos on YouTube showcasing their surreal humour, including \\"Birds of Britain\\", \\"Markets of Britain\\" and \\"Intermission\\". Popper also wrote on the fourteenth series of South Park; he was signed up by creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker following a week long brainstorming session, and worked on the final four episodes of first half-season. Popper created, wrote and produced six series of the Channel 4 sitcom Friday Night Dinner. Series 1 aired from February to April in 2011 and won the Rose D'or Award for Best Sitcom. It also received two BAFTA nominations and four British Comedy Award nominations. Popper had a small, uncredited role in Edgar Wright's 2004 film Shaun of the Dead, in which he played a news reporter, and also appeared in the Wright's next film, Hot Fuzz (2007), credited as \\"Not Janine\\". He reprised his Look Around You character, Jack Morgan, for an appearance in the music video for Frankie & The Heartstrings' 2011 single \\"Hunger\\". Books Robert Popper wrote the books The Timewaster Letters and Return of the Timewaster Letters under the pseudonym Robin Cooper. The books were a set of madcap letters he wrote to weird associations and hobby groups. The books became bestsellers and have so far sold over 300,000 copies. The third \\"Robin Cooper\\" book, The Timewaster Diaries, was published in 2007, was serialised on Radio 4's Book of the Week programme 16‚Äì20 July 2007, read by Paul Whitehouse. The Timewaster Letters was released in the US in the summer of 2008 and there are a number of Robin Cooper Timewaster Phone Calls released on the web and Popper's website. Tangerinegate Popper was responsible for a minor hoax regarding Gordon Brown in February 2010 known as \\"Tangerinegate\\".Tangerinegate... by Robert Popper Popper, who often makes prank phone calls, rang up London radio station LBC claiming he had seen Brown throw a tangerine into a laminating machine during a fit of rage, breaking the machine. This hoax was reported as a true event in The Daily Telegraph as well as being referenced (as 'alleged') on comedy news show The Bubble. The Financial Times (FT) website published a blog post, stating its belief that the story was a hoax. The FT also reported on the emergence of a computer animated version of the events from Hong Kong. Similar stories regarding Gordon Brown having temper tantrums were widely published in the British media during February 2010, following publicity about Andrew Rawnsley's book The End of the Party.http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780670918515,00.html?strSrchSql=Andrew+Rawnsley*/The_End_of_the_Party_Andrew_Rawnsley The Financial Times later issued a follow-up post acknowledging the hoax.

It is an application of pyrolysis. The process breaks up or 'cracks' large molecules. Coke, coal gas, gas carbon, coal tar, ammonia liquor, and coal oil are examples of commercial products historically produced by the destructive distillation of coal. Many early experiments used retorts for destructive distillation. Destructive distillation of any particular inorganic feedstock produces only a small range of products as a rule, but destructive distillation of organic materials commonly produces very many compounds, often hundreds, although not all products of any particular process are of commercial importance. The distillate are generally lower molecular weight. Some fractions however polymerise or condense small molecules into larger molecules, including heat- stable tarry substances and chars. Cracking feedstocks into liquid and volatile compounds, and polymerising, or the forming of chars and solids, may both occur in the same process, and any class of the products might be of commercial interest. Currently the major industrial application of destructive distillation is to coal. Historically the process of destructive distillation and other forms of pyrolysis led to the discovery of many chemical compounds or elucidation of their structures before contemporary organic chemists had developed the processes to synthesise or specifically investigate the parent molecules. It was especially in the early days that investigation of the products of destructive distillation, like those of other destructive processes, played parts in enabling chemists to deduce the chemical nature of many natural materials. Well known examples include the deduction of the structures of pyranoses and furanoses.I.L. Finar Organic Chemistry vol 1 ( 4th.ed.) Longmans 1963 plus I.L. Finar Organic Chemistry vol 2 ( 3rd.ed.) Longmans Green & Co. 1964 May be downlaoded from: https://archive.org/details/OrganicChemistryVol1 plus https://archive.org/details/OrganicChemistryVol2 Process The process of pyrolysis can be conducted in a distillation apparatus (retort) to form the volatile products for collection. The mass of the product will represent only a part of the mass of the feedstock, because much of the material remains as char, ash, and non-volatile tars. In contrast, combustion consumes most of the organic matter, and the net weight of the products amount to roughly the same mass as the fuel and oxidant consumed. Destructive distillation and related processes are in effect the modern industrial descendants of traditional charcoal burning crafts. As such they are of industrial significance in many regions, such as Scandinavia. The modern processes are sophisticated and require careful engineering to produce the most valuable possible products from the available feedstocks.Bates, John S.; Distillation of hardwoods in Canada; Pub: Ottawa, F.

It lies on the road that connects Khartoum with Gallabat on the Ethiopian border, about from the capital. Overview El-Gadarif is surrounded by mountains on three sides. The city represents an excellent example of the intermingled ethnicities of central Sudan. Recently, a university has been established there. The main feature of the city is the grain silo built by the Russians to store sorghum. The town is famous for its daily sesame seed auctions. Name The word Gedaref is derived from the Arabic phrase (Alli qada-Ye-rif) (Arabic ÿßŸÑŸÇÿ∂ÿß Ÿäÿ±ŸÅ), meaning 'He who has finished selling or buying should leave'. The phrase was later developed into 'Al-Gadarif'. The story of the name begins when Arab nomad tribes roaming the Butana plains in East-central Sudan chose the place where the city is built as a market place called Suq Abu Sinn (the Market of Abu Sinn), where the nomads exchanged their commercial commodities with the indigenous people. When the sun set, a herald used to call 'AIli Qada-ye-rif ... Alli qada-ye-rif', asking every one who had finished his dealing in the market to leave so that the market could be closed on time. Another theory is that the town was named for the range of hills surrounding the area which looks like cartilage. Yet there is confusion in the spelling of the word in Arabic, because \\"cartilage\\" in Arabic is written as Ghadarif (Arabic ÿ∫ÿ∂ÿßÿ±ŸÅ) not Qadarif (Arabic ŸÇÿ∂ÿßÿ±ŸÅ), the spelling of the town name.http://www.angelfire.com/ma2/yoss/Gedarif.html\\"Al- Qa·∏çƒÅrif.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2011. Web. 20 Aug. 2011. . History Al-Gada-ye-rif market place developed into a village; then into a town with its dwellers cultivating its fertile soil with sorghum, sesame, peanuts and vegetables. Its green plains during the rainy seasons attracted many nomad herds and peasants from neighbouring areas. According to Holt and Daly, the Shukriya, who were camel-owning nomads and the leading tribe of the southern Butana, were living and ruling the grain-producing rain lands of Gadarif or Qadarif, where a tribal market developed. This place, originally called Suq Abu Sinn (Abu Sinn's Market) took the name Qadarif, anglicized as Gedaref. The Scottish explorer James Bruce (who called the town Teawa) passed through al Qadarif in 1772. He recorded that its sheikh, Fidele, was a vassal of the Kingdom of Sennar. Today, Teawa or Twawa is the name of a hill in the western part of the city. The British explorer Samuel Baker stopped in this town in November 1862. He mentioned in his book The Nile Tributaries Of Abyssinia that it lay on the trade route between Khartoum and Kassala, and described at length its twice- weekly market. During the Turkiyah (Egyptian rule), Gedaref became an administrative unit with a strong military garrison. The Mahdist forces preserved this status when they occupied the town in 1884 during the Mahdist Revolt, using it as a base to conquer other places in the area and in neighbouring Ethiopia. Sir Gawain Bell, who worked in the Sudan in 1931 to 1945 as Assistant Inspector for Gedaref, referred to Gedaref in his book (Shadows on the sand), as a town with more African appearance than Arab, because of its hut houses (locally called quttiyya) made of wood, reeds and grass. Its population was more than fifteen thousand, a mixture of Arab tribes and peoples from Nigeria, Eritrea and Abyssinia.Shadows on the sand: the memoirs of Sir Gawain Bell, Gawain Bell (Sir.) - 1983 In September 1898 a British battalion led by Lieutenant-Colonel Parsons moved from Kassala toward Gedaref and clashed with a Mahdist Dervishes army composed of 3,500 men under the command of the Mahdist Emir Sa'ad-Allah in a jungle located between the River Atbara and Gedaref town. The fighting was fierce, but the forces of Parsons managed finally to defeat the Mahdist Dervishes.Sudan Despatches, a copy received by the Secretary of State for War from Major-General Lord Kitchener of Khartoum, G.C.B., K.C.M.G., Sirdar of the Egyptian Army. War Office, December 9, 1898. In the town a small garrison was left consisting of 200 soldiers led by the Mahdi Emir Nur Angara. The Mahdist Dervishes who fought bravely realized their defeat and retreated to the west of the city. Most of the defeated army was composed of soldiers from the Darfur and Kordofan regions of western Sudan. They had no choice except to settle their status with the British to stay and live with their families in the western part of Gedaref, which later became the basis of the Mayoral Bakr, whose influence extends to the frontier town of Gallabat on the Sudanese-Ethiopian border.Winston Churchill, Sir, Winston S. Churchill - 2007 - 276; Books.google.com During the Second World War, Gedaref became very important for the Condominium of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, by providing food (mainly grain and oil seeds) to the armies of the Allies in East Africa. After the war the town became also more attractive for agricultural investment to many segments of Sudanese tribes, especially after the establishment of the Mechanized Farming Corporation in 1968.Sudan Vision Daily News Paper http://www.sudanvisiondaily.com/ , A History of the Sudan: From the Coming of Islam to the Present Day (6th Edition) Longman(, 2011) Topography, flora and fauna The geographical feature of the city is marked by a group of hills surrounding it and small khors (tiny dry valley creeks). The largest is called Khor Maqadim, which runs from the southeast part of the city between Deim El Nur and Deim Suakin districts to the northwestern part of the city in Deim Bakr District. Its course overflows during the fall season, when heavy rain falls in the highland areas along the Ethiopian border. The climate of Gedaref is hot and rainy in the summer. The rainy season extends four months, with an average of annual rainfall of 700 to 900 mm. In the autumn during the rainy seasons, or Kharief (Arabic ÿßŸÑÿÆÿ±ŸäŸÅ) as it is locally called, large pools of water and green meadows with trees of various kinds of acacia cover the area. The early advent of the flamingo flock, or the Simber (Arabic ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸÖÿ®ÿ±) as it is locally called, gives the sign of the beginning of the Kharif.  Climate  El-Gadarif has a hot semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen climate classification BSh). Administration The city is administratively and socially divided into Diems (ÿØŸäŸÖ) or districts. The famous Deims are Deim Bakr, Deim El Nur, Diem Al Khama, Abakar Jibriel, Al- midan, Deim Abbas, Deim Saukin, Deim Sa'ad, Deim Hamad, Janayin, Abbayo, Nasr, Selamt El-Bey, Al Israa, Al Malik, A Nadher, Al Tadamun, Al Danagla, Al Jumhouriya, Al Mufaqaat, Al Syool, Al Mourada, Barnu, Badr, Marco, Al Rabaa, Ruwina, Addona, Taradona, Karfis, Al Kababish, Karrari, Al Mahrouga, Al Sufi, Al Muwazafien, Army Baracks and Police Baracks. Greater Gedaref includes many rural districts and villages such as Um Shagara, Al- Faw, Wad addida, Sabouniya, Koum Shitta, Um sawani, Um Sunaebra, Id Altin, Kassab, Al Samina, Shasheina, Al Hwata, Al Houri, AlMatna, and Al Shuwak. In 1994 Gedaref became the capital of Al-Qadarif State which includes Gedaref city, Faw, Gallabat, and Fashaga areas. Economy Gedaref is a trade centre for cotton, cereals, sesame seeds, and fodder produced in the surrounding areas, and it is a well-known agriculture area where a mechanized farming scheme has been introduced since 1954. About 70% of the total mechanized farming in the Sudan is carried out in Gedaref. The aim of the mechanized farming is to develop the areas socially and economically . Many large and endless individual fields grew suddenly and have scattered over the whole area surrounding Gedarif such as Um-seinat, Al-Ghadambliya, making use of the fertile soil and abundant rainfall (avg. 700 to 900 mm/year), and relatively obtainable manpower. The River Gash Irrigation Scheme is located to the northeast of Al-Qa·∏çƒÅrif, while the Rahad Scheme and the famous Gezira Scheme lie to the west.\\"Rahad Scheme.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2011. Web. 21 Aug. 2011. . With the cultivation of sesame seed, sunflower, cotton, peanuts and cereals, especially sorghum, Gedaref has become the country's granary. Thus, if Sudan could be the granary of Africa and the Middle East, Gedaref is the breadbasket of the Sudan. Light industries in the city include cotton ginning and spinning mills and soap factories. Transportation and communication The city is served by a station on the national railway network. It is linked with the capital Khartoum via Wad Medani city by a net of roads, railway, airway, and seasonal direct roads. It is also linked to Port Sudan city with roads and railway through Kassala at a distance of about 200 km. There are also roads to the Gallabat at the edge of the boundary with Ethiopia connecting Gedarif with the Ethiopian city of Gonder, and from there to the Ethiopian capital Addis Abeba.

The Gedaref Digital City Gedaref is distinguished also by its digital city, directed by the Gedaref Digital City Organization (GDCO) which is a non-governmental and non-profit organization, founded in 2005 in partnership between Gedaref city and Eindhoven community in the Netherlands. The initiative was taken by Dr.Agnes Ovington of Eindhoven Municipality, Gedaref Public Organization for Water and Development. GDCO, is part of the Telecentres Movement where ICT is used for community development. It won many international awards. It is the winner of information for development award i4d 2007 (e-India 2007) for the inclusion of the disabled, the winner of i4d 2008 awards for the best innovations at the grassroots Telecentres, and the winner of i4d 2009 for the initiatives of civil society for development (e-Agriculture project and other e-services).Gedaref Digital City website. http://gedaref.com/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=99:2011-06-09-16-13-12&catid;=38:rokstories- samples‚ü®=en&Itemid;= Population The population of the city is mainly Arab or Nuba Sudanese. It includes the indigenous Beja people. The total population is 269,395 (as of 2008). Inhabitants origins in Gedaref have rapidly changed during the last decades. Dwellers who belong to various nationalities had settled in the area along with the indigenous people. Today the mosaic of population includes many Sudanese tribes from different regions as far as Dar Fur, Kordofan, southern and northern Sudan. Tribes like Shaigiya, Baggara, Dinka, Fur, Nuba, Masalit, Shukriya, Beja, Hausa people and many other Sudanese tribes are represented in Gedaref. No other city in the Sudan, with exception of Khartoum and Port Sudan has so many dwellers of Foreign origin among its population, as Gedaref. Kurds, Armenians, Panian of India, Greeks, Egyptian Copts, Ethiopians, Eritrean, Somalis, Chadians, Yemenis, Italians has been Sudanized since generations and well integrated in the Gedaref community. The main reason for this gathering of foreign and local groups of people in Gedaref can be attributed to the Agricultural boom that swept the city and turned it to a major centre of trade in the area. Education Education in Gedaref has been far developed in the last decades. The city counts about 73 schools of different levels. With the establishment of Al Qadarif University the city has accomplished its dream to become an education shrine for the whole area of southeast Sudan. Boarding schools has been established in the city as early as the sixties to accommodate young villagers and rural areas youth. http://www.gaduniv.edu.sd/ Among the famous children of the city are Rashid Bakr (former Vice President 1983) and Ahmed Al Jabri (singer).

He was one of the sons of the dynasty's founder Hacƒ± I Giray (c. 1441‚Äì1466). It is reported that in 1456 he rebelled against his father and briefly occupied the throne, but this is not certain. This claim appears in several Wikipedia articles, but does not seem to be in the usual printed sources. After his father's death, for twelve years (1466‚Äì1478), the throne alternated between Hayder's brothers Nur Devlet and Me√±li I Giray. During one of Mengli's reigns Hayder was held in honorable confinement at the Genoese fortress of Sudak. In March 1475 the nobles replaced Mengli with Hayder. He and the Shirin Bey Eminek raided the Lithuanian border. In May‚ÄìDecember 1475 the Turks captured the Genoese ports on the south shore. They released Nur Devlet from prison in Sudak and made him khan. Hayder yielded to Nur Devlet but their relations were not good. Nur Devlet proved unpopular and in the spring of 1478 the Turks released their prisoner Mengli and placed him on the throne. Hayder and Nur Devlet fled to Kiev in the Polish Kingdom. About 1479 they moved to Muscovy under protection of the grand duke Ivan III, who later banished Hayder to Northern Muscovy for reasons that remain unknownGaivoronsky, p74 says that there were rumors that the Poles were planning to use him and Ivan decided to be safe, but his only source is Velyaminov-Zernov, which is very old..

Wistanstow is located about south of Church Stretton and north of Ludlow. It is about north of Craven Arms. It is just off the main Shrewsbury-Hereford road, the A49. The large parish, of , includes a number of other small settlements: Woolston, Upper Affcot, Cwm Head, Bushmoor, Strefford, Whittingslow, Felhampton and Cheney Longville, and a population of 724 was recorded in the 2001 census,National Statistics South Shropshire parishes increasing to 812 at the 2011 Census. The River Onny flows through the parish, southwest of the village, also Leamoor Common and Wettles are to the north of the village.  History and amenities  The main lane running through the village is a Roman road, which ran between the Roman settlements and forts at Leintwardine and Wroxeter. The village takes its name from the Anglo-Saxon saint Wigstan who was the grandson of the King of Mercia. He was martyred at this location by his greatuncle. His burial took place at his family crypt at the abbey of Rependon (now known as Repton) the Mercian capital, memorialized as St. Wystan upon his canonization (one of the oldest unaltered places of Christian worship in England). The Saxon suffix stow means (enclosed) place. An uncle of W(ystan) H(ugh) Auden (named for the eponymous saint spelled Wystan by his father who was an alumnus of Repton school built on the remains of the Abbey) wrote the entry for Wistanstow in Little Guide to Shropshire The present church building, Holy Trinity, was mainly built between 1180 and 1200. The nave roof of 1630 is one the church's finest features and was re-gilded in the mid-1960s. The interior is also graced by a number of early 19th century box pews and fine mid-20th-century wooden panelling behind the altar. It contains a war memorial plaque to local men who died serving in the World Wars and another to Lieutenant Colonel Henry Beddoes who was lost when S.S. Chiosa hit a wartime mine off Sicily in January 1919. Wistanstow has a splendid mock Tudor village hall that was given to the village in 1925 by a local landowner. This enormous \\"blackandwhite\\" building included cottages for the district nurse and resident caretaker. The village has a small church primary school. At the other end of the village opposite Manor Farm is the Plough Inn. Just behind is a small independent real ale brewery, \\"Wood's\\". In 1984, both the Plough and the brewery were featured as the final destination on a Shropshire edition of Treasure Hunt, with Anneka Rice pulling herself a pint of real ale to complete the game. ‚ÄúThe Smithy‚Äù is the village‚Äôs community shop which was officially opened by the actor Pete Postlethwaite OBE, a local parishioner in April 2000. Once the workplace of a local blacksmith and little more than the size of a shed, the shop stocks all the basics, with as much as possible sourced from local suppliers.

One of many mixed-race descendants of Southeast Indians who intermarried with European traders and later colonial settlers, William Weatherford was of mixed Creek, French, and Scots ancestry. He was raised as a Creek in the matrilineal nation and achieved his power in it, through his mother's prominent Wind Clan (as well as his father's trading connections). After the war, he rebuilt his wealth as a slaveholding planter in lower Monroe County, Alabama. Early life and education William Weatherford was born in 1781 (Griffith Jr. analysis), near the Upper Creek towns of Coosauda. Available via subscription, and with word search features, at questia.com.Griffith's analysis of Weatherford's date of birth is based on the death of his mother's first husband in the summer of 1780, see below and Griffith Jr., op. cit., p. 5.Several sources state that Weatherford was born in 1765, the date recorded on a tombstone located in Little River, Baldwin County, Alabama. Many sources state that his mother, Sehoy III, was born in 1759, and his siblings are documented as being born in the 1780s. It is near the current Coosada, Alabama, and was then a Koasati Indian town, near Hickory Ground (current Wetumpka, Alabama). His mother was Sehoy III, a \\"daughter of a Tabacha cheiftain\\" and from \\"the most powerful and privileged of all the Creek clans,\\" the Wind Clan (in Creek, Hutalgalgi ). His father, Charles Weatherford, was a red-haired Scots trader and friend of the chieftain, and had married Sehoy III after the death of her first husband, Tory Col. John Tate, in the summer of 1780. Sehoy III was of mixed Creek, French and possibly Scottish descent. As the Creek had a matrilineal kinship system, Sehoy III's children were considered born into her clan.Sehoy III's children had her clan status, the same as her male clan relatives. In this kinship system, property and other inheritance were passed through the maternal line, and a boy's maternal uncle was more important to his upbringing than his biological father. Charles Weatherford had a trading post near the Creek village, built a plantation, raised thoroughbred horses for racing, and contributed to his family as a trader. Benjamin Hawkins, first appointed as United States Indian agent in the Southeast and then as Superintendent of Indian Affairs in the territory south of the Ohio River, lived among the Creek and Choctaw, and knew them well. He commented in letters to President Thomas Jefferson that Creek women were matriarchs and had control of the children \\"when connected with a white man.\\" Hawkins observed that almost all of the traders, some wealthy, were likewise as \\"inattentive to their children as the Indians\\". As Griffith explains (based on John R. Swanton), the lack of fatherly concern was not an \\"unnatural indifference,\\" given the Creek culture and clan kinship system, and which established a closer relationship of children to their mother's eldest brother (more so than with their biological father). As a boy William Weatherford was called \\"Billy\\". After he showed his skill as a warrior, he was given the \\"war name\\" of Hopnicafutsahia, or \\"Truth Teller.\\" He was the great-grandson of Captain Jean Marchand, the French commanding officer of Fort Toulouse, and Sehoy I, a Creek of the Wind clan.On his mother's side, he was a nephew of the mixed-race Creek chief, Alexander McGillivray, who was prominent in the Upper Creek towns. Through his mother's family, Weatherford was a cousin of William McIntosh, who became a chief of the Lower Creek towns. The Lower Creek, who comprised the majority of population, lived closer to the European Americans and had intermarried with them, adopting more of their ways, as well as connecting to the market economy. Career Weatherford learned traditional Creek ways and language from his mother and her clan, as well as English from his father. As a young man, he acquired a plantation in the Upper Creek territory, where he owned slaves, planted commercial crops, and bred and raced horses as did his father. He generally had good relations with both the Creek nationals and European Americans for years. He worried about the increasing number of the latter, who were encroaching on Creek land. The Creek of the Lower Towns were becoming more assimilated, but the traditional elders and the people of the Upper Creek towns were more isolated from the European-American settlers. They kept more traditional ways and opposed the new settlements. Weatherford and other Upper Creek leaders resented the encroachment of settlers into their traditional Creek territory, principally in what the United States of America called the Mississippi Territory, which included their territory in present-day Alabama. After the Americans improved the Trading Path as the National Road in 1811, more American settlers came into the hunting territory and laid claim to homesteads. Various bands of Creeks, especially among the Upper Creek, resisted in a number of armed conflicts. But most of the more assimilated Lower Creek towns were forced to make land concessions to the United States in 1790, 1802, and 1805. The Lower Creek were among the Five Civilized Tribes who adopted some European-American style farming practices and other customs. As a result, most of the Creek managed to continue as independent communities while slowly becoming almost indistinguishable from other frontier families. The Upper Creek towns resisted the changes in the territory. In these debates, Weatherford counseled neutrality in the rise of hostilities. Conflict broke out within the Creek Nation between those who were adapting to assimilation and those trying to maintain the traditional leadership. Leaders of the Upper Creek began diplomatic overtures with Spanish and British colonial officials to develop allies against the United States. In the debates in Creek councils, those advocating resistance (\\"war\\") rather than cooperation or assimilation became known as Red Sticks, and they soon became the dominant faction in Creek politics, which were highly decentralized. Red Stick bands went to Spanish Florida to purchase arms. Americans learned that the Red Sticks were bringing back arms from Florida. Hastily organizing a militia, American frontiersmen intercepted and attacked a Red Stick party at Burnt Corn Creek. The latter were returning to the Upper Creek towns with arms purchased in Pensacola in present-day Florida. While the Alabama militia tried to secure the arms and ammunition in the Indian baggage train, the Red Sticks regrouped and fought off the Americans. In reaction to the United States attack on its men, the Creek \\"declared war\\" on the United States. Already involved in the War of 1812 against the US, the British encouraged the Creek resistance. Weatherford joined the Red Sticks along the frontier, where they tried to repulse American settlers from Creek territory. In late August 1813, with Peter McQueen and other Red Sticks, Weatherford participated in a retaliatory attack on Fort Mims. It was a hastily built civilian stockade on the lower Alabama River, about 35 miles north of Mobile. Frontier American families and Lower Creek had retreated to the fort, which was ineptly guarded. The Red Sticks gained entry into the fort and massacred the Lower Creek, as well as European-American settlers, including women and children. Estimates are that they killed up to 500 persons. Some 35 individuals survived. As a prominent leader, Weatherford was held responsible for the massacre, although there are reports he tried to prevent it. Burial sites of Sehoy III and William Weatherford, with a historical marker in foreground An Alabama militia followed up with another Ranger unit and maneuvered the Red Sticks into battle at the Battle of Holy Ground. Weatherford barely escaped capture, jumping from a bluff into the Alabama River while on horseback. Having repelled the Red Stick invasion in a number of skirmishes and forced them on the defensive, the Americans regrouped for a final offensive. The federal government did not have forces to spare. Major General Andrew Jackson led a combined army of state militia from Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama. Jackson's army finally isolated the main Red Stick Army along with hundreds of American hostages. Weatherford may have played a decisive role in rallying his forces and trying to save the hostages from death. In the finale of the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, Weatherford‚Äôs rapid responses allowed various small bands of Red Sticks to regroup and fight a rear guard action, but the remainder of the Red Sticks were destroyed. Although the majority of the American hostages were saved, the retreating Red Sticks killed dozens of them. Meanwhile, Weatherford and some other 200 Red Sticks escaped. Most of the Red Sticks retreated to Florida, where they joined the Seminole people, who had developed from Creek migrants and remnants of other tribes in the 18th century. Weatherford surrendered at Fort Jackson (formerly Fort Toulouse). Jackson spared Weatherford's life and used his influence and knowledge of Creek language to bring the other Upper Creek chiefs to a peace conference. Weatherford negotiated a new peace through a new treaty with the US; although he had to accept a permanent reduction in Creek territory, he gained retention of most of their territory, including areas where they had homes. Weatherford subsequently moved to the southern part of Monroe County, Alabama, where he rebuilt his wealth as a planter. He died there in 1824. A decade later, the US forced removal of most of the Creek and other Indians from the Southeast to west of the Mississippi River in Indian Territory (now Kansas and Oklahoma). Marriage and family William Weatherford married Mary Moniac (c. 1783 ‚Äì 1804), who was also of mixed race. They had two children, Charles and Mary (Polly) Weatherford. After Mary's death, Weatherford married Sopethlina Kaney Thelotco Moniac (c. 1783 ‚Äì 1813). She died after the birth of their son, William Weatherford, Jr., born 25 December 1813. About 1817, Weatherford married Mary Stiggins (c. 1783-1832), who was of Natchez and English heritage. They also had children, Alexander McGillivray Weatherford, Mary Levitia Weatherford, Major Weatherford (who died as a child), and John Weatherford. Weatherford's nephew, David Moniac, son of his sister Elizabeth Weatherford, was the first Native American graduate of the United States Military Academy. William Weatherford may have been a blood relative of the Shawnee Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa whose mother and father were of Creek and Shawnee lineages. Their relationship may have been the foundation of the strong alliance between Chief Red Eagle and Chief Tecumseh during the Indian Wars.

Early life James Coyle was born in Drum, County Roscommon, Ireland to Owen Coyle and his wife Margaret Durney. He attended Mungret College in Limerick and the Pontifical North American College in Rome, and was ordained a priest at age 23 on May 30, 1896. Later that year, he sailed with another priest, Father Michael Henry, to Mobile, Alabama, in the United States, and served under Bishop Edward Patrick Allen. He became an instructor, and later rector, of the McGill Institute for Boys. In 1904 Bishop Allen appointed Coyle to succeed Patrick O'Reilly as pastor of the Cathedral of Saint Paul in Birmingham, where he was well received and loved by the congregation. Father Coyle was the Knights of Columbus chaplain of Birmingham, Alabama Council 635. Murder On August 11, 1921, Father Coyle was shot in the head on the porch of St. Paul's Rectory by E. R. Stephenson, a Southern Methodist Episcopal minister and a member of the Ku Klux Klan. There were many witnesses.Sharon Davies, \\"Tragedy in Birmingham\\", Columbia Magazine, vol. 90, no. 3 (March 2010), p. 31. The murder occurred just hours after Coyle had performed a secret wedding between Stephenson's daughter, Ruth, and Pedro Gussman, a Puerto Rican she had met while he was working on Stephenson's house five years earlier. Gussman had also been a customer of Stephenson's barber shop. Several months before the wedding, Ruth had converted to Roman Catholicism. Father Coyle was buried in Birmingham's Elmwood Cemetery. Trial and aftermath Stephenson was charged with Father Coyle's murder. The Ku Klux Klan paid for the defense; of the five lawyers, four were Klan members. The case was assigned to the Alabama courtroom of Judge William E. Fort, a Klansman. Hugo Black, a future Justice of the Supreme Court and future Klansman, defended Stephenson. The defense team took the unusual step of entering a dual plea of \\"not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity\\", essentially arguing both that the shooting was in self-defense, and that at the time of the shooting Stephenson had been suffering from \\"temporary insanity\\". Stephenson was acquitted by one vote of the jury. One of Stephenson's attorneys responded to the prosecution's assertion that Gussman was of \\"proud Castilian descent\\" by saying \\"he has descended a long way\\". The outcome of the murder trial for Father Coyle's assassin had a chilling impact on Catholics, who found themselves the target of Klan violence for many years to come. Nevertheless, by 1941 a Catholic writer in Birmingham would write that \\"the death of Father Coyle was the climax of the anti-Catholic feeling in Alabama. After the trial there followed such revulsion of feeling among the right-minded who before had been bogged down in blindness and indifference that slowly and almost unnoticeably the Ku Klux Klan and their ilk began to lose favor among the people\\". On February 22, 2012, Bishop William H. Willimon of the North Alabama Conference of the United Methodist Church presided over a service of reconciliation and forgiveness at Highlands United Methodist Church in Birmingham.

Stephanus of Byzantium and Claudius Ptolemy write that Rhapta was a metropolis of Barbaria ().PTOLEMAEUS, GEOGRAPHY, ¬ß 4.7.12 Location G.W.B. Huntingford lists five proposed locations for Rhapta: *Tanga, at the mouth of the Mkulumuzi and Sigi Rivers *Pangani, at the mouth of the Ruvu river *Msasani, three miles north of Dar es Salaam--or Dar es Salaam itself *Kisuyu *Somewhere in the Rufiji River delta, opposite Mafia Island. Huntingford dismisses the first two as being too close to Zanzibar and Pemba islands (which he identifies with Menouthis, and follows the author of the Periplus in locating Menouthis north of Rhapta). He observes that there is no river at Msasani, and thus concludes Kisuyu or the Rufiji delta are the most likely candidates. However, J. Innes Miller points out that Roman coins have been found on Pemba; that the Ruvu emerges near the Kilimanjaro and Meru mountains--which confirm the account of Diogenes; and that an old inscription in Semitic characters has been found near the Pangani estuary, which make Pemba a likely candidate for Rhapta. However, the first evidence of inhabitation starts solely in the seventh century at a site called Tumbe on the northern end of the island, limpidly contradicting these assertions. Furthermore, John Perkins states this: \\"Some Roman, Byzantine, and Sasanian coins are reported from the East African coast; however, none of these come from excavations, and the surrounding evidence suggests that they probably did not reach the Swahili Coast in antiquity. Evidence for contacts and trade between this part of Africa and the Roman and Persian worlds is mainly recorded in the limited written records.\\"Perkins, John, \\"The Indian Ocean and Swahili coins, international networks and local developments\\" in Afriques, 2015 In recent years, professor Felix Chami has found archaeological evidence for extensive Roman trade on Mafia Island and, not far away, on the mainland, near the mouth of the Rufiji River, which he dated to the first few centuries CE. Goods Cinnamon sticks. Which goods were traded at Rhapta is disputed. The Periplus only states that it was a source of ivory and tortoise shell. J. Innes Miller argues that Rhapta formed an important link in the trade route between what is now modern Indonesia and consumers in the Mediterranean region. Miller notes that ancient authorities (e.g. Herodotus 3.111) state that cinnamon and cassia bark were harvested in Africa, yet these species until recently were found only in Southeast Asia, which would hint at some conflation. Miller points to the well-documented cultural links between Indonesia and East Africa (e.g., the Malagasy language is related to Malay, both people use double outrigger canoes). He then posits that the use of monsoons began far earlier than previously thought, allowing traders to bring their spices westward perhaps as early as the 2nd millennium BC. It is possible that both the account of the Periplus and at least part of Miller's theory are correct, for the Periplus focuses on the availability of tortoise shell, and its silence about other goods should not be taken as evidence that other goods were not traded.

Early life and career Williams was educated at the Salisbury Government School and the Community High School. He completed his A-Levels at the Sixth Form College. Williams then served as a teacher at various schools on the island and participated in sports as a coach and player. He was an active member of the Credit Union movement not only in Salisbury but on the Island as well as the Caribbean. He served both on the Supervisory Committee and the board of the Salisbury Co-operative Credit Union as Well as Treasurer of the Dominica Credit Union League Movement and twice was one of Dominicas Delegates at the Caribbean Conference of Credit Unions. Political career Williams was a member of the Young Freedom Movement, the youth arm of the Dominica Freedom Party which was important to the party's success. He was very active in his community, and he was rewarded for this when in the 1990 General Elections he was elected to Parliament for the Salisbury Constituency. By this time he was no longer associated with the Freedom Party and was now a member of the UWP. The youngest ever parliamentarian on the island, he learned quickly and was a very vocal member of the opposition. In 1995 the UWP formed the government and Williams widened his margin of victory in the Salisbury (Barroui) Constituency, transforming it into a UWP stronghold. He was appointed Minister of Communications and Works and Housing. As a minister he was very instrumental in the liberalization of the telecoms market within the OECS states, by issuing a licence to telecoms provider Marpin Telecoms thereby opening up the sector for competition on the island. This decision had positive implications for the entire OECS since at that time there were plans on reforming the sector. In the January 31, 2000, General Elections Williams comfortably retained his seat. However, the UWP did not retain enough seats in the Parliament and they again returned to the opposition. Williams then decided that he would attend the University of the West Indies to study Law. This provoked some criticism from government supporters, but generally his constituents were not angered by his decision. In the May 5, 2005 Elections Williams again retained his seat by a wide margin, though his opponent did better than expected. The UWP put up a tough election campaign but they lost one seat in the parliament and remained in opposition. This second loss by the party evinced the need for a change of political leadership. Williams had become a very important member of the party, and he along with Julius Timothy were the main contenders for the leadership. In October 2005, he was called to the bar and this enhanced his chances of becoming the party leader. In December 2005, Edison James stood down as political leader and Williams replaced him. His election alienated Julius Timothy, who as deputy leader under James thought he would have easily secured the leadership. This resulted in Timothy crossing the floor and joining the DLP government in September 2006. In July 2007 Edison James resigned as leader of the opposition and Williams assumed that office. In July 2008 Williams, in his capacity as an attorney, became embroiled in a controversy concerning a land deal. Resignation On July 30, 2008, in light of the controversy and in the interest of the party, Williams announced his resignation as Leader of the Opposition and as party leader of the United Workers' Party. However, he stated that after consultation with his constituents, he was \\"duty bound to honour the wishes of the people of Salisbury constituency\\" and continue as their Member of Parliament.\\"Dominica's opposition leader quits amid controversy\\", caribbean360.com, July 31, 2008.

It was released for Amiga, Atari ST, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, and MS-DOS. The game was programmed by David H. Lawson and its graphics were made by Garvan Corbett and Jim Ray Bowers. The soundtrack was composed by David Whittaker and the cover art is by the artist Roger Dean. Summary The control method is identical to that of Barbarian which was published the previous year. The game begins when the main character Drak is teleported into the alien spaceship that is approaching the earth. The objective of the game is to destroy the spaceship by finding certain objects from the ship. When the self-destruction is active, Drak has to find an escape shuttle before the spaceship blows up in order to survive. Reception Obliterator was reviewed in Computer Gaming World as a fun, well-executed action game, albeit not a challenging one. The game was praised for using score not just as an arbitrary value, but also to determine the time left for the hero to escape. C-lehti (3/1988) gave five stars for Amiga version and also full ten points for its music, graphics, interest-factor and \\"atmosphere\\". The review says that the game shows that the Amiga computer is capable of delivering what users have been awaiting, using computer's capabilities in a way that makes gaming experience a visual enjoyment. The review notes that the game is relatively easy to finish but still leaves a feeling that the game was worthy of its price. A possibility to save a game state on a disk is seen as an improvement to the previous game, Barbarian, from the authors.

Background Brigadier General George Crook commanded the Union Army of West Virginia, made up of three brigades from the Division of the Kanawha. When Ulysses S. Grant launched his spring offensive of 1864, two Union armies marched towards Richmond and a third moved into the Shenandoah Valley. Crook's troops were also involved in the offensive and began to march through the Appalachian Mountains into southwest Virginia. His objective was to destroy the Virginia & Tennessee Railroad, working in conjunction with William W. Averell's offensive, which had similar objectives. Brig. Gen. Albert G. Jenkins was in command of the few scattered Confederate units protecting the rail lines. He had assumed command only the day before Crook's army began to approach the railroad. Nevertheless, Jenkins was an experienced soldier. During the 1863 Gettysburg Campaign, Jenkins' Brigade had formed the cavalry screen for Richard S. Ewell's Second Corps. Jenkins led his men through the Cumberland Valley into Pennsylvania and seized Chambersburg, burning down nearby railroad structures and bridges. He accompanied Ewell's column to Carlisle, briefly skirmishing with Union militia at the Battle of Sporting Hill near Harrisburg. During the Battle of Gettysburg, Jenkins was wounded on July 2 and missed the final day's fighting. He did not recover to rejoin his command until autumn. Jenkins spent the early part of 1864 raising and organizing a large cavalry force for service in western Virginia. By May, he had been appointed Commander of the Department of Western Virginia with his headquarters at Dublin. Battle Back Creek Farm Jenkins, having decided to make a stand at Cloyd's Mountain, set up a strong defensive position. When Crook arrived, he decided against a frontal assault, concluding that the Confederate works were too strong and such an attack would decimate his army. The surrounding area was heavily forested and Crook used this as cover to swing his brigades around to the Confederate right flank. Crook began the battle with an artillery barrage, then sent in his brigade of green West Virginians under Colonel Carr B. White. Crook's remaining two brigades under Colonel Horatio G. Sickel and future president Colonel Rutherford B. Hayes were to launch a frontal assault as soon as the West Virginians had gotten under way. Serving as a major under Hayes was another future U.S. President, William McKinley. White's brigade, in its first fight, advanced to within 20 yards before heavy casualties from its exposed position forced it back. Crook, moving with Hayes' Ohio brigade, had to dismount and walk the slopes on foot because they were so steep. Still wearing his jack boots, he sank in a small stream the troops were crossing and his boots filled with water. Nearby soldiers rushed back and pulled him out. Hayes' brigade spearheaded the main assault around 11 a.m. The troops fought their way to the Confederate works and severe hand-to-hand fighting ensued. Sparks from the musket fire ignited the thick blanket of leaves on the ground, and many men from Sickel's and Hayes' brigades were pinned down and burned alive. The brigades had begun to fall back, when Crook sent two fresh regiments into Hayes' front. The West Virginians finally advanced against the artillery and overran its crew. The Ohio troops now began to overwhelm the Confederate center. Jenkins tried desperately to shift troops to the threatened areas, but he fell severely wounded and was captured. His second-in-command, John McCausland, took command and conducted a rear-guard action as he withdrew his troops. The Battle of Cloyd's Mountain was fought on the Back Creek Farm. The farmhouse served as a hospital and as headquarters for the Union General George Crook. Results The battle of Cloyd's Mountain was short and involved few troops, but it contained some of the most severe and savage fighting of the war. The engagement lasted a little over an hour, with much of that being hand-to-hand combat. Casualties were high for the modest number of troops involved. Crook lost 688 men, roughly 10% of his force. The Confederates lost fewer men--538-- but that totaled 23% of their total force. The battle is considered a Union victory because Crook was able to continue on and destroy the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad at Dublin, Virginia, and Averell was also able to destroy several railroad bridges along the same line, severing one of the Confederacy's last vital lifelines and its only rail connection to East Tennessee. The day after the battle, the remaining Confederate troops unsuccessfully defended a railroad bridge over the nearby New River. In the melee, a soldier who refused to take cover until Col. Hayes did so was mortally wounded. While undergoing first aid, the soldier was found to be a woman. Order of battle=Union General George Crook Kanawha Division -- Brig. Gen.

It was the final battle of the Satsuma Rebellion, where the heavily outnumbered samurai under Saig≈ç Takamori made their last stand against Imperial Japanese Army troops under the command of Generals Yamagata Aritomo and Kawamura Sumiyoshi. The battle culminated in the annihilation of Saig≈ç's army as well as his death, marking the end of the Satsuma Rebellion. The Imperial Army's victory consolidated their power, and they would not see another instance of internal mutiny. Battle Following defeat at the Siege of Kumamoto Castle and in other battles in central Ky≈´sh≈´, the surviving remnants of the samurai forces loyal to Saig≈ç Takamori fled back to Satsuma, seizing the hill of Shiroyama overlooking Kagoshima on 1 September 1877. Imperial army troops under the command of General Yamagata Aritomo and marines under the command of Admiral Kawamura Sumiyoshi began arriving soon after, and the rebels were promptly surrounded. In the mere six weeks since Saig≈ç's failed Siege of Kumamoto Castle, a combination of defections and combat losses had shrunk the size of his army from 20,000 to 500, compared to the Imperial Army's 30,000. Yamagata, although greatly outnumbering Saig≈ç, bided his time constructing a series of fortifications to encircle Saig≈ç and preempt any chance of a breakout, additionally requisitioning five warships to bombard the rebels and reduce their defenses. He was planning an attack from all sides, and in an effort to prevent another escape, ordered that any position engaged by the enemy was to be fired upon, regardless of friendly casualties. Saig≈ç defended his position with limited support from Snider-Enfield breechloaders and artillery, but had a critical lack of ammunition for both. He had to resort to melting down metal statues to produce bullets and tending to injuries with a carpenter's saw. Imperial Japanese Army fortifications encircling Shiroyama, September 1877. After firing a final barrage of artillery lasting the night, Yamagata's men attacked Saig≈ç's position. At 4AM, the battle began. The samurai, under heavy fire, charged the lines of the Imperial Army, which had not been trained for close-quarter sword fighting. In just a few minutes, the once organized line turned into disarray. Highly skilled samurai swordsmanship prevailed against an army with very little traditional training. For a short time, Saig≈ç's lines held, but were forced back due to weight of numbers. Saig≈ç was mortally wounded in the femoral artery and stomach, and was carried by Beppu Shinsuke downhill to find a place to commit seppuku. Serving as kaishakunin, Beppu cut off Saig≈ç's head and hid it to prevent it from being found by the enemy. After Saig≈ç's death, Beppu, now in command, charged downhill and was himself shot to death - without any ammunition, the rest of the samurai drew their swords, charged downhill, and were subsequently killed.Samurai: The World of the Warrior With these deaths, the Satsuma rebellion came to an end. Saig≈ç, with the last remnants of the Satsuma army, leads a desperate suicide charge. Aftermath Financially, crushing the Satsuma Rebellion cost the government greatly, forcing Japan off the gold standard and causing the government to print paper currency. The rebellion also effectively ended the samurai class, as the new Imperial Japanese Army built on conscripts who were all 'heimin' (commoners) had proven itself in battle. More critically, the defeat of the samurai displayed the power of modern artillery and rifles, against which a banzai charge had no appreciable effect. On 22 February 1889, Emperor Meiji pardoned Saig≈ç posthumously. Statues in Ueno Park, Tokyo and near the ruins of Kagoshima Castle stand in his memory. Saig≈ç Takamori was labelled as a tragic hero by the people, and his actions were considered an honorable example of bushido and Yamato- damashii.

(His doctoral dissertation, Literature and the Press, was published in 1960.) After receiving his Ph.D., he taught at New York's City College. While in New York, Dudek continued to contribute poems to First Statement and its successor, Northern Review. In 1944 some of his poems appeared in the anthology Unit of Five, alongside poetry by Ronald Hambleton, P. K. Page, Raymond Souster, and James Wreford. His own first book of poetry, East of the City, was issued by Toronto's Ryerson Press in 1946. Dudek began corresponding with modernist poet Ezra Pound in 1949, and met Pound in person the next year. Pound encouraged him to adopt a more cosmopolitan approach to his writing. 1950s By the early 1950s the Dudeks' marriage was breaking up. Louis Dudek returned to Montreal and joined the Department of English at McGill University in 1951. He would remain at McGill for the rest of his life. He became Greenshield professor of English in 1969, and Professor Emeritus in 1984.Heather Prycz, \\"Montreal in the 40s and 50s ,\\" A Digital History of Canadian Poetry, YoungPoets.ca, Web, May 6, 2011. His colleague Brian Trehearne remembered him as a \\"gifted and natural lecturer\\" who taught \\"one of the most popular and challenging courses in the history of the Faculty of Arts.\\" In 1952 Dudek founded Contact Press with Raymond Souster and Irving Layton; its first book was Cerberus, an anthology by the three of them.

Dudek also worked on the little magazine CIV/n (\\"Civilation\\"), founded in 1953 and edited by Aileen Collins. Dudek published his first long poem, Europe, in 1954. In 1956 Dudek began the McGill Poetry Series, a series of chapbooks by McGill students published by Contact Press. The first book in the Series, printed in 1956, was Let Us Compare Mythologies, the first book from Leonard Cohen. In 1957 the Series published The Carnal and the Crane, the first book by Daryl Hine.\\"Steve Smith\\" (discussion), LeonardCohenForum.com, Web, May 6, 2011. In 1957 Dudek began Delta, his own poetry magazine, \\"in which he featured the work of many promising new poets\\" until 1966. He bought a press, installed it in his basement, and learned how to run it to print the early issues of the magazine, as well as his 1958 book Laughing Stalks. In his own writing he continued to explore the possibilities of long poems, writing Transparent Sea in 1956 and En Mexico in 1958. Throughout the 1950s Dudek remained \\"a passionate admirer and defender\\" of Ezra Pound, \\"and his efforts contributed to the older poet's release in 1958 from St. Elizabeth's mental hospital (where Pound had been confined since 1946).\\"Bruce Whiteman, \\"Appreciation of Louis Dudek: The People's Intellectual,\\" Literary Montreal, VehiculePress.com, Web, May 6, 2001. Later life At odds with literary trends in the early 1960s, Dudek concentrated on his teaching and on the writing of his long poem, Atlantis (published in 1967). In 1966 he founded Delta Canada Books along with Michael Gnarowski and Glen Siebrasse. The firm published more than 30 titles between 1966 and 1971, including Dudek's Collected Poems (1971). Dudek married Aileen Collins in 1970. The next year the two of them began DC Books, which they would run until 1986, and which is still in business.\\"About DC Books,\\" DC Books, Web, May 6, 2011. He wrote a column on books, film, and the arts for the Montreal Gazette between 1965 and 1969. \\"This activity together with his reviews, articles and radio talks has remained fundamental to Dudek's perception of the poet's and the critic's role in society.\\" His collected columns were published in 1988 as In Defence of Art. As well, he regularly contributed to Canadian academic journals \\"and, in keeping with his commitment to literature as part of daily life, made frequent appearances on CBC Radio and in various newspapers as a commentator on the arts and culture.\\" The First Person in Literature was originally broadcast as a series of CBC Radio lectures. Dudek \\"kept up a lifelong battle against some of the most famous and influential voices in Canadian cultural writing, including Northrop Frye and Marshall McLuhan.\\" Perhaps for that reason, some major awards passed him by. Dudek always preferred to publish in the small press. \\"He was incredibly supportive of small publishers and writers,\\" Simon Dardick, publisher of V√©hicule Press, said of him. \\"There are dozens and dozens of writers and publishers who owe him so much. There was such a generosity of spirit there.\\"Alan Hustak, \\"Poet-teacher Louis Dudek, 83, dies,\\" Montreal Gazette, Mar. 23, 2001. In return the small press contained some of his strongest supporters (including V√©hicule Press), who continued to release new books by him through his lifetime. Dudek's poetry \\"was a beacon to three generations of Canadian poets, and among them are names like Daryl Hine and Doug Jones in the '50s, George Bowering and Frank Davey in the '60s, and Ken Norris, Endre Farkas and Peter Van Toorn in the '70s and '80s.\\" Writing Dudek began as a realist lyric poet influenced by the Imagists. Unit of Five (1944) shows a style that employs few adverbs and adjectives, as well as direct descriptions. The social impulse is also strong in East of the City (1946), which uses the city as the setting for most of its poems. Social realism is absent form Dudek¬¥s two next books of poetry, Twenty Four Poems (1952) and The Searching Image (1952). The first shows a strong influence of Imagism and its accumulative method; the second, however, shifts drastically towards stylism and artifice with dense and obscure metaphors and elaborate syntax.

He is well known for his friendship and mentorship of FBI undercover agent Joseph \\"Donnie Brasco\\" Pistone. When Pistone's operation was ended on July 26, 1981, the FBI intercepted and arrested Ruggiero on August 29, 1981. In November 1982, Ruggiero was sentenced to 15 years in prison for racketeering conspiracy; he was released in April 1993 before his death from cancer. Life=Early life Born in Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, Ruggiero grew up in the Knickerbocker Village private housing development in Little Italy, Manhattan. Ruggiero joined the Bonanno family organization as a young man, serving as a street soldier under caporegime Michael Sabella. Ruggiero soon became successful in bookmaking, extortion and loansharking rackets. He lived in an apartment on Monroe Street in Manhattan in the same building as his 'friend' and Bonanno soldier Anthony Mirra. Ruggiero reportedly owned a cigarette boat that he kept docked on the East River in New York. Ruggiero became good friends with future family boss Philip \\"Rusty\\" Rastelli and Mirra. Ruggiero became the part-owner of a fishery in the Fulton Fish Market in Manhattan. As a part-owner, Ruggiero was able to put himself on the company payroll with a $5,000-a-month \\"no-show\\" job. During the 1970s, he purchased a social club in Little Italy. Ruggiero had an estranged brother who changed his surname to \\"Reggero\\" to avoid association with the rest of the family. Ruggiero had three daughters and one son, Thomas Sbano, with his first wife. In the late 1950s, Ruggiero left his first wife, eventually moving in with his second wife, Louise. In September 1977, Ruggiero married Louise in a small ceremony at New York City Hall. Ruggiero's son, Thomas, struggled with a heroin dependency until he checked into a drug rehabilitation center in 1979. Ruggiero's younger daughter worked at a New York hospital and managed a booth at the Feast of San Gennaro in Little Italy. Two of Ruggiero's daughters reportedly married mobsters. The Bonanno family allegedly discovered that Ruggiero's son-in-law, Marco, was cheating the family and is alleged to have told Ruggiero to eliminate him. Marco disappeared and his body was never recovered. Operation Donnie Brasco Around the time Ruggiero became a member of the Bonanno family, he met Mafia associate \\"Donnie Brasco\\" (undercover FBI agent Joseph Pistone). Anthony Mirra introduced Brasco, posing as an expert jewel thief, to Ruggiero. Pistone's original mission had been to infiltrate truck hijacking and fencing rings. However, the friendships Pistone developed with Mirra and Ruggiero gave the FBI the chance to infiltrate the Mafia. Brasco started working for Ruggiero, placing bets and helping him make collections for the bookmaking operation in Ruggiero's social club. Ruggiero mentored Brasco and eventually promised to sponsor him for membership in the family. Ruggiero developed a close friendship with Brasco, which caused friction with his old friend Mirra, who had originally introduced Brasco to Ruggiero. Brasco served as best man at Ruggiero's 1977 wedding and frequently advised Ruggiero on handling his son Tommy's heroin addiction. Ruggiero once nearly discovered Brasco's true identity. Ruggiero and Brasco were in a Miami Beach, Florida restaurant as Ruggiero read a Time magazine containing an article about the infamous Abscam scandal and detailing how FBI agents posed as rich Arab businessmen to catch U.S. Congressmen taking bribes. What caught Ruggiero's eye was a picture of a white yacht that the FBI used to entertain the congressmen. Ruggiero recognized the boat as it was named the Left Hand, as the same boat Brasco provided several months before for a party. Brasco was able to convince Ruggiero that he did not know the boat's owner was related to the FBI. During an earlier criminal enterprise, Ruggiero met Frank Balistrieri, the Mafia boss of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Ruggiero admitted to Pistone that he felt threatened while in the presence of Balistrieri. In 1979, Ruggiero converted his social club into a candy store and gave it to one of his daughters to manage. At the same time, Ruggiero and Brasco started a bookmaking operation out of the store. However, Ruggiero was soon dropped from the partnership because he was unable to provide the initial required investment of $25,000. The three capos murder In 1979, Bonanno boss Carmine Galante was murdered, creating a power vacuum in the family. After Galante's murder, Philip Rastelli took over, running the organization from prison. However, one faction, led by Alphonse \\"Sonny Red\\" Indelicato, rebelled at Rastelli's leadership. At this time, Ruggiero joined the crew of Dominick \\"Sonny Black\\" Napolitano, a strong Rastelli supporter. On May 5, 1981, Indelicato and two other rebel capos, Philip Giaccone and Dominick Trinchera, were lured to a meeting and murdered. After the deaths of the three capos, the rebellion against Rastelli was squashed. According to Pistone, the murderers were Napolitano, John Cersani, Joe Massino, Sal Vitale, Joseph DeSimone, Gerlando Sciascia, Nicholas Santora, Vito Rizzuto, Louis Giongetti, and Santo Giordano. Ruggiero and Cersani were lookouts and were sent in after to clean up the massacre and dispose of the bodies, along with Napolitano, James Episcopia and Robert Capazzio. Reputation Ruggiero relished life as a mobster. In front of Pistone, he once explained: \\"As a wiseguy you can lie, you can cheat, you can steal, you can kill people ‚Äì legitimately. You can do any goddamn thing you want and nobody can say anything about it. Who wouldn't want to be a wiseguy?\\" Ruggiero was the epitome of a wiseguy and had the respect of other mobsters. He had a reputation as a killer but on a daily basis was not prone to violence. Ruggiero had never served time in prison; he had been arrested many times, but never jailed. Ruggiero earned his nickname \\"Lefty\\" from tossing dice left-handed while playing craps. He got the nickname \\"Two Guns\\" because when he went out on a hit, he liked to use two guns. By the 1970s, Ruggiero had acquired a gambling dependency. He was betting and losing heavily on horse races. Soon he was borrowing money from Nicholas Marangello to cover losing bets. By 1977, Ruggiero owed Marangello $160,000. The Bonanno family told Ruggiero that he would have to repay Marangello before he could become a made man. By 1977, Ruggiero had paid most of his debt to Marangello and the family accepted his membership. However, by 1978, Ruggiero was back in debt again to Marangello. To settle the debt this time, the family arranged to transfer the revenues from part of Ruggiero's criminal operations directly to Marangello. Due to his gambling problem, Ruggiero was always trying to hide his few assets from his creditors Marangello and Sabella. Aftermath and death On July 26, 1981, the Donnie Brasco operation came to an end. FBI agents visited Napolitano's apartment on top of the Motion Lounge and informed him of Brasco's true identity. After the Bonanno leadership learned the truth, they immediately went after the men who brought Brasco into their midst. Mirra and Napolitano were murdered shortly afterwards.Raab, pp. 617‚Äì620 On August 29, 1981, the FBI intercepted and arrested Ruggiero. In November 1982, Ruggiero, along with Santora, Antonio Tomasulo, and Anthony \\"Fat Tony\\" Rabito, was convicted in a six-week jury trial for racketeering conspiracy, and received a 15-year prison sentence. Ruggiero refused to believe that Donnie Brasco was a special agent in the FBI and not his associate. Ruggiero told his lawyer \\"He'll never go against us.\\" However, after Pistone testified against him, he later said, \\"I'll get that motherfucker Donnie if it's the last thing I do.\\" In April 1993, suffering from lung and testicular cancer, Ruggiero was released from prison after serving almost 11 years. He died on November 24, 1994. In the 1997 film Donnie Brasco, Benjamin Ruggiero was portrayed by Al Pacino. Ruggiero's granddaughter Ramona Rizzo appears on the TV show Mob Wives on VH-1.

The junction borders the Meenachil river, which is one of the medium range rivers, but well known through Arundhati Roy's famous book The God of Small Things. Most of the events in the book took place in Chungam. Aymanam village, which is mentioned in the book, is about three kilometers away from Chungam. The oldest college and school in Kerala and India are here. The road that passes through Chungam is an alternate route to reach Kottayam Medical College.  Etymology  Chungam is the Malayalam equivalent of tax. So all the locations where the tax was collected came to be known as Chungam; indeed Kerala has a number of places with the same name.  Education  The CMS College and the CMS College Higher Secondary School; both around 200 years of age were built by the Rev. Benjamin Baily of the Church Missionary Society, London. They were built with the generous help and assistance of Col. Munroe, the then Resident of the East India Company, and HH Rani Gauri Laxmi Bhai, the reagent queen of the erstwhile Travencore state. CMS College is the ancient seat of learning in India. It once had the largest hall in Asia. The Great Hall, as it's called, is truly a work of art. The same place has one of Kerala's ancient Seminaries and one of the first Malayalam press too. The Orthodox Theological Seminary is the seat of the reformation that has changed the Kerala Syrian Christian Beliefs. The CMS press, one of the first of its kind in Kerala, was started by the Rev. Benjamin Bailey. He was not happy with the existing models and he made a new one with the help of a blacksmith and a carpenter and with an Encyclopaedia! The Press is also the first in South India. It still houses Bailie's ancient press, printing devices, and other published works. He is the one who has standardized the official Malayalam script and accent; thus making Malayalam more than a mere dialectical variant of Tamil. The CMS College Higher Secondary School is now housed in his ancient house. Bailey had made the Holy Trinity Cathedral; which is one of the biggest churches of the CSI church.

It was founded in 1959 by Lieutenant-Commander Hugh Oswell. Until the late 1950s, the British Siebe Gorman company patents kept aqualungs expensive in Britain, and many British sport divers had to use home-made breathing sets and ex-armed forces or ex- industry rebreathers. Some became expert at home-making scuba diving demand regulators from industrial parts such as Calor Gas regulators. In 1959 Hugh Oswell designed around the Cousteau-Gagnan patent and made sport diving breathing sets accessibly inexpensive. Submarine Products Ltd were the first company to make scuba sets readily available to the public in the United Kingdom. They developed a unique diver delivery vehicle (the Subskimmer), and were important for introducing high quality plastics (e.g. ABS) into the manufacture of underwater breathing apparatus. For many years they supplied their Black Prince regulators and other open circuit equipment to the Royal Navy. When the British Navy decided to purchase foreign competitors' closed circuit equipment, imports became increasingly difficult. After financial difficulties, Submarine Products Ltd ceased in 1990. History=1950s According to the Classic Dive Books website,Submarine Products Limited. Retrieved on 12 May 2019. \\"In the mid-1950s Lt Cdr Hugh Oswell was a serving officer in the Royal Navy at Portsmouth and in his spare time, he was working on improvements and modifications to existing underwater breathing equipment ‚Äì even developing his own designs. He was assisted in producing his prototypes by Harry Biscoe who was also based at Portsmouth but had access to engineering facilities. Some time later, Oswell was posted to Tyneside as liaison officer at Swan Hunter shipyards. In 1957, the Royal Navy introduced staff reductions and Oswell took a redundancy package and that finances his new business venture Submarine Products based at Acomb near Hexham in Northumberland in the UK. Harry Biscoe was offered a job which he kept for the life of the company\\". 1955\\\\.

The manufacturers claim that in price, the 'Sealion' compares favourably with similar equipment produced elsewhere. This, combined with its improved design, should make it popular with overseas buyers. A model shown at the recent Canadian International Trade Fair attracted considerable attention.

Adebisi serves as one of the main characters in the first four seasons. After the first half of season four, his character was killed off the show so Akinnuoye-Agbaje could film the movie The Mummy Returns. Adebisi is one of the most feared and powerful inmates in Oz. A notorious drug dealer, killer, and rapist, Adebisi is feared by inmates and guards alike until his death in the midseason finale of season 4. Character overview Prisoner #93A234. Convicted May 2, 1993 - Murder in the first degree. Sentence: Life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Simon Adebisi is serving a life sentence without parole for beheading an undercover cop with a machete. An extremely muscular man, he can physically intimidate many of his fellow inmates. As one of the leaders of the Homeboys (the black gang in Oz), Adebisi is considered one of the prison's most dangerous inmates, and becomes one of the most recognizable characters on the show. He is well known for his trademark tilted hat, which Akinnuoye-Agbaje suggested was inspired by the \\"Area Boys\\" of Lagos, Nigeria. Adebisi is Nigerian - specifically Yoruba - and speaks with a strong accent, but had been in America for about 15 years prior to his incarceration. Adebisi is shown to be short- tempered, hedonistic as well as capable of engineering and executing long-term plans through intellect and manipulation. History=Season 1 Adebisi began as a minor character; a lieutenant of Jefferson Keane. Following Keane's execution in Episode 4, Paul Markstrom takes over the Homeboys until Adebisi and Kenny Wangler kill him when it is discovered he is an undercover cop. Adebisi then takes over and partners in the drug trade with the Italians. Italian Mafia boss Nino Schibetta saw him as the best drug player among the black inmates and respected his leadership skills. Unbeknownst to Schibetta, Adebisi and Ryan O'Reily intend to take over the drug trade and began putting crushed glass into Schibetta's food to slowly kill him. Adebisi also intimidates his new cellmate Tobias Beecher with fear of a future rape. Beecher accepts an offer of help from seemingly helpful Vernon Schillinger and moves out of Adebisi's cell and into Schillinger's cell. Adebisi intimidates Beecher as he leaves but backs off when Schillinger comes to Beecher's defense. Adebisi laughs realizing that Beecher is unaware that Schillinger is the leader of the Aryans and plans on making Beecher his sex slave. In the Season 1 finale, Adebisi, along with O'Reily, Kareem Said, Miguel Alvarez and Scott Ross, is a leader of a riot in their prison unit (known as \\"Emerald City\\"). He is taken prisoner by the other inmates, however, when he is incapacitated due to heroin withdrawal. In that episode, it is revealed that Adebisi's crime was exploited to have swept the previous governor out of office and gave Governor James Devlin his opening to reinstate the death penalty. Season 2 Adebisi continues to suffer severe heroin withdrawal in solitary during the post-riot lockdown. However, he is able to maintain control of the Homeboys when Emerald City reopens. Nino Schibetta's son Peter comes to Oz and learns that Adebisi is responsible for the death of his father, and is himself poisoned by Adebisi. Schibetta swears revenge and tries to kill Adebisi with help from Chucky Pancamo. In the prison kitchen Adebisi beats up Peter and Pancamo. After knocking out Pancamo, Adebisi brutally rapes a semi-conscious Schibetta. As a result, Schibetta is traumatized and humiliated, telling the authorities he doesn't remember what happened to him. In denial about being raped, Schibetta psychologically and emotionally deteriorates. Subsequently, he is transferred to the Oz prison psych ward. However, two distractions hold Adebisi's attention: first, his crush on death row inmate Shirley Bellinger, who flirts with him through notes before rejecting him upon discovering that he is black. Secondly, his heroin addiction is out of control. The Italian Mob, seeking revenge for Schibetta's rape, takes advantage of this when new inmate and Mafia boss Antonio Nappa gets Adebisi put into drug rehab through his staff connections. Adebisi is deposed as the head of the Homeboys and cut out of the drug trade through the help of Nappa's former friends. Another Nigerian Yoruba prisoner, an elderly man named Kipekemie Jara, comes to Oz, and begins to rehabilitate Adebisi, but at the same time the stress of the change brings on schizophrenic visions and severe psychosis. The Italians and the blacks consider Jara a threat, so they kill him. The shock and trauma of the event triggers a nervous breakdown in Adebisi and he is moved to the psych ward, placed in a cell right next to Peter Schibetta. Season 3 Adebisi comes out of the psych ward pretending to be a changed man. To prove he is sane, he defends Peter Schibetta from an attacker in the psych ward. This convinces Antonio Nappa that a potential change in heart from Adebisi could prove useful for the Italian mobsters. This is all a ploy, however, as Adebisi takes a job in the AIDS ward as a means of obtaining blood from AIDS patient Robbie Gerth to prick Nappa undetected with an HIV-infected needle. When Dr. Nathan confirms that Nappa is HIV-positive, he is sent to the AIDS ward, and Pancamo assumes leadership of the Italians. From here Adebisi gets ready to take control of the Homeboys once again. Meanwhile, Kenny Wangler is leading the Homeboys, who no longer trust Adebisi. Adebisi approaches Pancamo about becoming partners in the drug trade. Pancamo initially refuses because he is still angered about the beating Adebisi gave him and Schibetta. However, when Adebisi points out that he could be a strong ally, Pancamo agrees to work with him as long as he gets rid of Wangler. Adebisi then shows his sincerity with a plot to depose current black gang member Wangler by burning the skin of Wangler's allies, Poet and Junior Pierce, while Wangler is away at a funeral. When Wangler arrives back in Oz, he is locked in as Adebisi's cellmate. Adebisi practices various African \\"warrior training\\" activities such as hog tying Wangler naked. Adebisi then forces Wangler to accuse Unit Manager Tim McManus of sexual harassment. The claim hurt McManus, as he is already facing a sexual harassment suit from Claire Howell, putting McManus's credibility at further risk. Adebisi begins to formulate a plan to take over Emerald City and make it \\"all black.\\" The first step is to convince the impressionable Correctional Officer Clayton Hughes to help his African American counterparts behind bars as opposed to keeping them locked in. Adebisi tells him that his father had also died in Oz and then convinces Hughes that a white inmate murdered his father. Hughes, after seeing a few white officers make racist statements, starts accusing other black staff members, including Warden Leo Glynn, of betraying their own people and working for an oppressive white-run system. Adebisi's second step involved rallying the black inmates as a means of taking over the prison. He engineers a plan which results in the prison guards throwing Augustus Hill in the hole. He exploits the perceived racism of the white officers in order to incense the black inmates to riot. Despite opposition from Muslim inmate Kareem Said, the black inmates led by Adebisi begin shouting \\"Set Hill Free\\" and start physically confronting both the White inmates and correctional officers. Fearing a riot, Glynn locks Oz down into the new millennium and fires Hughes for being sympathetic to Adebisi's cause. Hughes however leaves Adebisi with a gun on his last day of work. Season 4 After the lockdown, Adebisi creates a tense situation by holding the smuggled gun in his cell. He manipulates Warden Glynn to let Poet, Pierce, and Wangler back into Em City claiming that the racial situation will rest easier getting them back. When Wangler asks why Adebisi isn't using the gun, he claims that their goal to get a black man to run Emerald City will be accomplished better if another inmate uses the gun. Adebisi then notices that the three of them led by Wangler harass and bully a new white inmate, a Frenchman named Guillaume Tarrant, who is a solitary loner unfit to handle the stress of prison life. Intending to eliminate Wangler, Adebisi leaves the gun under Tarrant's mattress. The next time Wangler tries to bully Tarrant, Tarrant pulls the gun and kills him, his friend Junior Pierce, Lou Rath, and officer Joseph Howard before turning the weapon on himself. With four blacks including one correctional officer dead at the hands of a white inmate, Adebisi's goals are accomplished and his plan is set in motion as Glynn fires McManus for overlooking the gun smuggling incident. Raoul Hernandez informs on him, convinced that the Latinos will move to aid the Whites. Hernandez tells Glynn that Adebisi used the gun to stir up racial tension and that it was given to him by Hughes. Adebisi and Pancamo agree that it is time for Hernandez to die, and use new inmate Enrique Morales to kill Hernandez and take his position as El Norte's gang leader. Meanwhile, a new inmate named Desmond Mobay, who is supposedly Jamaican, wants in with the gangsters. Mobay is actually a narcotics detective named Johnny Basil who is sent in to bust the drug trade in Emerald City. Adebisi is suspicious and opposes having Mobay join as a member their crew. But Mobay comes though and passes every initiation test successfully, eventually gaining their confidence. Over the course of the season Adebisi, with the help of Zahir Arif, persuades outside community leaders to pressure Glynn into hiring a black man to replace McManus. Glynn is running for Lieutenant Governor, and sees that hiring a black man to run Emerald City is likely to gain him more support from African American voters. Eventually, Glynn does hire a black man named Martin Querns. Querns, himself an ex-drug dealer, is told to rid Emerald City of violence and racial tension. Querns tells the inmates that they may sell and use drugs freely as long as there is no violence. Head guard Sean Murphy, an ardent supporter of McManus, is appalled by Querns' system, especially because it makes Adebisi, Pancamo, and Morales the trustees. Murphy questions Querns' motive in transferring all of the Aryan and Biker inmates out of Emerald City. Querns fires Murphy and instates a black officer Travis Smith as the head of Emerald City. Querns later recommends that Glynn transfer out all of the guards loyal to Sean Murphy also. Glynn allows Querns to transfer all of the white guards with the exception of Claire Howell, who hates McManus. All of the new guards transferred into Emerald City are black, as are all of the new inmates. However, none of these inmates are Muslim. This angers Arif, who had helped Adebisi get a black man to run Emerald City in the first place. The new inmates are also all loyal to Adebisi, who becomes the most powerful and influential inmate in the prison, and is given free rein by Querns as long as he suppresses violent incidents. Adebisi now has the freedom to satisfy all his vices, installing a curtain in his cell and creating his own version of \\"paradise\\", although he could not escape the fact that he was still in prison. In time, the Christian and gay gangs, both predominantly white, are replaced by black inmates, and soon the Italian and Latino inmates are deprived of the drug trade. When these two groups are sent to Unit B, two of Adebisi's lieutenants, Poet and Supreme Allah, are named trustees to replace Pancamo and Morales. At the same time, two of the few white inmates left in Emerald City, Chris Keller and Ryan O'Reily, decide to work together to bring Adebisi and Querns down. Keller murders inmates Nate Shemin and Mondo Browne, and they frame Supreme Allah. This causes Glynn to begin to mistrust Querns, who in turn begins to mistrust Adebisi, who tries to force a confession out of his lieutenant and various others. Adebisi is rattled by these events and begins to distrust his own men. Said, the re-instated leader of the Muslims, is greatly concerned about the effects of Adebisi's leadership in Emerald City under Querns. Said believes that Emerald City is rapidly becoming an inferno in which black inmates are being mentally poisoned. Noting Adebisi's distrust of his men in light of the murders, Said pretends to join forces with Adebisi with the covert intention of bringing him down. Said learns of Adebisi's video recordings of drug parties in his cell, and resolves to find a way to supply Glynn with this damning evidence of Querns' misconduct. Adebisi accepts Said's request to move into his cell and voluntarily gives him a video tape to \\"test his loyalty.\\" However, Said gives the tape to the warden and Querns is immediately fired. When McManus is reinstated as unit manager of Emerald City, he announces Adebisi's transfer out of the prison unit. In retaliation Adebisi tries to kill Said, gaining the attention of McManus, the guards and the prisoners. A large bloodstain splatters on the white curtains of the cell the two share and Adebisi soon emerges, seemingly victorious and unscathed. However, he reveals his injuries by spitting out blood from his mouth and collapsing at the top of the stairs, dead. His death was later ruled as self-defense since Adebisi attempted to murder Said first.

It was released on December 8, 2004 in North America. The program allows the user to customise their \\"Ping Pal\\" avatar and game interface by selecting from over 1000 different items such as hairstyles, makeup, clothing, backdrops, music loops and sound effects. Gameplay Items can be unlocked by trading with other players or buying them in a shop. Players must trade to complete their collections, as each cartridge's shop offers a different subset of the items. Players receive a regular allowance of coins, using the DS' date-keeping functionality, and can get more by playing mini-games (such as Guess the Number and Hot Potato), typing certain secret words in chat (each word works once per file) and even for choosing to display the credits screen more than once. Up to 16 players can connect wirelessly using one game cartridge; each must be within about 100 feet (30 m) of one of the others to exchange text and picture messages. Reception Although Ping Pals was marketed as a nonviolent, girl-friendly game, it was frequently criticized as not being interactive enough to be called a game. In addition to this, the DS has a built-in chat program called PictoChat. PictoChat includes features that Ping Pals lacks, and due to this, the game received \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. For instance, Nintendo Official Magazine, in its Nintendo DS special, had the opening sentence saying: \\"With PictoChat coming as standard, this is a bit like paying money to breathe air.\\" The reviewer gave a one word written summary reading \\"POINTLESS\\". Several images in Ping Pals were licensed from QPlay. These include the Cupimon, a green creature that dances in the startup animation, and several avatar and clothing graphics. The game received two zeroes and one 1.5 from Electronic Gaming Monthly, the lowest average score in the history of the publication.

Yager Stadium is a football stadium in Oxford, Ohio, USA. It is home to the Miami University RedHawks football team. It has a capacity of 24,286 spectators, and was built in 1983. It replaced Miami Field, which had been used since 1895 (the stands had been built in 1916) and was the home field for many of the coaches who had made the school famous. The stadium is named for Fred C. Yager, class of 1914, who was the lead benefactor in the project to build the stadium. Design The stadium has an unbalanced layout, with the west grandstands being 20 rows taller than the east (student) grandstands. A small set of bleachers sit in the north end zone; there are no seats in the south end zone under the main scoreboard. A Cradle of Coaches room is located inside the stadium, along with football offices, player meeting rooms, and locker rooms. Renovations Due to the successes of Miami's football program, the University has undertaken a continued series of facility upgrades beginning in 2003 with the addition of a FieldTurf playing surface. Other recent substantial upgrades of the facility include broadcast-quality permanent lighting, a new scoreboard with three Daktronics videoboards and the new Cradle of Coaches plaza in 2004, and new student bleacher sections on the east sideline and the north end zone in 2005.

This is a relation of inter-oscillator distances to the spatial Nyquist frequency of waves in the lattice. See also for more on the equivalence of k-vectors. In solid-state physics crystal momentum or quasimomentum is a momentum-like vector associated with electrons in a crystal lattice. It is defined by the associated wave vectors \\\\mathbf{k} of this lattice, according to :{\\\\mathbf{p}}_{\\\\text{crystal}} \\\\equiv \\\\hbar {\\\\mathbf{k}} (where \\\\hbar is the reduced Planck's constant). Frequently, crystal momentum is conserved like mechanical momentum, making it useful to physicists and materials scientists as an analytical tool. Lattice symmetry origins A common method of modeling crystal structure and behavior is to view electrons as quantum mechanical particles traveling through a fixed infinite periodic potential V(x) such that :V({\\\\mathbf{x}}+{\\\\mathbf{a}})=V({\\\\mathbf{x}}), where \\\\mathbf{a} is an arbitrary lattice vector. Such a model is sensible because crystal ions that form the lattice structure are typically on the order of tens of thousands of times more massive than electrons, making it safe to replace them with a fixed potential structure, and the macroscopic dimensions of a crystal are typically far greater than a single lattice spacing, making edge effects negligible. A consequence of this potential energy function is that it is possible to shift the initial position of an electron by any lattice vector \\\\mathbf{a} without changing any aspect of the problem, thereby defining a discrete symmetry. Technically, an infinite periodic potential implies that the lattice translation operator T(a) commutes with the Hamiltonian, assuming a simple kinetic-plus-potential form. These conditions imply Bloch's theorem, which states :\\\\psi_n({\\\\mathbf{x}})=e^{i{\\\\mathbf{k} {\\\\mathbf{\\\\cdot x}}}}u_{n{\\\\mathbf{k}}}({\\\\mathbf{x}}), \\\\qquad u_{n{\\\\mathbf{k}}}({\\\\mathbf{x}}+{\\\\mathbf{a}})=u_{n{\\\\mathbf{k}}}({\\\\mathbf{x}}), or that an electron in a lattice, which can be modeled as a single particle wave function \\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{x}), finds its stationary state solutions in the form of a plane wave multiplied by a periodic function u(\\\\mathbf{x}). The theorem arises as a direct consequence of the aforementioned fact that the lattice symmetry translation operator commutes with the system's Hamiltonian. One of the notable aspects of Bloch's theorem is that it shows directly that steady state solutions may be identified with a wave vector \\\\mathbf{k}, meaning that this quantum number remains a constant of motion. Crystal momentum is then conventionally defined by multiplying this wave vector by Planck's constant: :{\\\\mathbf{p}}_{\\\\text{crystal}} = \\\\hbar {\\\\mathbf{k}}. While this is in fact identical to the definition one might give for regular momentum (for example, by treating the effects of the translation operator by the effects of a particle in free space), there are important theoretical differences. For example, while regular momentum is completely conserved, crystal momentum is only conserved to within a lattice vector. For example, an electron can be described not only by the wave vector \\\\mathbf{k}, but also with any other wave vector \\\\mathbf{k'}such that :\\\\mathbf{k'} = \\\\mathbf{k} + \\\\mathbf{K}, where \\\\mathbf{K} is an arbitrary reciprocal lattice vector. This is a consequence of the fact that the lattice symmetry is discrete as opposed to continuous, and thus its associated conservation law cannot be derived using Noether's theorem. Physical significance The phase modulation of the Bloch state \\\\psi_n({\\\\mathbf{x}})=e^{i{\\\\mathbf{k} {\\\\mathbf{\\\\cdot x}}}}u_{n{\\\\mathbf{k}}}({\\\\mathbf{x}}) is the same as that of a free particle with momentum \\\\hbar k , i.e. k gives the state's periodicity, which is not the same as that of the lattice. This modulation contributes to the kinetic energy of the particle (whereas the modulation is entirely responsible for the kinetic energy of a free particle). In regions where the band is approximately parabolic the crystal momentum is equal to the momentum of a free particle with momentum \\\\hbar k if we assign the particle an effective mass that's related to the curvature of the parabola. Relation to velocity A wave packet with dispersion, which causes the group velocity and phase velocity to be different. This image is a 1-dimensional real wave, but electron wave packets are 3-dimensional complex waves. Crystal momentum corresponds to the physically measurable concept of velocity according to :{\\\\mathbf{v}}_n({\\\\mathbf{k}}) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\hbar} abla_{\\\\mathbf{k}} E_n({\\\\mathbf{k}}). This is the same formula as the group velocity of a wave. More specifically, due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, an electron in a crystal cannot have both an exactly-defined k and an exact position in the crystal. It can, however, form a wave packet centered on momentum k (with slight uncertainty), and centered on a certain position (with slight uncertainty). The center position of this wave packet changes as the wave propagates, moving through the crystal at the velocity v given by the formula above. In a real crystal, an electron moves in this way‚Äîtraveling in a certain direction at a certain speed‚Äîfor only a short period of time, before colliding with an imperfection in the crystal that causes it to move in a different, random direction. These collisions, called electron scattering, are most commonly caused by crystallographic defects, the crystal surface, and random thermal vibrations of the atoms in the crystal (phonons). Response to electric and magnetic fields Crystal momentum also plays a seminal role in the semiclassical model of electron dynamics, where it obeys the equations of motion (in cgs units): :{\\\\mathbf{v}}_n({\\\\mathbf{k}}) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\hbar} abla_{\\\\mathbf{k}} E_n({\\\\mathbf{k}}), :{\\\\mathbf{\\\\dot{p}}}_{\\\\text{crystal}} = -e \\\\left( {\\\\mathbf{E}} -\\\\frac{1}{c} {\\\\mathbf{v}} \\\\times {\\\\mathbf{H}} \\\\right) Here perhaps the analogy between crystal momentum and true momentum is at its most powerful, for these are precisely the equations that a free space electron obeys in the absence of any crystal structure. Crystal momentum also earns its chance to shine in these types of calculations, for, in order to calculate an electron's trajectory of motion using the above equations, one need only consider external fields, while attempting the calculation from a set of equations of motion based on true momentum would require taking into account individual Coulomb and Lorentz forces of every single lattice ion in addition to the external field. Applications=Angle-resolved photo- emission spectroscopy (ARPES) In angle-resolved photo-emission spectroscopy (ARPES), irradiating light on a crystal sample results in the ejection of an electron away from the crystal. Throughout the course of the interaction, one is allowed to conflate the two concepts of crystal and true momentum and thereby gain direct knowledge of a crystal's band structure. That is to say, an electron's crystal momentum inside the crystal becomes its true momentum after it leaves, and the true momentum may be subsequently inferred from the equation :{\\\\mathbf{p_{\\\\parallel}}} = \\\\sqrt{2 m E_{\\\\text{kin}}}\\\\sin \\\\theta by measuring the angle and kinetic energy at which the electron exits the crystal, where m is a single electron's mass. Because crystal symmetry in the direction normal to the crystal surface is lost at the crystal boundary, crystal momentum in this direction is not conserved. Consequently, the only directions in which useful ARPES data can be gleaned are directions parallel to the crystal surface.

In 1857, he published a book which he dedicated to the \\"nonslaveholding whites\\" of the South. The Impending Crisis of the South, written partly in North Carolina but published when the author was in the North, argued that slavery hurt the economic prospects of non-slaveholders, and was an impediment to the growth of the entire region of the South. Anger over his book due to the belief he was acting as an agent of the North attempting to split Southerners along class lines led to Southern denunciations of 'Helperism'. Biography Helper was born near Mocksville, North Carolina. He was the son of a small slave-owning farmer in Western North Carolina. His father died before Helper was a year old, but he was cared for by a wealthy extended family and obtained a good education with the financial help of his uncle. He graduated from Mocksville Academy in 1848, and went to California in 1851 to hopes of finding wealth, but came back in 1854 disillusioned. In 1855 Helper wrote the book The Land of Gold. Reality versus fiction, which widely ridiculed the state. Deeply opposed to slavery and the condition of Southern culture and lack of economic progress, Helper later wrote one of the most effective criticisms of the South titled The Impending Crisis of the South. In it he argued the South's growth, prosperity, and cultural development were being held back by slavery. He deployed statistics from the census to show that land values, literacy levels, and manufacturing rates were considerably lower in the South than in the North. He warned of the devastation caused by slavery through deforestation. He proposed that slaveholders be taxed to colonize all free blacks in Africa or Latin America.Brown (2004) The success of The Impending Crisis in the South made Helper famous overnight. It is also heightened the political crisis by raising fears among Southerners that poor landless Southern whites might turn against slavery if they saw that it did not benefit them. The fear of class divisions within the white community was enough to lead many Southerners who had previously been opponents of secession to embrace it after the election of Abraham Lincoln.Brown (2004) After the war Helper appeared as a post-war Fire Eater, urging the wholesale expulsion of former slaves. His hatred of blacks eventually became a phobia, to the point that he would not patronize hotels or restaurants that employed blacks. Southern enemies of Reconstruction were unwilling to forgive his previous opposition to slavery, and he remained a marginal, and increasingly unstable, character in postwar America.Fredrickson (1998) Lincoln appointed Helper as United States consul in Buenos Aires from 1861 to 1866. He spent most of the postwar years promoting a scheme to build an intercontinental railroad connecting North and South America, which would help replace black and brown peoples with whites. The \\"Three Americas Railway\\" was supposed to extend from the Bering Sea to the Strait of Magellan. His schemes never came to anything, and he committed suicide by turning on the gas in his Washington, D.C. apartment. The Impending Crisis of the South The book, which was a combination of statistical charts and provocative prose, attracted little attention until 1859 when it was widely reprinted in condensed form by Northern opponents of slavery. Helper concluded that slavery hurt the Southern economy overall (by preventing economic development and industrialization), and was the main reason why the South had progressed so much less than the North (according to the results of the 1850 census). Helper spoke on behalf of the majority of Southern whites of moderate means‚Äîthe Plain Folk of the Old South‚Äîwho he said were oppressed by a small (but politically dominant) aristocracy of wealthy slave-owners.Brown (2004) The reaction in the South was very negative. According to John Spencer Bassett, who studied the issue and wrote in 1898, circulating Helper's book could be the basis of criminal charges and politicians often accused each other of having read it, but many of the most successful politicians read it and used it to change the problems stated. In his 1867 essay, \\"War of races. By whom it is sought to be brought about. Considered in two letters, with copious extracts from the recent work of Hilton R. Helper\\", John Harmer Gilmer calls Helper a profane miscreant, one of many insults directed at Helper in that essay. There are very few references to blacks in the book, and certainly slavery as an economic institution is denounced, not black people. It generated a furor in the South, where authorities banned its possession and distribution and burned copies that could be seized. Between 1857 and 1861 nearly 150,000 copies of the book were circulated, and in 1860 the Republican party distributed it as a campaign document. In December 1859 Democrats returning to Congress reacted with indignation because 68 Republicans had endorsed the book and planned to use it as campaign literature in the presidential election of 1860. Opponents blocked the election of Republican John Sherman as speaker because he had endorsed the book.Brown (2004)Fredrickson (1998) Tributes Helper's house near Mocksville *The Hinton Rowan Helper House was Helper's residence, 1829‚Äì49, and is a designated National Historic Landmark. *Liberty ship SS Hinton R.

W. Bush. His field of research was the study of low-energy nuclear reactions and structure using heavy ion beams. Life Born in Westmeath, Ontario, Canada, he received a Bachelor of Science in 1949 and a Master of Science in 1950 from Queen's University. He received a M.S. and a Ph.D. degree in nuclear physics in 1952 from the University of Rochester in the United States. From 1952 to 1953, he was an instructor, and from 1953 to 1954 he was an assistant professor at the University of Rochester. In 1955, he was hired as an associate research officer, Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., and from 1958 to 1960 he was a senior research officer and section head. In 1960, he moved to the United States to become an associate professor of physics at Yale University. He became a U.S. citizen in 1970. He was appointed a professor in 1961 and was associate director of the Heavy Ion Accelerator Lab from 1960 to 1963. He was the founder, and from 1963 to 1989, the director, of Yale's A. W. Wright Nuclear Structure Lab. From 1970 to 1977, he was chairman of the Physics Department. In 1972, he was appointed the Henry Ford II Professor of Physics and was in this position until 1993. Before being appointed under the Bush Cabinet, he was a member of President Ronald Reagan's White House Science Council. While serving as Bush's science advisor from 1989 to 1993, he pushed for major increases in scientific research funding so that the United States could compete with Japan and Germany in manufacturing. He also supported the expansion of the high-speed network which eventually became the Internet. In addition he is known for having played a key role in impeding progress toward international action on climate change at the Noordwijk Climate Conference. During the final negotiation, Bromley, urged by White House Chief of Staff John Sununu, convinced the conference to abandon the commitment to freeze emissions. Following his public policy work, he returned to Yale University to serve as Sterling Professor of the Sciences and Dean of the Yale Faculty of Engineering from 1994 to 2000. His tenure as dean substantially revived Yale's engineering programs and led to its re-establishment as the Yale School of Engineering & Applied Science. He continued teaching at Yale until his death in 2005. Over his career, he had many honors including 33 honorary degrees and membership in the United States National Academy of Science and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

This is a consequence of regulation, local norms, and the set of information, privacy, and business policies concerning corporate decision-making and operations openness to employees, stakeholders, shareholders and the general public. From the perspective of outsiders, transparency can be defined simply as the perceived quality of intentionally shared information from the corporation. Recent research suggests there are three primary dimensions of corporate transparency: information disclosure, clarity, and accuracy. To increment transparency, corporations infuse greater disclosure, clarity, and accuracy into their communications with stakeholders. For example, governance decisions to voluntarily share information related to the firm's ecological impact with environmental activists indicate disclosure; decisions to actively limit the use of technical terminology, fine print, or complicated mathematical notations in the firm's correspondence with suppliers and customers indicate clarity; and decisions to not bias, embellish, or otherwise distort known facts in the firm's communications with investors indicate accuracy. The strategic management of transparency, therefore, involves intentional modifications in disclosure, clarity, and accuracy to accomplish the firm's objectives. High levels of corporate transparency can have positive impact on companies. It is known that high levels of corporate transparency improve investment efficiency and resource allocation. Companies with great corporate transparency are expected to enjoy lower cost of external financing resulting in more opportunities for growth. Next, transparency can lead to better reflection of company specifications in the stock prices and greater extent of monitoring by outside investors. Internally, corporate transparency has been shown to increase employee trust in the organization. Among other benefits of corporate transparency are lower transaction costs and greater stock liquidity associated with lower cost of capital which in return correlates with an increase in the firm value. On the other hand, low levels of corporate transparency are linked with moral hazard extracting firm resources for private benefit. This causes principal-agent problem and worsens firm performance. Standard & Poor's has included a definition of corporate transparency in its GAMMA Methodology aimed at analysis and assessment of corporate governance. As a part of this work, Standard & Poor's Governance Services publishes the Transparency Index which calculates the average score for the largest public companies in various countries. Transparency International publishes an index of corporate transparency based on public disclosure of anti-corruption programmes and country-by-country reporting. Corporate transparency is also used to refer to radical transparency in corporate governance. Transparency Index calculated as the average score for the largest public companies in various countries. Corporate transparency is also used to refer to radical transparency in corporate governance.  Customer support transparency  Corporations may be transparent to investors, the public at large, and to customers. Opening up the customer support channels may mean using a feedback tool which allows users to publicly vote on new developments, having an open internet forum, or actively responding to social media questions.  European Union  Standards concerning corporate transparency in European Union are scrutinized under Directive 2014/95/EU, referred to as Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD). Under this legislation companies have to disclose information regarding employed practices related to environmental protection, social responsibility and treatment of employees, respect for human rights, anti-corruption and bribery and diversity on company boards (in terms of age, gender, educational and professional background). By 2018, companies are required to include non- financial statements in their annual reports. It was found that 60% companies disclose their non-financial information in their annual reports in contrast to 40% favoring a separate document in 2019. The ones with obligation to publish such information are large public-interest companies with more than 500 employees, which amounts to approximately 6000 companies across European Union. Companies enjoy great flexibility how to disclose relevant information as they can either use international, European or national guidelines. For instance, they can use the UN Global Compact, the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises or ISO 26000. Despite enclosed suggestions for guidelines, none is referred to by more than 10% of companies. To better understand the situation, companies are expected to describe their business model in relation to sustainability and strategic risks. This might not be reality as only nearly a half of companies mentioned at least one strategic risk related to sustainability and only 7.2% further described how those risks were being addressed in 2019. The most frequently listed risks where related to climate change (24.9%), environmental challenges (23.9%) and labour issues (23.8%). As of 20 February 2020, the European Commission launched a public consultation on the review of the NFRD.  China  In 2008, researchers found that value maximization might not be the ultimate goal of Chinese listed companies as a result of the Chinese government being the major shareholder of state-owned enterprises (SOE). Comparing listed companies in different markets, it seems that those with sound corporate governance practices tend to showcase relatively good performance, which was in contrast to the situation in the Chinese market. It was believed that implementation of new reforms would result in higher corporate transparency of Chinese firms. In 2002, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) issued a code of corporate governance affecting practices and structures employed by Chinese firms. One year later, the CSRC allowed qualified foreign institutional investors (QFII) to enter the Chinese stock market. It was found that QFIIs have greater control over state shareholders in state-owned companies than domestic mutual funds and are more prone to act as unbiased monitoring body. Institutional ownership has positive effect on both, corporate governance transparency and accounting information transparency. However, there is not sufficient amount of evidence to support the claim that higher levels of corporate transparency lead to higher levels of institutional ownership in China.  Taiwan  Corporate transparency in Taiwan is assessed using Information Disclosure and Transparency Ranking System (IDTRS) launched in 2003 by Securities and Futures Institute. Whole process is on voluntary basis with evaluation executed annually in two-stage process where the ranking committee and companies with possibility of expressing their opinions participate. Capital markets in Taiwan evolved over the recent decades from ones with insufficient protection of shareholders and stock market instability to markets with plausible transparency practices. Establishing IDTRS has increased the level of corporate transparency and information disclosure by Taiwanese companies. Their motivation is driven by the likelihood of their transparency ranking being made public and possible consequences of such action. Disclosing more information mediates information asymmetry, prevents moral hazard and can lead to higher liquidity and lower cost of capital. Ultimately, IDTRS has been successful in stimulating companies to disclose more information, increasing firm value and improving quality of forecasts of firm's performance in stock market.  Emerging Countries  Countries with multi-party legislatures are associated with higher levels of corporate transparency. Furthermore, when a country transitions to multi-party legislature, opacity is expected to decrease. Comparing democracies and authoritarian regimes, we can expect that firms are more transparent in democratic countries. Levels of corporate transparency are decreasing as we go from democracies to countries with semi- competitive authoritarian regimes. Lastly, firms in countries with non- competitive authoritarian regimes display the greatest opacity. When a regime changes from non-competitive authoritarian one to semi-competitive, corporate transparency tends to improve. However, this trend does not hold if a country transitions from a semi-competitive authoritarian regime to democracy.

This process forms vesicles containing the absorbed substances and is strictly mediated by receptors on the surface of the cell. Only the receptor-specific substances can enter the cell through this process. Process Although receptors and their ligands can be brought into the cell through a few mechanisms (e.g. caveolin and lipid raft), clathrin-mediated endocytosis remains the best studied. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis of many receptor types begins with the cargo ligands in the luminal compartment of the vesicle binding to receptors on the cell membrane. The cargo ligand and receptor will then recruit adaptor proteins and clathrin triskelions to the outside membrane of the cell around where budding will form. Budding of the plasma membrane then occurs, forming a clathrin-coated pit. Other receptors can nucleate a clathrin-coated pit allowing formation around the receptor. A mature pit will be cleaved from the plasma membrane through the use of membrane-binding and fission proteins such as dynamin (as well as other BAR domain proteins), forming a clathrin-coated vesicle that then uncoats and typically fuses to a sorting endosome. Once fused, the endocytosed cargo (receptor and/or ligand) can then be sorted to lysosomal, recycling, or other trafficking pathways.  Function  Endocytosis is triggered when a specific receptor is activated in Receptor- mediated endocytosis. The function of receptor-mediated endocytosis is diverse. It is widely used for the specific uptake of certain substances required by the cell (examples include LDL via the LDL receptor or iron via transferrin). The role of receptor-mediated endocytosis is well recognized up take downregulation of transmembrane signal transduction but can also promote sustained signal transduction. The activated receptor becomes internalised and is transported to late endosomes and lysosomes for degradation. However, receptor-mediated endocytosis is also actively implicated in transducing signals from the cell periphery to the nucleus. This became apparent when it was found that the association and formation of specific signaling complexes via clathrin-mediated endocytosis is required for the effective signaling of hormones (e.g. EGF). Additionally it has been proposed that the directed transport of active signaling complexes to the nucleus might be required to enable signaling, due to the fact that random diffusion is too slow, and mechanisms permanently downregulating incoming signals are strong enough to shut down signaling completely without additional signal-transducing mechanisms. Experiments Using fluorescent dyes to tag specific molecules in living cells, it is possible to follow the internalization of cargo molecules and the evolution of a clathrin-coated pit by fluorescence microscopy. Since the process is non-specific, the ligand can be a carrier for larger molecules. If the target cell has a known specific pinocytotic receptor, drugs can be attached and will be internalized. To achieve internalisation of nanoparticles into cells, such as T cells, antibodies can be used to target the nanoparticles to specific receptors on the cell surface (such as CCR5). This is one method of improving drug delivery to immune cells.

A classic example is made with ground beef over tater tots with cream of mushroom soup, but some versions in Minnesota use the official state grain wild rice, or even macaroni, in place of the potatoes. The dish originates in the Upper Midwest region of the United States, where it remains popular, particularly in Minnesota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, and North Dakota. Hotdish is cooked in a single baking dish, and served hot (per its name). It commonly appears at communal gatherings such as family reunions, potlucks, and church suppers.

In years past, a pasta was the most frequently used starch, but tater tots and local wild rice have become very popular as well. Hotdishes are filling, convenient, and easy to make. They are well-suited for family reunions, funerals, church suppers, and covered dish dinners or potlucks where they may be paired with potato salad, coleslaw, Jello salads, Snickers salad, and pan-baked desserts known as bars. Ingredients Tater Tot Hotdish from the Saint Paul, Minnesota, Winter Carnival Typical ingredients in hotdish are potatoes or pasta, ground beef, green beans, and corn, with canned soup added as a binder, flavoring and sauce. Potatoes may be in the form of tater tots, hash browns, potato chips, or shoe string potatoes. The dish is usually seasoned lightly with salt and pepper, and it may be eaten with ketchup as a condiment. Another popular hotdish is the tuna hotdish, made with macaroni or egg noodles, canned tuna, peas, and mushroom soup. Also common is a dish known as goulash, though it bears no resemblance to the familiar Hungarian goulash. Minnesota goulash is usually made with ground beef, macaroni, canned tomatoes, and perhaps a can of creamed corn. Cream of mushroom soup is so ubiquitous in hotdish that it is often referred to in such recipes as ‚ÄúLutheran Binder,‚Äù referring to hotdish's position as a staple of Lutheran church cookbooks. The soup is considered a defining ingredient by some commentators.Mohr, H. (1987). How to Talk Minnesotan. New York: Penguin Books. Minnesota Congressional Hot Dish Competition After the 2010 U.S. midterm elections, former Senator Al Franken invited the members of the Minnesota congressional delegation to a friendly hotdish-making competition, to come together in celebration of the state before the beginning of the legislative session.

History Platz had entered the arena of record production in the early 1960s, and having had a string of hits by licensing records to major labels (most Essex artists were released on EMI's Regal Zonophone), decided to start his own independent record label in 1970. With Malcolm Jones as label manager he formed Fly Records and tapped a rich vein of hits, with the Move, singles from T. Rex and John Kongos (\\"He's Gonna Step On You\\"), as well as hit albums, the most important being Electric Warrior, T. Rex‚Äôs breakthrough number 1 album. But by mid 1972 Marc Bolan had left Fly Records to set up his own label imprint and Essex/Fly producer Tony Visconti had also left with Bolan, setting up his own Good Earth Productions. With new staff brought into the label, Platz decided to promote a new roster of artists and re-launch with a new label named Cube Records. The headline of the press release issued by Malcolm Jones in May 1972 to communicate this development boldly stated \\"Essex puts Fly into Cube\\". A fact literally translated by the label's logo, which consisted of a fly within a wire-frame cube. According to the press release, Fly Records had been limited to operating in the UK, but Cube Records would be an international operation. In effect, Cube simply continued using Fly's catalogue numbering prefix, but with only one Fly artist, guitar virtuoso John Williams, remaining on the new label. Cube's first singles came from Rod Thomas, whose rather insipid MOR/pop \\"Timothy Jones\\" failed to make any impact on the charts, and folk music stalwart Harvey Andrews, whose poignant single \\"In The Darkness\\"/\\"Soldier\\" (BUG 20) was subject to an 'unofficial' ban by the BBC. Harvey's Cube album Writer Of Songs, was produced by long term Essex Music associate John Worth, and featured a stellar cast of musicians including Ralph McTell, Cozy Powell, Danny Thompson, David Pegg and Rick Wakeman, Rodger Bain, producer of Black Sabbath and Budgie, produced an album for folk-rock outfit the JSD Band, which came replete with sleeve notes written by BBC Radio One DJ John Peel. But by July 1972 the label's ethos had moved too far from Jones' remit during the Fly days, and he left the label. The company's legacy recordings that had been released via FLY on its TOOFA series were also now brought into Cube, and by the end of the year Cube continued the TOOFA campaign with releases by T. Rex and Procol Harum, while all efforts were focussed on a brand new signing Joan Armatrading, an artist developed by Elton John producer Gus Dudgeon. Cube released Armatrading's first album, Whatever's for Us (with 11 of the songs co-written by Pam Nestor) in 1972. Even with their biggest promotional campaign to date, the critical favour Armatrading's album garnered could not be replicated in sales. Their decision to credit the album almost solely to Joan Armatrading, giving little credit to Pam Nestor, caused not only the break-up of the duo but also caused Cube to lose Armatrading, who, upset and annoyed by the episode, negotiated her way out of her contract and signed for A&M; instead. Further albums by Harvey Andrews, the JSD Band, Batti Mamzelle & Kestrel followed, and George Martin's production for John Williams' The Height Below ‚Äì a sort of concept album ‚Äì failed to sell in large numbers. Hits like Jimmy Helms' mid 1970s pop/soul \\"Gonna Make You an Offer You Can't Refuse\\" and John Williams' film theme tune, \\"Cavatina (Theme from The Deer Hunter)\\", were only an occasionality, and after around 80 singles and 30 albums a new label makeover was ushered in. As British pub rock lay the minimalist foundations for the oncoming punk rock scene, Cube became Electric Cube, albeit briefly, before its label manager Jeremy Thomas shelved the Cube imprint and established The Electric Record Company, whose Electric Records imprint became the home for new releases. Cube Records soon ceased producing its own catalogue, opting to licence to various catalogue companies over the years. Going full circle, Cube's recordings were incorporated into Onward Music, run by David Platz's son Simon Platz, and Cube‚Äôs catalogue has returned to its initial home, Fly Records.

She graduated from the National College of Art and Design in Dublin in 1989 with a degree in sculpture. Her father, Dick Joynt, was also a sculptor. Rachel Joynt is preoccupied by the historical texture of place and in her work she often seems to expose or memorialize the past as a substrate of the present. Her commissions include People's Island (1988) in which brass footprints and bird feet criss-cross a well-traversed pedestrian island near Dublin's O'Connell Bridge. She collaborated with Remco de Fouw to make Perpetual Motion (1995), a large sphere with road markings which stands on the Naas dual carriageway and featured as a visual shorthand for leaving Dublin in The Apology, a Guinness advert. She made the 900 underlit glass cobblestones which were installed in early 2005 along the edge of Dublin's River Liffey; many of these cobblestones contain bronze or silver fish.

She was initially sentenced to death, but was later returned to the Philippines. Her story was made into a film in 1997.  Early life  Balabagan grew up in a poor Muslim family in Sultan Kudarat, Maguindanao in the Philippines. She had 13 brothers and sisters but only six survived. Her siblings died due to disease and because of her family's financial constraints, which prevented them from availing adequate medical care. She worked for relatives at a young age to support her studies. She only managed to reach the fifth grade. She has implied that she was abused by an uncle as a child. Employment At age 14, Balabagan decided to work abroad. Her recruiter listed her age as 28 and managed to secure a job for her. She learnt of this falsification only when she was already on her flight to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. She was tasked by contract to work for a 67-year-old widower with four sons. Balabagan was anxious of the employment and convinced herself that her employers would respect her since she and they were Muslims. This was later proven to be false, as Balabagan became a subject of unsolicited sexual advances. Case On July 19, 1994, Balabagan killed her employer, Almas Mohammed al-Baloushi, stabbing him 34 times. She alleged that he had tried to rape her, and that she was acting in self-defence. On June 26, 1995, a court ruled that she was guilty of manslaughter as well as a victim of rape. She was sentenced to seven years imprisonment and ordered to pay 150,000 dirhams () in blood money to al- Baloushi's relatives, while at the same time awarded 100,000 dirhams (US$27,000) as compensation for the rape.\\"Amnesty International is concerned about the capital sentence imposed on Sarah Balabagan\\", September 27, 1995. However, the prosecution appealed the verdict, calling for the death penalty. On September 6, 1995, a second Islamic court found no evidence of rape and convicted her of premeditated murder, sentencing her to death by firing squad. There was an international outcry and a defense campaign in several countries, as her case was seen as symbolising the ill-treatment of domestic servants in Arab states of the Persian Gulf, and just a few months earlier there had been the rather similar case of Flor Contemplaci√≥n, a Filipina domestic worker who was hanged in Singapore that March. Reportedly, it was only after a personal appeal for mercy by President of the United Arab Emirates Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan that al-Baloushi's family agreed to drop their execution demand in exchange for blood money.\\"Filipina maid sentenced to caning, prison in Emirates\\", Nando Times, October 30, 1995. On October 30, at her third trial, her sentence was reduced to a year's imprisonment and 100 strokes of the cane, along with payment of blood money, which was donated by a Filipino businessman. She was caned in 20 strokes at a time over five days spanning January 30 ‚Äì February 5, 1996. Philippine Ambassador Roy Se√±eres said \\"Balabagan said it was bearable. Embassy officials visited her twice afterward, and there were no marks or bruises or reddening.\\"\\"Philippine Maid Gets Symbolic 100 Lashes\\", Los Angeles Times, February 10, 1996. However, she later said that her injuries were more serious than she said at the time. She returned to the Philippines on August 1, 1996, to a hero's welcome. Later life Shortly after her release, Balabagan embarked on a career as a singer, appearing on a television program with Geri Halliwell. In 1998, she became a single parent after a brief relationship. In August 2003, she married Russell Vergara. She went on to have two more children. She later converted from Islam to Christianity after being introduced to a pastor by a Christian singer, Dulce Amor. She and Vergara divorced in 2010. In 2013, she married Jun Sereno, and they have a child. As of 2018, she lives in Las Vegas with her husband and five children. In August 2020, Balabagan confirmed that the father of her first-born child is the journalist Arnold Clavio, who exclusively covered her murder case, and revealed that their relationship happened when she was 17 years old. She explained that her revelation was not out of vengeance, but to merely put an end to rumors. She also added that she apologized to \\"everyone she hurt\\", including her family and the family of Clavio, and that Clavio's wife has forgave her through the Messenger. In film Balabagan's story was dramatised in the 1997 Philippine film The Sarah Balabagan Story.

It was a large, ornate, public building used for meetings and other official business during the Roman Empire. Its ruins have been excavated. What is left from its classical period are mostly foundations, floors, a small back corner wall with a few arches that are part of both the original building and later Imperial reconstructions and a single column from its first building phase. The Basilica Julia was built on the site of the earlier Basilica Sempronia (170 BC) along the south side of the Forum, opposite the Basilica Aemilia. It was initially dedicated in 46 BC by Julius Caesar, with building costs paid from the spoils of the Gallic War, and was completed by Augustus, who named the building after his adoptive father. The ruins which have been excavated date to a reconstruction of the Basilica by the Emperor Diocletian, after a fire in 283 AD destroyed the earlier structure.  History and use =Ancient Rome The reconstructed remains of a center column with support. The flaring at the top is the beginning of arches for the bottom tier The first iteration of the Basilica Julia was begun around 54 BC by Julius Caesar, though it was left to his heir Augustus to complete the construction and name it in honor of his adoptive father. The basilica was built over the remains of two important Republican structures: the Basilica Sempronia, which was demolished by Caesar to make way for the new basilica, and pre-dating both, the house of Scipio Africanus, Rome's legendary general. The Basilica Sempronia was built in 169 BC by Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus and required the demolition of the house of Africanus and a number of shops to make room. The first Basilica Julia burned in 9 AD, shortly after completion, but it was reconstructed, enlarged, and rededicated to Augustus' adoptive sons Gaius and Lucius in 12 AD. The Basilica was restored after a fire in 199 AD by Septimius Severus, and later reconstructed by the Emperor Diocletian after another fire in 283 AD. The Basilica is bordered on its short sides by two important ancient roads which led from the Tiber to the Forum: the Vicus Jugarius to the west, and the Vicus Tuscus to the east. The ground floor was divided into five east-west aisles inside, with the central aisle forming a large hall that measured 82x18 meters, sheltered by a three-story high roof. The adjoining aisles to the north and south of the central hall were divided by marble-faced brick columns which supported concrete arcades; the columns in turn supported the upper level of the basilica, which was used as a public gallery. The floor of the central hall was paved in colorful polychrome marble slabs, contrasting with the plain white marble of the adjoining aisles. The Basilica's fa√ßade as it appeared after the Augustan restoration was two stories high and arcaded, with engaged Carrara marble columns decorating the piers between the arches on both levels. The Basilica housed the civil law courts and tabernae (shops), and provided space for government offices and banking. In the 1st century, it also was used for sessions of the Centumviri (Court of the Hundred), who presided over matters of inheritance. In his Epistles, Pliny the Younger describes the scene as he pleaded for a senatorial lady whose 80-year-old father had disinherited her ten days after taking a new wife. Suetonius states that Caligula greatly enjoyed showering the crowd in the forum below with money while standing on the roof of the Basilica Julia.Suetonius, Caligula, 37 It was the favorite meeting place of the Roman people. This basilica housed public meeting places and shops, but it was mainly used as a law court. On the pavement of the portico, there are diagrams of games scratched into the white marble. One stone, on the upper tier of the side facing the Curia, is marked with an eight by eight square grid on which games similar to chess or checkers could have been played. The last recorded restoration of the Basilica Julia was undertaken by the Urban Prefect Gabinius Vettius Probianus in 416 AD, who also relocated several Greek statues by the sculptors Polykleitos and Timarchus for display near the center of the fa√ßade. The inscribed bases of these statues recording the restoration still survive. Late antiquity & medieval era The ruins of the Basilica Julia from the Capitoline Hill, showing the broad central hall & side aisles The Basilica Julia was partially destroyed in 410 AD when the Visigoths sacked Rome and the site slowly fell into ruin over the centuries. The marble was especially valuable in the medieval and early modern eras for burning into lime, a material used to make mortar. The remnants of kilns on the site, which were found in early excavations, confirmed that most of the building's components were destroyed in this way. Part of the remains of the basilica were converted into a church, generally identified as that of Santa Maria de Cannapara which is mentioned in catalogues from the 12th through the 15th centuries. Other parts of the basilica were sectioned off in the medieval period for the use of different trades. The marble workers, or marmorarii, took up most of the remaining space not occupied by the church in the 11th century for re-fashioning and selling marble architectural ornaments; the eastern aisle was occupied by the rope- makers and was called the Cannaparia as a result. In the 16th century, the long-buried site of the Basilica was used as a burial ground for patients of the adjacent Ospedale della Consolazione. The building consists now only of a rectangular area, levelled off and raised about one metre above ground level, with jumbled blocks of stone lying within its area. A row of marble steps runs full length along the side of the basilica facing the Via Sacra, and there is also access from a taller flight of steps (the ground being lower here) at the end of the basilica facing the Temple of Castor and Pollux.  Archaeology and excavation  The earliest excavations of the Basilica Julia in the late 15th and 16th centuries were destructive, their main purpose being to recover valuable travertine and marble for re-use. In 1496, travertine was mined from the ruins to build the fa√ßade of the Palazzo Torlonia, the Roman palace of Cardinal Adriano Castellesi. There were also excavations in 1500, 1511-12, and 1514, as well as a destructive excavation in 1742 which uncovered the portion of the Cloaca Maxima which runs underneath the basilica. In the process the giallo antico yellow marble which covered the floor was stripped and sold to a stone-cutter. The Chevalier Fr√©denheim also undertook excavations between November, 1788 and March, 1789; Fr√©denheim dismantled much of the remaining colored marble pavement and removed many architectural fragments. The site was excavated by Pietro Rosa in 1850 who reconstructed a single marble column and travertine supports. In 1852 segments of concrete vaulting with stuccowork coffering was unearthed but later destroyed in 1872.

The three dioceses had been Prince-bishoprics of the Holy Roman Empire until they were seized by King Henry II of France between April and June 1552. At the end of the Thirty Years' War, they were officially ceded to France by the 1648 Peace of Westphalia. History The Three Bishoprics of Metz, Toul and Verdun (outlined in pink), surrounded by the Duchies of Bar and Lorraine In the course of the rebellion against the Habsburg emperor Charles V, several Protestant Imperial princes met at Lochau Castle near Torgau in May 1551. Here the receiving Wettin elector Maurice of Saxony forged an alliance with Duke John Albert I of Mecklenburg, Prince William IV of Hesse, whose father Landgrave Philip I was jailed by the emperor, the Hohenzollern margrave Albert Alcibiades of Brandenburg-Kulmbach and his cousin Duke Albert of Prussia. Dissatisfied with the Interim decreed by Charles V at the 1548 Diet of Augsburg, the insurgents were full of resolution to defend Protestantism and‚Äìnot least‚Äìtheir autonomy against the Imperial central authority. They agreed to establish contacts with the Catholic French king Henry II, disregarding his oppression of the Protestant Huguenots. In autumn Henry declared war against Charles V and prepared to march against the Empire up to the Rhine River. On 15 January 1552, he signed the Treaty of Chambord with Maurice of Saxony and his Protestant allies, whereby the French conquests were legitimised ahead of time. The princes acknowledged the king's lordship as \\"Vicar of the Empire\\" over the Imperial cities of Metz, Toul and Verdun, as well as Cambrai \\"and other towns of the Empire that do not speak German\\". The insurgents in turn received subsidies and military assistance from the French, their troops moved into the Habsburg hereditary lands and laid siege to the emperor at Innsbruck, while his brother Ferdinand I entered into negotiations that led to the revocation of the Augsburg Interim by the 1552 Peace of Passau. Image:Cathedrale metz 2003.jpgMetz Cathedral Image:Cath√©drale de Toul-Fa√ßade.JPGToul Cathedral Image:55 VERDUN Cathedrale+Cloitre.JPGVerdun Cathedral Backed by Duke Francis of Guise and his brother Cardinal Charles of Lorraine, King Henry II of France upon his agreement with the Protestant princes had started his Voyage d‚ÄôAllemagne \\"for the sake of German liberties\\". On Palm Sunday 1552 French troops under the command of Anne de Montmorency in a surprise attack moved into the walls of Metz, followed by the occupation of Toul on 13 April. Henry then turned against the Lorraine capital Nancy, where he had the minor duke Charles III abducted to the French court in Paris. On 18 April the king celebrated his entry into Metz and, after a failed attack on the Imperial City of Strasbourg, returned from the Rhine to move into Verdun on 12 June. At that time, the French had occupied the three Imperial cities as well as the territory of the surrounding Prince-bishoprics. As from the emperor's perspective, Elector Maurice and his allies had no right to legally dispose of Imperial territory, Charles V started a campaign against the French in order to reconquer the occupied dioceses culminating in the Siege of Metz from 19 October 1552 to 2 January 1553. The expedition ultimately failed, when the Imperial troops were defeated by the French forces under Duke Francis of Guise in the 1554 Battle of Renty. When the emperor, worn out and exhausted, abdicated in 1556, his successor Ferdinand I discontinued all attempts to regain the Three Bishoprics. communes and departments King Henry II left a permanent garrison in each of the cities and gradually subjected its citizens to his royal authority. Especially the Metz townsmen filed several petitions to the Imperial Diet, however, the retrieval of the lost Three Bishoprics was no longer a main concern of the disintegrating Empire during the ongoing confessionalization. Initiated by Cardinal Richelieu, the Trois-√âv√™ch√©s received a certain autonomy with a provincial parlement installed in 1633 in Metz, dominated by the city's patriciate. Civil commotions decreased as the cities prospered under French rule, though the implementation of the gabelle of salt sparked some unrest in Metz. When King Louis XIV acceded to the throne in 1643, he confirmed the privileges of the Metz, Toul and Verdun citizens as his \\"good and faithful subjects\\". After the acquisition of the Three Bishoprics was finally recognized by the Holy Roman Empire in the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, the province's territory was further enlarged by parts of the Duchy of Luxembourg around Thionville (Diedenhofen), ceded to France according to the 1659 Treaty of the Pyrenees, and several Lorraine villages annexed in 1661. The Diocese of Saint-Di√©, created in 1777 and sometimes called the \\"Fourth Bishopric of Lorraine\\" (\\"le Quatri√®me √âv√™ch√© lorrain\\"), is not related historically to the Three Bisphoprics.

She was the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Professor of Social and Political Ethics in the University of Chicago Divinity School with a joint appointment in the department of political science.. Biography=Early life Elshtain was born on January 6, 1941, to Paul Bethke and Hellen Lind in Windsor, Colorado. She grew up in Timnath, Colorado. She was from a Lutheran background.. She received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Colorado State University and master's degrees in history from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison and the University of Colorado. She received her Doctor of Philosophy degree from Brandeis University in 1973, writing her dissertation on Women and Politics: A Theoretical Analysis. Career Elshtain taught from 1973 to 1988 at the University of Massachusetts and then from 1988 to 1995 she taught at Vanderbilt University as the first woman to hold an endowed professorship. Elshtain was selected as a Phi Beta Kappa scholar, a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University, a Guggenheim Fellow, and recipient of nine honorary degrees. In 1995 she became a professor at University of Chicago. She was the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Professor of Social and Political Ethics at the University of Chicago Divinity School, and a contributing editor for The New Republic. She was also a Visiting Distinguished Professor of Religion and Politics at Baylor University. In the 1990s, she chaired the Council on Civil Society, a joint project of the Institute for American Values and the University of Chicago Divinity School, which issued the report A Call to Civil Society: Why Democracy Needs Moral Truths. She was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and she has served on the boards of the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, and the National Humanities Center. She was the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship, and received nine honorary degrees. In 2002, Elshtain received the Frank J. Goodnow award, the highest award for distinguished service to the profession given by the American Political Science Association. The focus of Elshtain's work is an exploration of the relationship between politics and ethics. Much of her work concerned the parallel development of male and female gender roles as they pertain to public and private social participation. After the September 11, 2001, attacks she was one of the more visible academic supporters of US military intervention in Afghanistan and Iraq.News report in September/October 2013 issue of Philosophy Now magazine entitled 'Jean Bethke Elshtein' (sic), accessible here She published over five hundred essays and authored and/or edited over twenty books, including Democracy on Trial, Just War Against Terror: The Burden of American Power in a Violent World, Jane Addams and the Dream of American Democracy, Augustine and the Limits of Politics, and Sovereignty: God, State, Self. In 2006, she was appointed by US President George W. Bush to the Council of the National Endowment for the Humanities, and also delivered the prestigious Gifford Lectures at the University of Edinburgh, joining such previous Gifford Lecturers as William James, Hannah Arendt, Karl Barth, and Reinhold Niebuhr. In 2008, Elshtain received a second presidential appointment to the President's Council on Bioethics. Elshtain contributed to national debates on the family, the roles of men and women, the state of American democracy, and international relations for more than thirty-five years. =Analysis of major works= Elshtain's importance to the United States stems both from her impact in political ethics, and also her position in society as a woman. Carlin Romano, author of America the Philosophical, explains in his work that Elshtain's aim \\"was not so much to lobby for specific policies as to push for good civic-minded 'individualism' over the egoism of 'bad individualism'\\". In one of her more popular titles, Women and War, Elshtain examines women's roles in war as contrasted against masculine roles and why these concepts are important to society. Beginning by examining America's societal interpretations of gender roles during wartime (man as a brave fighter and woman as a pacifist), Elshtain argues that men may make poor civic soldiers due to the fact that they are predisposed to a dangerous kind of eager adolescence on the battlefield, while women may be enthusiastically patriotic and possess a kind of necessary maturity, which is vital to successful combat. In one of her more famous works, Democracy on Trial, Elshtain reflects on democracy in America, discussing how socio-cultural insistence on \\"difference\\" or \\"separatism\\" have evolved since the ratification of the Constitution, and how it may be detrimental to the system. Elshtain does not deny the importance of difference, especially within a civic body. Rather, she recognizes that Americans are no longer acting as representative bodies in governments, which embrace separate interests and also work as a collective towards the betterment of the whole. Elshtain, like James Madison, explains that American factional hostility is only a detriment to society: \\"one makes war with enemies: one does politics ‚Äì democratic politics ‚Äì with opponents\\". Death She died on August 11, 2013, at the age of 72 of heart failure resulting from endocarditis. She was buried at Grandview Cemetery, Fort Collins.Volga German Institute Published works=Books * Sovereignty: God, State, Self (2008) * Just War Against Terror: The Burden of American Power in a Violent World (2003) * Jane Addams and the Dream of American Democracy (2002) * Who Are We?

She was the second navy ship to be named for the Mount Rushmore National Memorial in the Black Hills of South Dakota. She is the seventh ship in her class of dock landing ships and the fourth ship in that class to serve in the United States Pacific Fleet. Rushmore was laid down on 9 November 1987, by the Avondale Shipyards, New Orleans; launched on 6 May 1989, sponsored by Mrs. Meredith Brokaw, wife of NBC News anchorman Tom Brokaw; and commissioned on 1 June 1991, at New Orleans. Mission The assigned mission of the dock landing ship is to transport and launch loaded amphibious craft and vehicles with their crews and embarked personnel in amphibious assaults by landing craft and amphibious vehicles. It can render limited docking repair service to small ships and craft. General comments The provides for greater storage space of weapons and equipment, improved facilities for embarked troops, greater range of operations, and the capability to embark either conventional landing craft or LCAC. The ships incorporate materiel handling equipment including elevators, package/roller conveyors and forklifts, pallet transporters, and a turntable. The turntable is located between the well deck and the helicopter deck forward of the boat deck to assist in the rapid turnaround of vehicles and equipment during loading/offloading operations. History= 1990s  The ship's first assignment was to deliver three Air Cushioned Landing Craft (LCAC) to Camp Pendleton, California from Panama City, Florida. Along the way, Rushmore conducted a port visit in Jamaica, traversed the Panama Canal, and visited Rodman, Panama. Camp Pendleton was the last stop before arriving at her homeport of NS San Diego. During her first six-month deployment, Rushmore spearheaded the beach landing on Somalia during Operation Restore Hope. The largest military humanitarian operation in history, Restore Hope was designed to provide food and medical relief to the starving people of Somalia. Rushmores 1994 WestPac deployment came almost one year ahead of schedule. She deployed with only four weeks' notice and participated in Operation Support Hope off the coast of Mombasa, Kenya, the USLO relocation in Somalia, and exercises with forces of Oman and the United Arab Emirates. During this deployment, Rushmore also was awarded a Meritorious Unit Commendation. Rushmores 1996 deployment followed a complete and highly successful training cycle during which Rushmore earned the Blue E and the Battle E. This deployment provided numerous international training opportunities for the Amphibious Readiness Group and the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit (13th MEU) including Exercise Cobra Gold '96 with Thailand, Exercise Infinite Moonlight with Jordan, Exercise Red Reef with Saudi Arabia, and MEUEX '96 with Kuwait. Rushmore demonstrated its superior adaptability throughout deployment by becoming the first LSD-41-class ship to employ Rigid Hull Inflatable Boats (RHIBs) for the SPECWAR Detachment. Rushmore concluded 1996 with a port visit to Mazatl√°n, Mexico. The ship earned its second consecutive Battle E in 1996. Rushmore is the test platform for the Smart Ship program known as Gator 17. The ship was outfitted with several new technologies to reduce workload and manning levels. Information from the program aboard Rushmore will be used to assist in the design of the LPD-17 class amphibious ships. Installation was completed at the end of 1997. The USS Rushmore at NS Pearl Harbor during RIMPAC (2004). Rushmore deployed in 1999 with the Amphibious Ready Group and the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit (11th MEU). During this deployment, Rushmore participated in Exercise Iron Magic with the United Arab Emirates and Exercise Red Reef with Saudi Arabia. Rushmore also had the distinction of becoming the first United States Naval warship to visit Doha, Qatar in 10 years. Other port visits included Japan, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Singapore, Guam, Australia and Hawaii. On 12 March 1999, the ship made history when then Commander Michelle J. Howard (as of December 2013 she is the Vice Chief of Naval Operations and confirmed by the US Senate to the rank of Admiral (4 star rank) ) became its commanding officer and the first African American woman to Command a US Navy ship. Rushmore returned to San Diego in December 1999 and became the first \\"Smart Ship\\" to complete a six-month Western Pacific deployment. 2000s With the new millennium, came a year of local operations for Rushmore. Rushmore participated in CARAT 2001 in cooperation with other navies in the Western Pacific, South China Sea and Southeast Asia. Returning home just days prior to the September 11 attacks, Rushmore began preparations to deploy to areas of national security interests. After coming out of \\"the yards\\" USS Rushmore participated in RIMPAC 2002 with a host of nations off the shores of Hawaii. The ship set sail in the early month of January 2003 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom as part of the Bonhomme Richard Amphibious Ready Group (ARG). The ship deployed on 6 December 2004 once again in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom as part of the Expeditionary Strike Group (ESG 5). On the way to the Fifth Fleet Area of Responsibility, the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami occurred, which would change the course of Rushmore and begin a massive U.S. military humanitarian operation, dubbed Operation Unified Assistance. The tsunami that flooded parts of Southeast Asia took the lives of more than 100,000 people in a matter of hours. USS Rushmore and the elements of Expeditionary Strike Group Five were called into action. The ship became an afloat staging base for military helicopters to refuel and transport supplies. USS Rushmore launched both LCACs bringing tons of food and water ashore for distribution to survivors. Once the operation ended, Rushmore reset a course to the Persian Gulf to support Maritime Security Operations, and help defend Iraq's Kwar Al Amaya and Al Basra Oil Platforms. The Marines of the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit deployed to Kuwait, and went further north into areas of Iraq before they were brought back on board in early April. Rushmore sailors enjoyed two port visits during their two months in the Persian Gulf, one visit to the Mid- Eastern country of Bahrain, the other, a trip to the port of Jebel Ali, United Arab Emirates. During the transit home, Rushmore stopped for a port visit to Cairns, Australia. Rushmore returned to the ship's homeport of San Diego, California on 6 June 2005. The ship completed a three-month maintenance period and participated in Exercise Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) off the coast of Hawaii from June to August 2006. Rushmore began 2007 by completing work ups with the Bonhomme Richard (ESG 5). They loaded more than 400 Marines of the 13th MEU onboard along with their equipment to prepare for the transit to the Middle East. On 16 February 2007, Rushmore was awarded the 2006 Battle \\"E\\" award. As 10 April 2007 arrived Rushmore was ready to get underway for deployment to the Middle East. Rushmore visited several different ports, including Guam, Singapore, Jebel Ali, Dubai and Bahrain. On 1 December 2007, Rushmore became the first ship since the September 11 terrorist attacks to host a United States Navy open house while inport Seal Beach, California. Thousands showed up to tour the ship. The crew took visitors through the bridge, medical center, Combat Information Center, and other external places on the ship. Rushmore certified in ULTRA-C in May 2008 and sailed up to Seattle, Washington, to take part in the Centennial Celebration of the Great White Fleet on 22 May. She participated in a parade of ships and later hosted tours to both the general public and guests for the gala. In late September 2008, Rushmore sailed to Esquimalt, British Columbia, Canada, to serve as the test platform for developing ASW systems in the Nanoose Firing Range. While there, Rushmore had a three-day port visit and was hosted by (FFH 334). Upon their return home, Rushmore finalized their preparations for the Congressionally-mandated Navy's Board of Inspection and Survey (INSURV) on 27 October 2008.

Chest radiographs are the most common film taken in medicine. Like all methods of radiography, chest radiography employs ionizing radiation in the form of X-rays to generate images of the chest. The mean radiation dose to an adult from a chest radiograph is around 0.02 mSv (2 mrem) for a front view (PA, or posteroanterior) and 0.08 mSv (8 mrem) for a side view (LL, or latero-lateral).Fred A. Mettler, Walter Huda, Terry T. Yoshizumi, Mahadevappa Mahesh: \\"Effective Doses in Radiology and Diagnostic Nuclear Medicine: A Catalog\\" ‚Äì Radiology 2008;248:254‚Äì263 Together, this corresponds to a background radiation equivalent time of about 10 days. Medical uses Dedicated chest radiography room Conditions commonly identified by chest radiography * Pneumonia * Pneumothorax * Interstitial lung disease * Heart failure * Bone fracture * Hiatal hernia Chest radiographs are used to diagnose many conditions involving the chest wall, including its bones, and also structures contained within the thoracic cavity including the lungs, heart, and great vessels. Pneumonia and congestive heart failure are very commonly diagnosed by chest radiograph. Chest radiographs are also used to screen for job-related lung disease in industries such as mining where workers are exposed to dust.Using Digital Chest Images to Monitor the Health of Coal Miners and Other Workers . National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. For some conditions of the chest, radiography is good for screening but poor for diagnosis. When a condition is suspected based on chest radiography, additional imaging of the chest can be obtained to definitively diagnose the condition or to provide evidence in favor of the diagnosis suggested by initial chest radiography. Unless a fractured rib is suspected of being displaced, and therefore likely to cause damage to the lungs and other tissue structures, x-ray of the chest is not necessary as it will not alter patient management. The main regions where a chest X-ray may identify problems may be summarized as ABCDEF by their first letters:medicalmnemonics.com > Chest X-ray interpretation 2002 *Airways, including hilar adenopathy or enlargement *Breast shadows *Bones, e.g. rib fractures and lytic bone lesions *Cardiac silhouette, detecting cardiac enlargement *Costophrenic angles, including pleural effusions *Diaphragm, e.g. evidence of free air, indicative of perforation of an abdominal viscus *Edges, e.g. apices for fibrosis, pneumothorax, pleural thickening or plaques *Extrathoracic tissues *Fields (lung parenchyma), being evidence of alveolar flooding *Failure, e.g. alveolar air space disease with prominent vascularity with or without pleural effusions Views Positioning for a PA chest x-ray Normal lateral chest radiograph. Different views (also known as projections) of the chest can be obtained by changing the relative orientation of the body and the direction of the x-ray beam. The most common views are posteroanterior, anteroposterior, and lateral. In a posteroanterior (PA) view, the x-ray source is positioned so that the x-ray beam enters through the posterior (back) aspect of the chest and exits out of the anterior (front) aspect, where the beam is detected. To obtain this view, the patient stands facing a flat surface behind which is an x-ray detector. A radiation source is positioned behind the patient at a standard distance (most often 6 feet, 1,8m), and the x-ray beam is fired toward the patient. In anteroposterior (AP) views, the positions of the x-ray source and detector are reversed: the x-ray beam enters through the anterior aspect and exits through the posterior aspect of the chest. AP chest x-rays are harder to read than PA x-rays and are therefore generally reserved for situations where it is difficult for the patient to get an ordinary chest x-ray, such as when the patient is bedridden. In this situation, mobile X-ray equipment is used to obtain a lying down chest x-ray (known as a \\"supine film\\"). As a result, most supine films are also AP. Lateral views of the chest are obtained in a similar fashion as the posteroanterior views, except in the lateral view, the patient stands with both arms raised and the left side of the chest pressed against a flat surface. Typical views Required projections can vary by country and hospital, although an erect posteroanterior (PA) projection is typically the first preference. If this is not possible, then an anteroposterior view will be taken. Further imaging depends on local protocols which is dependent on the hospital protocols, the availability of other imaging modalities and the preference of the image interpreter. In the UK, the standard chest radiography protocol is to take an erect posteroanterior view only and a lateral one only on request by a radiologist. In the US, chest radiography includes a PA and Lateral with the patient standing or sitting up. Special projections include an AP in cases where the image needs to be obtained stat and with a portable device, particularly when a patient cannot be safely positioned upright. Lateral decubitus may be used for visualization of air-fluid levels if an upright image cannot be obtained. Anteroposterior (AP) Axial Lordotic projects the clavicles above the lung fields, allowing better visualization of the apices (which is extremely useful when looking for evidence of primary tuberculosis). Additional views *Decubitus ‚Äì taken while the patient is lying down, typically on his or her side. Useful for differentiating pleural effusions from consolidation (e.g. pneumonia) and loculated effusions from free fluid in the pleural space. In effusions, the fluid layers out (by comparison to an up-right view, when it often accumulates in the costophrenic angles). *Lordotic view ‚Äì used to visualize the apex of the lung, to pick up abnormalities such as a Pancoast tumour. *Expiratory view ‚Äì helpful for the diagnosis of pneumothorax. *Oblique view ‚Äì useful for the visualization of the ribs and sternum. Although it's necessary to do the appropriate adaptations to the x-ray dosage to be used. Landmarks angle parts of the ribs and some other landmarks labeled. Mediastinal structures on a chest radiograph. In the average person, the diaphragm should be intersected by the 5th to 7th anterior ribs at the mid-clavicular line, and 9 to 10 posterior ribs should be viewable on a normal PA inspiratory film. An increase in the number of viewable ribs implies hyperinflation, as can occur, for example, with obstructive lung disease or foreign body aspiration. A decrease implies hypoventilation, as can occur with restrictive lung disease, pleural effusions or atelectasis. Underexpansion can also cause interstitial markings due to parenchymal crowding, which can mimic the appearance of interstitial lung disease. Enlargement of the right descending pulmonary artery can indirectly reflect changes of pulmonary hypertension, with a size greater than 16 mm abnormal in men and 15 mm in women. Appropriate penetration of the film can be assessed by faint visualization of the thoracic spines and lung markings behind the heart. The right diaphragm is usually higher than the left, with the liver being situated beneath it in the abdomen. The minor fissure can sometimes be seen on the right as a thin horizontal line at the level of the fifth or sixth rib. Splaying of the carina can also suggest a tumor or process in the middle mediastinum or enlargement of the left atrium, with a normal angle of approximately 60 degrees. The right paratracheal stripe is also important to assess, as it can reflect a process in the posterior mediastinum, in particular the spine or paraspinal soft tissues; normally it should measure 3 mm or less. The left paratracheal stripe is more variable and only seen in 25% of normal patients on posteroanterior views. Localization of lesions or inflammatory and infectious processes can be difficult to discern on chest radiograph, but can be inferenced by silhouetting and the hilum overlay sign with adjacent structures. If either hemidiaphragm is blurred, for example, this suggests the lesion to be from the corresponding lower lobe. If the right heart border is blurred, than the pathology is likely in the right middle lobe, though a cavum deformity can also blur the right heard border due to indentation of the adjacent sternum. If the left heart border is blurred, this implies a process at the lingula. Abnormalities=Nodule A lung nodule is a discrete opacity in the lung which may be caused by: * Neoplasm: benign or malignant * Granuloma: tuberculosis * Infection: round pneumonia * Vascular: infarct, varix, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, rheumatoid arthritis There are a number of features that are helpful in suggesting the diagnosis: * rate of growth ** Doubling time of less than one month: sarcoma/infection/infarction/vascular ** Doubling time of six to 18 months: benign tumour/malignant granuloma ** Doubling time of more than 24 months: benign nodule neoplasm * calcification * margin ** smooth ** lobulated ** presence of a corona radiata * shape * site If the nodules are multiple, the differential is then smaller: *infection: tuberculosis, fungal infection, septic emboli *neoplasm: e.g., metastases, lymphoma, hamartoma *sarcoidosis *alveolitis *auto-immune disease: e.g., granulomatosis with polyangiitis, rheumatoid arthritis *inhalation (e.g., pneumoconiosis) Cavities A cavity is a walled hollow structure within the lungs. Diagnosis is aided by noting: *wall thickness *wall outline *changes in the surrounding lung The causes include: *cancer *infarct (usually from a pulmonary embolus) *infection: e.g., Staphylococcus aureus, tuberculosis, Gram negative bacteria (especially Klebsiella pneumoniae), anaerobic bacteria, and fungus *Granulomatosis with polyangiitis Pleural abnormalities Fluid in space between the lung and the chest wall is termed a pleural effusion. There needs to be at least 75 mL of pleural fluid in order to blunt the costophrenic angle on the lateral chest radiograph and 200 mL of pleural fluid in order to blunt the costophrenic angle on the posteroanterior chest radiograph. On a lateral decubitus, amounts as small as 50ml of fluid are possible. Pleural effusions typically have a meniscus visible on an erect chest radiograph, but loculated effusions (as occur with an empyema) may have a lenticular shape (the fluid making an obtuse angle with the chest wall). Pleural thickening may cause blunting of the costophrenic angle, but is distinguished from pleural fluid by the fact that it occurs as a linear shadow ascending vertically and clinging to the ribs. Diffuse shadowing The differential for diffuse shadowing is very broad and can defeat even the most experienced radiologist. It is seldom possible to reach a diagnosis on the basis of the chest radiograph alone: high-resolution CT of the chest is usually required and sometimes a lung biopsy. The following features should be noted: *type of shadowing (lines, dots or rings) **reticular (crisscrossing lines) **companion shadow (lines paralleling bony landmarks) **nodular (many small dots) **rings or cysts **ground glass **consolidation (diffuse opacity with air bronchograms) *location (where is the lesion worst?) **upper (e.g., sarcoid, tuberculosis, silicosis/pneumoconiosis, ankylosing spondylitis, Langerhans cell histiocytosis) **lower (e.g., cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, connective tissue disease, asbestosis, drug reactions) **central (e.g., pulmonary edema, alveolar proteinosis, lymphoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, PCP) **peripheral (e.g., cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, connective tissue disease, chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia) *lung volume **increased (e.g., Langerhans cell histiocytosis, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, cystic fibrosis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis) **decreased (e.g., fibrotic lung disease, chronic sarcoidosis, chronic extrinsic allergic alveolitis) Pleural effusions may occur with cancer, sarcoid, connective tissue diseases and lymphangioleiomyomatosis.

The fort has been a residential complex since the early 1970s but has a history dating back 150 years. Founding Fort Picklecombe was commissioned in the mid 19th century by Lord Palmerston, Foreign Secretary and then Prime Minister under Queen Victoria. Being an island, Great Britain was at risk from large scale enemy invasion by sea, particularly from France. Palmerston ordered a series of coastal forts and batteries to be built in this area to defend the large naval base at Devonport near Plymouth. The coastal entrance to Plymouth is known as Plymouth Sound, and was to be defended by Fort Picklecombe to the west, Fort Bovisand to the east, and a smaller fort on the Plymouth Sound breakwater. Fort Picklecombe itself would be defended from attack from the rear by a series of smaller forts and batteries positioned on or near the Rame peninsula. Fort Picklecombe was built near an earlier earthen battery dating back to the start of the 19th century. It was designed by Major (later Maj Gen) Whitworth Porter ,Freddy Woodward, (1996) The Historic Defences of Plymouth, Cornwall County Council, p174 and was built by Hubbard and Company. Constructed between 1864 and 1871, the fort was armed with forty two 9-inch and 10-inch muzzle loading guns, which were mounted in a semi-circular arc of two-storey casemates faced with granite blocks and iron shields. In the 1890s, it was rearmed with two 6-inch breech-loaders and two light quick firing guns. Not a single shot has ever been fired in anger from the fort. The Palmerston forts‚Äô lack of war action led them to be dubbed Palmerston Follies, the fact that they were a deterrent was lost on their critics. 20th century Guns were removed from the fort in the 1920s but after the outbreak of the World War II it was reactivated and manned by the 566th Devon Coast Regiment, Royal Artillery. In addition to the two 6-inch guns, two twin 6-pounder guns were installed. Just down the coast to the west of the fort range finder and searchlight positions were made. The remains of these positions still remain today. After the war, the fort was decommissioned and it stood derelict for many years. Eventually it was offered for sale to property developers and in the early 1970s it was converted to 103 residential apartments.https://www.fpmc.co.uk The fort‚Äôs position overlooking Plymouth Sound and within the beautiful Mount Edgcumbe Country Park make it highly desirable. A quiet rural retreat yet only a couple of miles as the crow flies from the urban sprawl of Plymouth. A grand building, called the Officers‚Äô Mess stands in an elevated position above the main fort complex. It is said that in order to meet the demands of the then landowner, the Earl of Edgcumbe, the officers mess had to emulate Warwick Castle, complete with towers and castellations. In the Spring of 2007 work was well under way to convert the Officers Mess into flats.

Form and function At a Greek symposium, kraters were placed in the center of the room. They were quite large, so they were not easily portable when filled. Thus, the wine-water mixture would be withdrawn from the krater with other vessels, such as a kyathos (pl. kyathoi), an amphora (pl. amphorai), or a kylix (pl. kylikes). In fact, Homer's OdysseyIX.10 describes a steward drawing wine from a krater at a banquet and then running to and fro pouring the wine into guests' drinking cups. The modern Greek word now used for undiluted wine, krasi (Œ∫œÅŒ±œÉŒØ), originates from the krasis (Œ∫œÅŒ¨œÉŒπœÇ, i.e., mixing) of wine and water in kraters.Entry Œ∫œÅŒ¨œÉŒπœÇ at LSJ Kraters were glazed on the interior to make the surface of the clay more impervious for holding water, and possibly for aesthetic reasons, since the interior could easily be seen. The exterior of kraters often depicted scenes from Greek life, such as the Attic Late 1 Krater, which was made between 760 and 735 B.C.E. This object was found among other funeral objects, and its exterior depicted a funeral procession to the gravesite. Usage At the beginning of each symposium a symposiarch (œÉœÖŒºœÄŒøœÉŒØŒ±œÅœáŒøœÇ), or \\"lord of the common drink\\", was elected by the participants. He would then assume control of the wine servants, and thus of the degree of wine dilution and how it changed during the party, and the rate of cup refills. The krater and how it was filled and emptied was thus the centerpiece of the symposiarch's authority. An astute symposiarch should be able to diagnose the degree of inebriation of his fellow symposiasts and make sure that the symposium progressed smoothly and without drunken excess. Wine dilution Manner of Lydos, Black-figured column crater depicting swans, ca. 550 BC, Museum of the Ancient Agora, Athens Drinking √°kratos (undiluted) wine was considered a severe faux pas (misstep, wrongdoing) in ancient Greece, enough to characterize the drinker as a drunkard and someone who lacked restraint and principle. Ancient writers prescribed that a mixing ratio of 1:3 (wine to water) was optimal for long conversation, a ratio of 1:2 when fun was to be had, and 1:1 was really only suited for orgiastic revelry, to be indulged in very rarely, if at all. Since such mixtures would produce an unpalatable and watery drink if applied to most wines made in the modern style, this practice of the ancients has led to speculation that ancient wines might have been vinified to a high alcoholic degree and sugar content, e.g. by using dehydrated grapes, and could withstand dilution with water better. Such wines would have also withstood time and the vagaries of transportation much better. Nevertheless, the ancient writers offer scant details of ancient vinification methods, and therefore this theory, though plausible, remains unsupported by evidence.  Forms = Column krater  This form originated in Corinth in the seventh century BCE but was taken over by the Athenians where it is typically black-figure. They ranged in size from to in height and were usually thrown in three pieces: the body/ shoulder area was one, the base another, and the neck/ lip/ rim a third. The handles were pulled separately. Calyx krater Euphronios & Euxitheos, Crat√®re attique √† figures rouges, 515‚Äì510 BC, Louvre These are among the largest of the kraters, supposedly developed by the potter Exekias in black figure though in fact almost always seen in red. The lower body is shaped like the calyx of a flower, and the foot is stepped. The psykter-shaped vase fits inside it so well stylistically that it has been suggested that the two might have often been made as a set. It is always made with two robust upturned handles positioned on opposite sides of the lower body or \\"cul\\".  Volute krater  This type of krater, defined by volute-shaped handles, was invented in Laconia in the early 6th century BC, then adopted by Attic potters. Its production was carried on by Greeks in Apulia until the end of the 4th century BC. Its shape and method of manufacture are similar to those of the column krater, but the handles are unique: to make each, the potter would have first made two side spirals (\\"volutes\\") as decorative disks, then attached a long thin slab of clay around them both forming a drum with flanged edges. This strip would then have been continued downward until the bottom of the handle where the potter would have cut a U-shaped arch in the clay before attaching the handle to the body of the vase.  Bell krater  Bell kraters were first made in the early fifth century which meant that it came later than the three other krater types This form of krater looks like an inverted bell with handles that are faced up. Bell kraters are red-figure and not black-figure like the other kraters.

Among the largest and most famous metal kraters in antiquity were one in the possession of the Samian tyrant Polycrates, and another one dedicated by Croesus to the Delphic oracle. There are a few extant Archaic bronze kraters (or often only their handles), almost exclusively of the volute-type. Their main production centres were Sparta, Argos and Corinth, in Peloponnesus. During the Classical period the Volute-type continued to be very popular along with the calyx-type, and beside the Corinthian workshop an Attic one was probably active. Exquisite exemplars of both volute- and calyx-kraters come from Macedonian 4th century BC graves. Among them the gilded Derveni Krater represents an exceptional chef d‚Äô≈ìuvre of late Classical metalwork.Barr-Sharrar B., The Derveni krater: masterpiece of classical Greek metalwork, ASCSA 2008 The Vix bronze crater, found in a Celtic tomb in central France is the largest known Greek krater, being 1.63 m in heightVix-Mus√©e-du- Pays-Ch√¢tillonnais: Tr√©sor-de-Vix and over 200 kg in weight.

After rediscovery of these pieces, imitations became a staple of garden decoration in the Baroque and Neoclassical periods. The French artist and landscape designer Hubert Robert included the Borghese Vase, both alone and together with other stone kraters, in several of his works.Grasselli, Margaret Morgan, Yuriko Jackall, et al., Hubert Robert, The National Gallery of Art, Washington, 2016.

This original Musaeum (\\"Institution of the Muses\\") was the home of music or poetry, a philosophical school and library such as Plato's Academy, and also a storehouse of texts. It did not have a collection of works of art, rather it was an institution that brought together some of the best scholars of the Hellenistic world, analogous to a modern university. This original Musaeum was the source for the modern usage of the word museum. History The Musaeum was an institution founded, according to Johannes Tzetzes, by Ptolemy I Soter (c. 367 BC ‚Äì c. 283 BC) at Alexandria. It is perhaps more likely that Ptolemy II Philadelphus (309‚Äì246 BC) was the true founder.There is no ancient source for the founding either of the Library or the Musaeum, Roger S.

More than 1,000 scholars lived in the Mouseion at a given time. Staff members and scholars were salaried by the Mouseion and paid no taxes. They also received free meals, free room and board, and free servants. The Mouseion was administered by a priest appointed by the Pharaoh. The Mouseion's scholars conducted scientific research, published, lectured, and collected as much literature as possible from the known world. In addition to Greek works, foreign texts were translated from Assyrian, Persian, Jewish, Indian languages, and other sources. The edited versions of the Greek literary canon that we know today, from Homer and Hesiod forward, exist in editions that were collated and corrected by the scholars assembled in the Musaeum at Alexandria. Appearance The Greek geographer Strabo described the Musaeum and Library as richly decorated edifices in a campus of buildings and gardens. > The Mouseion is also part of the palaces, possessing a peripatosAn open > loggia for walking and talking. and exedraThe curved seat of an exedra is > more accommodating to a group conversation than a bench in a straight line. > and large oikos, in which the common tableOikos signifies \\"household\\" in the > broadest sense; an English analogy might be a university \\"commons\\". of the > philologoi, men who are members of the Mouseion, is located.

The Mouseion featured a roofed walkway, an arcade of seats, and a communal dining room where scholars routinely ate and shared ideas. The building was filled with private study rooms, residential quarters, lecture halls, and theaters. Notable scholars The following scholars are known to have studied, written, or performed their experiments at the Musaeum of Alexandria. *Archimedes ‚Äì father of engineering *Aristarchus of Samos ‚Äì proposed the first heliocentric system of the universe * Callimachus ‚Äì a noted poet, critic and scholar *Erasistratus ‚Äì physician and co-founder of the Academy of Medicine in Alexandria along with Herophilus *Eratosthenes ‚Äì argued for a spherical earth and calculated its circumference to near-accuracy *Euclid ‚Äì father of geometry *Herophilus ‚Äì notable physician and founder of the scientific method *Hipparchus ‚Äì founder of trigonometry *Pappus ‚Äì mathematician *Hero ‚Äì father of mechanics Decline The classic period of the Musaeum did not survive the purge and expulsion of most of the intellectuals attached to it in 145 BC, when Aristarchus of Samothrace resigned his position; at any rate, the sources that best describe the Musaeum and library, Johannes Tzetzes and others, all Byzantine and late, do not mention any further directors.Daniel Heller-Roazen, \\"Tradition's Destruction: On the Library of Alexandria\\" October, 100, Obsolescence (Spring 2002:133-1530 esp. p. 140. The Musaeum continued as an institution in the Roman period when Strabo gave his description of it, and according to Suetonius,Suetonius, Claudius, 42 the emperor Claudius added an additional building.Edward Jay Watts, (2008), City and School in Late Antique Athens and Alexandria, page 147. University of California Press Under the emperors, membership of the Musaeum was awarded to prominent scholars and statesmen, often as a reward to supporters of the emperor.Edward Jay Watts, (2008), City and School in Late Antique Athens and Alexandria, page 148. University of California Press Emperor Caracalla suppressed the Musaeum in 216,Butler, Alfred, The Arab Conquest of Egypt ‚Äì And the Last Thirty Years of the Roman Dominion, p. 411. perhaps as a temporary measure. By this time, the center of learning in Alexandria had already moved to the Serapeum. Destruction The last known references to Musaeum membership occur in the 260s.Edward Jay Watts, (2008), City and School in Late Antique Athens and Alexandria, page 150. University of California Press The Bruchion, the section of Alexandria that included the Musaeum, was probably destroyed by fire on the orders of Emperor Aurelian in 272, although we do not know for sure whether it still existed in 272, the area having already been set ablaze during the occupation by Julius Caesar. Scattered references in later sources suggest that a Musaeum was reestablished in the 4th century on a different site, but little is known about this later organisation and it is unlikely to have had the resources of its predecessor. The mathematician Theon (ca. 335 - ca. 405), father of Hypatia, is described in the tenth century Suda as \\"the man from the Mouseion.\\" It is not known what connection he actually had with the Musaeum. Zacharias Rhetor and Aeneas of Gaza both speak of a physical space known as the \\"Mouseion\\" in the later 5th century. Legacy This original Musaeum or Institution of the Muses was the source for the modern usage of the word museum. In early modern France, it denoted as much a community of scholars brought together under one roof as it did the collections themselves. French and English writers referred to these collections as a \\"cabinet\\" as in \\"a cabinet of curiosities.\\" A catalogue of the 17th century collection of John Tradescant the Elder and his son John Tradescant the Younger was the founding core of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. It was published as Musaeum Tradescantianum: or, a Collection of Rarities. Preserved at South-Lambeth near London by John Tradescant, 1656.

The group takes its name from a fictional lodge that Laurel and Hardy belonged to in the 1933 film Sons of the Desert. In 1964, three years after the book Mr. Laurel and Mr. Hardy by John McCabe was published, McCabe formed a small group of Laurel and Hardy admirers, including actor Orson Bean, cartoonist Al Kilgore, TV personality Chuck McCann, and John Municino. McCabe created a mock-serious ‚Äúconstitution‚Äù that satirized the formalities of many social organizations. Stan Laurel endorsed and humorously revised the document; he suggested that members might wear a fez or blazer patch with the motto \\"Two Minds Without a Single Thought\\". Founding member Kilgore created a logo with the motto in Latin (in the spirit of Laurel‚Äôs dictum that the organization should have ‚Äúa half-assed dignity‚Äù about it) as Duae tabulae rasae in quibus nihil scriptum est (literally: \\"Two blank slates on which nothing has been written\\"). The first public Sons of the Desert meeting was held in New York City in 1965, shortly after Stan Laurel's death. McCabe's group quickly inspired chapters in other United States cities, and then in the United Kingdom and other countries. By 1971, there were 23 chapters. In keeping with the tongue-in- cheek ‚Äúdesert‚Äù theme, each local chapter of the society is called a ‚Äútent,‚Äù and each tent is named after one of the Laurel and Hardy films and designated with an \\"Oasis number\\" (e.g., Chicago is Oasis #10). There are more than 100 active \\"tents\\" worldwide,WayOutWest.org listing of active tents as of July 2019, archived at the Wayback Machine mostly in the United States and United Kingdom. Members meet up regularly to enjoy Laurel and Hardy movies in an informal atmosphere. Many chapters formed in the 1960s are still active today. In addition to local and regional meetings, the Sons of the Desert organization has held international conventions every two years since 1978. Most have been located in the United States but some have been held in the United Kingdom and other countries. Actors and technicians who worked with Laurel and Hardy have been frequent guests, and rare films and memorabilia are exhibited. The Sons organization has been profiled periodically in media outlets, usually in a newsworthy context (as when long-lost films have been discovered). In 1971 and again in 2020, the Saturday Evening Post magazine profiled the organization. In 1974 the British Broadcasting Corporation featured the Sons in its documentary film Cuckoo. NBC's whimsical reality show Real People brought the Sons to a national audience in 1980. The CBN cable- television network scheduled a Laurel & Hardy movie marathon and invited Sons members from across America to take part in the live, national broadcast. A documentary film about the Sons was produced in 1987 by Alexander Marshall: Revenge of the Sons of the Desert is a featurette showing the international membership at one of its conventions, with commentary by celebrity guests. An Emmy Award winner, the film is included in the DVD set The Laurel & Hardy Collection Volume One (released in 2006). The Michigan tent also started a helper group named after the Laurel and Hardy short Brats, which is composed of child members.

It is used in both Saab 9-3 and Opel Vectra vehicles, and is available with 150, 175 and engines. It will also be used for a flexifuel version starting production spring 2007. Saab Trionic T8 has been developed by Saab and is a very advanced engine management system. The Engine Control Module (ECM) is used principally to regulated the air mass, fuel and ignition timing.  Functionality  Trionic monitors ionization rates at each spark plug to individually control and adjust the combustion process for each cylinder. Other primary functions are: * Ignition timing * Fuel injection * Turbo boost pressure * Air mass measurement * Throttle Throttle regulation Trionic 8 calculates how much power the driver wants as early as possible to avoid turbo kick or lag, therefore making driving smooth. As the driver depresses the accelerator pedal, it acts on a pedal position sensor integrated in the pedal bracket. This information, in the form of a voltage, is connected to the ECM which converts the voltage value to a torque request from the driver. The torque request is then processed by the ECM with regard to current operating conditions and limitations. The result is an air mass request to achieve the torque requested by the ECM. The driver's requested torque can be higher than that requested by ECM when, for example: * Maximum engine torque at the current operating point has already been attained * The traction control system (TCS) intervenes * the knock control system intervenes The ECM regulates the throttle area (opening angle) together with the turbo wastegate so that the correct torque is attained, i.e. air mass per combustion. Fuel injection is sequential and regulated with air mass per combustion and engine speed as parameters. ;Advantages This system has the following advantages: * Turbocharger delay can be almost eliminated * Exhaust emissions are reduced during changes in load * Idle speed control is integrated * Load compensation is possible over the entire load and engine speed range * Efficient engine torque limitation is achieved over the entire load and engine speed range * Cruise control can easily be integrated into the system Ignition Ignition takes place with individual ignition coils placed on the respective spark plug. The spark plugs, together with the ignition coils and combustion detection module (CDM), are used to detect combustion and possible knocking. This means there is no need for a camshaft position sensor or separate knock sensor. Comparison with Trionic T7 Compared with the earlier Trionic T7, the following functions are new: ;Throttle body actuator (604) * Contains throttle position sensor and throttle motor with associated reduction gear. * The throttle body is spherical to improve the throttle area control with low loads. * No mechanical limp-home function as with T7. ;Accelerator position sensor (379) * Integrated in accelerator pedal bracket. ;Ignition coil with integrated power module (320) * Separate inductive ignition coils with ionization current measurement. * Power stage integrated in ignition coils ;Combustion Detection Module (740) * Combustion Detection Module (CDM) processes the ion current signal from the ignition coils first. * Provides ECM with information on combustion quality and possible knocking. ; Exhaust temperature sensor (602) * Measures temperature of exhaust gases after catalytic converter. * Used as enable criteria for catalytic converter diagnosis. ;Pressure sensor, atmospheric pressure (539) * New model located on engine instead of integrated in control module. * Same function as in earlier Trionic T7 system. ;Power steering fluid pressure switch (739) * Informs ECM when power steering servo pressure exceeds 17 bar. * Used for idle speed compensation. ;Level monitor, engine oil (243) * Informs ECM when oil level is low. * Used for indication on Saab Information Display (SID). ;Level sensor, fuel (46) * Informs ECM of current fuel level. * Used for certain diagnoses and trip computer, and for indicating fuel level on main instrument unit (MIU). ;Relay, start relay (517) * Controlled by ECM. ;Radiator fan control * Radiator fan logic is in ECM that also activates the radiator fan relays. * Radiator fan can run in four different modes. ;Generator (2) * ECM controls whether the generator should charge or not. * Used to engage generator charging with a certain delay after starting and in certain cases disengage generator charging. In this case, the engine load will be reduced temporarily when idling to stabilise the idling speed. ;Pressure monitor, engine oil (44) * Informs ECM when oil pressure is low. * Used for indicating on MIU and SID. ;Pressure sensor, A/C (620) * Informs ECM of current pressure on the A/C system high pressure side. * Used for load compensating, radiator fan operation and is sent out as a bus message to be used by ACC. Tuning Due to countermeasures implemented by Saab to protect their intellectual property, Trionic 8 systems are more difficult to reprogram. Despite those countermeasures, some tuning companies do offer performance-tuned Trionic 8 maps.

The BD-5 has a small, streamlined fuselage holding its semi-reclined pilot under a large canopy, with the engine installed in a compartment in the middle of the fuselage, and a propeller-driving engine - or jet engine in the BD-5J variant - mounted immediately to the rear of the cockpit. The combination of fighter-like looks and relatively low cost led to the BD-5 selling over 5,000 kits or plans, with approximately 12,000 orders being taken for a proposed factory-built, FAA-certified version.Winchester 2005, p. 28. However, few of the kit versions were actually completed due to the company's bankruptcy in the mid-1970s, and none of the factory built \\"D\\" models were produced, as a result of the failure to find a reliable engine for the design. In total, only a few hundred BD-5 kits were completed, although many of these are still airworthy today. The BD-5J version holds the record for the world's lightest jet aircraft, weighing only .  Design and development =The Micro concept Development of the \\"Micro\\" dates back as early as 1967, when Jim Bede was inspired by the Schleicher ASW 15. Along with his chief designer, Paul Griffin, they make preliminary designs of what would become the BD-5. At the time, however, Bede was working on the Bede BD-4. Serious work on the Micro started in 1970, with construction of the prototype starting in earnest late that year. While the BD-4 was fairly conventional looking, the Micro was a radical design. It is an extremely small one-seat design that looked more like a jet fighter than a typical general aviation aircraft, with the pilot sitting in a semi-reclined position under a large fighter-like plexiglas canopy only inches above the pilot's head. Behind the cockpit was a compartment housing a two-cylinder air-cooled piston engine driving a pusher propeller. For improved performance the aircraft featured both a V-tail and retractable landing gear in order to reduce drag. Calculated drag was so low that split flaps and spoilers were added to the wing in order to improve deceleration for landing. This was apparently the first application of spoilers on a light aircraft.Aleith 1973, p. 128. The low drag implied excellent performance; with the 40 hp engine it was expected to reach \\"nearly\\" , while the larger engine allowed it to cruise at 200 mph with the \\"B\\" wing, and have 1,215 miles range. With the shorter \\"A\\" wing, , it would be fully aerobatic and have a slightly higher top speed. Builders could optionally buy both wings, switching them in about 10 minutes. In addition to being easy to fly, the BD-5 was also intended to be easy to build and own. The fuselage was constructed primarily from fiberglass panels over an aluminum frame, reducing construction time to only a few hundred hours. Although the early designs required some welding in the landing gear area, it was planned that this would be removed in the kit versions, so construction would require no special tooling or skills.Noland 1974, p. 40. Even the cost of operation would be extremely low, offering fuel efficiency of With the wings removed, the aircraft could be packed into a small custom trailer, allowing it to be towed away by car for storage in a garage, and from there to any suitable flat area for takeoff.\\"BD-5.\\" bd5.com. Retrieved: November 22, 2010. Bede published an information booklet about the BD-5 in November 1970. Several very positive magazine articles appeared at this point. The October 1971 issue of Science & Mechanics had the BD-5 on the cover, listing the price as $1,950. The associated article showed the construction of the original prototype, with numerous claims about how easy it was to construct. The August 1973 issue of Popular Science also covered the aircraft, although it listed the price at $2,965 with the 40 hp engine.Harvey, Frank.At Last...the Real 200-mph, 38-mpg, $2965, BD-5! Popular Science, August 1973, pp. 80‚Äì83, 122. The \\"miniature fighter\\" generated intense demand. As one author put it, \\"Even before the plane first left the ground, thoughts of flying the sleek, bullet-shaped aircraft with its pusher prop stimulated the imagination of nearly everyone who had heard of the program.\\" On February 24, 1971, the first $200 deposit to reserve a \\"place in line\\" to receive a kit was accepted, with the target shipping date being May 24, 1972.\\"Bede BD-5B.\\" Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum. Retrieved: June 20, 2007. By August 1971, 800 deposits had been taken, even though the first BD-5 prototype had yet to complete high-speed taxi tests. By the end of the year, the company had taken over 4,300 orders, making it one of the most popular general aircraft projects in modern history.  Flight testing  N500BD = The prototype, N500BD, flew briefly on September 12, 1971, powered by a Polaris Industries snowmobile engine. This was sixteen months after deposits had been taken, which led to some griping in the press. The stability of the aircraft with the original V-tail was marginal at best and clearly needed a redesign. With the original fibreglass fuselage, this was a time-consuming process, so the decision was made to switch to an all-metal fuselage with the components incorporating compound curves produced using hydroformed aircraft-grade aluminum alloy. These could be modified with relative ease during the testing cycle. It also made economic sense as the orders rolled in, the $30,000 in tooling would be spread over what was now a large order book. By December 1971, the tooling for the new fuselage was in development. The aircraft now featured a longer, more pointed nose, whereas the N500BD had been patterned on the ASW 15 and had a more rounded, egg-like shaping at the front. While this work was in progress, Bede continued to experiment with modifications to the empennage, eventually abandoning the V-tail for a more conventional rudder and horizontal stabilizer layout with highly swept surfaces. Further testing on N500BD showed flow interference between the horizontal surfaces and the propeller, and the stabilizer was raised six inches to correct it, placing it about midway up the rear fuselage. = N501BD = The first example of the new fuselage arrived in March 1972, and was fitted with a new Kiekhaefer Aeromarine engine Bede had seen at the Oshkosh Airshow in 1971. Finished as N501BD, numerous small delays prevented it from flying until July 11, 1972. These flights demonstrated continued problems with the pitch stability; after briefly considering an all-flying stabilator, it was again redesigned with more area and less sweep, becoming much more conventional in layout.Noland 1973, p. 26. The program was now far too large for Bede to handle alone. In March 1972, he hired Burt Rutan to head the flight test department, who was soon joined by Les Berven as chief test pilot. They took over development, giving Bede more time to work on business issues. This was proving difficult enough, as Kiekhaefer and Bede could not reach an agreement about deliveries, forcing him to change to a similar 40 hp Hirth Motoren design, then selecting a larger 55 hp Hirth, instead. Several additional problems turned up during testing. Stick forces were very low, but this was easily addressed by making the servo tabs 50% larger. A more worrying development was that the engines all had problems with mixture due to changes in engine speed or load, which led to rough engine operation. In August, while Bede was demonstrating the BD-5 (N501BD) to the FAA in order to receive permission to fly at Oshkosh, the engine seized. On its deadstick landing, the aircraft overran the runway, buckling the nose gear. Incorrect mixture was identified as the cause of a second wreck of N501BD, in September 1972, when the mixture control broke and Berven had to execute another forced landing. This landing resulted in damage to all the gear and the fuselage as well. Since N502BD would be ready in two months, they decided not to repair N501BD, and it ended testing after about 30 hours of flight time. = N502BD = N502BD ran into problems of its own. Early models used a variable speed belt drive system to transfer power from the engine to the propeller shaft. This was removed from N502BD and it suddenly began exhibiting a serious vibration problem during taxi tests. Experts were called in,Hessenaur, Donald P. \\"Propeller Drive Systems and Torsional Vibration\\". bugatti100p.com. Retrieved June 9, 2013. and a freewheel clutch and additional bearings added to correct the problem, but it was not until March 26, 1973 that N502BD flew. From then on the test program seemed to go more smoothly,Weeghman 1972, p. 41. although this aircraft also suffered two dead stick landings, one from a pinched fuel line occurred while the plane was being observed by the Popular Science author, and another due to metal in a new engine's cylinder. By the time the test program neared its conclusion, the aircraft had undergone major changes. One victim of the program was the shorter \\"A\\" wing, which calculations showed would only improve performance at speeds very close to Vmax (the highest available speed). Flight testing also showed the stall speed with the smaller wing was decidedly high. Split flaps and spoilers had also disappeared. The canopy and cockpit dimensions had changed, the aircraft had new landing gear systems, and the tail was completely new. Estimated top speed was also reduced 10%. The biggest change, however, was the engine. The original plans to use a 40 hp model proved to be decidedly underpowered, although they were still offered for a time. It was the need for more power that would fit into the very small engine bay that demanded the use of a high-revving two-stroke engine, and few examples of such a design in the desired power class were available. Additionally, two-stroke engines are very smooth running at high RPM, but have real problems running smoothly at low RPM. Even after months of effort, the Hirth designs showed rough running and high minimum power outputs when idled. Two-strokes also have high fuel consumption, and it was expected that the larger engines would burn between 4.5 and 5.5 gallons per hour. By this point, it seemed the basic design was complete, and Bede turned his attention to other projects. One was the jet-powered BD-5J, which boosted performance to . There was an attempt to sidestep the engine problem with the BD-5S glider (S for Sailplane), with lengthened wings and no engine, which prompted Air Progress magazine to sarcastically note, \\"At last, a BD-5 with no engine problems.\\" This glider version did not fly well and the project was scrapped. Some work on a BD-6 was also carried out, essentially a shrunk BD-4 single-seater. There was some criticism that Bede should have attended to the basic BD-5 rather than move on to these other projects. Bede also decided to seek FAA certification of the BD-5D as a production aircraft and sell it complete, and began taking $600 deposits for this model. Deliveries begin By the middle of 1973 the basic design was complete and the tooling set up for production. Now over two and a half years after the deposits started being taken, the engines were the only part holding up deliveries, so Bede offered to ship the kit with the engine to follow. This was a fairly attractive option; it meant the builder could get to work and hopefully complete the airframe by the time the engine arrived, at that point expected in September 1973. Many builders took the company up on the offer, only to receive incomplete kits and plans.Wirth, Wayne. \\"Building the BD-5?\\" Popular Science, August 1974, p. 6. Initially, all three Hirth engines were offered; builders could keep the 40 hp engine, or \\"trade up\\" to 55 hp or . The latter, which Bede had developed with Hirth, was now considered the baseline engine for the aircraft; when equipped with the original 40 hp the aircraft proved to be underpowered. In a late 1973 newsletter to prospective owners, Bede suggested the 70 hp model and discouraged use of the smaller engines.\\"A Special Note to All BD-5 Builders.\\" Bede Aircraft. Retrieved: June 18, 2007. Prices had risen throughout the 30 months since deposits were first taken. Originally priced at $1,799, the base price was raised to $2,599 with the 55 hp Hirth, and owners were offered a \\"trade up\\" for the difference in price if they had ordered the aircraft with the original 40 hp engine. When 1974 came, engines were still not being delivered in sufficient numbers, although some started to arrive early that year. At that point, unexpectedly, Hirth went bankrupt after about 500 engines had shipped. Once again, the BD-5 lacked a suitable engine, but this time the search for a replacement ended with a Zenoah design from Japan. Development of this engine was lengthy, and in the end it would not be certified for export until 1978, although this was not anticipated at the time.Weeghman 1974, p. 30. In the meantime, Bede came up with another novel solution to the problems of converting pilots to the new aircraft. They took an engine-less example and bolted it to the front of a pickup truck on a trapeze, attaching the pilot's throttle control to the truck's. Pilots could test fly the aircraft without danger - if a problem developed the driver of the truck simply hit the brakes.Kocivar, Ben. \\"Flying the hot BD-5 tethered to a truck.\\" Popular Science, August 1974, p. 69.  Deliveries end, Bede bankruptcy  After more than 5,100 kits had been delivered to prospective builders, the kits stopped shipping as well. Although the company was effectively bankrupt at this point, work on the BD-5D continued for some time. The bankruptcy became official in 1979, by which point the BD-5 project was long dead. During the bankruptcy proceedings, it was learned that the money ostensibly being used to build kits was instead being spent on a variety of other projects. As a result, Bede entered a consent decree with the FTC to no longer accept deposits on aircraft for a period of 10 years.Bede Aircraft Inc. et al. 92 F.T.C. 449. BD-5B powered by a Subaru EA-81 engine Many owners stored, abandoned, or sold their incomplete kits, but a few hundred diehard builders finished them with a variety of engines, with installations designed by third parties and former Bede Aircraft dealers. Having to hunt for an engine was only one problem. The time to build the aircraft was much longer than quoted; original estimates from the company put it at 600 to 800 hours but users estimated it to be as much as 3,500 hours. Some of this was due to the need to fit their selected engine into an airframe designed for the Hirth, which was no longer available. Additionally, the construction techniques had improved somewhat since early Bede designs, but fastening the panels still required drilling, deburring, dimpling, drilling again and deburring again for each rivet. With the original mixed- construction design this would not have been as much of a task, but with the all-metal version this was extremely time-consuming. While Bede claimed the aircraft could be put together by anyone in a garage, builders generally agree that doing so without proper construction techniques could result in a potentially dangerous aircraft. One way to overcome that issue is to use a set of properly laid-out jigs to align and drill the pilot holes for the airframe, wings and other components. For all of these reasons, it was some time before completed BD-5s started to appear.Davisson 1974, p. 25. Additionally, some of the kits were shipped with missing parts, adding to the confusion.Karnes, Ed. \\"A few words about third-party services for the BD-5.\\" bd5.com. Retrieved June 20, 2007. All of this led to a rash of kits being sold for fire sale prices, although this did allow the builders to complete kits at bargain prices. Flying starts Although Bede had suggested using the B wings, the earliest kits shipped only with the short \\"A\\" wings. All four examples completed with these wings crashed on their first flight, three on takeoff, one on landing. In three of the four crashes, the pilots were killed. Of the first 25 aircraft completed, with both the \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" wings, 14 crashed with 9 fatalities.Mackerodt, Fred. \\"BD-5\\" The First Do-It-Yourself Jet.\\" Popular Mechanics, December 1989. Even when examples with the \\"B\\" wings were completed, the safety record did not improve greatly. Several crashes in the BD-5B were found to have taken place due to engine failure on takeoff, both due to the mix of \\"oddball\\" engines as well as endemic cooling problems.Berthe, Chuck and Dick VanGrunsven. \\"Flight Testing of Homebuilt Aircraft.\\" 35th The Society of Experimental Test Pilots (SETP) Symposium, October 30, 2008. Retrieved: November 22, 2010. The reason this is such an issue with the BD-5 is twofold - the high line of thrust means an engine failure immediately results in an unexpected (for most pilots) nose-up attitude change. Pilots who fail to fly the aircraft first and then attempt to restart the engine inevitably stall, with the associated consequences. This was aggravated by the fact the original wing had a very sharp stall with little warning and a nasty tendency to snap roll.Anderson, Seth. \\"A Critique of the BD-5 Concept: Part II.\\" EAA's Sport Aviation Magazine, September 1986, pp. 43‚Äì47. To make matters worse, a documented manufacturing error in some wing skins delivered to kit builders exacerbated the problem. A rather small center of gravity range added to the problems of properly trimming the aircraft.  Further developments  With the demise of the Bede Aircraft Company, the BD-5 entered a sort of limbo while builders completed their kits. The early safety problems and the challenge of adapting a suitable engine exacerbated delays. Over the next few years, however, solutions to most of these problems arrived in one form or another. Many other changes have also been incorporated to improve the original design. The problem of finding a suitable engine with yet weighing under was a serious problem in the 1970s, but today there are a number of off-the-shelf designs in this class. The widely available Rotax 582 is a engine weighing in standard configuration, almost tailor-made for the BD-5. Other engines successfully used in BD-5s include the Subaru EA-81, Honda EB1 & EB2 (with and without turbocharging), Hirth 2706, AMW 225-3 and 2SI 808.

Problems with the abrupt stall were mostly addressed by Harry Riblett, an airfoil designer who documented a procedure to apply a slight reprofile of the wing root airfoil, which softened the stall response of the aircraft without any significant performance degradation.Riblett, Harry. \\"An Upper Surface Wing Re-Profile for the BD-5.\\" bd5.com. Retrieved: June 20, 2007. The reprofile presents other unique problems, associated with the way it is applied to the wing upper surface, essentially glueing foam to the aluminum skin and covering with fiberglass. Similarly, the small center-of-gravity range has since been addressed with stretch kits for the fuselage. Several companies were formed to help builders complete their kits, and many of the aftermarket modifications were worked into these services. , BD-Micro Technologies of Siletz, Oregon continues to offer kit building support, including new-build kits featuring (optionally) all of these modifications and powered by a Rotax 582 or Hirth 2706 two-stroke engine, and even the BD-5T, a turboprop version using a TRS-18 turbine powering a mechanically-controlled variable-pitch propeller.Bayerl, Robby and Martin Berkemeier et al.

The result was the sleek BD-5J (also known as the \\"Acrostar Jet \\"http://www.maxim.com/entertainment/movies/article/fly-bond- octopussy%E2%80%99s-jet), a aircraft. The design used the Sermel TRS-18-046 turbojet which produced thrust and was used on a Caproni certified motorglider design. The original engines were produced under license by Ames Industrial in the USA. The wing was modified to an \\"intermediate\\" size between the original A and B wings, with a span.BD-5J from \\"Octopussy\\" Bob Bishop purchased 20 BD-5J kits as soon as they had appeared, and many of the flying examples started life in this batch of 20. Versions from the original batch became a popular airshow fixture. Throughout the 1980s and until 1991, Coors flew two of them as the \\"Silver Bullets\\". Budweiser also had a BD-5J called the Bud Light Jet, but that contract has long expired and the aircraft was lost as a result of an engine compartment fire from which Bishop successfully bailed out. The aircraft also appeared in the opening sequence of the James Bond film Octopussy.Winchester 2005, p. 28. Many of these aircraft have since been involved in crashes. The loss of the Bud Light Jet was caused by an incorrectly specified fuel flow sending unit which burst in mid-flight and caused fuel to be sprayed directly into the engine compartment. The fuel ignited when it came in contact with the hot components of the engine, forcing the pilot to trade speed for altitude, climb, and bail out. The aircraft then went into a flat spin and pancaked into the ground, but was sufficiently intact to allow the cause of the fire to be determined relatively quickly. On June 16, 2006, while practicing for an air show at Carp Airport in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, Scott Manning fatally crashed in his \\"Stinger Jet,\\" one of the last BD-5Js to remain on the airshow circuit. The Transportation Safety Board of Canada report assigned probable cause of the wreck to the incorrect installation of the right wing, which caused the flap on that wing to suddenly retract in flight and create a \\"split flap\\" condition. The aircraft rolled to the right and Manning was unable to recover in time.\\"Loss of Control and Collision with Terrain, Bede BD-5J C-GBDV.\\" Transportation Safety Board of Canada, Aviation Investigation Report A06O0141, June 16, 2006.Jim√©nez, Juan. \\"Airshow pilot lost in Ottawa BD-5 jet accident.\\" Aero-News.Net, June 16, 2006.

He was, with Charles Wheatstone, the co-inventor of the Cooke- Wheatstone electrical telegraph, which was patented in May 1837. Together with John Lewis Ricardo he founded the Electric Telegraph Company, the world's first public telegraph company, in 1846. He was knighted in 1869. Life He was born at Ealing, Middlesex; his William Cooke father was a surgeon there, and later was appointed professor of anatomy at the University of Durham. He was educated at Durham School and at the University of Edinburgh, and at the age of 20 entered the Indian Army. After five years' service in India Cooke returned home; then studied medicine in Paris, and at Heidelberg under Georg Wilhelm Munke. In 1836 he saw electric telegraphy, then only experimental: Munke had illustrated his lectures with a telegraphic apparatus on the principle introduced by Pavel Schilling in 1835. Cooke decided to put the invention into practical operation with the railway systems; and gave up medicine. Early in 1837 Cooke returned to England, with introductions to Michael Faraday and Peter Mark Roget. Through them he was introduced to Charles Wheatstone, who in 1834 gave the Royal Society an account of experiments on the velocity of electricity. Cooke had already constructed a system of telegraphing with three needles on Schilling's principle, and made designs for a mechanical alarm. He had also made some progress in negotiating with the Liverpool and Manchester Railway Company for the use of his telegraphs. Cooke and Wheatstone went into partnership in May 1837; Cooke handled the business side. Wheatstone and Cooke's first patent was taken out within a month and was \\"for improvements in giving signals and sounding alarms in distant places by means of electric currents transmitted through electric circuits\\". Cooke now tested the invention, with the London and Blackwall Railway, the London and Birmingham Railway, and the Great Western Railway companies, successively allowing the use of their lines for the experiment. A five needle model of telegraph was given up as too expensive. In 1838 an improvement reduced the number of needles to two, and a patent for this was taken out by Cooke and Wheatstone. Before a parliamentary committee on railways in 1840, Wheatstone stated that he had, with Cooke, obtained a new patent for a telegraphic arrangement; the new apparatus required only a single pair of wires. But the telegraph was still too costly for general purposes. In 1845, however, Cooke and Wheatstone succeeded in producing the single needle apparatus, which they patented, and from that time the electric telegraph became a practical instrument, soon adopted on all the railway lines of the country. In the meantime a priority dispute arose between Cooke and Wheatstone. An arrangement was come to in 1843 by which several patents were assigned to Cooke, with the reservation of a mileage royalty to Wheatstone; and in 1846 the Electric Telegraph Company was formed in conjunction with Cooke, the company paying ¬£120,000 for Cooke and Wheatstone's earlier patents. Cooke later tried to obtain an extension of the original patents, but the judicial committee of the Privy Council decided that Cooke and Wheatstone had been sufficiently remunerated. The Albert Medal of the Royal Society of Arts was awarded on equal terms to Cooke and Wheatstone in 1867; and two years later Cooke was knighted, Wheatstone having had the same honour conferred upon him the year before. A civil list pension was granted to Cooke in 1871. He died on 25 June 1879.

Life He was born at Huttenried in Bavaria. Orphaned at the age of four, he was reared by an uncle at Augsburg, who finally sent him to the University of Dillingen, where he studied under Sailer, Zimmer, and Weber. There he laid the foundation of the modest piety by which his whole life was distinguished. This cites his Life by J. Gossner (1831). He had followed the extreme practices of asceticism as a penance for sin, all to no avail, as he believed, and then developed a doctrine of salvation by faith which came very near to pure Lutheranism. This he preached with great effect. After serving as priest in several Bavarian towns, he was driven from Bavaria by the opposition of the ecclesiastical authorities and other priests. He made his way in 1799 to Linz in Austria, where he was welcomed by Bishop Gall, and set to work first at Leonding and then at Waldneukirchen, becoming in 1806 pastor at Gallneukirchen. His pietistic movement won considerable way among the Catholic laity, and even attracted some fifty or sixty priests. The death of Gall and other powerful friends, however, exposed him to bitter enmity and persecution from about 1812, and he had to answer endless accusations in the consistorial courts. His enemies followed him when he returned to Bavaria, but in 1817 the Prussian government appointed him to a professorship at D√ºsseldorf, and in 1819 gave him the pastorate at Sayn near Neuwied. He died in 1825. His autobiography was edited by Johannes Gossner, Leipzig, 1831, Eng. transl., London, 1836, who also issued two volumes of his sermons Berlin, 1830.

It was invented by the French cryptographer Felix Delastelle. The technique encrypts pairs of letters (digraphs), and thus falls into a category of ciphers known as polygraphic substitution ciphers. This adds significant strength to the encryption when compared with monographic substitution ciphers which operate on single characters. The use of digraphs makes the four-square technique less susceptible to frequency analysis attacks, as the analysis must be done on 676 possible digraphs rather than just 26 for monographic substitution. The frequency analysis of digraphs is possible, but considerably more difficult - and it generally requires a much larger ciphertext in order to be useful.  Using four-square  The four-square cipher uses four 5 by 5 (5x5) matrices arranged in a square. Each of the 5 by 5 matrices contains the letters of the alphabet (usually omitting \\"Q\\" or putting both \\"I\\" and \\"J\\" in the same location to reduce the alphabet to fit). In general, the upper-left and lower- right matrices are the \\"plaintext squares\\" and each contain a standard alphabet. The upper-right and lower-left squares are the \\"ciphertext squares\\" and contain a mixed alphabetic sequence. To generate the ciphertext squares, one would first fill in the spaces in the matrix with the letters of a keyword or phrase (dropping any duplicate letters), then fill the remaining spaces with the rest of the letters of the alphabet in order (again omitting \\"Q\\" to reduce the alphabet to fit). The key can be written in the top rows of the table, from left to right, or in some other pattern, such as a spiral beginning in the upper-left-hand corner and ending in the center. The keyword together with the conventions for filling in the 5 by 5 table constitute the cipher key. The four-square algorithm allows for two separate keys, one for each of the two ciphertext matrices. As an example, here are the four-square matrices for the keywords \\"example\\" and \\"keyword.\\" The plaintext matrices are in lowercase and the ciphertext matrices are in caps to make this example visually more simple: a b c d e E X A M P f g h i j L B C D F k l m n o G H I J K p r s t u N O R S T v w x y z U V W Y Z K E Y W O a b c d e R D A B C f g h i j F G H I J k l m n o L M N P S p r s t u T U V X Z v w x y z  Algorithm  To encrypt a message, one would follow these steps: * Split the payload message into digraphs. (HELLO WORLD becomes HE LL OW OR LD) * Find the first letter in the digraph in the upper-left plaintext matrix. a b c d e E X A M P f g h i j L B C D F k l m n o G H I J K p r s t u N O R S T v w x y z U V W Y Z K E Y W O a b c d e R D A B C f g h i j F G H I J k l m n o L M N P S p r s t u T U V X Z v w x y z * Find the second letter in the digraph in the lower-right plaintext matrix. a b c d e E X A M P f g h i j L B C D F k l m n o G H I J K p r s t u N O R S T v w x y z U V W Y Z K E Y W O a b c d e R D A B C f g h i j F G H I J k l m n o L M N P S p r s t u T U V X Z v w x y z * The first letter of the encrypted digraph is in the same row as the first plaintext letter and the same column as the second plaintext letter. It is therefore in the upper-right ciphertext matrix. a b c d e E X A M P f g h i j L B C D F k l m n o G H I J K p r s t u N O R S T v w x y z U V W Y Z K E Y W O a b c d e R D A B C f g h i j F G H I J k l m n o L M N P S p r s t u T U V X Z v w x y z * The second letter of the encrypted digraph is in the same row as the second plaintext letter and the same column as the first plaintext letter. It is therefore in the lower-left ciphertext matrix. a b c d e E X A M P f g h i j L B C D F k l m n o G H I J K p r s t u N O R S T v w x y z U V W Y Z K E Y W O a b c d e R D A B C f g h i j F G H I J k l m n o L M N P S p r s t u T U V X Z v w x y z Using the four-square example given above, we can encrypt the following plaintext: Plaintext: he lp me ob iw an ke no bi Ciphertext: FY GM KY HO BX MF KK KI MD Here is the four-square written out again but blanking all of the values that aren't used for encrypting the first digraph \\"he\\" into \\"FY\\" \\\\- - - - - - - - - - \\\\- - h - - - - - - F \\\\- - - - - - - - - - \\\\- - - - - - - - - - \\\\- - - - - - - - - - \\\\- - Y - - - - - - e \\\\- - - - - - - - - - \\\\- - - - - - - - - - \\\\- - - - - - - - - - \\\\- - - - - - - - - - As can be seen clearly, the method of encryption simply involves finding the other two corners of a rectangle defined by the two letters in the plaintext digraph. The encrypted digraph is simply the letters at the other two corners, with the upper-right letter coming first. Decryption works the same way, but in reverse. The ciphertext digraph is split with the first character going into the upper-right matrix and the second character going into the lower-left matrix. The other corners of the rectangle are then located. These represent the plaintext digraph with the upper-left matrix component coming first.  Four-square cryptanalysis  Like most pre-modern era ciphers, the four-square cipher can be easily cracked if there is enough text. Obtaining the key is relatively straightforward if both plaintext and ciphertext are known. When only the ciphertext is known, brute force cryptanalysis of the cipher involves searching through the key space for matches between the frequency of occurrence of digrams (pairs of letters) and the known frequency of occurrence of digrams in the assumed language of the original message. Cryptanalysis of four-square generally involves pattern matching on repeated monographs. This is only the case when the two plaintext matrices are known. A four-square encipherment usually uses standard alphabets in these matrices but it is not a requirement. If this is the case, then certain words will always produce single-letter ciphertext repeats. For instance, the word MI LI TA RY will always produce the same ciphertext letter in the first and third positions regardless of the keywords used. Patterns like these can be cataloged and matched against single-letter repeats in the ciphertext. Candidate plaintext can then be inserted in an attempt to uncover the ciphertext matrices. Unlike the Playfair cipher, a four-square cipher will not show reversed ciphertext digraphs for reversed plaintext digraphs (e.g. the digraphs AB BA would encrypt to some pattern XY YX in Playfair, but not in four-square). This, of course, is only true if the two keywords are different. Another difference between four-square and Playfair which makes four-square a stronger encryption is the fact that double letter digraphs will occur in four-square ciphertext. By all measures, four-square is a stronger system for encrypting information than Playfair. However, it is more cumbersome because of its use of two keys, and, preparing the encryption/decryption sheet can be time consuming. Given that the increase in encryption strength afforded by four-square over Playfair is marginal and that both schemes are easily defeated if sufficient ciphertext is available, Playfair has become much more common. A good tutorial on reconstructing the key for a four-square cipher can be found in chapter 7, \\"Solution to Polygraphic Substitution Systems,\\" of Field Manual 34-40-2, produced by the United States Army.

Mysore is commonly described as the 'City of Palaces', and there are seven palaces including this one; however, 'Mysore Palace' refers specifically to this one within the Old fort. The land on which the palace now stands was originally known as puragiri (literally, citadel), and is now known as the Old Fort. Yaduraya built the first palace inside the Old Fort in the 14th century, which was demolished and constructed multiple times. The current structure was constructed between 1897 and 1912, after the Old Palace was burnt ablaze Mysore Palace is now one of the most famous tourist attractions in India, after the Taj Mahal, with more than 6 million annual visitors. Construction The last palace, now known as the Old Palace or the Wooden Palace, was burnt into ashes during the 1896 Dasara festivities. Maharaja Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV and his mother Maharani Kempananjammanni Devi, commissioned the British architect Henry Irwin to build a new palace. Meanwhile, the royal family stayed in the close by Jaganmohan Palace. The construction was overseen by B. P. Raghavulu Naidu, an executive engineer in the Mysore Palace division. He had conducted elaborate architectural studies during his visits to Delhi, Madras, and Calcutta, and these were used in planning for the new palace. The construction cost was placed at Rs 41,47,913 (around $30 million adjusted to inflation) and was completed in 1912.http://www.culturalindia.net/monuments/mysore-palace.html The palace was further expanded in around 1930 (including the addition of the present Public Durbar Hall wing) during the reign of Maharaja Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar. Although the construction was completed in 1912, the fort continued to be beautified and its inhabitants were slowly moved to the newer extensions built off the palace. Architecture The architectural style of domes of the palace is commonly described as Indo-Saracenic, with blends of the Hindu, Mughal, Rajput, and Gothic styles. It is a three-story stone structure with marble domes, and has a 145-foot five-story tower. The palace is surrounded by a large garden. The entrance gate and arch hold the emblem and coat of arms of the kingdom of Mysore, around which is written the kingdom's motto in Sanskrit: \\"‡§® ‡§¨‡§ø‡§≠‡•Ü‡§§‡§ø ‡§ï‡§¶‡§æ‡§ö‡§®\\" (never terrified).A The main complex is 245 Ft in length and also 156 Ft in width. There are fire extinguishing machines located in all parts of the palace in order to prevent any fires. The palace has three entrances: the East Gate (the front gate, opened only during the Dasara and for dignitaries), the South Entrance (for public), and the West Entrance (usually opened only during the Dasara). The three-story stone building of fine grey granite with deep pink marble domes has a facade with several expansive arches and two smaller ones flanking the central arch, which is supported by tall pillars. Above the central arch is a sculpture of Gajalakshmi, the Goddess of wealth, prosperity, fortune, and abundance with her elephants. There are three major exclusive temple buildings within the Old Fort, and about 18 inside the palace heart building. The palace was built adjacent to the even older Parakala Mutt headquarters, whose leaders have remained the rajagurus (royal teacher and guide) of Mysore kings. The kings of Mysore were devotees of Goddess Chamundi, hence the palace's facing the Chamundi Hills.Chamundi The palace houses two durbar halls (ceremonial meeting halls of the royal court) and incorporates an array of courtyards, gardens, and buildings.

It contains only butter, water, flour, and eggs. Instead of a raising agent, it employs high moisture content to create steam during cooking to puff the pastry. The pastry is used in many European and European-derived cuisines. History According to some cookbooks, a chef by the name of Pantarelli or Pantanelli invented the dough in 1540, seven years after he left Florence with Catherine de' Medici and her court. He used the dough to make a g√¢teau and named it . Over time, the recipe of the dough evolved, and the name changed to , which was used to make , small cakes made in the shape of a woman's breasts. Then, Avice, a in the eighteenth century, created what were then called choux buns. The name of the dough changed to , as Avice's buns resembled cabbages‚Äîchoux in French. From there, made modifications to the recipe, resulting in the recipe most commonly used now for profiteroles. Essential ingredients and manner of rising The ingredients for choux pastry are butter, water, flour and eggs. Like Yorkshire pudding or David Eyre's pancake, instead of a raising agent, it employs high moisture content to create steam during cooking to puff the pastry. The high moisture content is achieved by boiling the water and butter, then adding the flour. The mixture is cooked a few minutes longer, then cooled before adding enough eggs to achieve the desired consistency. The boiling step causes the starch in the flour to gel, allowing the incorporation of more water. Foods made with choux pastry This pastry is used to make profiteroles, , √©clairs, , French crullers, , St. Honor√© cake, Parisian gnocchi, dumplingsHenri-Paul Pellaprat, Jeremiah Tower, The Great Book of French Cuisine, 2012 and goug√®res. Choux pastry is usually baked but for beignets it is fried. In Spain and Latin America, churros are made of fried choux pastry, sugared and dipped in a thick hot chocolate for breakfast. In Italian cuisine, choux pastry is the base for zeppole di San Giuseppe which are cream-filled pastries eaten on March 19th for the feast of Saint Joseph. In Austrian cuisine, one variation of , a sweet apricot dumpling cooked in simmering water, uses choux pastry; in that case it does not puff, but remains relatively dense.

It debuted in Japan on January 27, 2005, in North America on March 14, 2005, in Europe on May 6, 2005, and in Australia on May 19, 2005. As of August 2007, the game sold 197,337 copies in Japan. Yoshi Touch & Go was produced by Takashi Tezuka and directed by Hiroyuki Kimura. It was one of the launch titles for the DS in Japan. The game was released on the Wii U Virtual Console in 2015. The game revolves around Yoshi and Baby Mario/Baby Luigi. Its graphical style and the cast of characters originate from Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island. The game heavily utilizes the DS's touch screen capabilities and makes use of the microphone as well. The challenge in the game comes from replaying the same modes over and over to get the best possible score, similar to the classic arcade games of the 1980s. Therefore, the difficulty of the game is based primarily on improving one's own skill. Gameplay The game begins with three different gameplay modes: \\"Score Attack\\", \\"Marathon\\", and the \\"multiplayer vs. mode\\". Additionally, the player can unlock \\"Time Attack\\" and \\"Challenge modes\\" by getting the high score in the \\"Score Attack\\" and \\"Marathon\\" modes. When the high score on the two new modes is achieved, the mini-game \\"Balloon Trip\\" is unlocked. There are two basic level types: a vertical level, where the player must lead Baby Mario through the sky safely to the ground; and a side-scrolling level, where the player takes control over different colored Yoshis, carrying Baby Mario on their back. As opposed to the earlier Yoshi games, in Yoshi Touch & Go, the player cannot take direct control over the characters. Instead, the Yoshis move from the left to the right automatically at a certain speed. However, the player can draw lines on the lower screen with the stylus, which creates clouds that will support a character. This attribute allows the creation of alternate routes to avoid enemies and obstacles. If the drawn clouds are impeding progress, they disappear by blowing into the microphone. Enemies can be dispatched by drawing circles on them, which puts most of them into a bubble. In the side-scrolling level, a Yoshi can make an egg out of fruits by leading them to its mouth. By tapping on the screen, the Yoshi will launch an egg in that direction, which is useful for defeating enemies or collecting coins and fruits. By tapping on a Yoshi himself, the player can make him jump, and tapping him again while he's in midair will cause him to do a flutter-kick jump. The Nintendo DS's two screens act as one tall screen, whereas the player can only create clouds on the lower one. However, by throwing eggs in the upper screen it is possible to collect coins or fruits from there. The wireless \\"multiplayer vs. mode\\" is an exception to this general layout, as only the lower screen shows the player's view, while the upper screen shows that of the enemy. In the multiplayer mode, the goal is to be faster than the opponent. By clearing out enemies on their own screen, the player can cause spiky obstacles to appear on the opponent's screen. In some modes, there is a star point counter. Once this reaches 100, a Super Star will appear. If Yoshi touches it or the player drags it to Yoshi, Baby Mario will temporarily become Super Baby Mario, who is considerably faster than Yoshi and has unlimited stars (instead of eggs) to throw. The star points will then return to zero. Also, by feeding fruits to Yoshi a certain number of eggs will be replenished. The number of replenished eggs depends on the fruit consumed (for instance, an apple only refills one egg, while melons refill twenty). The color of Yoshi that Baby Mario rides depends on the player's score in the vertical falling part of the game. If the player gets 60 points, he will ride a light blue Yoshi, and then the color will go up a level for every other 20 points scored (for instance, pink Yoshi at 80 points, blue Yoshi at 100 points, etc.). The only two exceptions are white and orange Yoshi: In Marathon mode, when Baby Mario changes Yoshis, depending on the player's performance he might start riding a white Yoshi, who will switch to black Yoshi unless it's at the 10,000 meters mark, in which case he will switch over to orange Yoshi. It will then switch to purple Yoshi at 20,000 meters in Marathon. In challenge mode, after the high score is beaten, getting 0 points in the Baby Mario segment of future games will unlock a fast purple Yoshi. The same applies to time attack where a white Yoshi, which has unlimited eggs, can be unlocked. Development According to director Hiroyuki Kimura and designer Keizo Ohta, Yoshi Touch & Go was originally planned to be designed for the Nintendo GameCube as \\"Balloon Trip\\". A demo of the game was first exhibited during the E3 of 2004 and gained positive responses, causing the executives of Nintendo to greenlight the project. Shigeru Miyamoto felt that the game would create a bigger impact as a DS title. Yoshi Touch & Go was produced by Takashi Tezuka and directed by Hiroyuki Kimura. The game's musical score was created by Toru Minegishi, Asuka Ohta, and Kazumi Totaka. Baby Mario and Baby Luigi were voiced by Charles Martinet while the voice-over of the Yoshis was done by Totaka, including the 19-note song he performed. Reception The game was generally well-received, though not as positive as earlier games of the Yoshi series, such as Yoshi's Island. It holds average ratings of 75% at GameRankings and 73/100 at Metacritic. Craig Harris of IGN said it \\"is one of the most original and unique games created for the system so far, and it's truly a design that's unlike anything you've played before.\\" He especially commended the multiplayer mode and gave the game an 8.8/10. Additionally, it won the IGN Editors' Choice Award on March 11, 2005. Some reviewers, however, criticized Yoshi Touch & Go for its lack of storyline and the simple gameplay. GameSpot's Ryan Davis found that he was \\"going through the same few levels over and over again\\" and thought the multiplayer mode was not very compelling, concluding that although \\"the gameplay concepts...are quite good,\\" the overall package \\"simply lacks substance.\\" Also, the game gathered negative criticism for its price, which was described as too high by some critics. Nevertheless, Touch & Go was a moderate success, selling 197,337 copies in Japan.

Designated by the characterization of the basic notes and scales, ancient music was transmitted through oral or written systems. Origins Written musical notation was the first mark of a literate society. During the time of prehistoric music, people had a tendency to primarily convey their music and ideas through oral means. However, with the rise of social classes, many European and Asian societies regarded literacy as superior to illiteracy which caused people to begin writing down their musical notations. This made music evolve from simply hearing music and transmitting it orally, to keeping records and personal interpretations of musical themes (; ; ). Egypt Egyptian lute players. Fresco from the tomb of Nebamun, a nobleman in the 18th Dynasty of Ancient Egypt (c. 1350 BC). Music has been an integral part of Egyptian culture since antiquity. The ancient Egyptians credited the goddess Bat with the invention of music who was later syncretized with another goddess, Hathor. Osiris used this music from Hathor to civilize the world. The earliest material and representational evidence of Egyptian musical instruments dates to the Predynastic period, but the evidence is more securely attested in tomb paintings from the Old Kingdom (c. 2575‚Äì2134 BC) when harps, end-blown flutes (held diagonally), and single and double pipes of the clarinet type (with single reeds) were played (; ; ; ). Percussion instruments, and lutes were added to orchestras by the Middle Kingdom. Bronze cymbals dating from the Roman period‚Äî30 BC to 641 AD‚Äîhave been found in a tomb on a site near Naucratis (; ). Although experiments have been carried out with surviving Egyptian instruments (on the spacing of holes in flutes and reed pipes, and attempts to reconstruct the stringing of lyres, harps, and lutes), only the Tutankhamun trumpets and some percussion instruments yield any secure idea of how ancient Egyptian instruments sounded . None of the many theories that have been formulated have any adequate foundation (; ) Mesopotamia In 1986, Anne Draffkorn Kilmer, professor of ancient history and Mediterranean archaeology at the University of California, Berkeley, published her decipherment of a cuneiform tablet, dating back to 2000 BCE from Nippur, one of the most ancient Sumerian cities. She claimed that the tablet contained fragmentary instructions for performing and composing music in harmonies of thirds, and was written using a diatonic scale . The notation in the first tablet was not as developed as the notation in the later cuneiform Hurrian tablets from Ugarit, dated by Kilmer to about 1250 BCE . The interpretation of the notation system is still controversial (at least five rival interpretations have been published), but it is clear that the notation indicates the names of strings on a lyre, and its tuning is described in other tablets. These tablets represent the earliest recorded melodies, though fragmentary, from anywhere in the world . Harps of Ur In 1929, Leonard Woolley discovered pieces of four different harps while excavating the ruins of the ancient city Ur, located in what was Ancient Mesopotamia and what is now contemporary Iraq. The fragments have been dated to 2750 BCE and some are now located at the University of Pennsylvania, the British Museum in London, and in Baghdad. Various reconstructions and restorations of the instruments have been attempted, but none have been completely satisfactory. Depending on various definitions, they could be classified as lyres rather than harps, the most famous being the bull-headed harp, held in Baghdad. However, the Iraq War in 2003 led to the destruction of the bull-head lyre . Hurrian music Among the Hurrian texts from Ugarit are some of the oldest known instances of written music, dating from c.1400 BCE and including one substantially complete song. A reconstruction of this hymn is presented at the Urkesh webpage. Ancient India Musical instruments, such as the seven-holed flute and various types of stringed instruments have been recovered from the Indus valley civilization archaeological sites The Samaveda consists of a collection (samhita) of hymns, portions of hymns, and detached verses, all but 75 taken from the Rigveda, to be sung, using specifically indicated melodies called Samagana, by Udgatar priests at sacrifices in which the juice of the soma plant, clarified and mixed with milk and other ingredients, is offered in libation to various deities . In ancient India, memorization of the sacred Vedas included up to eleven forms of recitation of the same text The NƒÅtya Shastra is an ancient Indian treatise on the performing arts, encompassing theatre, dance and music. It was written at an uncertain date in classical India (between 200 BCE and 200 CE). The Natya Shastra is based upon the much older Natya Veda which contained 36,000 slokas (; ). Unfortunately there are no surviving copies of the Natya Veda. There are scholars who believe that it may have been written by various authors at different times. The most authoritative commentary on the Natya Shastra is Abhinavabharati by Abhinava Gupta . While much of the discussion of music in the Natyashastra focuses on musical instruments, it also emphasizes several theoretical aspects that remained fundamental to Indian music: # Establishment of Shadja as the first, defining note of the scale or grama . # Two Principles of Consonance: The first principle states that there exists a fundamental note in the musical scale which is Avinashi (‡§Ö‡§µ‡§ø‡§®‡§æ‡§∂‡•Ä) and Avilopi (‡§Ö‡§µ‡§ø‡§≤‡•ã‡§™‡•Ä) that is, the note is ever-present and unchanging. The second principle, often treated as law, states that there exists a natural consonance between notes; the best between Shadja and Tar Shadja, the next best between Shadja and Pancham. # The Natyashastra also suggests the notion of musical modes or jatis which are the origin of the notion of the modern melodic structures known as ragas. Their role in invoking emotions are emphasized; thus compositions emphasizing the notes gandhara or rishabha are said to be related to tragedy (karuna rasa) whereas rishabha is to be emphasized for evoking heroism (vIra rasa) . Jatis are elaborated in greater detail in the text Dattilam, composed around the same time as the Natyashastra (; ). Ancient China A famous Tang Dynasty (618‚Äì907) qin, the \\"Jiu Xiao Huan Pei\\" The qin or Guqin, dates back to around 5,000 years ago. Legend states that figures of China's pre-history, \\"Fuxi, Shennong and Huang Di, the \\"Yellow Emperor\\" ‚Äî were involved in its creation\\". Most qin books and tablature written before the twentieth century confirm that this is the origin of the qin, although now it is viewed as mythology. In Chinese literature the qin dates back almost 3,000 years, while examples of the instrument have been found in tombs that date back to about 2,000 years ago. Although the ancient literature states it's beginnings, the origin of the qin is still a subject of debate over the past few decades. Ancient Greece Symposium scene, c. 490 BCE Ancient Greek musicians developed their own robust system of musical notation. The system was not widely used among Greek musicians, but nonetheless a modest corpus of notated music remains from Ancient Greece and Rome. The epics of Homer were originally sung with instrumental accompaniment, but no notated melodies from Homer are known. Several complete songs exist in ancient Greek musical notation. Three complete hymns by Mesomedes of Crete (2nd century CE) exist in manuscript. In addition, many fragments of Greek music are extant, including fragments from tragedy, among them a choral song by Euripides for his Orestes and an instrumental intermezzo from Sophocles' Ajax. Some fragments of Greek music, such as the Orestes fragment, clearly call for more than one note to be sounded at the same time. Greek sources occasionally refer to the technique of playing more than one note at the same time. In addition, double pipes, such as used by the Greeks and Persians, and ancient bagpipes, as well as a review of ancient drawings on vases and walls, etc., and ancient writings (such as in Aristotle, Problems, Book XIX.12) which described musical techniques of the time, all indicate harmony existed. Ancient Rome The music of ancient Rome borrowed heavily from the music of the cultures that were conquered by the empire, including music of Greece, Egypt, and Persia. Music was incorporated into many areas of Roman life including the military, entertainment in the Roman theater, religious ceremonies and practices, and \\"almost all public/civic occasions.\\" The philosopher-theorist Boethius translated into Latin and anthologized a number of Greek treatises, including some on music. His work The Principles of Music (better-known under the title De institutione musica) divided music into three types: Musica mundana (music of the universe), musica humana (music of human beings), and musica instrumentalis (instrumental music).

The capital of his voivodship (duchy) was Titel. The exact border of his duchy is not clear: according to some sources, his duchy included present-day northern Serbia, much of present-day central Hungary, present-day eastern Slovakia and part of present-day western Ukraine and northern Romania, while according to other sources his duchy included only present-day Baƒçka region of Serbia and Hungary. History According to Gesta Hungarorum, Salan (Salanus) was an Orthodox vassal of the Byzantine Empire or of the Bulgarian tsar (Emperor). Serbian historian Dr Aleksa Iviƒá supposes that Salan was a Slavic king.Dr Aleksa Iviƒá, Istorija Srba u Vojvodini, Novi Sad, 1929. The chronicle states that he was descendant of the Bulgarian Khan who conquered the territory up to the borders of Russia and Poland after the death of Attila the Hun. At the time of Hungarian conquest (after 896), Hungarians attacked Salan's voivodship and Bulgarians led by the tsar Simeon came to the aid of voivod Salan and even the Byzantine Emperor sent auxiliary troops against the Hungarians. The Hungarians defeated a united Bulgarian and Byzantine army led by Salan in the early 10th century on the plains of Alp√°r \\"Alp√°r\\" may be modern Tiszaalp√°r; recorded in 1075 as \\"Olper\\", when it was within the domains of G√©za I. and the voivodship of Salan fell under Hungarian rule. Name origin There is a theory that his name means \\"the salt man\\", so it could be a name given to him by the authors of the chronicles, describing the role he had: supplying salt for his suzerain (supposedly the tsar Simeon the Great of Bulgaria). By some opinions name Salanus has a Latin resonance and, by this view, it might have Latin or Vlach origin. Sources The main historical source about duke Salan is a historical chronicle known as Gesta Hungarorum, written by Magister P., notary of Hungarian King Bela in the late 12th century. Gesta Hungarorum, however, is not considered to be a fully reliable source, thus the existence of Salan is questionable. However, the 10th century Lombard chronicler, Liudprand, also wrote about a Hungarian victory over the Bulgarians and the Byzantines in the early 10th century and other sources also mention that area between Danube and Tisa was under Bulgarian rule, which confirm some claims from Gesta Hungarorum regarding the story about Salan. Nestor's chronicle also mentions that area between Danube, Tisa and Galicia was inhabited by Slavs and Vlachs, which also confirms some claims from Gesta Hungarorum regarding the entering of Magyar tribes in the Danube plain and battles against Slavs and Vlachs.G.

The album included \\"Dismembered\\", a new version of the band's first single, \\"S√∂ngull\\" (1983), with most of the guitars replaced by pipes and bells. Critical reception In a 1984 review at Sounds magazine, David Tibet gave the album a perfect score, saying: \\"'The Eye' steps boldly out of the supposed confines that the Crass label is meant to impose...and drags the listener into a glacial world of confused emotion and shattered visions.\\" He compared it to The Scream by Siouxsie and the Banshees, \\"primarily I suppose because of the howling vocals and decaying metal\\".Tibet, David. Kukl The Eye review. Sounds. 3 September 1984 AllMusic praised the album, stating that \\"The Eye is a patently draining affair seemingly devoid of any coherent structure. Repeated spins, however, unearth a highly sophisticated aesthetic that borrows evenly from punk, noisecore, avant garde, and good old-fashioned indie. Although highly discordant and often atonal, it's a curiously engaging record, aided in part by Bj√∂rk's darkly emotive vocals and the presiding, almost mythical, sense of impending lunacy. It may not be for everyone, but this is gutsy, non- conformist music as authored by one of the most passionate, intense bands in Iceland's esteemed history\\".

(2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, , p. 157 Known by pejorative, punk rock nicknames, original members were known simply as \\"Useless\\" (Gerry Hannah), \\"Dimwit\\" (Ken Montgomery), \\"Wimpy\\" (Brian Roy Goble) and \\"Normal\\" (Mike Graham). History Dimwit quit the band shortly after their first 7\\" was released to join the Pointed Sticks and was replaced by Koichi Imagawa, also known as Jim Imagawa, on drums. In 1981, Hannah left the band and gradually became involved with a small group of underground activists calling themselves Direct Action. In the alternative media they were referred to as the Vancouver 5, but in the mainstream press they were dubbed the Squamish 5. The group, composed of ecologists and feminists, were responsible for a number of actions, including the 14 October 1982 bombing of the Litton Industries plant in Ontario which made guidance systems for cruise missiles. The Litton bombing hurt several plant workers and three police officers were also injured. While Gerry was not part of the Litton bombing, he supported it, and did take part in other actions, as well as planning to rob a Brinks truck to fund future actions. He was arrested on 20 January 1983, along with the four other members of Direct Action. Many benefits were arranged for the group by people such as Jello Biafra and Joey Shithead of D.O.A. to pay lawyers fees but, in the end, Hannah pleaded guilty to avoid years in prison. He received a 10-year sentence and was released after serving 5 years. During his time in prison, he began writing a column for the fanzine Maximum RocknRoll which helped maintain his connection to the punk scene. A number of years after his release he was the subject of a documentary film made by B.C. filmmaker Glen Sanford, called Useless. After Hannah left the band, the Subhumans re-formed with Ron Allan on bass. After Imagawa left the band, Dimwit was briefly back with the Subhumans before Randy Bowman joined in his place. With the line up of Wimpy Roy, Mike Graham, Ron Allan, and Randy Bowman, the Subhumans recorded the album No Wishes, No Prayers for Black Flag's SST Records. Ron Allan and Randy Bowman later went on to join the Vancouver band The Scramblers and Brian Goble went on to join D.O.A. on bass and occasional lead vocals. Their songs have been covered by many other bands, including D.O.A., NoMeansNo, MDC, Overkill, Jingo de Lunch, and Vancouver all-women band Cub, and they are highly regarded within the punk community. The band toured western Canada in 1995, with Hannah and Goble along with Jon Williams on guitar and David \\"Salty\\" MacAnulty on drums. They released the CD Pissed Off ‚Ä¶ With Good Reason the following year.\\"Subhumans page on Citizenfreak.com\\". In 2005, the Subhumans reunited with the following lineup: Gerry Hannah on bass, Jon Card (ex-Personality Crisis, SNFU and D.O.A.) on drums, Wimpy Roy on vocals and Mike Graham on guitar. They signed to Alternative Tentacles and G7 Welcoming Committee Records. A new album, New Dark Age Parade, was released in September 2006. Death Was Too Kind, a compilation of the band's early singles and EPs, was released in 2008. In 2010, the band released the album Same Thoughts, Different Day, a re-recorded version of Incorrect Thoughts, after legal issues prevented the band from reissuing the original album.

He was also Minister for Finance. At the age of 40 years and 92 days, Themptander is the youngest person to become Prime Minister in Swedish history. His death at the age of 52 years and 351 days makes him also the youngest prime minister at his death. Biography Robert Themptander was born in Stockholm, the son of army lieutenant Nils Themptander and wife Adolphina Laurent. After law studies in Uppsala and a highly successful career in the civil service he became in 1879 a member of the Second Chamber. There from the beginning he was a member of the centre party, a party loyal to then incumbent government. Gradually he began move orientate towards the agrarian party. He married in 1874 with Frida Dahlberg, with whom he had three children. In the government of Arvid Posse in 1880, he became Minister without Portfolio and, in 1881 Minister of Finance. He stayed on in this office in three years before he became Prime Minister at the age of 40. Only Louis De Geer had become Prime Minister at a younger age. Through good contacts in different parliamentary positions he was successful in breaking the political gridlock concerning the defense question. This issue was finally achieved in the year of 1885. He was less successful in his goal to protect the free trade system which Louis De Geer and Minister of Finance Gripenstedt had instituted during their time in office. This political economy had with many good benefits contributed to the modernization of Sweden. As food prices on the world markets sank because of increased imports from all of North America, demand increased for high tariffs to protect Swedish interests. Eventually Themptander was constrained to retire, yet not through defeat in the 1887 election, when his resistance towards the new duty-friendly winds of opinion meant more election debate than before. Riksdag candidates were compelled to answer about which views they had, if they were Free Traders or Protectionists. This was seen by many at the time as uncommon. Lifelong members of the Riksdag had previously been elected on the basis of their high personal reputation and confidence. The Free Traders won in Stockholm and gained twenty-two parliamentary seats. But it appeared that one member had not paid his taxes and therefore the whole list was declared invalid. Lifelong members of the Riksdag who were free trade supporters were replaced with tariff supporters. Therefore, the Second Chamber returned a protectionist majority. Themptander attempted to have King Oscar II announce a new election, but the King denied the request. Then Themptander resigned as Prime Minister. From 1888‚Äì96 he was Stockholm County Governor and afterwards director for Trafik AB Gr√§ngesberg‚ÄìOxel√∂sund. Robert Themptander died on 30 January 1897 in Stockholm.

He received his B.A. from the University of Toronto in 1962, and went on to graduate studies at Oxford University, where he received a B.Phil in 1964 and D.Phil. in 1969, although he returned to Canada in 1965; his thesis, under the supervision of Alfred Jules Ayer, attempted to refute empiricism. In 1965, he took a position as a lecturer at Carleton University, and in 1967, became an assistant professor there, but in the same year he moved back to Toronto after philosophy department members David Savan and David Gauthier persuaded the other faculty to overlook his radical politics.. At Toronto, Goldstick taught Marxism, synthetic apriority, and ethics. His work in philosophy centres on topics in metaphysics and epistemology. His philosophical work consists of approximately 75 papers, including: *\\"Methodological Conservatism\\" (Am. Phil. Quart. 1971); *\\"Dialectics versus Metaphysics\\" (Explorations in Knowledge, 1988); *\\"Cognitive Reason\\" (Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, 1992) He is the author of Reason, Truth, and Reality,(University of Toronto Press, 2009, ) a \\"defense of pre-Kantian rationalism\\".

His mother was a lawyer and anti-war activist and friends with politicians like J. S. Woodsworth and Tim Buck. According to , Goldstick has been the subject of illicit Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) surveillance since the age of 15.. As a high school student, Goldstick was a member of the National Federation of Labor Youth. He became politically involved in student movement politics at the University of Toronto while an undergraduate there in the 1950s. Later, he campaigned with a young Tariq Ali at Oxford against the Vietnam war. Since returning to Canada he has worked on many direct action campaigns including students issues like tuition reduction and elimination; against sexism, homophobia and racism such as the Dr Chun case; international solidarity with the ANC, Black Panthers, Angela Davis, and FMLN; as well as electoral politics on the municipal, provincial and federal level. For many years he was involved in the University of Toronto Marxist Institute. Goldstick is currently a member of the Council of Canadians and is active in peace, anti-war, and Palestinian solidarity movements.

He is a supporter of the Canadian Peace Alliance and presented on \\"Sovereignty and Global Peace\\" at the 2010 Canadian Peace Research Association. Advocacy of Atheism Goldstick has been involved in debates across Canada on the existence of God. He has publicly debated writers such as Micheal R. Butler, attempting to refute Butler's Transcendental argument for God. Goldstick maintains that an omnipotent God must be able to accomplish anything, even if it entails a contradiction‚Äîgenocide, famine, etc. On this account, the Christian God cannot be omnipotent and benevolent, for a benevolent, omnipotent God would have prevented the introduction of suffering into the world.

It is a major branch of the Royal Ottawa Health Care Group (ROHCG), which also encompasses the Brockville Mental Health Centre, the University of Ottawa Institute of Mental Health Research and the Royal Ottawa Foundation for Mental Health. History The hospital was established as the Lady Grey Hospital in February 1910 and renamed the Royal Ottawa Hospital in 1969. Andrew Leyshon-Hughes, a killer who stabbed Canadian heiress Nancy Eaton twenty-one times, was confined to the hospital in the 1980s. The aging hospital was completely replaced by a new facility designed by Parkin Architects and built in the form of an eight- storey tower by a joint venture of Carillion and EllisDon at a cost of $143 million. The new hospital was the first P3 hospital procured in Canada and was officially opened by Premier Dalton McGuinty in October 2006. Pedophilia controversy Psychiatrist Paul Fedoroff and the ROMHC have come under criticism for claims they could cure pedophilia, despite the medical consensus of the opposite. In 2014, Fedoroff claimed his program can treat pedophilia and other disorders \\"so successfully that people who were aroused by children, exhibitionism or rape can eventually lead healthy, consensual sex lives.\\" This contrasted with other experts who said, \\"There is absolutely, positively no evidence that we can cure 'a paraphilic disorder'\\". Fedoroff based his claim on his study of 43 men showed pedophilia on a phallometric test (where the men's erection responses were measured). When these men were tested again, 21 of them showed less response to children and more response to adults. The study was strongly criticized, with experts noting that Fedoroff's measurement technique was unreliable and could be manipulated by the test-takers trying to look normal, and that the finding was actually a statistical illusion caused by a phenomenon called regression to the mean. According to sex researcher J. Michael Bailey, \\"I think his data were not appreciably different than random coin tossing...Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and yet Paul's paper is extraordinarily weak.\\" In 2016, Andreas Mokros and Elmar Habermeyer, sex researchers at the University Hospital of Zurich used Fedoroff's original data and applied statistical modelling of Fedoroff's method to test its validity. Their results verified the previous criticisms, showing directly that Fedoroff's method was invalid and that his reported finding was actually a statistical artefact, indistinguishable from random variation. Fedoroff dismissed the analyses and criticisms, however, saying they \\"are concerns to be raised about any un-replicated study\\" and asking \\"Why all the fuss about this one, especially since the news appears to be good?\\"Fedoroff, J. Paul. (2016, July 29). Pedophilia: Interventions that work. Psychiatric Times. In 2017, Fedoroff and the ROMHC continued their claims of success (called a \\"boast\\" by the National Post). According to Fedoroff, \\"We have evidence all day from people who say they‚Äôve gotten better.....People always come back saying ‚ÄòThis is much better, I enjoy this so much more than what I used to go through\\". According to Professor Martin Lalumiere of the University of Ottawa, standard treatment focuses on strategies to avoid trouble (such as avoiding situations where the person is alone with children). In the method Fedoroff describes, pedophiles are taught to find sexual stimulation from people their own age, in repeated sessions using adult pornography as practice. According to James Cantor, a sex researcher known for his MRI studies of pedophilia, what ROHMC clinic is doing is equivalent to the failed ‚Äúconversion therapy‚Äù of homosexuality. Fedoroff's response to the National Post was that there is no evidence that pedophilia cannot be altered and that he and his team are \\"working on\\" studies to prove their claims.

Chicane was intended as a side project of the act, however they only saw one release as a duo, the Offshore EP through Cyanide Records. After \\"Offshore\\"'s release as a single in 1996, the song quickly garnered success, debuting at number 1 on the UK Dance Singles Chart. After this Elstob left the duo, and Chicane (and Disco Citizens) became the solo moniker of Nick Bracegirdle. He soon signed to Alex Gold's record label, Xtravaganza Recordings, who showed interest in releasing a full album by Chicane.

While he was the Minister for Militia and Defence, he was the father of the most famous Canadian casualty of the Second Boer War Harold Lothrop Borden.Canadian Biography Online - Herold Borden Historians credit him with creating and financing a modernised Canadian militia with a staff and medical, transport, and signals that proved important for allowing Canadian ground forces to deploy with their own support services as self-contained national contingents, albeit in an imperial framework. In this sense, he helped to create the foundations for the Canadian Expeditionary Force of 1914‚Äì1918.Carmen Miller, A Knight in Politics: A Biography of Sir Frederick Borden (McGill-Queen's University Press, 2010) Career Born in Cornwallis, Nova Scotia, the son of Dr. Jonathan Borden and Maria Frances Brown. Borden received a Bachelor of Arts degree from University of King's College in Windsor, Nova Scotia in 1866. He joined the militia as a cadet at King‚Äôs College and then as an assistant surgeon in the 68th (Kings) Battalion of Infantry in 1869. He earned a M.D. in 1868 from Harvard Medical School and practiced as a physician in Canning, Nova Scotia. Borden soon added business to his medical practice, acting as a bank agent, buying real estate, ships and helping found the successful Cornwallis Valley Railway from Canning to Kentville in 1887. He formed his own company the F. W. Borden Company in 1895, later known as the Nova Scotia Produce and Supply Company, to oversee his various business ventures in agriculture, lumber, shipping and investment. Harold died at war He entered politics in 1874 with election as a Liberal member from Kings (electoral district); aside from an interruption 1882‚Äì1887, he represented this constituency until 1911. Minister of militia and defence As Minister of militia and defence from 1896‚Äì1911, Borden implemented a series of reforms that gave the militia the ability to act as a formed army with its own supply and medical services. He also increased the rate at which Canadian officers attended British and Indian staff colleges at Camberley and Quetta and used these staff-trained graduates to help create professionally-trained staffs at the Royal Military College of Canada, and regional divisional headquarters. He increased pay and retirement benefits, equipped the militia with modern weapons, established rules regulating tenure of command, and decentralized command and administration. Miller (2010) presents evidence that Borden saved himself from financial ruin by stationing three battalions of soldiers to Halifax in 1900 in order to make a profit for his faltering supply company. Honours CFB Borden was named in his honour when the air base was founded in 1916. He is the cousin of the eighth Prime Minister of Canada, Robert Borden. Following the succession of King Edward VII and the end of the Second Boer War by the Peace of Vereeniging in late May 1902, Borden was created a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902. He attended the fleet review held at Spithead on 16 August 1902 to mark the coronation, and received the order in an investiture on board the royal yacht Victoria and Albert the previous day. He was appointed a Knight of Grace of the Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem in England (K.St.J.) on 13 August 1902, and granted the honorary rank of Surgeon-General in the British Army in the 1911 Coronation Honours.

He took the World Lightweight Championship in April 1945 and made eight successful defenses of the title against six different fighters prior to losing the championship to Jimmy Carter in 1951. Williams was known for his great right hand, and was named to The Ring magazine's list of 100 greatest punchers of all time as well as The Ring magazine Fighter of the Year for 1948.His trainers included Jimmy Wilson and Jesse Goss. His manager for much of his career was Frank \\"Blinky\\" Palermo, who was later strongly suspected of having ties to organized crime. Early life Williams was born in Brunswick, Georgia on August 2, 1923. He did not turn professional until 1940 when he began boxing in Trenton, New Jersey. According to boxing lore, Williams worked as a newsboy after his family's move to Trenton, and first began boxing using his fists to defend the corner where he sold his papers.\\"Bull Ring Battle Draws 35,000 in Mexico City\\", The Independent Record, Helena, Montana, pg. 8, 19 April 1945 Professional career During his career, Williams faced and defeated former lightweight champions Sammy Angott, Bob Montgomery, and Beau Jack. Taking the NBA World Lightweight Championship, April 1945 Williams was inducted into the U.S. Army after a close non-title win against the great lightweight Sammy Angott by ten-round decision at Shibe Park in Philadelphia on September 6, 1944, though he continued regular professional boxing during his service.\\"Ike Williams Again Defeats Angott on Split\\", The News Journal, Wilmington, Delaware, pg. 27, 7 September 1944 Williams won the NBA World Lightweight Championship before a crowd of 35,000 by a second-round knockout of Juan Zurita in Mexico City on April 18, 1945. Their first planned meeting in Philadelphia had been cancelled by the Pennsylvania Boxing Commission who recognized Bob Montgomery as the lightweight champion. Williams made a two fisted attack to the head of Zurita in the second which Zurita could not hold off, though he had made an effective defense in the first round. It was Zurita's first title defense. Shortly after Zurita was counted out, Williams' corner was crowded by fans, and several policeman were required to clear the ring before Williams could return to his dressing room.The fight drew 35,000 in \\"Bull Ring Battle Draws 35,000 in Mexico City\\", The Independent Record, Helena, Montana, pg. 8, 19 April 1945 =World Lightweight Title defense against Bob Montgomery, August 1947= In one of his most important title defenses, he achieved a knockout of black boxer Bob Montgomery, NYSAC Lightweight Champion, at Municipal Stadium in Philadelphia in six rounds on August 4, 1947, to become the undisputed World Lightweight Champion. Montgomery was down for a count of nine in the sixth before the bout was stopped. The victory also avenged a twelfth-round knockout loss to Montgomery from January 25, 1944. At least one source had Williams with an edge in three of the rounds, with one to Montgomery, and one too close to call. The blow that sent Montgomery to the mat in the sixth was a right to the chin by the hard punching Williams. Montgomery rose after nine but continued to take punches and was up against the ropes, and sinking to the mat on his knees before the referee stopped the bout.Cuddy, Jack, \\"Ike Williams Stops Bob Montgomery to Win Lightweight Mit Title\\", The Ogden Standard- Examiner\\", Ogden, Utah, pg. 10, 5 August 1947 =World Lightweight Title defense against Jesse Flores, September 1948= On September 23, 1948, Williams successfully defended his Lightweight title against Jesse Flores winning in a tenth-round technical knockout at Yankee Stadium in New York's Bronx. Flores had been on the mat five times during the fight, down twice in the fifth and twice in the eighth. The final blows were a left hook and then a right that sent Flores to the mat 2:07 into the tenth round.Holmes, Tommy, \\"Senior Flores Met Up With a Champ\\", The Brooklyn Daily Eagle\\", Brooklyn, New York, pg. 16, 24 September 1948 =World Lightweight Title defense against Enrique Bolanos, July 1949= On July 21, 1949, Williams defended his title against Enrique Bolanos winning in a fourth-round technical knockout before a crowd of near 19,000 at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles. Bolanos had been sent to the canvas twice before referee Jack Dempsey decided to end the bout 2:40 into the fourth round. Bolanos was knocked to the mat for a count of eight early in the fourth, and then after rising received a series of left and right hooks that sent him to his knees near William's corner. Bolanos' manager George Parnassus threw in the towel and referee Dempsey abruptly ended the bout causing the fight to be recorded as a technical knock out.Crowd was near 19,000 in \\"Williams Seeks Bigger Game After Knocking Out Bolanos to Retain Lightweight Title\\", St. Louis Dispatch, St. Louis, Missouri, pg. 31, 22 July 1949 =World Lightweight Title defense against Freddy Dawson, December 1949= On December 5, 1949, Williams defeated Freddy Dawson in a close fifteen-round decision before 10,389 fans at Convention Hall in Philadelphia. He had defeated Dawson twice in previous meetings and led in the early betting. In the post-fight decision, the two judges gave him the decision by only one round, ruling that 8 rounds were won by him and 7 by Dawson. The referee, who was closer to the action, gave him 9 rounds to 6 for Dawson. There were no knockdowns in the bout, and according to one source only one hard solid punch, a hard left to Dawson's head in the fifth. Boxing reporters already were concerned about Williams' ability to make the lightweight limit prior to his bout with Dawson, an issue that would arise again in his bout with Jimmy Carter. There were several newspaper reports that wrote of Williams' fine for informing the press of a potential bribe of the judges he claimed he had heard about in a phone call. He was fined by the boxing commission for informing the press of the possible bribe before he had first informed the commission.\\"Williams Retains Crown Despite Warning of Fix\\", The Gazette and Daily, York, Pennsylvania, pg. 29, 6 December 1949 On January 17, 1949, Williams first defeated Johhny Bratton by a comfortable margin in the Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in a ten-round decision before a satisfied crowd of 8,000 fans. Williams had taken a two-month lay-off from his fight schedule to help heal a broken hand. The judges scored 6-2 and 7-3 for Bratton, while the referee scored a closer 5-4-1 decision. Bratton put up a defense, and even stunned Williams momentarily in the eighth with a blow to the jaw, but lacked the skills at 21 to defeat Williams.\\"Ringchamp Winner Over Negro Boxer\\", Wilkes-Barre Times Leader, Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, pg. 15, 18 January 1949 On January 20, 1950, before a crowd of 12,000 at Chicago Stadium, Williams won an eighth-round technical knockout against Bratton who was forced to leave the ring with a broken jaw. Bratton later claimed the injury took place in round three. Williams hammered his opponent particularly hard in the second and seventh rounds, and was comfortably ahead on points, losing only one of the eight rounds fought to Bratton. Bratton ended the bout by turning his back and signalling the referee to end the fight.\\"Contract of Loser Just Sold\\", St. Louis Post-Dispatch, pg 6. 21 January 1950 After returning to boxing, Bratton would briefly take the NBA World Welterweight Championship in March 1951, holding it only two months. =Loss of World Lightweight Title against Jimmy Carter, May 1951= He held on to the crown until May 25, 1951, when he was stopped by Jimmy Carter in a fourteenth-round technical knockout at New York's Madison Square Garden. Williams had been sent to the canvas four times before the fight was called. Williams was down for a count of five and eight in the fifth. He was down for a count of four and then six in the fourteenth before the referee ended the fight. Williams believed that his trouble making weight had weakened him for the fight.Rose, Murray, \\"Ike Williams is Defeated by Unknown\\", The News Paladium, Benton Harbor, Michigan, pg. 6, 26 May 1951 Williams, for part of his career, was managed by Frank \\"Blinky\\" Palermo, who later was suspected of having ties to organized crime. According to Williams, he was blackballed by the boxing managers guild when he sought to manage himself. Palermo informed him he could resolve his problems with the guild, and Williams agreed to let Palermo manage him. Williams testified before the Kefauver Commission that Palermo did not arrange for him to throw any fights, but that he shorted him his share of his purses. Nevertheless, Williams did claim to have taken a dive against Chuck Davey, a much hyped contender for the welterweight crown. Testifying before Congress, 1961 In 1961 Williams testified before Congress on antitrust in boxing. In his testimony, Williams stated that all boxers are asked to take bribes and that he was boycotted as a result of trying to manage himself. He explained that he could not get a fight because he did not use a manager and that he could not book a fight until he found a manager from the manager's guild. He explained that he did not receive his share of his purse in two fights which included Jesse Flores in Yankee Stadium, for the lightweight title on September 23, 1948 and Beau Jack at Shibe Park in Philadelphia, on July 12, 1948 and September 23, 1948. In those fights the money owed him was $32,500 and $32,400. He testified he told the boxing association to temporarily hold on to the money for these two fights for tax purposes. Later when he asked for his money, he discovered that his shares of the profits had been taken by his manager, who claimed to have fallen on hard times and spent it. Williams still had to pay the taxes on his share of the profits, though he never received them.From Ike Williams, \\"Testimony,\\" in U.S. Congress, Senate Judiciary Committee, Professional Boxing: Hearings Before Subcommittee on Antitrust and Monopoly, 86th Cong., 2d sess., pursuant to S. Res. 238, December 5‚Äì14, 1960 (Washington, D.C., Government Printing Office, 1961), 664‚Äì71. He further testified that his manager was offered $30,000 for him to throw a championship fight against Freddy Dawson in Philadelphia on December 5, 1949, though he declined. He testified that ten minutes before the fight he heard the judges being told if he did not win by a knock out that the fight would go to Dawson. Williams won the fight and told the media afterwards that he had heard a rumor that the fight would be fixed to go to Dawson by decision of the judges if he did not win by a knockout. Williams believed that the Judges upon hearing that he called the media decided to not fix the fight by giving an unfair decision to Dawson. Nonetheless, Williams was fined $500 for his comments to the media. Williams also recalled a fight against Kid Gavilan on January 28, 1949 at Madison Square Garden, in which he was offered $100,000 to throw the fight. Again, Ike Williams did not take the money, an action he regretted because he lost the fight even though a plurality of reporters in subsequent news stories that cover the fight believed he had won. This made Williams conclude that the judges may have also been influenced in this fight to vote for his opponent in the case of a points decision. Williams also believed he lost his lightweight title in a bout with the boxer Jimmy Carter on May 25, 1951 in a bout where the judges were also influenced. He testified he was again offered to throw the fight, for a sum of $50,000. Again, Williams said he regretted not taking the money as he lost the fight in a similar fashion as before. Williams testified he never took the money offered to him to fix fights because too many people were counting on him and that too many of his friends had bet their hard earned money on him. Death at 71 in Los Angeles, 1994 Williams died on September 5, 1994 at his home in the Wilshire District of Los Angeles of natural causes.\\"Ex-champ Ike Williams Dies at 71\\", Philadelphia Daily News, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, pg. 61, 7 September 1994 Boxing achievements and honors Williams was The Ring magazine's Fighter of the Year for 1948, was inducted into The Ring Boxing Hall of Fame (disbanded in 1987), and was an inaugural 1990 inductee to the International Boxing Hall of Fame.

Biography=Early years Kolarov was born in ≈ûumnu, Ottoman Empire (now Shumen, Bulgaria) on 16 July 1877, the son of a shoemaker.Branko Lazitch with Milorad M. Drachkovitch, Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern: New, Revised, and Expanded Edition. Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution Press, 1986; pg. 224. After graduating from high school in Varna, he worked as a teacher in Nikopol from 1895 to 1897. In 1897, Kolarov joined the Bulgarian Workers' Social Democratic Party (BWSDP). Kolarov studied law in Aix-en-Provence, France, and at the University of Geneva. Following his graduation in 1900, Kolarov worked as a lawyer in his hometown and, from 1904, in Plovdiv. Political career After the ideological split of the BWSDP, Kolarov cast his lot with Dimitar Blagoev's Tesniak (Narrow) wing of the party, which espoused revolutionary socialism. From 1904 to 1912, Kolarov headed the local Tesniak organization in Povdiv. He was named a member of the organization's governing Central Committee in 1905. On behalf of the Tesniak organization, Kolarov was a delegate to the congresses of the Second International at Stuttgart (1907) and Copenhagen (1910). During the Balkan wars Kolarov served as a second lieutenant in the 13th Rila Regiment of 7th Rila Division of the Bulgarian army.Dimitrova, Snezhana. Of Other Balkan Wars: Affective Worlds of Modern and Traditional (The Bulgarian Example). In: Perceptions: Journal of Foreign Affairs, Ankara, 2013, p. 48, note 7. 1913 Kolarov was elected to the Bulgarian National Assembly. Kolarov participated in the September 1915 Zimmerwald Conference but at the time he remained at aloof from the revolutionary Zimmerwald Left. Kolarov was also the delegate of the Tesniak organization to the 1917 Socialist conference held in Stockholm. In April 1919 the Bulgarian Communist Party was established, with Kolarov elected the first Secretary of its Central Committee. In 1920, Kolarov was arrested in Romania and was thus unable to attend the 2nd World Congress of the Communist International, although he was able to attend the 3rd World Congress held in Moscow the following year as the representative of the Bulgarian Communist Party. Kolarov was elected to the Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI) and became a key functionary in the Comintern. Early in 1923, he travelled to Central and Western Europe on behalf of the Comintern, attending Communist gatherings in Paris, Frankfurt, Oslo, and Prague.Lazitch and Drachkovitch, Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern, pg. 225. In June 1923, Kolarov spoke at the 3rd Enlarged Plenum of ECCI in Moscow before returning secretly to Bulgaria at the end of the month. There he was promptly arrested but released on 5 August. Upon his release, Kolarov played a critical role along with Georgi Dimitrov in convincing the Bulgarian Communist Party to organize an insurrection in accordance with Comintern instructions. Kolarov was a member of the revolutionary committee which launched that uprising in September 1923. This attempted revolution failed and Kolarov was forced to flee to the Soviet Union by way of Yugoslavia and Austria. He remained in exile for more than two decades. Kolarov remained a top official of the Communist International, presiding over the body's debates at the 5th World Congress of 1924. He was re-elected to ECCI and its governing Presidium at the 5th, 6th, and 7th Congresses. Kolarov was President of the Executive Committee of the Peasant International (Krestintern) from 1928 until its dissolution in 1939. He also served as director of the International Agrarian Institute in Moscow during this period. In 1943, Kolarov signed the document formally dissolving the Communist International. Return to Bulgaria Kolarov returned to Bulgaria in 1945 during its occupation by the Soviet Union, and was elected to the National Assembly again. He was reelected in 1946 and became provisional president of Bulgaria that year, amidst the growing domination of the communists. He remained president until the formation of the government headed by Dimitrov in December 1947, which he entered as deputy prime minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs. When Dimitrov died in July 1949, Kolarov was elected to Dimitrov's old post as prime minister. He served until his own death a few months later. Death and legacy He died in Sofia on 23 January 1950. His city of birth, Shumen, was named Kolarovgrad in his honor between 1950 and 1965.

Prehistoric music is followed by ancient music in different parts of the world, but still exists in isolated areas. However, it is more common to refer to the \\"prehistoric\\" music which still survives as folk, indigenous or traditional music. Prehistoric music is studied alongside other periods within music archaeology. Findings from Paleolithic archaeology sites suggest that prehistoric people used carving and piercing tools to create instruments. Archeologists have found Paleolithic flutes carved from bones in which lateral holes have been pierced. The Divje Babe flute, carved from a cave bear femur, is thought to be at least 40,000 years old. Instruments such as the seven-holed flute and various types of stringed instruments, such as the Ravanahatha, have been recovered from the Indus Valley Civilization archaeological sites.The Music of India By Reginald MASSEY, Jamila MASSEY. Google Books India has one of the oldest musical traditions in the world‚Äîreferences to Indian classical music (marga) are found in the Vedas, ancient scriptures of the Hindu tradition. The earliest and largest collection of prehistoric musical instruments was found in China and dates back to between 7000 and 6600 BCE. Origins of prehistoric instruments The use of the term 'music' is problematic within prehistory. It may be that, as in the traditional music of much of sub-Saharan Africa, the concept of 'music', as we understand it, was somewhat different. Many languages traditionally have terms for music that include dance, religion or cult. The context in which prehistoric music took place has also become a subject of much study, as the sound made by music in prehistory would have been somewhat different depending on the acoustics present. Some cultures have certain instances of their music intending to imitate natural sounds. In some instances, this feature is related to shamanistic beliefs or practice. It may also serve entertainment (game) or practical functions (for example, luring animals in hunt). It is likely that the first musical instrument was the human voice itself, which can make a vast array of sounds, from singing, humming and whistling through to clicking, coughing and yawning. (See Darwin‚Äôs Origin of Species on music and speech.) The oldest known Neanderthal hyoid bone with the modern human form has been dated to be 60,000 years old, predating the oldest known Paleolithic bone flute by some 20,000 years, but the true chronology may date back much further. Music can be theoretically traced to prior to the Paleolithic age. The anthropological and archaeological designation suggests that music first arose (among humans) when stone tools first began to be used by hominids. The noises produced by work such as pounding seed and roots into meal are a likely source of rhythm created by early humans. The first rhythm instruments or percussion instruments most likely involved the clapping of hands, stones hit together, or other things that are useful to create rhythm. Examples of paleolithic objects which are considered unambiguously musical are bone flutes or pipes; paleolithic finds which are currently open to interpretation include pierced phalanges (usually interpreted as \\"phalangeal whistles\\"), bullroarers, and rasps. These musical instruments date back as far as the paleolithic, although there is some ambiguityhttp://www.dar.cam.ac.uk over archaeological finds which can be variously interpreted as either musical or non-musical instruments/tools. Another possible origin of music is motherese, the vocal-gestural communication between mothers and infants. This form of communication involves melodic, rhythmic and movement patterns as well as the communication of intention and meaning, and in this sense is similar to music.Dissanayake, E. (2000). Antecedents of the temporal arts in early mother-infant interaction. In The origins of music. Edited by Nils Wallin, Bjorn Merker and Steven Brown, pp. 389‚Äì410. Cambridge, MA: Massachusetts Institute of Technology, pg 389‚Äì410 Miller suggests musical displays play a role in \\"demonstrating fitness to mate\\". Based on the ideas of honest signal and the handicap principle, Miller suggested that music and dancing, as energetically costly activities, were to demonstrate the physical and psychological fitness of the singing and dancing individual to the prospective mates.Miller, G. (2000). Evolution of human music through sexual selection. In The origins of music. Edited by Nils Wallin, Bjorn Merker and Steven Brown, pp. 329‚Äì360.

Such work has included acoustic field tests to capture and analyse the impulse response of archaeological sites; acoustic tests of lithophones or 'rock gongs'; and reconstructions of soundscapes as experimental archaeology. An academic research network, the Acoustics and Music of British Prehistory Research Network, has explored this field. Africa=Egypt In prehistoric Egypt, music and chanting were commonly used in magic and rituals. The ancient Egyptians credited the goddess Bat with the invention of music. The cult of Bat was eventually syncretised into that of Hathor because both were depicted as cows. Hathor's music was believed to have been used by Osiris as part of his effort to civilise the world. The lion-goddess Bastet was also considered a goddess of music. Rhythms during this time were unvaried and music served to create rhythm. Small shells were used as whistles. During the predynastic period of Egyptian history, funerary chants continued to play an important role in Egyptian religion and were accompanied by clappers or a flute. Despite the lack of physical evidence in some cases, Egyptologists theorise that the development of certain instruments known of the Old Kingdom period, such as the end-blown flute, took place during this time. Asia=China In 1986, several gudi (literally \\"bone flutes\\") were found in Jiahu in Henan Province, China. They date to about 7000 BCE. They have between 6 and 9 holes each and were made from the hollow bones of a bird, the red-crowned crane. At the time of the discovery, one was found to be still playable. The bone flute plays both the five- or seven-note scale of Xia Zhi and six-note scale of Qing Shang of the ancient Chinese musical system. India India has one of the oldest musical traditions in the world‚Äîreferences to Indian classical music (marga) are found in the Vedas, ancient scriptures of the Hindu tradition. Instruments such as the seven-holed flute and various types of stringed instruments, such as the Ravanahatha, have been recovered from the Indus Valley Civilization archaeological sites.The Music of India By Reginald MASSEY, Jamila MASSEY. Google Books Australia Performance of Aboriginal song and dance in the Australian National Maritime Museum in Sydney. Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander music includes the music of Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders. Music has formed an integral part of the social, cultural and ceremonial observances of these people, down through the millennia of their individual and collective histories to the present day, and has existed for 40,000 years. The traditional forms include many aspects of performance and musical instrumentation which are unique to particular regions or Indigenous Australian groups; there are equally elements of musical tradition which are common or widespread through much of the Australian continent, and even beyond. The culture of the Torres Strait Islanders is related to that of adjacent parts of New Guinea and so their music is also related. Music is a vital part of Indigenous Australians' cultural maintenance.Wilurarra Creative (2010). Music  Traditional instruments Didgeridoo= Buskers playing didgeridoos at Fremantle Markets, 2009 A didgeridoo is a type of musical instrument that, according to western musicological classification, falls into the category of aerophone. It is one of the oldest instruments to date. It consists of a long tube, without finger holes, through which the player blows. It is sometimes fitted with a mouthpiece of beeswax. Didgeridoos are traditionally made of eucalyptus, but contemporary materials such as PVC piping are used. In traditional situations it is played only by men, usually as an accompaniment to ceremonial or recreational singing, or, much more rarely, as a solo instrument. Skilled players use the technique of circular breathing to achieve a continuous sound, and also employ techniques for inducing multiple harmonic resonances. Although traditionally the instrument was not widespread around the country ‚Äì it was only used by Aboriginal groups in the most northerly areas . = Clapsticks = A clapstick is a type of musical instrument that, according to western musicological classification, falls into the category of percussion. Unlike drumsticks, which are generally used to strike a drum, clapsticks are intended for striking one stick on another, and people as well. They are of oval shape with paintings of snakes, lizards, birds and more. = Gum leaf = Used as a hand-held free reed instrument. = Bull Roarer = A bullroarer consists of a weighted airfoil (a rectangular thin slat of wood about (6 in) to (24 in) long and about (0.5 in) to (2 in) wide) attached to a long cord. Typically, the wood slat is trimmed down to a sharp edge around the edges, and serrations along the length of the wooden slat may or may not be used, depending on the cultural traditions of the region in question. The cord is given a slight initial twist, and the roarer is then swung in a large circle in a horizontal plane, or in a smaller circle in a vertical plane. The aerodynamics of the roarer will keep it spinning about its axis even after the initial twist has unwound. The cord winds fully first in one direction and then the other, alternating. It makes a characteristic roaring vibrato sound with notable sound modulations occurring from the rotation of the roarer along its longitudinal axis, and the choice of whether a shorter or longer length of cord is used to spin the bullroarer. By modifying the expansiveness of its circuit and the speed given it, and by changing the plane in which the bullroarer is whirled from horizontal to vertical or vice versa, the modulation of the sound produced can be controlled, making the coding of information possible. * Audio/visual demonstration * Sound modulation by changing orbital plane. The low-frequency component of the sound travels extremely long distances, clearly audible over many miles on a quiet night. Various cultures have used bullroarers as musical, ritual, and religious instruments and long-range communication devices for at least 19,000 years. Bullroarers have been used in initiation ceremonies and in burials to ward off evil spirits, bad tidings, and especially women and children. Bullroarers are considered secret men's business by all or almost all Aboriginal tribal groups, and hence forbidden for women, children, non-initiated men, or outsiders to even hear. Fison and Howitt documented this in \\"Kamilaroi and Kurnai\\" (page 198). Anyone caught breaching the imposed secrecy was to be punished by death. They are used in men's initiation ceremonies, and the sound they produce is considered in some indigenous cultures to represent the sound of the Rainbow Serpent. In the cultures of southeastern Australia, the sound of the bullroarer is the voice of Daramulan, and a successful bullroarer can only be made if it has been cut from a tree containing his spirit. Use of Bullroarers have also been documented in Ancient Greece, Britain, Ireland, Scandinavia, Mali, New Zealand, and the Americas, see Bullroarer. Banks Island Eskimos were still using Bullroarers, circa 1963, 59 year old \\"Susie\\" scaring off four polar bears armed only with three seal hooks as such and vocals. Aleut, Eskimo and Inuit used bullroarers occasionally as a children's toy or musical instruments, but preferred drums and rattles.Inuit Music Europe=Germany In 2008, archaeologists discovered a bone flute in the Hohle Fels cave near Ulm, Germany. The five-holed flute has a V-shaped mouthpiece and is made from a vulture wing bone. The researchers involved in the discovery officially published their findings in the journal Nature in June 2009. It is one of several similar instruments found in the area, which date to at least 35,000 years ago, making this one of the oldest confirmed finds of any musical instruments in history. The Hohle Fels flute was found next to the Venus of Hohle Fels and a short distance from the oldest known human carving. On announcing the discovery, scientists suggested that the \\"finds demonstrate the presence of a well-established musical tradition at the time when modern humans colonized Europe\\". Scientists have also suggested that the discovery of the flute may help to explain why early humans survived, while Neanderthals became extinct. Greece Cycladic statues of a double flute player (foreground) and a harpist (background) On the island of Keros (ŒöŒ≠œÅŒøœÇ), two marble statues from the late Neolithic culture called Early Cycladic culture (2900‚Äì2000 BCE) were discovered together in a single grave in the 19th century. They depict a standing double flute player and a sitting musician playing a triangular-shaped lyre or harp. The harpist is approximately high and dates to around 2700‚Äì2500 BCE. He expresses concentration and intense feelings and tilts his head up to the light. The meaning of these and many other figures is not known; perhaps they were used to ward off evil spirits or had religious significance or served as toys or depicted figures from mythology. Ireland Aurignacian flute made from a vulture bone, Geissenkl√∂sterle (Swabia), which is about 35,000 years old. The oldest known wooden pipes were discovered in Wicklow, Ireland, in the winter of 2003, carbon-dated at around 2167¬±30 BCE. A wood-lined pit contained a group of six flutes made from yew wood, between long, tapered at one end, but without any finger holes. They may once have been strapped together. Slovenia The oldest flute ever discovered may be the so-called Divje Babe flute, found in the Cerkno Hills, Slovenia in 1995, though this is disputed. The item in question is a fragment of the femur of a juvenile cave bear, and has been dated to about 43,000 years ago.Flute History, UCLA. Retrieved June 2007. However, whether it is truly a musical instrument or simply a carnivore-chewed bone is a matter of ongoing debate. In 2012 some flutes, that were discovered years earlier in the Gei√üenkl√∂sterle cave, received a new high-resolution carbon-dating examination yielding an age of 42,000 to 43,000 years. The Americas=Canada For thousands of years, Canada has been inhabited by Indigenous Peoples [Aboriginal peoples in Canada] from a variety of different cultures and of several major linguistic groupings. Each of the Indigenous communities had (and have) their own unique musical traditions. Chanting ‚Äì singing is widely popular, with many of its performers also using a variety of musical instruments. They used the materials at hand to make their instruments for thousands of years before Europeans immigrated to the new world. They made gourds and animal horns into rattles which were elaborately carved and beautifully painted. In woodland areas, they made horns of birchbark along with drumsticks of carved antlers and wood. Drums were generally made of carved wood and animal hides. These musical instruments provide the background for songs and dances.

He was born at Savignano, near Rimini, and studied at Bologna and Rome. Having weakened his eyesight by the study of documents of the Middle Ages, he turned his attention to epigraphy and numismatics. At Rome he arranged and cataloged several collections of coins, amongst them those of the Vatican, a task which he undertook for Pope Pius VII. In consequence of the disturbances of 1821, Borghesi retired to San Marino, where he died in 1860. Although mainly an enthusiastic student, he was for some time podest√† of the little republic. His monumental work, Nuovi Frammenti dei Fasti Consolari Capitolini (1818‚Äì1820), attracted the attention of the learned world as furnishing positive bases for the chronology of Roman history, while his contributions to Italian archaeological journals established his reputation as a numismatist and antiquarian. Before his death, Borghesi conceived the design of publishing a collection of all the Latin inscriptions of the Roman world. The work was taken up by the Academy of Berlin under the auspices of Theodor Mommsen, and the result was the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum. Napoleon III ordered the publication of a complete edition of the works of Borghesi. This edition, in ten volumes, of which the first appeared in 1862, was not completed until 1897.

Cultural capital functions as a social relation within an economy of practices (i.e., system of exchange), and includes the accumulated cultural knowledge that confers social status and power.Harker, 1990:13Barker, Chris. 2004. \\"Cultural capital.\\" Pp. 37 in The Sage Dictionary of Cultural Studies. London: SAGE Publications. It comprises all of the material and symbolic goods, without distinction, that society considers rare and worth seeking.The Dictionary of Human Geography (5th ed.). 2009. p. 127. The concept was coined by Pierre Bourdieu and Jean-Claude Passeron in \\"Cultural Reproduction and Social Reproduction\\" (1977). It was expanded on by Bourdieu in his essay \\"The Forms of Capital\\" (1985) and his book The State Nobility: √âlite Schools in the Field of Power (1996). In the essay, Bourdieu describes cultural capital as a person's education (knowledge and intellectual skills) that provides advantage in achieving a higher social- status in society.Bourdieu, Pierre. [1985] 1986. \\"The Forms of Capital.\\" Pp. 46‚Äì58 in Handbook of Theory of Research for the Sociology of Education. There are three types of cultural capital: embodied capital; objectified capital, and institutionalised capital.  Origin  In \\"Cultural Reproduction and Social Reproduction\\" (1977), Pierre Bourdieu and Jean-Claude Passeron presented cultural capital to conceptually explain the differences among the levels of performance and academic achievement of children within the educational system of France in the 1960s. Bourdieu further developed the concept in his essay \\"The Forms of Capital\\" (1985) and in his book The State Nobility: √âlite Schools in the Field of Power (1996). In the essay, Bourdieu lists cultural capital among two other categories of capital: economic capital, which refers to the command of economic resources (money, assets, property); and social capital, which is the actual and potential resources linked to the possession of a durable network of institutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance and recognition. Types Cultural capital and its types. There are three types of cultural capital: embodied capital; objectified capital, and institutionalised capital.  Embodied cultural capital  Embodied cultural capital comprises the knowledge that is consciously acquired and passively inherited, by socialization to culture and tradition. Unlike property, cultural capital is not transmissible, but is acquired over time, as it is impressed upon the person's habitus (i.e., character and way of thinking), which, in turn, becomes more receptive to similar cultural influences. Linguistic cultural capital is the mastery of language and its relations; the embodied cultural capital, which is a person's means of communication and self-presentation, acquired from the national culture.Bourdieu, 1990:114. =Habitus and field= The cultural capital of a person is linked to his or her habitus (i.e., embodied disposition and tendencies) and field (i.e., social positions), which are configured as a social-relation structure.King, 2005:223 The habitus of a person is composed of the intellectual dispositions inculcated to him or her by family and the familial environment, and are manifested according to the nature of the person.Harker, 1990, p. 10.Webb, 2002, p. 37.Gorder, 1980, p. 226. As such, the social formation of a person's habitus is influenced by family,Harker et al., 1990, p.11 by objective changes in social class,King, 2005, p. 222. and by social interactions with other people in daily life;Gorder, 1980, p. 226 moreover, the habitus of a person also changes when he or she changes social positions within the field.Harker, 1990, p. 11. The field is the place of social position that is constituted by the conflicts that occur when social groups endeavour to establish and define what is cultural capital, within a given social space; therefore, depending upon the social field, one type of cultural capital can simultaneously be legitimate and illegitimate. In that way, the legitimization (societal recognition) of a type of cultural capital can be arbitrary and derived from symbolic capital.  Objectified cultural capital  Objectified cultural capital comprises the person's property (e.g. a work of art, scientific instruments, etc.) that can be transmitted for economic profit (buying-and-selling) and for symbolically conveying the possession of cultural capital facilitated by owning such things. Yet, whilst possessing a work of art (objectified cultural-capital) the person can consume the art (understand its cultural meaning) only with the proper conceptual and historical foundations of prior cultural-capital. As such, cultural capital is not transmitted in the sale of the work of art, except by coincidental and independent causation, when the seller explains the artwork's significance to the buyer.  Institutionalized cultural capital  Institutionalized cultural capital comprises an institution's formal recognition of a person's cultural capital, usually academic credentials or professional qualifications. The greatest social role of institutionalized cultural-capital is in the labor market (a job), wherein it allows the expression of the person's array of cultural capital as qualitative and quantitative measurements (which are compared against the measures of cultural capital of other people). The institutional recognition facilitates the conversion of cultural capital into economic capital, by serving as a heuristic (practical solution) with which the seller can describe his or her cultural capital to the buyer. Theoretical research The concept of cultural capital has received widespread attention all around the world, from theorists and researchers alike. It is mostly employed in relation to the education system, but on the odd occasion has been used or developed in other discourses. Use of Bourdieu's cultural capital can be broken up into a number of basic categories. First, are those who explore the theory as a possible means of explanation or employ it as the framework for their research. Second, are those who build on or expand Bourdieu's theory. Finally, there are those who attempt to disprove Bourdieu's findings or to discount them in favour of an alternative theory. The majority of these works deal with Bourdieu's theory in relation to education, only a small number apply his theory to other instances of inequality in society. Traditional application Those researchers and theorists who explore or employ Bourdieu's theory use it in a similar way as it was articulated by Bourdieu. They usually apply it uncritically, and depending on the measurable indicators of cultural capital and the fields within which they measure it, Bourdieu's theory either works to support their argument totally, or in a qualified way. These works to help portray the usefulness of Bourdieu's concept in analysing (mainly educational) inequality but they do not add anything to the theory. One work that does employ Bourdieu's work in an enlightening way is that of Emirbayer & Williams (2005), who use Bourdieu's notion of fields and capital to examine the power relations in the field of social services, particularly homeless shelters.Emirbayer, Mustafa, and Eva M. Williams. 2005. \\"Bourdieu and Social Work.\\" Social Service Review 79(4):689‚Äì724. . . The authors talk of the two separate fields that operate in the same geographic location (the shelter) and the types of capital that are legitimate and valued in each. Specifically they show how homeless people can possess \\"staff-sanctioned capital\\" or \\"client-sanctioned capital\\" and show how in the shelter, they are both at the same time, desirable and undesirable, valued and disparaged, depending on which of the two fields they are operating in. Although the authors do not clearly define staff-sanctioned and client-sanctioned capital as cultural capital, and state that usually the resources that form these two capitals are gathered from a person's life as opposed to their family, it can be seen how Bourdieu's theory of cultural capital can be a valuable theory in analyzing inequality in any social setting. Expansion A number of works expand Bourdieu's theory of cultural capital in a beneficial manner, without deviating from Bourdieu's framework of the different forms of capital. In fact, these authors can be seen to explore unarticulated areas of Bourdieu's theory as opposed to constructing a new theory. On the other hand, some have introduced new variables into Bourdieu's concept of cultural capital. The work of Emmison & Frow (1998) centers on an exploration of the ability of Information Technology to be considered a form of cultural capital.Emmison, M., and J. Frow. 1998. \\"Information Technology as Cultural Capital.\\" Australian Universities Review 1(1998):41-45. The authors state that \\"a familiarity with, and a positive disposition towards the use of bourgeoisie technologies of the information age can be seen as an additional form of cultural capital bestowing advantage on those families that possess them.\\" Specifically computers are \\"machines\\" that form a type of objectified cultural capital, and the ability to use them is an embodied type of cultural capital. This work is useful because it shows the ways in which Bourdieu's concept of cultural capital can be expanded and updated to include cultural goods and practices which are progressively more important in determining achievement both in the school and without. Dolby (2000) cites the work of Hage, who uses Bourdieu's theory of cultural capital to explore multiculturalism and racism in Australia.Dolby, N. 2000. \\"Race, National, State: Multiculturalism in Australia.\\" Arena Magazine (45):48‚Äì51. Hage's discussion around race is distinct from Bourdieu's treatment of migrants and their amount of linguistic capital and habitus. Hage actually conceives of \\"whiteness\\" as being a form of cultural capital. 'White' is not a stable, biologically determined trait, but a \\"shifting set of social practices.\\" He conceptualizes the nation as a circular field, with the hierarchy moving from the powerful center (composed of 'white' Australians) to the less powerful periphery (composed of the 'others'). The 'others' however are not simply dominated, but are forced to compete with each other for a place closer to the centre. This use of Bourdieu's notion of capital and fields is extremely illuminating to understand how people of non-Anglo ethnicities may try and exchange the cultural capital of their ethnic background with that of 'whiteness' to gain a higher position in the hierarchy. It is especially useful to see it in these terms as it exposes the arbitrary nature of what is \\"Australian\\", and how it is determined by those in the dominant position (mainly 'white' Australians). In a path-breaking study, Bauder (2006) uses the notions of habitus and cultural capital to explain the situation of migrants in the labor market and society.Bauder, Harald. 2006. Labor Movement: How Migration Regulates Labor Markets. New York: Oxford University Press. Bourdieu's theory has been expanded to reflect modern forms of cultural capital. For instance, studies conducted by Asaf Nissenbaum and Limor Shifman (2017) on the topic of internet memes, utilising the website 4chan to analyse how these memes can be seen as forms of cultural capital.‚òÉ‚òÉ Discourse demonstrates the different forums and mediums that memes can be expressed through, such as different 'boards' on 4chan. Additionally, scholars have extended Bourdieu's theory to the field of religion where embodied cultural capital allows middle classes for developing distinctive religious styles and tastes. Through these styles and tastes, they draw symbolic class boundaries in opposition to co-believers from lower-class backgrounds. = Education = Sociologist Paul DiMaggio expands on Bourdieu's view on cultural capital and its influence on education: \\"Following Bourdieu, I measure high school students' cultural capital using self-reports of involvement in art, music, and literature.\\" Retired teacher John Taylor Gatto, in his article \\"Against School\\" (2003), addresses education in modern schooling. The relation of cultural capital can be linked to Alexander Inglis' Principles of Secondary Education (1918), which indicates how American schooling is what like Prussian schooling in the 1820s. The objective was to divide children into sections, by distributing them by subject, by age, and by test score. Inglis introduces six basic functions for modern schooling; the third, fourth, and fifth basic functions listed bt Inglis are related to cultural capital, and describe the manner in which schooling enforces the cultural capital of each child, from a young age: * Diagnosis and direction (function #3):‚ÜµSchool is meant to determine the proper social role of each student, by logging mathematic and anecdotal evidence into cumulative records. * Differentiation (function #4): Once the social role of a student is determined, the children are sorted by role and trained only as merited for his or her social destination. * Selection (function #5): This refers to Darwin's theory of natural selection applied to \\"the favoured races\\". The idea is to help American society by consciously attempting to improve the breeding stock. Schools are meant to tag the socially unfit with poor grades, remedial- schooling placement, and other notable social punishments that their peers will then view and accept them as intellectually inferior, and effectively bar them from the reproductive (sexual, economic, and cultural) sweepstakes of life. That was the purpose of petty humiliation in school: \\"It was the dirt down the drain.\\" The three functions are directly related to cultural capital, because through schooling children are discriminated by social class and cognitively placed into the destination that will make them fit to sustain that social role. That is the path leading to their determined social class; and, during the fifth function, they will be socially undesirable to the privileged children, and so kept in a low social stratum. Stanton-Salazar & Dornbusch (1995) examine how those people with the desired types of cultural (and linguistic) capital in a school transform this capital into \\"instrumental relations\\" or social capital with institutional agents who can transmit valuable resources to the person, furthering their success in the school.Stanton-Salazar, Ricardo D., and Sanford M. Dornbusch. 1995. \\"Social Capital and the Reproduction of Inequality: Information Networks among Mexican-Origin High School Students.\\" Sociology of Education 68(2):116‚Äì35. . . They state that this is simply an elaboration of Bourdieu's theory. Similarly, Dumais (2002) introduces the variable of gender to determine the ability of cultural capital to increase educational achievement.Dumais, Susan A. 2002. \\"Cultural Capital, Gender, and School Success: The Role of Habitus.\\" Sociology of Education 75(1):44‚Äì68. . . . The author shows how gender and social class interact to produce different benefits from cultural capital. In fact in Distinction, Bourdieu states \\"sexual properties are as inseparable from class properties as the yellowness of lemons is inseparable from its acidity.\\"Bourdieu, Pierre. 1984. Distinction. p. 107. He simply did not articulate the differences attributable to gender in his general theory of reproduction in the education system. = Cultural omnivores = Extending the theory of cultural capital, Richard A. Peterson and A. Simkus (1992) distinguish the (secondary) analysis of survey data on Americans exclusively.Peterson, Richard A., and A. Simkus. 1992. \\"How musical tastes mark occupational status groups.\\" They use the term cultural omnivores as a particular higher status section in the US that has broader cultural engagements and tastes spanning an eclectic range from highbrow arts to popular culture. Originally, it was Peterson (1992) who coined the term to address an anomaly observed in the evidence revealed by his work with Simkus (1992), which showed that people of higher social status, contrary to elite- mass models of cultural taste developed by French scholars with French data, were not averse to participation in activities associated with popular culture. The work rejected the universal adaptation of the cultural capital theory, especially in the 20th century in advanced post-industrialist societies like the United States. = Science capital = In the UK, Louise Archer and colleagues (2015) developed the concept of science capital. The concept of science capital draws from the work of Bourdieu, particularly his studies focusing on the reproduction of social inequalities in society. Science capital is made up of science-related cultural capital and social capital as well as habitus. It encapsulates the various influences that a young person's life experiences can have on their science identity and participation in science-related activities. The empirical work on science capital builds from a growing body of data into students' aspirations and attitudes to science, including University College London's ASPIRES ResearchASPIRES Research. University College, London. 2020. and King‚Äôs College London's Enterprising Science.Enterprising Science The concept of science capital was developed as a way to understand why these science-related resources, attitudes and aspirations led some children to pursue science, while others did not. The concept provides policy makers and practitioners with a useful framework to help understand what shapes young people's engagement with (and potential resistance to) science. Criticism Criticisms of Bourdieu's concept have been made on many grounds, including a lack of conceptual clarity. Perhaps due to this lack of clarity, researchers have operationalised the concept in diverse ways, and have varied in their conclusions. While some researchers may be criticised for using measures of cultural capital which focus only on certain aspects of 'highbrow' culture, this is a criticism which could also be leveled at Bourdieu's own work. Several studies have attempted to refine the measurement of cultural capital in order to examine which aspects of middle-class culture actually have value in the education system. It has been claimed that Bourdieu's theory, and in particular his notion of habitus, is entirely deterministic, leaving no place for individual agency or even individual consciousness. However, Bourdieu never claimed to have done so entirely, but defined a new approach; that is, Bourdieu's work attempts to reconcile the paradoxical dichotomy of structure and agency. Some scholars such as John Goldthorpe dismiss Bourdieu's approach: Bourdieu has also been criticised for his lack of consideration of gender. Kanter (in Robinson & Garnier 1986) points out the lack of interest in gender inequalities in the labour market in Bourdieu's work.Robinson, R., and M. Garnier. [1986] 2000. \\"Class Reproduction Among Men and Women in France: Reproduction Theory on its Home Ground.\\" Pp. 144‚Äì53 in Pierre Bourdieu Volume I, edited by D. Robbins. London: Sage Publications. However, Bourdieu addressed the topic of gender head-on in his 2001 book Masculine Domination, in which he states on the first page of the prelude that he considers masculine domination to be a prime example of symbolic violence.

Electoral district Located in the west-end of Toronto, the riding is made up largely of the old City of York, a southwestern portion of the old city of North York, and parts of the old city of Toronto north of High Park. A sizeable portion of the land in the western part of the riding which was previously part of the old City of York was the old village of Weston until that village was absorbed into the City of York in 1968. The riding has a largely working class and immigrant population. Its geographic boundaries are the part of the City of Toronto bounded by a line drawn from Humber River east along Highway 401, south along the Canadian National Railway situated west of Caledonia Road, west along Rogers Road, southeast along Old Weston Road, west along Lavender Road, south along Keele Street, southeast along the Canadian National/Canadian Pacific Railway, west along the Canadian Pacific Railway, and north along the Humber River to Highway 401. Former boundaries York South‚ÄîWeston was created in 1976 from parts of York South, York West, Davenport, High Park‚ÄîHumber Valley, and Etobicoke ridings. Its new boundaries were originally of the part of Metropolitan Toronto bounded by a line drawn from Eglinton Avenue West north along Keele Street, west along Lawrence Avenue West, south along the Humber River, east and north along the north limit of the City of Toronto, south along Runnymede Road, east along Annette Street, south along Keele Street, east along Humberside Avenue, northwest along the Canadian National Railway, east along the north limit of the City of Toronto, north along the east side of Prospect Cemetery, and west along Eglinton Avenue West to Keele Street. In 1987, York South‚ÄîWeston was redefined to consist of the parts of the cities of North York, Toronto and York bounded by a line drawn from the western limit of the City of North York east along Highway 401, south along Keele Street, west along Eglinton Avenue West, south along Keele Street, west along the southern limit of the City of York, southeast along the Canadian National Railway line, west along Dupont Street, northwest along Dundas Street West, west along Annette Street, north along Runnymede Road, west along the Canadian Pacific Railway line, and north along the western limits of the Cities of York and North York to Highway 401. In 1996, it was redefined to consist of the parts of the cities of North York, Toronto and York bounded by a line drawn from the western limit of the City of North York east along Highway 401, southeast along the Canadian National Railway situated immediately west of Caledonia Road, west along Rogers Road, south along Old Weston Road, west along the northern limit of the City of Toronto, southeast along the Canadian National Railway, west along the Canadian Pacific Railway, and north along the western limit of the cities of York and North York to Highway 401. In 2003, it was given its current boundaries as described above. This riding was unchanged during the 2012 electoral redistribution.

It suffered the highest casualty count of any brigade in the history of the United States Army, with some 1,172 killed in action. Organization and early battles The \\"Old Brigade\\" served from 1861 to 1865 and was one of two brigades from Vermont, both famous in their own right. The First Vermont Brigade was organized in October 1861, primarily through the efforts of Maj. Gen. William F. \\"Baldy\\" Smith. It was composed of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th Vermont regiments, which had been individually mustered into service between June and September, for a time, it also included the 26th New Jersey Infantry. Its first commander was Brig. Gen. William T. H. Brooks. In April 1862, the brigade was incorporated into the Army of the Potomac as the 2nd Brigade, 2nd Division, VI Corps, and first saw action during Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan's Peninsula Campaign in the battles of Williamsburg and Savage's Station. It later was present at Antietam and Fredericksburg. Under the command of Brig. Gen. Lewis A. Grant, the Vermonters fought in the campaign culminating in the Battle of Chancellorsville. The Vermonters participated in VI Corps' capture of Marye's Heights in the Second Battle of Fredericksburg and then were prominent in the fighting at Salem Church. They were held in reserve during the Battle of Gettysburg, holding a flank guard position behind Big Round Top, losing only one man wounded. After the Gettysburg Campaign, elements of the Vermont Brigade were sent to help quell the draft riots in New York City. The Overland Campaign The depleted brigade received reinforcements in May 1864 when the 11th Vermont Infantry was assigned to the organization. That same month, the Army of the Potomac, under the overall supervision of Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, began its spring offensive (the Overland Campaign) towards Richmond. The Vermont Brigade mustered approximately 2,850 soldiers at the start of the campaign. On the morning of May 5, the Union army attacked Gen. Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia at the Battle of the Wilderness. While the initial Union attack was successful, rough terrain and stubborn resistance ground down the attack. By midday, Lt. Gen. A.P. Hill's Confederate corps had been brought up and was attacking the weak Union center along the Orange Plank Road. Maj. Gen. George W. Getty's brigades were ordered by Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock, who was still bringing up most of his corps, to hold the road and counterattack. The Vermont Brigade took the southern flank and charged the advancing Confederates. Ordered to retreat, the 5th Vermont regiment instead launched a bayonet charge, buying time for Union troops and the rest of the Vermont Brigade to fall back to their hasty works. The Confederates continued to attack until the Union line was stabilized. Losses by the brigade totaled 1,269 killed, wounded, and missing in less than 12 hours of fighting. After the Wilderness, the Union Army moved south to Spotsylvania Court House, where Lee's army had entrenched. The 11th Vermont Infantry joined the brigade at this point. Early in the battle, elements of the Vermont brigade, defending barricades forward of the rest of the Union Army, were ordered to retreat and spike their supporting artillery field pieces before the Confederates overran them. Disobeying orders, the commander of the brigade ordered the guns to be \\"spiked with canister,\\" and the brigade was able to defend the guns and works successfully until reinforcements arrived to stabilize the position. The Vermonters suffered heavily during the ensuing assault on the Confederate defenses as The Vermont Brigade led the assault on the \\"Mule Shoe Salient\\", a protruding network of trenches in the center of the Confederate lines. The final battle of the Overland Campaign was the Battle of Cold Harbor. The Vermont Brigade was one of the units selected to charge Confederate earthworks on June 1, 1864. Grant's attack failed and he suffered heavy losses. In less than 10 minutes, hundreds of soldiers from the Vermont Brigade were killed or wounded. The brigade, in less than one month of fighting, had been reduced from 2,850 men to less than 1,200. Petersburg and the Valley While the Army of the Potomac and the Army of Northern Virginia dug in at Petersburg, Confederate Lt. Gen. Jubal A. Early was sent on a mission through the Shenandoah Valley to the outskirts of Washington, D.C. The Vermont Brigade fought in the Valley Campaign against Early, under the overall command of Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan. At the Battle of Cedar Creek, Early launched a surprise attack against Sheridan's army and the First Vermont Brigade covered the Union army's temporary retreat, prior to Sheridan's counterattack and decisive victory. Lewis Grant commanded the 2nd Division, VI Corps, during the later stages of this action, when Getty became acting corps commander. Col. George P. Foster led the brigade while Grant was in command of the division. Foster's brigade held the center of the division's line until the entire formation retreated in good order. When Brig. Gen. Daniel D. Bidwell fell and his brigade, of the Vermonters' left, was in danger of losing heart, Lt. Col. Winsor B. French, who took command, is reported to have told his men not to fall back until the Vermonters did so. Six Medals of Honor were awarded to Vermonters at Cedar Creek, and the brigade captured three regimental colors and much of the 12th North Carolina regiment. Returning to Petersburg, where it was engaged until the end of the war, the First Vermont Brigade led the attack on the earthworks defending the city, successfully breaking through the Confederate lines on the morning of April 2, 1865. Lewis Grant was wounded in this action and briefly relinquished command. Six members of the brigade were awarded the Medal of Honor for valor for this action. After the surrender of Lee's army later that month, the brigade participated in the victory parade in Washington. It returned to Vermont and the men were mustered out. Many former members of the brigade joined fraternal veterans organizations such as the Grand Army of the Republic and the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States and held reunions to recount their days in the First Vermont Brigade.

Flow diagram is a collective term for a diagram representing a flow or set of dynamic relationships in a system. The term flow diagram is also used as a synonym for flowchart,Robert L. Harris. Information Graphics: A Comprehensive Illustrated Reference. 2000. p. 153-155 and sometimes as a counterpart of the flowchart.Harris. (1999, p. 156) Flow diagrams are used to structure and order a complex system, or to reveal the underlying structure of the elements and their interaction.Urs B. Meyer et al. Process Oriented Analysis: Design and Optimization of Industrial Production Systems. 2006. p. 38.  Overview  The term flow diagram is used in theory and practice in different meanings. Most commonly the flow chart and flow diagram are used in an interchangeable way in the meaning of a representation of a process. For example the Information Graphics: A Comprehensive Illustrated Reference by Harris (1999) gives two separate definitions: :Flow chart or flow diagram... is a diagram that visually displays interrelated information such as events, steps in a process, functions, etc., in an organized fashion, such as sequentially or chronologically.Harris. (1999, p. 153) :Flow diagram [is] a graphic representation of the physical route or flow of people, materials, paperworks, vehicles, or communication associated with a process, procedure plan, or investigation.Harris. (1999, p. 156) In the second definition the meaning is limited to the representation of the physical route or flow. An example of such a diagram is the illustration of the flows in a nuclear submarine propulsion system, which shows different streams back and forth in the system. The representation of such a system can be supplemented by one or more flowcharts, which show the sequence of one of the flows in one direction, or any of the control flows to manage the system. The physical movement of objects from one location to another can also be visualized in a mix of maps and flowchart or sankey diagram, which are called flow maps. Flow maps can indicate on a map, what flows, moves or migrates, in which direction, and in which quantities etc.Harris.

The Embarcadero is the eastern waterfront and roadway of the Port of San Francisco, San Francisco, California, along San Francisco Bay. It was constructed on reclaimed land along a three mile long engineered seawall, from which piers extend into the bay. It derives its name from the Spanish verb embarcar, meaning \\"to embark\\"; embarcadero itself means \\"the place to embark\\". The Central Embarcadero Piers Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 20, 2002. The Embarcadero right-of-way begins at the intersection of Second and King Streets near Oracle Park, and travels north, passing under the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge. The Embarcadero continues north past the Ferry Building at Market Street, Pier 39, and Fisherman's Wharf, before ending at Pier 45. A section of The Embarcadero which ran between Folsom Street and Drumm Street was formerly known as East Street. For three decades, until it was torn down in 1991, the Embarcadero Freeway dominated the area. The subsequent redevelopment and restoration efforts have, according to the National Trust for Historic Preservation, \\"contributed to a remarkable urban waterfront renaissance\\", with the Embarcadero Historic District serving as a \\"major economic engine for the Bay Area\\". History San Francisco's shoreline historically ran south and inland from Clark's Point below Telegraph Hill to present-day Montgomery Street and eastward toward Rincon Point, enclosing a cove named Yerba Buena Cove. As the city grew, the cove was filled. Over fifty years a large offshore seawall was built and the mudflats filled, creating what today is San Francisco's Financial District. The San Francisco Belt Railroad, a short line railroad for freight, ran along The Embarcadero; its former enginehouse has been preserved. The roadway follows the seawall, a boundary first established in the 1860s and not completed until the 1920s. During the early-20th century when the seaport was at its busiest and before the construction of the Bay Bridge, Pier 1, Pier 1¬Ω, Pier 3 and Pier 5 were dedicated chiefly to inland trade and transport. These connections facilitated the growth of communities in the Sacramento- and San Joaquin Valleys and fostered California's agricultural business. Today, these piers comprise the Central Embarcadero Piers Historic District. The Delta Queen docked at Pier 1¬Ω, ferrying people between San Francisco and Sacramento. There was once a pedestrian footbridge that connected Market Street directly with the Ferry building and a subterranean roadway to move cars below the plaza. During World War II, San Francisco's waterfront became a military logistics center; troops, equipment and supplies left the Port in support of the Pacific theater. Almost every pier and wharf was involved in military activities, with troop ships and naval vessels tied up all along the Embarcadero. However, after the completion of the Bay Bridge and the rapid decline of ferries and the Ferry Building, the neighborhood fell into decline. The transition to container shipping, which moved most shipping to Oakland, led to further decline. Automobile transit efforts led to the Embarcadero Freeway being built in the 1950s. This improved automobile access to the Bay Bridge, but detracted aesthetically from the city. For 30 years, the freeway divided the waterfront and the Ferry Building from downtown. It was torn down in 1991, after being severely damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. View from the bay 2007 View of Yerba Buena Island and Bay Bridge After the freeway had been cleared, massive redevelopment began as a grand palm-lined boulevard was created, squares and plazas were created and/or restored, and Muni's N Judah and T Third Street and F Market & Wharves lines were extended to run along it, with the N and T lines going south from Market Street to Fourth and King Streets (at Oracle Park and the Caltrain station) and the F line going north from Market to Fisherman's Wharf. The Muni also relaunched the ‚ÄòE‚Äô line which was historically a seasonal service connecting Fishermans' Wharf to the Caltrain Depot, the line now operates weekends between Jefferson and Jones adjacent Fisherman's Wharf and Fourth and King streets near the Caltrain terminus. The sidewalk along the waterfront between China Basin and Fisherman's Wharf was named \\"Herb Caen Way...\\" after the death of celebrated local columnist Herb Caen in 1997. The three dots, or ellipsis, deliberately are included in honor of columnist Herb Caen's Pulitzer Prize winning writing style. A large public sculpture, Cupid's Span, by Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen, was installed in 2002 along the Rincon Park area. Resembling Cupid's bow and arrow with the arrow implanted in the ground, the artists stated that the statue was inspired by San Francisco's reputation as the home port of Eros, hence the stereotypical bow and arrow of Cupid.Cupid's Span. Chronology of Large-Scale Projects by Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen. oldenburgvanbruggen.com. August 25, 2009. Retrieved November 4, 2012. In 2016, the Embarcadero was named on the list of \\"11 Most Endangered Historic Places\\" in the US by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, citing \\"the dual natural threats of sea-level rise and seismic vulnerability\\" to the seawall. Subway station Embarcadero Station, a BART and Muni Metro subway station, is located at the foot of Market Street, one block from The Embarcadero. While not in the original transit system plans, it has become the most highly trafficked BART station. As it is an infill station, the design is unique among the Market Street Subway. Embarcadero Center Embarcadero Center consists of four 30 to 45 story buildings and the Hyatt Regency San Francisco, located between the Ferry Building and the foot of Market Street. Until 2001, there was a viewing deck on top of the Embarcadero Center. During the winter holidays, the edges of all four buildings are illuminated, the effect resembling the outlines of four giant books on a shelf. Justin Herman Plaza At the eastern end of Market Street is Justin Herman Plaza, opened in 1972, named for M. Justin Herman. Education Right along the Embarcadero Center is the Embarcadero YMCA, the city's flagship branch of a group of a dozen locales. The center features the unique Youth Chance High School, an alternative high school that is a magnet for troubled students from throughout the Bay Area. Seawall upgrade and enhancements projects The Embarcadero seawall is over a century old, originally constructed between 1878 and 1916, and is in need of upgrades in order to ensure its integrity in the event of a major earthquake. the Port of San Francisco, the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, and several other departments are partnering to deliver a project to upgrade the seawall and adjoining public spaces. The project is expected to cost at least $2 billion, and the city successfully passed a ballot measure to issue $425 million in bonds to finance part of the project in November 2016.

The Embarcadero sits on property administered by the Port of San Diego, in the Columbia district of Downtown San Diego. The Embarcadero is home to the San Diego cruise ship terminal, the museum ships at Navy Pier and , seven other historic vessels belonging to the San Diego Maritime Museum, and various restaurants and shops from the North Embarcadero down through Seaport Village. The Port is redeveloping the historic Broadway Pier to create a second cruise-ship pier and terminal. That project is slated for completion in December 2010. Embarcadero Circle Embarcadero Circle is a redevelopment project in the North Embarcadero, located at Broadway and Harbor Drive. It will include the new cruise ship terminal at Broadway Pier, as well as two hotels: a 27-story Marriott hotel with 500 rooms and a concert venue, and a 40-story Hyatt hotel. Embarcadero Circle is located north of the Navy Broadway Complex. North Embarcadero Visionary Plan North Embarcadero in 2006 In 1997, a major redevelopment of the Embarcadero was proposed, to be carried out through a Joint Powers Authority (JPA), composed of the City of San Diego, the Centre City Development Corporation (CCDC), and the Port of San Diego. The proposed redevelopment was called the North Embarcadero Visionary Plan, a multi-phased redevelopment of the waterfront in Downtown San Diego. This redevelopment project proposed to move Harbor Drive to the east and build an esplanade from the B Street Pier to the former Navy Pier along Harbor Drive. It also included public art displays, tree groves and open spaces, while continuing San Diego's tradition of having a working waterfront, according to Port plans.North Embarcadero Visionary Plan at portofsandiego.org The proposed redevelopment area was bordered by Market Street to the south (Marina District), Laurel Street to the north (Little Italy), and the railroad tracks to the east. However, the proposed redevelopment project was sent back to the drawing boards in April 2010 when the California Coastal Commission rejected it. A major issue was the disappearance from the plan of an originally proposed grassy park. In the plan rejected by the Coastal Commission, the park had been replaced by a smaller, hardscape plaza. The Port will now amend its master plan and resubmit its proposal for Coastal Commission approval, a process that can take several years.

It was released in late 1998 in Japan, 1999 in North America, and in 2000 in Europe. The game features a vast array of characters, with over 100 recruitable characters, of which over 40 are usable in combat. Suikoden II takes place years after the events of the original Suikoden and centers on an invasion of the City States of Jowston by the Kingdom of Highland. The player controls a silent protagonist who is the adopted son of Genkaku, a hero who saved the City-State of Jowston in a war against Highland years ago. The protagonist and his best friend, Jowy Atreides, each gain one half of the Rune of the Beginning, one of the 27 True Runes of the Suikoden setting, and become caught up in the intrigues of the invasion and the dark fate of those who bear the halves of that Rune. The game is considered a sleeper hit and was initially released to lackluster sales and somewhat tepid critical reception, with some criticism (and lack of widespread appeal) being directed at the game's simpler and more retro 16-bit sprite visuals at a time when 3D graphics were heavily emphasized across the industry. In retrospect however, it has been cited as one of the greatest video games of all time and a classic of the role-playing genre. Gameplay Suikoden II is a role- playing video game with strategic elements covering those gameplay options pertaining to large scale confrontations, such as between two armies. The player controls a quiet protagonist and travels with him around the world map, advancing the plot by completing tasks and talking with other characters. The player can also recruit new characters to his cause, often involving a short sidequest to do so. In towns, the player can gather information, sharpen characters' weaponry, and buy equipment; wilderness areas generally feature random encounters with monsters. The battle system in Suikoden II features six-person parties. A variety of statistics determine in-game combat ability. If all six characters lose all their hit points and are thus incapacitated, it is game over and the player must restart. Exceptions exist for certain plot battles in which winning is optional; the player can lose and the plot continues on, albeit in a slightly different fashion. Runes, the source of all magic in the world of Suikoden II, are handled the same as the original Suikoden. Characters have a certain number of spell usages per \\"spell level\\"; for instance, a character with 4 level 1 spell slots and a Fire Rune could cast \\"Flaming Arrows\\" (the level 1 Fire Rune spell) 4 times. Other runes offer different benefits, and some may be used as often as desired. Updates from the original Suikoden include a grid and unit based tactical battle system, the addition of a three rune slot system which allows for three different runes to be equipped at once, a party inventory system, and a \\"dash\\" button that allowed the player to move around the screen quicker and vast graphical improvement. Also notable is the inclusion of a variety of mini-games including one quite reminiscent of Iron Chef. A transfer of data from the prior game in the series enables returning characters to enter the fray with higher levels and improved weapons. References to the original Suikoden are also adapted accordingly for a greater feel in continuity. Following the original Suikoden, Suikoden II contains three different types of combat: *Regular battles: The party the player has selected faces off with 1-6 enemies. This battle type is considered typical in RPGs, containing options for attack, magic (Runes), items etc. This is the only battle style where the player can gain experience, items or Potch (the currency of Suikoden II). *Duels: The main character is pitted against another character in single combat. This style of fighting only has three moves: Attack, Wild Attack, and Defend. This duel is played in a Rock, Paper, Scissors style where \\"Attack\\" beats \\"Defend\\", \\"Wild Attack\\" beats \\"Attack\\", and \\"Defend\\" beats \\"Wild Attack\\". The player can usually tell what kind of attack the enemy is going to perform by the taunts displayed on-screen. *Massive battles: More interactivity was added to this element of the gameplay over that of its predecessor. While some of the shades of the old \\"Rock, Paper, Scissors\\" style battle of the original (where cavalry beats archers, archers beat magic and magic beats cavalry) remain, Suikoden II introduces a grid style battle system reminiscent to that of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms or Fire Emblem games. As the main character recruits characters for his castle, this opens up more options for more units. Certain characters are 'unit leaders' while others are 'supports'. Every character adds a certain amount of defense or attack to a unit. In addition, certain characters also add special abilities to the unit to which they have been attached. The numbers affect the chances of win or loss as much as the type of units being pitted against each other. Every unit may take up to a total of two 'losses' which are counted when a unit suffers a severe number of casualties. Each skirmish they take part in might result in no loss, loss on one side, or even loss on both sides. As mentioned before, certain characters add special abilities to the units. Examples of these abilities include being able to take more losses than usual, magic or archery to allow attacks from a distance, healing of itself or others, etc. When a unit suffers its maximum losses it will retreat from battle and, when this happens there is a possibility of the characters in the unit being wounded or even killed. Should a character be killed in a massive battle, they are considered permanently dead. Dialogue between characters in Suikoden 2 is an important part of gameplay. Story=Characters The protagonist of Suikoden II (whose name is decided by the player at the start of the game, originally as Riou) goes from being a member of a youth brigade in the Highland Kingdom to being the leader of its opposition, the New Alliance Army. In acquiring one half of the Rune of the Beginning, he is destined to become honest leader of the newly rebuilt Jowston Army, and also to oppose the holder of the other half of the Rune of the Beginning, Jowy Atreides. The antagonist for the majority of the game is Luca Blight, heir to the throne of Highland. Luca is a brutal and bloodthirsty madman who developed a strong hatred for Jowston at a young age after witnessing his mother's rape by thugs hired by City-State capital Muse to attack the Highland royal envoy. A variety of characters from the original Suikoden appear in Suikoden II. Some such as Viktor play major roles in the story, while others only appear in cameos (such as Kage who is briefly seen talking to Jowy before Mayor Anabelle is killed). If the player has a completed save data from the original Suikoden in their memory card, then the protagonist of the previous game can be recruited and Gremio will appear briefly (if the saved game did not have all 108 characters recruited, Gremio will not appear). Plot The game begins with the player and his childhood friend Jowy Atreides working together as members of the youth division of the Highland Army. Luca Blight, the prince of Highland, and Captain Rowd, the player's commanding officer, orchestrate the slaughter of the player's and Jowy's unit and blame it on the neighboring city-state of Jowston, giving the prince an excuse to invade Jowston. The player and Jowy escape the slaughter by jumping off a cliff into a river. They meet again after the player is fished from the river by a group of mercenaries from the first game‚ÄîViktor and Flik‚Äîand Jowy is rescued by Pilika from the town of Toto. Eventually reuniting with the player's sister, Nanami, the two are tried as spies against Highland and sentenced to death, but are saved by Viktor and Flik and return with the mercenaries. Blight pursues them, driving the group toward the city of Muse. Searching a shrine in Toto, the player and Jowy are each given half of the Rune of Beginning‚Äîthe player is given the Bright Shield Rune, and Jowy the Black Sword Rune. Afterwards, the two are transported by Leknaat out of the shrine, and continue on their travel to Muse. After difficulty entering into Muse due to increased security, the party finally reunite with Viktor and members of the mercenary army that survived the attack. Viktor introduces the player and Jowy to Lady Annabelle‚Äîthe mayor of Muse‚Äîwho tells them she has a story to share regarding the adoptive grandfather/father figure of the player and Nanami, Genkaku, who died shortly before the game begins. Without the knowledge of the others, the player and Jowy are asked to participate in a spy mission to the Highland camp to the north, and while trying to escape, Jowy is captured by the enemy. He promises to catch up with the player and Nanami, however, and eventually reunites with them in Muse. Time passes, and the player awakens on the morning of the Hill Top Summit held in Muse for all of the leaders of the city-state; Muse, Tinto, Two River, South Window, Greenhill, and the Matilda Knightdom. The party all attend the conference, where Annabelle shares the information on the Highland Army's imminent attack. The city-state is split on what action to take, as the Highland Army arrives outside Muse. After successfully defending the city, the player and Nanami go to meet Annabelle for information regarding Genkaku. They arrive, however, to find that Jowy has murdered Anabelle, and immediately flees before he can be discovered. Anabelle then apologizes to the player and Nanami for how the state treated Genkaku, without revealing details about what actually happened. Shortly after Annabelle's last words, her assistant Jess arrives and assumes that the player has killed Anabelle, and runs to get help. Jowy opens the gates to Muse as the Highland army invades the city, with the party managing to escape southward to South Window. In South Window, the mayor asks them to travel to the city of North Window‚ÄîViktor's hometown‚Äîto investigate disturbances that have been occurring there. After discovering that the vampire, Neclord, is alive and causing the disturbances, the party obtain the Star Dragon Sword and drive Neclord from the castle. As the party begin to leave North Window, the rest of the survivors from Muse arrive and tell that South Window has fallen to the Highland Army. With North Window as the site of a new base they begin to build up their forces, and Viktor reveals what Annabelle had wanted to share about Genkaku. He had been a heroic general for the city-state‚Äîwho also wielded the Bright Shield Rune worn by the player‚Äîand was betrayed by the then mayor of Muse, Anabelle's father. He participated in a duel against his Highland friend and fellow general, Han, to decide the fate of Kyaro town. Anabelle's father coated Genkaku's sword in a poison that he detected before the duel began, planning to blame Genkaku for the death of the Highland general. Genkaku could not bring himself to strike his friend, and thus was defeated in the duel, with Kyaro becoming Highland territory and Genkaku's name disgraced for many decades. It is this connection to Genkaku and his own character that lead the player to be named leader of the new Dunan Unification Army, and bring him to recruit people to join the cause. The player and the rest of the Stars of Destiny recruited work to gain the support of the remaining city-states to challenge Highland. During this time, Luca Blight sacrifices nearly the entire populace of Muse to the Beast Rune after running down refugees trying to flee the city. However, Jowy has risen through the ranks of Luca Blight's army after capturing Greenhill without even a battle, eventually marrying Jillia Blight‚Äîthe sister of Luca‚Äîand murdering the King of Highland by poisoning himself and having the King drink his blood as part of a peerage ceremony. Luca becomes King of Highland, and eventually launches an unsuccessful attack against the Dunan army. However, Jowy betrays Luca Blight, giving the Dunan army information of the pending attack. This allows the Dunan army to set up an ambush for Luca Blight. He is defeated and killed with Jowy then ascending to the leader of Highland through his marriage. It is revealed that Jowy's intention since his original betrayal of the city-state by murdering Anabelle has been to bring peace to the land; he never expected the player to have such success against Highland. After finally freeing the occupied city-states and uniting all of them under one banner, the player and the party successfully defeat Highland, causing Jowy to flee, however, Nanami is shot by arrow from one of the soldiers for the king of Matilda, who plotted to assassinate both the player and Jowy. After the fall of the capital of Highland and the Beast Rune's defeat, the player returns to the spot on the cliff from the beginning of the game, when the two first escaped from the youth brigade massacre and promised to return to if they should become separated. Jowy speaks about how the two's fate had been destined to be interconnected since they first accepted the two runes in Toto. The two duel, with Jowy, Nanami, and the player's fate depending on how many Stars of Destiny the player has recruited and if the player chooses to attack Jowy. Development and release In the winter of 1993/1994, Konami newcomers Yoshitaka Murayama and Junko Kawano were tasked with creating an RPG for an internally developed video games console. This game was scrapped in the early stages of development & despite the popular belief was not the basis for the script of Suikoden https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_YKeO4ULL0 https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TET7gvdI6L9NlyKuJigEremgUUqzpMpKROPlBQMda7k/edit https://www.rpgfan.com/news/2019/9773.html. Murayama, Kawano and ten other employees were instead assigned with developing Konami's first games for Sony's upcoming console, the PlayStation. With the pick of making a baseball game, a racing game or an RPG, Murayama and Kawano decided to reopen their RPG project, although Murayama has stated that given the opportunity, he would have preferred to make a shoot 'em up, citing his preference for arcade action titles such as Taito's Metal Black. Committed from the start to make a franchise to rival series such as Enix's Dragon Quest and Square's Final Fantasy, Murayama wrote the scenario of the first Suikoden. http://arcadology.net/the-development-of-suikoden/. With the success of the first game a sequel gained a green-light. After reading fan letters Murayama decided that the selling point of the first game was its story, and thus it became the main focus of the second title. The story for Suikoden 2 was conceived after Suikoden 1 and was mostly written by Murayama himself https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_YKeO4ULL0 . Konami later released Genso Suikoden I & II, a compilation of the first two games of the series, in 2005 on the PlayStation Portable. However, it was released only to the Japanese market. Suikoden II was made available for download on the PlayStation Network on December 9, 2014. Reception Suikoden II saw a limited print run, and the lackluster initial response prevented a reprinting of the game. Despite this, the game received \\"favorable\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Francesca Reyes of Next Generation called it \\"One of the best RPGs to hit PlayStation this year.\\" Since the 2010's, reanalysis of the game is often met with critical praise, and many video game critics and players alike consider it to be one of the greatest video games of all time as well as one of the best console RPGs from outside of the Square- Enix canon, and the best of all Suikoden games.

The project was scrapped in 1915 after initial tests deemed the vehicle to be underpowered and vulnerable to artillery fire. It has become known among industrial design students as a catastrophic failure of engineering without proper consideration to design. History It differed from modern tanks in that it did not use caterpillar tracks--rather, it used a tricycle design. The two front spoked wheels were nearly in diameter; the rear-mounted third wheel was only high. The upper cannon turret reached a height of nearly . The hull was wide with two more cannon in sponsons. Additional weapons were also planned under the belly. Each wheel was powered by a Sunbeam engine. The huge wheels were intended to cross significant obstacles. However, due to miscalculations of the weight, the rear wheel was prone to getting stuck in soft ground and ditches, and the front wheels were sometimes insufficient to pull it out. This led to a fiasco of tests before the high commission in August 1915. The tank remained in the location where it was tested, some from Moscow until 1923 when it was finally taken apart for scrap.

Purchased by General Motors in 1909, the company continued to produce modestly priced automobiles until 1931 when the brand was dropped in favor of the division's Pontiac make. Beginning The company was named for Oakland County, Michigan, in which it was based. As originally conceived and introduced, the first Oakland used a vertical two-cylinder engine that rotated counterclockwise. This design by Alanson Partridge Brush, inventor of the single-cylinder Cadillac and Brush Runabout, also featured a planetary transmission. The 1908 Oakland came in five body styles, designated Model A‚ÄìE , varing from a runabout to a landaulet. The first year of Oakland production, 1908, had 278 vehicles roll off the line. GM Takeover 1909 Oakland 40 After one year of production, Oakland's principal founder, Edward Murphy, sold half of the company to William C. Durant's General Motors Corporation in early 1909. When Murphy died in the summer of 1909, GM acquired the remaining rights to Oakland. Within General Motors, Oakland was later slotted pricewise above the volume-priced Chevrolet and below the more expensive Oldsmobile, Buick, and Cadillac cars. Conventional four-cylinder engined models were introduced shortly after the GM takeover. In 1916, the company introduced a V8 engine,Clymer, Floyd. Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877-1925 (New York: Bonanza Books, 1950), p.166. and production soared to 35,000 in 1917, shared with the Chevrolet Series D. By early 1920, however, production and quality control problems began to plague the division. In 1921, under new General Manager Fred Hannum, a consistent production schedule was underway and the quality of the cars improved, and Oakland vehicles shared the GM A platform used by Chevrolet. One marketing tactic was the employment of a quick-drying bright blue automotive lacquer by Duco (a DuPont brand product), leading to the slogan \\"True Blue Oakland\\". The Oakland car was built only in Pontiac, Michigan, which is the county seat of Oakland County. The name antedates any GM association with an automobile manufacturing facility in Oakland, California, that built Chevrolet vehicles before Chevrolet joined GM called Oakland Assembly. Pontiac 1928 Oakland Sport Cabriolet 1929 Oakland Model 212 Landaulette Sedan As General Motors entered the 1920s, the product ladder started with the price-leading Chevrolet marque, and then progressed upward in price, power, and luxury to Oakland, Oldsmobile, Buick, and ultimately Cadillac. By the mid-1920s, a sizable price gap existed between Chevrolet and Oakland, as well as a wide gap between Oldsmobile and Buick. Also, a product gap existed between Buick and Cadillac. General Motors pioneered the idea that consumers would aspire to buy up an automotive product ladder if a company met certain price points-called the Companion Make Program. To address this, General Motors authorized the introduction of four brands priced and designed to fill the gaps. Cadillac would introduce the LaSalle to fill the gap between Cadillac and Buick. Buick would introduce the Marquette to handle the upper end of the gap between Buick and Oldsmobile. Oldsmobile would introduce the Viking, which took care of the lower end of the same gap. Oakland's part in this plan was the 1926 Pontiac, a shorter-wheelbase \\"light six\\" priced to sell at a four-cylinder car's price point, but still above Chevrolet. Pontiac was the first of the companion marques introduced, and in its first year sold 49,875 units. By 1929, GM sold 163,000 more Pontiacs than Oaklands. The discontinuation of Oakland was announced with the onset of the Great Depression in 1931. Pontiac was the only companion make to survive beyond 1940, or to survive its \\"parent\\" make.

It began as a rebuilding of the partnership's successful We-Will 1929 racer, but soon turned into a completely new racing monoplane aircraft, powered by a large radial engine. Model 44s became the dominant racers of the 1930s, setting innumerable records including setting a new world speed record in 1933. The only surviving Model 44 is on display at the Crawford Auto-Aviation Museum, Cleveland, Ohio. Three replica Model 44s are on display at the Louisiana State Museum, Patterson, Louisiana.  Design and development  Experienced air-racer Jimmy Wedell formed a business partnership in 1929 with millionaire Harry P. Williams after giving him flying lessons. Initial plans were to teach flying, provide an aerial photography service and win an airmail contract. Wedell's passion for air racing led him to convince Williams to build a racer for the January, 1930 Miami Air Races. This first aircraft was named \\"We-Will\\" but as development and testing continued it became apparent it would not be ready for the 1930 Miami event. Wedell halted development of the \\"We-Will\\" design and began a new aircraft, the \\"We-Winc\\". In parallel to the development of the We-Winc, Wedell began the construction of a third aircraft, the \\"We-Will Jr.\\" This aircraft first appeared in the Cirrus Derby held in Detroit on July 21 but the design proved to be underpowered. Further development with improved aerodynamics, numerous technical innovations and a Hamilton Standard ground adjustable propeller radically changed the aircraft's appearance. Incorporated into the design were the wheel spats that would be an iconic feature of the future racers. It was a typical construction with a braced, low-wing monoplane utilizing fixed landing gear in large spats. This version was however also underpowered. In development and in competition this version, by now dubbed \\"Model 22\\" proved to be a disappointment and further development was abandoned.Hirsch and Schultz 2001, p. 26. Operational history By 1931, Wedell had turned his attention back to the original We-Will and after a rebuild using the lessons learned in building the We-Winc and the We-Will Jr. attained an acceptable level of performance. This version was named the \\"Model 44\\". When mated with a Pratt & Whitney Wasp Jr. engine, the design's true potential began to be realized. That year, the \\"44\\" placed second at the National Air Races.Hirsch and Schultz 2001, p. 29. Soon after the '31 Nationals, Wedell began rebuilding the 44 and the We-Winc as well as taking a contract to build a Model 44 for the famous aviator Roscoe Turner. On the second test flight of Turner's Model 44, the left wing experienced a structural failure and was destroyed in the ensuing crash. Piloting the aircraft himself, Wedell parachuted to safety. After this incident, the assistance of Howard Barlow, an aeronautical engineer, was obtained in the redesign of the wings. The second Turner racer was built with the new wing design and proved to be an exceptional performer. The other two Model 44s were rebuilt according to the new wing specification as test pilots had noted wing vibrations in both aircraft previously.Hirsch and Schultz 2001, p. 37. These three aircraft went on to dominate air racing for the next several years. Model 44s were raced in 1932, 1933 and 1934 Bendix Trophy races, as well as the 1934 Thompson and Shell Trophy. In September 1933 at the International Air Race in Chicago, the 44 piloted by Wedell set the new world speed record of 305.33 miles per hour.Schmid and Weaver 1983, p. 314. Flying a 44, Doug Davis won the 1934 Bendix Trophy, but crashed and was killed while leading the Thompson Trophy Race on September 3, 1934. Roscoe Turner won the Thompson Trophy in a 44 with a different engine, while J. A. Worthen placed third, also in a 44.

Owned by Entercom, the station also serves as the Memphis affiliate for the Rick Dees Weekly Top 40. The WMC- FM studios are located in Memphis' Colonial Acres neighborhood, while the station transmitter resides in the nearby suburb of Bartlett. Besides a standard analog transmission, WMC-FM is also available online via Radio.com. Founded by The Commercial Appeal, WMC-FM is notable for being an FM \\"superpower station,\\" with an output exceeding Federal Communications Commission (FCC) restrictions; of FM stations operating in the FCC's Zone II, WMC-FM is the most powerful. History The Memphis Publishing Company, a subsidiary of Scripps-Howard Newspapers which owned the Memphis Commercial Appeal and founded WMC (790 AM), launched this station as WMCF on May 22, 1947.Broadcasting Yearbook 1948 page 318 WMCF was the first FM station established in Memphis and the second in the state of Tennessee, after WSM- FM/Nashville, which signed on in 1941. From its establishment, WMCF had an output of 515,000 watts; this would be adjusted multiple times before setting at their current power output of 300,000 watts. As the FM adjunct to WMC, WMCF largely simulcast the AM station's programming. On December 11, 1948, a TV station was added, WMCT. WMC, WMCF and WMCT moved to studios at 1960 Union Avenue in Midtown Memphis in 1959 and celebrated with a broadcast hosted by comedian George Gobel. WMCF changed their call sign to WMC-FM on May 27, 1960; WMCT would become WMC-TV in 1967. WMC-FM was the first FM radio station in the market, and the first in Tennessee, to play progressive rock, beginning February 6, 1967. Personalities on the station included Greg Hamilton, Ron Michaels, Jon Scott, David Day, and the program director was Mike Powell. Artists included King Crimson, It's a Beautiful Day, and Quicksilver Messenger Service. The versions of \\"Light My Fire\\" by The Doors and \\"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\\" by Iron Butterfly (with its extended drum solo) were longer than the one most stations played. In the early 1970s, the station was responsible for regionally breaking many new artists such as David Bowie, Alice Cooper, Lynyrd Skynyrd, ZZ Top and Billy Joel. By 1978, WMC-FM evolved to a Top 40 format, which would transition to a hot adult contemporary format on September 1992. Scripps Howard sold WMC, WMC-FM and WMC-TV to Atlanta businessman Bert Ellis in 1993. Ellis, in turn, sold his station group in the spring quarter of 1996 to a new broadcasting group formed by the Retirement Systems of Alabama, also composed of Aflac's broadcast holdings and Ellis' Raycom Sports operations; this was subsequently named Raycom Media. Raycom Media sold off WMC and WMC-FM in 2000 to Infinity Broadcasting, a subsidiary of CBS Radio, while keeping WMC-TV. WMC and WMC-FM relocated to the Entercom complex in the Moriah Woods Business Park, near the intersection of I-240 and Mount Moriah Road in Memphis. In 2006, Entercom Communications purchased WMC and WMC-FM from CBS Radio; this preceded both companies merging a decade later. Superpower status Current FCC restrictions were passed in 1962 and mandate a maximum 100,000 watts across most of the country on the FM band, with most of the Northeast and much of California limited to 50,000 watts. WMC-FM is calculated to exceed power restrictions by 4.6 decibels. However, WMC-FM was grandfathered at the high power since it went on the air before the restrictions began. Personalities WMC-FM personalities include: the morning team of Ryan Anderson and Michelle Lewis; Sheryl Stewart middays; Chris Michaels afternoons; Chase Daniels evenings; and Bennett Doyle overnights. WMC-FM also carries the Rick Dees Weekly Top 40, syndicated via Compass Media Networks, on weekends. Many of the station's air personalities worked there for a decade or longer. Most notably, Ron \\"Hey Now\\" Olson had been the station's morning host since the 1980s, partnered with Steve Conley for some of that time, until leaving the station to join co-owned WRVR. Tom Prestigiacomo had been the afternoon host since 1979, staying for nearly three decades; Prestigiacomo left in 2007 for rival AC outlet WKIM.

It has an area of 367.3 km¬≤ and as of 1 January 2019, it had a population of 20,373.\\"BEF4: FOLKETAL 1. JANUAR EFTER √òER\\" (Danmarks Statistik). Retrieved 28 June 2019. The main town on the island is called Nyk√∏bing Mors. Geologically Mors is unique. Like the neighbouring island of Fur, it is known for its deposits of diatomite, locally known as 'moler' (mo-clay).  Sights  Jesperhus park Jesperhus Flower Park The largest flower park in the Nordic countries, Jesperhus, is situated in Legind Bjerge to the south west of Nyk√∏bing. The park contains wide range of plants, including cacti, palms, a variety of roses and a lot of other colourful flowers. The park also has a butterfly reserve, aquarium, aviary, terrarium and hatching center. The Moler Museum The Moler Museum boasts the largest collection of moler (diatomite) fossils in Denmark and tells the story of moler geology, the natural history of the island, and the relationship between the Danish people and moler including its manufacturing properties. The fossils include imprints of birds, fish, turtles, plants and insects. Hanklit Hanklit is situated on the northern coast of the island and is a beautiful cliff face and tourist attraction. The cliff is c. 60 metres high and has several moler deposits. Several people search the cliff face for plant and animal fossils and there are also paragliders who use the nearby hills of Salgerh√∏j for takeoff. Shellfish Mors is known for its shellfish industries; specifically mussel and oyster fisheries and aquaculture. The Danish Shellfish Center (Dansk Skaldyrcenter), part of the Technical University of Denmark, is a research and dissemination center for marine science and aquaculture. The Danish Shellfish Festival takes place in Nyk√∏bing Mors every year in June, celebrating the shellfish industries and Limfjorden traditions.  Transportation  There is a bridge link to the island from Salling via the Sallingsund Bridge on the southeastern side of Mors, and another from Thy via the Vilsund Bridge on the northwestern side of the island. In addition to these two bridges, there are also ferry links to Thy from southwest Mors and from the north of the island. There is also a small airfield called \\"Mors√∏\\" with ICAO EKNM.  History  During the Jutland Peasant rebellion of 1441, Christopher of Bavaria, King of Denmark, approached the rebel camp at Husby Hole near St J√∏rgen's Hill in northern Jutland and sent word that anyone who left the camp and went home would not be punished for rebellion. The men from the island of Mors as well as those from Thisted left, for which they were afterwards called cowards and traitors.

Across species, different sexes are often characterized by different types and numbers of sex chromosomes. In order to neutralize the large difference in gene dosage produced by differing numbers of sex chromosomes among the sexes, various evolutionary branches have acquired various methods to equalize gene expression among the sexes. Because sex chromosomes contain different numbers of genes, different species of organisms have developed different mechanisms to cope with this inequality. Replicating the actual gene is impossible; thus organisms instead equalize the expression from each gene. For example, in humans, females (XX) silence the transcription of one X chromosome of each pair, and transcribe all information from the other, expressed X chromosome. Thus, human females have the same number of expressed X-linked genes as do human males (XY), both sexes having essentially one X chromosome per cell, from which to transcribe and express genes. Different lineages have evolved different mechanisms to cope with the differences in gene copy numbers between the sexes that are observed on sex chromosomes. Some lineages have evolved dosage compensation, an epigenetic mechanism which restores expression of X or Z specific genes in the heterogametic sex to the same levels observed in the ancestor prior to the evolution of the sex chromosome. Other lineages equalize the expression of the X- or Z- specific genes between the sexes, but not to the ancestral levels, i.e. they possess incomplete compensation with ‚Äúdosage balance‚Äù. One example of this is X-inactivation which occurs in humans. The third documented type of gene dose regulatory mechanism is incomplete compensation without balance (sometimes referred to as incomplete or partial dosage compensation). In this system gene expression of sex-specific loci is reduced in the heterogametic sex i.e. the females in ZZ/ZW systems and males in XX/XY systems. There are three main mechanisms of achieving dosage compensation which are widely documented in the literature and which are common to most species. These include random inactivation of one female X chromosome (as observed in Mus musculus; this is called X-inactivation), a two-fold increase in the transcription of a single male X chromosome (as observed in Drosophila melanogaster), and decreased transcription by half in both of the X chromosomes of a hermaphroditic organism (as observed in Caenorhabditis elegans). These mechanisms have been widely studied and manipulated in model organisms commonly used in the laboratory research setting. A summary of these forms of dosage compensation is illustrated below. However, there are also other less common forms of dosage compensation, which are not as widely researched and are sometimes specific to only one species (as observed in certain bird and monotreme species). Three main mechanisms of dosage compensation observed in common model eukaryotic organisms.  Random inactivation of one ‚ôÄ X  One logical way to equalize gene expression amongst males and females that follow a XX/XY sex differentiation scheme would be to decrease or altogether eliminate the expression of one of the X chromosomes in an XX, or female, homogametic individual, such that both males and females then express only one X chromosome. This is the case in many mammalian organisms, including humans and mice. The evidence for this mechanism of dosage compensation was discovered prior to scientists‚Äô understanding of what its implications were. In 1949, Murray Barr and Ewert Bertram published data describing the presence of ‚Äúnucleolar satellites, which they observed were present in the mature somatic tissue of different female species. Further characterization of these satellites revealed that they were actually packages of condensed heterochromatin, but a decade would pass before scientists grasped the significance of this specialized DNA. Then, in 1959 Susumu Ohno proved that these satellite-like structures found exclusively in female cells were actually derived from female X chromosomes. He called these structures Barr bodies after one of the investigators who originally documented their existence. Ohno‚Äôs studies of Barr bodies in female mammals with multiple X chromosomes revealed that such females used Barr bodies to inactivate all but one of their X chromosomes. Thus, Ohno described the ‚Äún-1‚Äù rule to predict the number of Barr bodies in a female with n number of X chromosomes in her karyotype. Simultaneously, Mary F. Lyon began investigating manipulations of X-linked traits that had phenotypically visible consequences, particularly in mice, whose fur color is a trait intimately linked to the X chromosome. Building on work done by Ohno and his colleagues, Lyon eventually proved that either the maternal or paternal X chromosome is randomly inactivated in every cell of the female body in the species she was studying, which explained the heterogeneous fur patterns she observed in her mosaic mice. This process is known as X-inactivation, and is sometimes referred to as ‚Äúlyonization‚Äù. This discovery can be easily extrapolated to explain the mixed color patterns observed in the coats of tortoiseshell cats. The fur patterns characteristic of tortoiseshell cats are found almost exclusively in females, because only they randomly inactivate one X chromosome in every somatic hair cell. Thus, presuming that hair color determining genes are X-linked, it makes sense that whether the maternal or paternal X chromosome is inactivated in a particular hair cell can result in differential fur color expression. Compounding on Lyon's discoveries, in 1962 Ernest Beutler used female fibroblast cell lineages grown in culture to demonstrate the heritability of lyonization or random X-inactivation. By analyzing the differential expression of two existing, viable alleles for the X-linked enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) gene, Beutler observed that the inactivation of the gene was heritable across passaged generations of the cells. This pattern of dosage compensation, caused by random X-inactivation, is regulated across development in female mammals, following concerted patterns throughout development; for example, at the beginning of most female mammal development, both X chromosomes are initially expressed, but gradually undergo epigenetic processes to eventually achieve random inactivation of one X. In germ cells, inactivated X chromosomes are then once again activated to ensure their expression in gametes produced by female mammals. Thus, dosage compensation in mammals is largely achieved through the silencing of one of two female X chromosomes via X-inactivation. This process involves histone tail modifications, DNA methylation patterns, and reorganization of large-scale chromatin structure encoded by the X-ist gene. In spite of these extensive modifications, not all genes along the X chromosome are subject to X-inactivation; active expression at some loci is required for homologous recombination with the pseudo-autosomal region (PAR) of the Y chromosome during meiosis. Additionally, 10-25% of human X chromosome genes, and 3-7% of mouse X chromosome genes outside of the PARs show weak expression from the inactive X chromosome.  Two-fold increased transcription of a single ‚ôÇ X  Another mechanism common for achieving equal X-related genetic expression between males and females involves two-fold increased transcription of a single male X chromosome. Thus, heterogametic male organisms with one X chromosome may match the level of expression achieved in homogametic females with two active X chromosomes. This mechanism is observed in Drosophila. The concept of dosage compensation actually originated from an understanding of organisms in which males upregulated X-linked genes two-fold, and was much later extended to account for the observation of the once mysterious Barr bodies. As early as 1932, H.J. Muller carried out a set of experiments which allowed him to track the expression of eye color in flies, which is an X-linked gene. Muller introduced a mutant gene that caused loss of pigmentation in fly eyes, and subsequently noted that males with only one copy of the mutant gene had similar pigmentation to females with two copies of the mutant gene. This led Muller to coin the phrase ‚Äúdosage compensation‚Äù to describe the observed phenomenon of gene expression equalization. Despite these advances, it was not until Ardhendu Mukherjee and W. Beermann performed more advanced autoradiography experiments in 1965 that scientists could confirm that transcription of genes in the single male X chromosome was double that observed in the two female X chromosomes. Mukherjee and Beermann confirmed this by designing a cellular autoradiography experiment that allowed them to visualize incorporation of [3H]uridine into ribonucleic acid of the X chromosomes. Their studies showed equal levels of [3H]uridine incorporation in the single male X chromosome and the two female X chromosomes. Thus, the investigators concluded that the two-fold increase in the rate of RNA synthesis in the X chromosome of the male relative to those of the female could account for Muller's hypothesized dosage compensation. In the case of two-fold increased transcription of a single male X chromosome, there is no use for a Barr body, and the male organism must use different genetic machinery to increase the transcriptional output of their single X chromosome. It is common in such organisms for the Y chromosome to be necessary for male fertility, but not for it to play an explicit role in sex determination. In Drosophila, for example, the sex lethal (SXL) gene acts as a key regulator of sexual differentiation and maturation in somatic tissue; in XX animals, SXL is activated to repress increased transcription, while in XY animals SXL is inactive and allows male development to proceed via increased transcription of the single X. Several binding sites exist on the Drosophila X chromosome for the dosage compensation complex (DCC), a ribonucleoprotein complex; these binding sites have varying levels of affinity, presumably for varying expression of specific genes. The Male Specific Lethal complex, composed of protein and RNA binds and selectively modifies hundreds of X-linked genes,* increasing their transcription to levels comparable to female D. melanogaster. In organisms that use this method of dosage compensation, the presence of one or more X chromosomes must be detected early on in development, as failure to initiate the appropriate dosage compensation mechanisms is lethal. Male specific lethal proteins (MSLs) are a family of four proteins that bind to the X chromosome exclusively in males. The name ‚ÄúMSL‚Äù is used because mutations in these genes cause inability to effectively upregulate X-linked genes appropriately, and are thus lethal to males only and not their female counterparts. SXL regulates pre-messenger RNA in males to differentially splice MSLs and result in the appropriate increase in X chromosome transcription observed in male Drosophila. The immediate target of SXL is male specific lethal-2 (MSL-2). Current dogma suggests that the binding of MSL-2 at multiple sites along the SXL gene in females prevents proper MSL-2 translation, and thus, as previously stated, represses the possibility for X-linked genetic upregulation in females. However, all other transcription factors in the MSL family‚Äîmaleless, MSL-1, and MSL-3‚Äîare able to act when SXL is not expressed, as in the case in males. These factors act to increase male X chromosome transcriptional activity. Histone acetylation and the consequent upregulation of X-linked genes in males is dictated by the MSL complex. Specifically, special roX non-coding RNAs on the MSL complexes facilitate binding to the single male X chromosome, and dictate acetylation of specific loci along the X chromosome as well as the formation of euchromatin. Though these RNAs bind at specific sites along the male X chromosome, their effects spread along the length of the chromosome and have the ability to influence large-scale chromatin modifications. The implications of this spreading epigenetic regulation along the male X chromosome is thought to have implications for understanding the transfer of epigenetic activity along long genomic stretches.  Decreased transcription of both hermaphroditic Xs by half  Other species that do not follow the previously discussed conventions of XX females and XY males must find alternative ways to equalize X-linked gene expression among differing sexes. For example, in Caenorhabditis elegans (or C. elegans), sex is determined by the ratio of X chromosomes relative to autosomes;Meyer BJ. 1997. Sex determination and X chromosome dosage compensation. In C. elegans II (ed. Riddle DL, et al.), pp. 209‚Äì240. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY. worms with two X chromosomes (XX worms) develop as hermaphrodites, whereas those with only one X chromosome (XO worms) develop as males. This system of sex determination is unique, because there is no male specific chromosome, as is the case in XX/XY sex determination systems. However, as is the case with the previously discussed mechanisms of dosage compensation, failure to express X-linked genes appropriately can still be lethal. In this XX/XO sex determination system, gene expression on the X chromosome is equalized by downregulating expression of genes on both X chromosomes of hermaphroditic XX organisms by half. In these XX organisms, the dosage compensation complex (DCC) is assembled on both X chromosomes to allow for this tightly regulated change in transcription levels. The DCC is often compared to the condensin complex, which is conserved across the mitotic and meiotic processes of many species. This complex is crucial to the condensation and segregation of chromosomes during both meiosis and mitosis. Because data substantiates the theory that dosage compensation in other species is caused by chromatin-wide modifications, many theorize that the DCC in particular functions similar to the condensin complex in its ability to condense or remodel the chromatin of the X chromosome. The role of the DCC in this form of dosage compensation was postulated by Barbara J. Meyer in the 1980s, and its individual components and their cooperative function were later parsed out by her lab. Notably, in 1999, data from Meyer's lab showed that SDC-2 is a particularly important transcriptional factor for targeting the DCC to the X chromosome and for assembling DCC components onto the X chromosomes in XX embryos. More recently, Meyer's lab has shown that proteins known as X-linked signal elements (XSEs) operate in concert with SDC-2 to differentially repress and activate other genes in the dosage compensation pathway. By selectively mutating a panel of genes hypothesized to contribute to dosage compensation in worms, Meyer's group demonstrated which XSEs specifically play a role in determining normal dosage compensation. They found that during embryonic development, several X-linked genes‚Äîincluding sex-1, sex-2, fox-1, and ceh-39‚Äîact in a combinatorial fashion to selectively repress transcriptional activity of the xol-1 gene in hermaphrodites. Xol-1 expression is tightly regulated during early development, and is considered the most upstream gene in sex determination of C. elegans. In fact, xol-1 is often referred to in the literature as the master sex regulatory gene of C. elegans. XX C. elegans embryos have much lower xol-1 expression than their XO counterparts, resulting from overall increases in the amount of SEX-1, SEX-2, CEH-39, and FOX-1 transcription produced in the female embryos. This consequent decrease in xol-1 expression then allows higher SDC-2 expression levels, which aids in the formation and function of the DCC complex in the XX hermaphroditic worms, and in turn results in equalized expression of X-linked genes in the hermaphrodite. Though all of the above-mentioned XSEs act to reduce xol-1 expression, experimentally reducing expression levels of these individual XSEs has been shown to have a minimal effect on sex determination and successful dosage compensation. This could be in part because these genes encode different proteins that act cooperatively rather than in an isolated fashion; for example, SEX-1 is a nuclear hormone receptor, while FOX-1 is an RNA-binding protein with properties capable of inducing post-transcriptional modifications in the xol-1 target. However, reducing the level of more than one XSE in different combinational permutations seems to have an additive effect on ensuring proper sex determination and resultant dosage compensation mechanics. This supports the hypothesis that these XSEs act together to achieve the desired sex determination and dosage compensation fate. Thus, in this model organism, the achieved level of X-chromosome expression is directly correlated to the activation of multiple XSEs that ultimately function to repress xol-1 expression in a developing worm embryo. A summary of this C. elegans mechanism of dosage compensation is illustrated below. thumb Other species-specific methods The ZZ/ZW sex system is used by most birds, as well as some reptiles and insects. In this system the Z is the larger chromosome so the males (ZZ) must silence some genetic material to compensate for the female's (ZW) smaller W chromosome. Instead of silencing the entire chromosome as humans do, male chickens (the model ZZ organism) seem to engage in selective Z silencing, in which they silence only certain genes on the extra Z chromosome. Thus, male chickens express an average of 1.4-1.6 of the Z chromosome DNA expressed by female chickens. The Z chromosome expression of male zebra finches and chickens is higher than the autosomal expression rates, whereas X chromosome expression in female humans is equal to autosomal expression rates, illustrating clearly that both male chickens and male zebra finches practice incomplete silencing. Few other ZZ/ZW Systems have been analyzed as thoroughly as the chicken; however a recent study on silkworms revealed similar levels of unequal compensation across male Z chromosomes. Z-specific genes were over-expressed in males when compared to females, and a few genes had equal expression in both male and female Z chromosomes. In chickens, most of the dosage compensated genes exist on the Zp, or short, arm of the chromosome while the non-compensated genes are on the Zq, or long, arm of the chromosome. The compensated (silenced) genes on Zp resemble a region on the primitive platypus sex chromosome, suggesting an ancestor to the XX/XY system.  Birds  The sex chromosomes of birds evolved separately from those of mammals and share very little sequence homology with the XY chromosomes. As such, scientists refer to bird sex chromosomes as a ZW sex- determining system, with males possessing two Z chromosomes, and females possessing one Z chromosome and one W. Thus, dosage compensation in birds could be hypothesized to follow a pattern similar to the random X-inactivation observed in most mammals. Alternatively, birds might show decreased transcription of the two Z chromosomes present in the male heterogametic sex, similar to the system observed in the two hermaphrodite X chromosomes of C. elegans. However, bird mechanisms of dosage compensation differ significantly from these precedents. Instead, male birds appear to selectively silence only a few genes along one of their Z chromosomes, rather than randomly silencing one entire Z chromosome. This type of selective silencing has led some people to label birds as ‚Äúless effective‚Äù at dosage compensation than mammals. However, more recent studies have shown that those genes on the Z chromosome which are not inactivated in birds may play an important role in recruiting dosage compensation machinery to the Z chromosome in ZZ organisms. In particular, one of these genes, ScII has been demonstrated to be an ortholog of xol-1, the master sex regulator gene in C. elegans. Thus, the function of the selective silencing may be to spare dosage compensation of genes crucial for sex determination of homologous pairing. While the epigenetic mechanisms behind dosage compensation in birds are poorly understood, especially in comparison to the well-studied mechanisms of dosage compensation in humans and Drosophila, several recent studies have revealed promising sequences. One example is MHM (male hypermethylated) RNA, an Xist-like long noncoding RNA that is expressed only in female chickens (ZW). It is associated with female- specific hyper-acetylation of lysine 16 on histone 4 near the MHM locus on the Z chromosome. This MHM locus is heavily studied as a site of dosage compensation because male Z chromosomes are hypermethylated and thus underexpress genes in this area in comparison to female Z chromosomes which are hyperacetylated and overexpress these genes. There has been debate on whether the MHM locus constitutes dosage compensation, however, since scientists claim that even if the MHM locus has been found to have significantly greater expression in females than in males, it could not even be considered to be a dosage compensation mechanism since it does not balance gene dose between the Z chromosome and autosomes in the heterogametic sex. Similar to mammals, chickens seem to use CpG islands (segments of Cytosine- phosphate-Guanine that are more readily methylated and silenced than other DNA segments) to regulate gene expression. One study found that CpG islands were found primarily in compensated areas of the Z chromosome‚Äîareas that are differentially expressed in male and female chickens. Thus it is likely that these CpG islands are locations where genes on the male Z chromosome are methylated and silenced, but which stay functional on the female Z chromosome.  Monotremes  Platypus, a type of monotreme Monotremes are a class of basal mammals that also lay eggs. They are an order of mammals that includes platypuses and four species of echidna, all of which are egg-laying mammals. While monotremes use an XX/XY system, unlike other mammals, monotremes have more than two sex chromosomes. The male short-beaked echidna, for example, has nine sex chromosomes‚Äî5 Xs and 4 Ys, and the male platypus has 5 Xs and 5 Ys. Platypuses are a monotreme species whose mechanism of sex determination has been extensively studied. There is some contention in academia about the evolutionary origin and the proper taxonomy of platypuses. A recent study revealed that four platypus X chromosomes, as well as a Y chromosome, are homologous to some regions on the avian Z chromosome. Specifically, platypus X1 shares homology with the chicken Z chromosome, and both share homology with the human chromosome 9. This homology is important when considering the mechanism of dosage compensation in monotremes. In 50% of female platypus cells, only one of the alleles on these X chromosomes is expressed while in the remaining 50% multiple alleles are expressed. This, combined with the portions that are homologous to chicken Z and human 9 chromosomes imply that this level of incomplete silencing may be the ancestral form of dosage compensation. Regardless of their ambiguous evolutionary history, platypuses have been empirically determined to follow an XY sex-determination system, with females possessing five pairs of X chromosomes as the homogametic sex, and males possessing five X and five Y chromosomes as the heterogametic sex. Because the entire genome of the platypus has yet to be completely sequenced (including one of the X chromosomes), there is still continued investigation as to the definitive mechanism of dosage compensation that Platypuses follow. Research from the laboratory of Jennifer Graves used qPCR and SNP analysis of BACs containing various genes from X chromosomes in order to find whether multiple alleles for particular X-linked genes were being expressed at once, or were otherwise being dosage compensated. Her group found that in female platypuses, some X-linked genes only expressed an allele from one X chromosomes, while other genes expressed multiple alleles. This appears to be a system similar to the selective silencing method of dosage compensation observed in birds. However, about half of all X-linked genes also seemed to stochastically express only one active copy of said gene, alluding to the system of random X-inactivation observed in humans. These findings suggest that platypuses may employ a hybrid form of dosage compensation that combines feature from mammals as well as birds. Understanding the evolution of such a system may have implications for solidifying the true ancestral lineage of monotremes.  Plants  In addition to humans and flies, some plants also make use of the XX/XY dosage compensation systems. Silene latifolia plants are also either male (XY) or female (XX), with the Y chromosome being smaller, with fewer genes expressed, than the X chromosome. Two separate studies have shown male S. latifolia expression of X-linked genes to be about 70% of the expression in females. If the S. latifolia did not practice dosage compensation, the expected level of X-linked gene expression in males would be 50% that of females, thus the plant practices some degree of dosage compensation but, because male expression is not 100% that of females, it has been suggested that S. latiforia and its dosage compensation system is still evolving. Additionally, in plant species that lack dimorphic sex chromosomes, dosage compensation can occur when aberrant meiotic events or mutations result in either aneuploidy or polyploidy. Genes on the affected chromosome may be upregulated or down-regulated to compensate for the change in the normal number of chromosomes present.  Reptiles  Research into dosage compensation has been carried out in five species of toxicoferan reptiles. Two species of caenophidian snake (one which belongs to the family Viperidae and the other to the family Colubridae) have been investigated and both of these exhibit female heterogametic sex determination systems (ZZ\\\\ZW) and have incomplete compensation without balance. The Komodo dragon exhibits incomplete compensation without dosage balance in their independently evolved ZZ/ZW system. In the XX/XY system of Basiliscus vittatus incomplete compensation without dosage balance was also seen. The Green anole (Anolis carolinensis; Dactyloidea), has XX/XY sex determination and unlike the other squamates studied to date has complete dosage compensation with dosage balance.  X chromosome inactivation and embryonic stem cells  XCI is initiated very early during female embryonic development or upon differentiation of female embryonic stem (ES) cells and results in inactivation of one X chromosome in every female somatic cell. This process is initiated very early during development, around the two- to eight-cell stage and is maintained in the developing extra-embryonic tissues of the embryo, including the fetal placenta. Xist RNA induces heterochromatinization of the X chromosome by attracting chromatin modifiers, involved in gene silencing. Xist RNA is tightly associated with the Xi and it is required for X Chromosome Inactivation to occur in cis. Knockout studies in female ES cells and mice have shown that X chromosomes bearing a deletion of the Xist gene are unable to inactivate the mutated X. Most of the human female ES cell lines display an inactivated X chromosome already in the undifferentiated state characterized by XIST expression, XIST coating and accumulated markers of heterochromatin on the Xi. It is widely thought that human embryos do not employ XCI prior to implantation. Female embryos have an accumulation of Xist RNA on one of the two X chromosomes, beginning around the 8-cell stage. Xist RNA accumulates at the morula and blastocyst stages and is shown to be associated with transcriptional silencing of the Xist-coated chromosomal region, therefore indicating dosage compensation has occurred. Recently, however, it has become increasingly apparent that XCI of the paternal X chromosome is already present from the 4-cell stage onward in all cells of preimplantation mouse embryos, not the 8-cell stages.  Xist, Xite, and Tsix and their roles in X-inactivation  Xite and Xist, are both proteins that regulate and facilitate the process of X-inactivation and are important in the silencing of genes within the X chromosome that is being inactivated. These work in combination with Tsix, which is non-coding RNA that is an antisense which downregulates the effects of Xist on the X chromosome in which it is expressed on the maternal X chromosome upon the start regulation of X-inactivation. These three proteins/RNA codons regulate the X-X pair in a cisorientation in order to be able to have both chromosomes available for inhibitory actions. Tsix and Xite have basic protein functions in addition to X-inactivation and regulate the X-X pair in the transorientation. This ensures exclusive silencing for both X chromosomes. Xite and Tsix are both essential within the orientational directional processes in cis and trans as it is seen that without Tsix and Xite in trans it perturbs pairing and counting of genes. Once the Xist is turned off and no longer regulates the process, the Tsix will slowly decrease in expression as well until both proteins‚Äô RNA are no longer being changed by Xic. Xite is the protein that harbors intergenic transcription start sites from hypersensitive sites of allelic crossovers/differences. When X-inactivation begins, the transcription of Xite increases and signals for the downregulation of Tsix in cisorientation, which is on the silent X chromosome, all while promoting the Tsix persistence on the active X chromosome. Xite also has major roles to play in the asymmetry of Tsix expression and generates X chromosome inequality through moving and helping orient the chromosomes to be acted upon by the correct subsequent protein, either Tsix or Xist.  Neo-sex chromosomes and Dosage compensation  The monarch butterfly Danaus plexippus belongs to the order Lepidoptera and has 30 chromosomes one of which is a neo-sex chromosome which is the result of a fusion between one of the sex chromosomes and an autosome. A study using a combination of methods (Hi-C assembly, coverage analysis and ChIp-seq) found that the neo-Z segment exhibits complete dosage compensation which is achieved by increased transcription in ZW females. Interestingly, the ancestral Z segment exhibits dosage balance with transcription levels being equal between both genders but less than the expected ancestral level, and this is achieved by decreased transcription in ZZ males.

FMCS is tasked with mediating labor disputes around the country; it provides training and relationship development programs for management and unions as part of its role in promoting labor- management peace and cooperation. The Agency also provides mediation, conflict prevention, and conflict management services outside the labor context for federal agencies and the programs they operate. The FMCS headquarters is located in Washington, D.C. with other offices across the country.  About FMCS  FMCS was created by Congress as a neutral and independent government agency upon enactment of the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947 (Taft- Hartley Act) and mandated to resolve industrial conflict and promote labor- management peace and cooperation, minimizing the impact of these disputes on the free flow of commerce. With its headquarters in Washington, D.C. and offices across the country, the agency has, for decades, been providing dispute resolution and conflict management services for employers and unions across industries and work activities in the private, public, and federal sectors. FMCS has also been involved in facilitating negotiated rulemaking processes and providing conflict prevention and conflict management for a wide range of agencies in the federal sector. The Agency also has an international program, partnering with more than 60 countries to provide consulting and training in labor dispute resolution and the design of conflict management systems.

Under Taft-Hartley, FMCS may offer its services \\"in any labor dispute in any industry affecting commerce, either upon its own motion or upon the request of one or more of the parties to the dispute, whenever in its judgment such dispute threatens to cause a substantial interruption of commerce.\\" By statute, FMCS receives advance notification any time a party to a collective bargaining agreement intends to terminate or modify the contract upon expiration. No modification or termination of a collective bargaining agreement is permitted unless the party wishing to modify or terminate notifies the other party at least 60 days prior to expiration and, within 30 days after notice to the other party, notifies FMCS and applicable state mediation agencies. For healthcare institutions, the notice times are extended to 90 and 60 days respectively. FMCS also has a large labor arbitration program. The Agency maintains a roster of approximately 1,000 private arbitrators who are vetted based on their background, experience, and training in issues arising under collective bargaining agreements. Typically, more than 10,000 requests for arbitrator panels are received by FMCS each year from parties to labor-management grievance disputes. Panels are randomly drawn from the FMCS Roster based on specified parameters, and the parties select an arbitrator who is then officially appointed by FMCS. Arbitrators must abide by the Code of Professional Responsibility for Arbitrators of Labor-Management Disputes, to which FMCS is a signatory; the Code is incorporated by reference in the Agency‚Äôs federal regulations. Formation and first director On August 7, 1947, President of the United States Harry S. Truman appointed Cyrus S. Ching as the first director of the FMCS.

In 1973, a Relationship-by-Objectives (RBO) program is developed for use in extreme cases of poor labor-management relations, when continued deterioration of the relationship could have drastic economic effect. The first RBO program is delivered in Maine on behalf of the Georgia- Pacific Company and Paperworkers Local 27. In 1975, FMCS officially entered a new arena: Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR). Congress passes Public Law 93-531, directing the Service to mediate a 100-year old land dispute between the Hopi and Navajo Indian Tribes in Arizona. In 1978, Congress extended the FMCS charter to mediate disputes beyond the private sector to the Federal government. In November,1979, FMCS began mediating age discrimination complaints. In 1983, FMCS was the first agency to provide the service of negotiated rulemaking, or ‚Äúreg-neg.‚Äù Conducted with the Federal Aviation Administration and Department of Transportation, regulations were developed to deal with flight and duty time of pilots. The institutionalization of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) came with the passage of the ADR Act of 1990 which created the responsibility of every federal agency to look at its mission and to see what could be resolved through ADR techniques; also to establish an ADR coordinator, and to promote these efforts. FMCS testified and described the kind of work it did both for promoting ADR and negotiated rulemaking. In 1996, representatives from FMCS facilitated an ADR process in Minnesota regarding land use issues in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) and in Voyageurs National Park (VNP). In addition to agreements reached on the BWCAW, the mediation team also announced agreements on strategies to handle problems in the park having to do with public safety, improved Park Service consultation with local people, and other issues. In 1997, representatives from FMCS mediated negotiations between United Parcel Service and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. It required three weeks of mediation to an end the largest national strike in two decades. In June 2002, representatives from FMCS facilitated National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) discussions in New York City regarding the scope of the subsequent building and fire safety investigation following the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The meetings, which were conducted over the course of five sessions, featured more than 30 speakers, many of whom had family members and friends who were killed in the collapse of the World Trade Center towers.

Subsequently, an extension to the contract was announced in with a July 1, 2022 expiration date. In February 2019, representatives of the FMCS mediated negotiations and agreement between the Denver Classroom Teachers Association and Denver Public School District, ending not only ‚Äúthe first teachers' strike in Denver in 25 years -- it concludes 15 months of sometimes acrimonious negotiations.‚Äù From January to April 2019, FMCS facilitated regulatory negotiations meetings with the Department of Education. The meetings proposed changes/new regulations for the Federal Student Aid programs authorized under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 as amended. These particular negotiations were on the topic of Accreditation and Innovation, including TEACH grant requirements, Distance Learning and Faith-Based Institutions. The meetings were live- streamed and open to the public with time at the end of each day for public comment. In April 2019, FMCS and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) officially committed to work together to resolve federal workplace disputes by utilizing ADR as a means of efficiently reducing the backlog of federal sector charges, In June 2019, FMCS and the Federal Labor Relations Authority (Authority) announced a new commitment to work together to provide labor organizations and agencies with an opportunity to resolve negotiability appeals before they are considered by the Authority‚Äôs Members for a decision. In August 2019, representatives of FMCS mediated negotiations between the State of Alaska and the Inlandboatmen‚Äôs Union, ending a nine-day strike.  Shared Neutrals program  In 2019, FMCS began administrative management of the Federal Shared Neutrals Program, an interagency collaborative effort in support of alternative dispute resolution, formerly operated as Sharing Neutrals by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). FMCS administers the program in the National Capital Region, in coordination with participating federal agencies that contribute to, and make use of, a pool of collateral-duty federal employees to mediate cases outside their own agency. In many regions of the country, Federal Executive Boards (FEBs) have created individual programs modeled after the DC-based program but run through each FEB. These programs continue separate operations, except for those who may wish to have FMCS administer their regional Shared Neutrals program. Annually, the Shared Neutrals Program provides workplace mediation services for hundreds of cases across more than 50 participating agencies and sub-agencies, supported by a pool of more than 250 collateral-duty federal employees who are dedicated to assisting in the resolution of workplace disputes.  Awards and accolades  FMCS received the top ranking among small Federal agencies as a Best Place to Work in the Federal Government, according to the 2018 rankings by the nonprofit Partnership for Public Service and Boston Consulting Group. With rankings first being held in 2003, 2018 marks the fifth time FMCS was selected for the top spot, having also earned this distinction in 2005, 2007, 2015, and in 2017. Additionally, the Agency has consistently ranked in the top 4 since the ‚Äúsmall agency‚Äù category rankings were first included in 2007. Data points from the FEVS revealed that FMCS‚Äôs 2018 employee engagement score is 87.2 out of 100, which placed FMCS at 1 out of 29 small agencies.  National Labor-Management Conference (NLMC)  FMCS hosts a biennial conference to promote better relationship and dispute management as a proactive means for preventing conflict that can impair organizational success. Historically, the NLMC attracts over 1000 industrial relations professionals, representatives of labor and management, academics, arbitrators and legal professionals across the labor relations and employment spectrum.

In computer graphics, the rendering equation is an integral equation in which the equilibrium radiance leaving a point is given as the sum of emitted plus reflected radiance under a geometric optics approximation. It was simultaneously introduced into computer graphics by David Immel et al. and James Kajiya in 1986. The various realistic rendering techniques in computer graphics attempt to solve this equation. The physical basis for the rendering equation is the law of conservation of energy. Assuming that L denotes radiance, we have that at each particular position and direction, the outgoing light (Lo) is the sum of the emitted light (Le) and the reflected light. The reflected light itself is the sum from all directions of the incoming light (Li) multiplied by the surface reflection and cosine of the incident angle.  Equation form  The rendering equation may be written in the form :L_{\\\\text{o}}(\\\\mathbf x, \\\\omega_{\\\\text{o}}, \\\\lambda, t) = L_{\\\\text{e}}(\\\\mathbf x, \\\\omega_{\\\\text{o}}, \\\\lambda, t) \\\\ + \\\\int_\\\\Omega f_{\\\\text{r}}(\\\\mathbf x, \\\\omega_{\\\\text{i}}, \\\\omega_{\\\\text{o}}, \\\\lambda, t) L_{\\\\text{i}}(\\\\mathbf x, \\\\omega_{\\\\text{i}}, \\\\lambda, t) (\\\\omega_{\\\\text{i}}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf n) \\\\operatorname d \\\\omega_{\\\\text{i}} where *L_{\\\\text{o}}(\\\\mathbf x, \\\\omega_{\\\\text{o}}, \\\\lambda, t) is the total spectral radiance of wavelength \\\\lambda directed outward along direction \\\\omega_{\\\\text{o}} at time t, from a particular position \\\\mathbf x *\\\\mathbf x is the location in space *\\\\omega_{\\\\text{o}} is the direction of the outgoing light *\\\\lambda is a particular wavelength of light *t is time *L_{\\\\text{e}}(\\\\mathbf x, \\\\omega_{\\\\text{o}}, \\\\lambda, t) is emitted spectral radiance *\\\\int_\\\\Omega \\\\dots \\\\operatorname d\\\\omega_{\\\\text{i}} is an integral over \\\\Omega *\\\\Omega is the unit hemisphere centered around \\\\mathbf n containing all possible values for \\\\omega_{\\\\text{i}} *f_{\\\\text{r}}(\\\\mathbf x, \\\\omega_{\\\\text{i}}, \\\\omega_{\\\\text{o}}, \\\\lambda, t) is the bidirectional reflectance distribution function, the proportion of light reflected from \\\\omega_{\\\\text{i}} to \\\\omega_{\\\\text{o}} at position \\\\mathbf x, time t, and at wavelength \\\\lambda *\\\\omega_{\\\\text{i}} is the negative direction of the incoming light *L_{\\\\text{i}}(\\\\mathbf x, \\\\omega_{\\\\text{i}}, \\\\lambda, t) is spectral radiance of wavelength \\\\lambda coming inward toward \\\\mathbf x from direction \\\\omega_{\\\\text{i}} at time t *\\\\mathbf n is the surface normal at \\\\mathbf x *\\\\omega_{\\\\text{i}} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf n is the weakening factor of outward irradiance due to incident angle, as the light flux is smeared across a surface whose area is larger than the projected area perpendicular to the ray. This is often written as \\\\cos \\\\theta_i. Two noteworthy features are: its linearity‚Äîit is composed only of multiplications and additions, and its spatial homogeneity‚Äîit is the same in all positions and orientations. These mean a wide range of factorings and rearrangements of the equation are possible. It is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind, similar to those that arise in quantum field theory. Note this equation's spectral and time dependence ‚Äî L_{\\\\text{o}} may be sampled at or integrated over sections of the visible spectrum to obtain, for example, a trichromatic color sample. A pixel value for a single frame in an animation may be obtained by fixing t; motion blur can be produced by averaging L_{\\\\text{o}} over some given time interval (by integrating over the time interval and dividing by the length of the interval). Note that a solution to the rendering equation is the function L_{\\\\text{o}}. The function L_{\\\\text{i}} is related to L_{\\\\text{o}} via a ray- tracing operation: The incoming radiance from some direction at one point is the outgoing radiance at some other point in the opposite direction.  Applications  Solving the rendering equation for any given scene is the primary challenge in realistic rendering. One approach to solving the equation is based on finite element methods, leading to the radiosity algorithm. Another approach using Monte Carlo methods has led to many different algorithms including path tracing, photon mapping, and Metropolis light transport, among others.  Limitations  Although the equation is very general, it does not capture every aspect of light reflection. Some missing aspects include the following: * Transmission, which occurs when light is transmitted through the surface, such as when it hits a glass object or a water surface, * Subsurface scattering, where the spatial locations for incoming and departing light are different. Surfaces rendered without accounting for subsurface scattering may appear unnaturally opaque ‚Äî however, it is not necessary to account for this if transmission is included in the equation, since that will effectively include also light scattered under the surface, * Polarization, where different light polarizations will sometimes have different reflection distributions, for example when light bounces at a water surface, * Phosphorescence, which occurs when light or other electromagnetic radiation is absorbed at one moment in time and emitted at a later moment in time, usually with a longer wavelength (unless the absorbed electromagnetic radiation is very intense), * Interference, where the wave properties of light are exhibited, * Fluorescence, where the absorbed and emitted light have different wavelengths, * Non-linear effects, where very intense light can increase the energy level of an electron with more energy than that of a single photon (this can occur if the electron is hit by two photons at the same time), and emission of light with higher frequency than the frequency of the light that hit the surface suddenly becomes possible, and * Relativistic Doppler effect, where light that bounces on an object that is moving in a very high speed will get its wavelength changed; if the light bounces at an object that is moving towards it, the impact will compress the photons, so the wavelength will become shorter and the light will be blueshifted and the photons will be packed more closely so the photon flux will be increased; if it bounces at an object that is moving away from it, it will be redshifted and the photons will be packed more sparsely so the photon flux will be decreased. For scenes that are either not composed of simple surfaces in a vacuum or for which the travel time for light is an important factor, researchers have generalized the rendering equation to produce a volume rendering equation suitable for volume rendering and a transient rendering equation for use with data from a time-of-flight camera.

The vessel, converted from the former Finnish Aframax crude oil tanker Tempera by Keppel Corporation, will replace an older FPSO unit in the Yombo field off the Republic of Congo in 2018. Built at Sumitomo Heavy Industries in Japan in 2002, Tempera was the first ship to utilize the double acting tanker (DAT) concept in which the vessel is designed to travel ahead in open water and astern in severe ice conditions. Tempera and her sister ship Mastera, built in 2003, were used mainly to transport crude oil, year-round, from the Russian oil terminal in Primorsk to Neste Oil refineries in Porvoo and Naantali. In 2015, Neste sold Tempera to the oil and gas company Perenco for conversion to an FPSO.  Concept  Although icebreaking cargo ships had been built in the past, their hull forms were always compromises between open water performance and icebreaking capability. A good icebreaking bow, designed to break the ice by bending it under the ship's weight, has very poor open water characteristics and is subjected to slamming in heavy weather while a hydrodynamically efficient bulbous bow greatly increases the ice resistance.Kujala, P and Riska, K: Talvimerenkulku (TKK-AM-13). Department of Applied Mechanics, Helsinki University of Technology, 2010. However, already in the late 1800s captains operating ships in icebound waters discovered that sometimes it was easier to break through ice by running their vessels astern. This was because the forward-facing propellers generated a water flow that lowered the resistance by reducing friction between the ship's hull and ice.Aker Arctic Technology Inc.: Icebreaking Supply Vessels Arcticaborg and Antarcticaborg . Retrieved 8 February 2010 These findings resulted in the adoption of bow propellers in older icebreakers operating in the Great Lakes and the Baltic Sea, but as forward-facing propellers have a very low propulsion efficiency and the steering ability of a ship is greatly reduced when running astern, it could not be considered a main operating mode for merchant ships.Juurmaa, K et al.: New ice breaking tanker concept for the arctic (DAT) . Kvaerner Masa-Yards Arctic Technology, 1995.Juurmaa, K et al.: The development of the new double acting ships for ice operation. Kvaerner Masa-Yards Arctic Technology, 2001 and 2002 . For this reason it was not until the development of electric podded propulsion, ABB's Azipod, that the concept of double acting ships became feasible. The superiority of podded propulsion in icebreaking merchant ships, especially when running astern, was proved when Finnish product tankers Uikku and Lunni were converted to Azipod propulsion in 1993 and 1994, respectively. Even though the ships were originally designed with icebreaking capability in mind, after the conversion ice resistance in level ice when running astern was only 40% of that when breaking ice ahead despite the ships being equipped with an icebreaking bow and not designed to break ice astern.  History = Development and construction  Following the successful operation of the Azipod-converted tankers Uikku and Lunni in the Northern Sea Route, Kv√¶rner Masa-Yards Arctic Research Centre developed the first double acting tanker concept in the early 1990s. The 90,000 DWT tankers were designed to transport oil and gas condensate from the Pechora Sea in the Russian Arctic, where ice conditions during winter can be considered moderate and the ships would operate mainly in astern mode, first to Murmansk and then Rotterdam, where most of the distance can be travelled in open water year round. Other early double acting concepts included a similar ship with an icebreaking bow that would be utilized in summer time when the ship was traveling in areas with low ice concentration but with a risk of colliding with multi-year ice blocks. In early 2000s Fortum Shipping, the transportation arm of the Finnish energy company Fortum, started a major fleet renewal program to increase the efficiency and reduce the average age of its vessels.NextStop - Merten valtiaat. Refine 2/06 , page 24. Neste Oil, 2006. The program also included replacing the company's old tankers, such as the 90,000-ton Natura, that were used to transport crude oil to the company's oil refineries in the Gulf of Finland. The old ships had traffic restrictions during the worst part of the winter because of their lower ice class of 1C and could not deliver their cargo all the way to the refineries in Porvoo and Naantali because they were denied icebreaker assistance. When this happened, the oil had to be transported to smaller ships of higher ice class at the edge of the ice ‚Äî a practice that was both uneconomical and hazardous. To solve these problems Kv√¶rner Masa-Yards Arctic Research Centre developed a new 100,000 DWT Aframax tanker concept together with Fortum Shipping, which ordered two vessels from Sumitomo Heavy Industries in 2001. The new ships were designed to the highest Finnish-Swedish ice class, 1A Super, and to be capable of operating in all ice conditions encountered in the Baltic Sea. The possibility to operate in the Pechora Sea was also taken into account in the design process. Extensive ice model tests confirmed the vessel's operational capability in level ice, rubble fields, ice channels and ridges. The world's first double acting tanker and the largest 1A Super class oil tanker at that time, Tempera, was delivered from Yokosuka shipyard in late August 2002.Ice- class tankers .

Design (as oil tanker) = General characteristics  Tempera is long overall and between perpendiculars. The moulded breadth and depth of her hull are and , respectively, and from keel to mast she measured . Her gross tonnage is 64,259 and net tonnage 30,846, and the deadweight tonnage corresponding to the draft at summer freeboard, , is 106,034 tons, slightly less than in Mastera. In ballast Tempera draws only of water. The foreship of Tempera is designed for open water performance with a bulbous bow to maximize the hydrodynamic efficiency. The ship is, just like any other ice-strengthened vessel, also capable of running ahead in light ice conditions. The stern is, however, shaped like an icebreaker's bow, and Tempera is designed to operate independently in the most severe ice conditions of the Baltic Sea. For this purpose the ship is also equipped with two bridges for navigating in both directions. The ship is served by a crew of 15 to 20 depending on operating conditions during winter and maintenance work during summer. Tempera is classified by Lloyd's Register of Shipping.  Cargo tanks and handling  Tempera has six pairs of heated, partially epoxy-coated cargo tanks and one pair of fully coated slop tanks, all divided by a longitudinal center bulkhead and protected by double hull, with a combined capacity of at 98% filling. For cargo handling she has three electrically driven cargo oil pumps with a capacity of 3,500 m3/h √ó 130 m and one cargo oil stripping pump rated for 300 m3/h √ó 130 m. The cargo can be loaded in 10 hours and discharged in 12 hours. Each cargo tank has two and both slop tanks one automated tank cleaning machines as well as holes for portable tank cleaning machines. The ship's ballast water capacity of is divided into sixteen segregated ballast tanks, six pairs located in the double hull around the cargo tanks, two fore peak tanks and two aft peak tanks. She has two electrically driven ballast pumps rated at 2,500 m3/h √ó 35 m and 3,000 m3/h √ó 70 m. The ballast capacity is needed to maintain correct trim especially during drydocking ‚Äî the empty ship has an aft trim of and an uneven weight distribution may damage the hull girder.Tempera telakalla. Vapaavahti 4/2010 , pages 4-7. Merimiespalvelutoimisto, 2010.  Power and propulsion  Tempera has diesel-electric powertrain with four main generating sets, two nine-cylinder W√§rtsil√§ 9L38B and two six-cylinder 6L38B four-stroke medium-speed diesel engines, with a combined output of . The main engines are equipped with exhaust gas economizers. In addition Tempera has one auxiliary diesel generator that can be used when the ship is at port. The auxiliary generator, six-cylinder W√§rtsil√§ 6L26A, has an output of . While underway at , the fuel consumption of the ship's main engines is 56 tons of heavy fuel oil per day when loaded and 40 tons per day in ballast. Her tanks can store of heavy fuel oil for the main engines, of diesel oil for the auxiliary generator, steam boilers and inert gas system, and of lubrication oil. Tempera and her sister ship are the first tankers propelled by ABB Azipod electric azimuth thrusters capable of rotating 360 degrees around the vertical axis. The pulling-type VI2500 pods in these two ships, with a nominal output of 16 MW and fixed-pitch propellers turning at 86 rpm, are the most powerful ice-strengthened Azipod units ABB has ever produced.Potkurikeksint√∂ her√§tti kilpailijat.

The forward-facing propeller increases the propulsion efficiency due to optimal water flow to the propeller and thus improves fuel efficiency. In addition an azimuthing thruster's ability to direct thrust to any direction also results in excellent manoeuvrability characteristics that exceeds those of ships utilizing traditional mechanical shaftlines and rudders.Azipod¬Æ Propulsion, ABB The turning circle of Mastera and Tempera is only half a kilometer at full speed, half of that of a traditional oil tanker of the same size.

Retrieved 4 March 2015.Oakes, Elizabeth H. Lyon, Mary Frances. International Encyclopedia of Women Scientists. New York, NY. Facts on File, Inc. 2002. Facts on File, Inc. Science Online. factsonfile.com. Early life and education Mary Lyon was born on 15 May 1925 in Norwich, England as the eldest out of three children of a civil servant and a schoolteacher. She was educated at a grammar school in Birmingham. During that time, she said, she became interested in science thanks to a good schoolteacher and nature books she won in an essay competition. During the Second World War, she pursued her studies at Girton College, Cambridge at the University of Cambridge, where she read zoology, physiology, organic chemistry and biochemistry, with zoology as her main subject. At this time, only 500 female students were allowed to study at the university, in contrast to more than 5,000 men. Furthermore, despite doing the same work as male students, female students received only ‚Äútitular\\" degrees, rather than full Cambridge degrees that would make them members of the university. During her studies at Cambridge, she became interested in embryology. She went on to do her PhD with Ronald Fisher, who was Professor of Genetics in Cambridge, where she characterised a mutant mice strain with a 'pallid' mutation and published the research. During the course of her PhD she moved to Edinburgh. Research and career After her PhD (awarded 1950), Lyon joined the group of Conrad Hal Waddington, with whom she worked in the last part of her PhD. The group was funded by the Medical Research Council to investigate mutagenesis and the genetic risks of radiation. In addition to the 'pallid' mutation mice, she studied mutations such as 'ataxia' (a nervous mutation which caused walking difficulties in the mice) and 'twirler' (a mutation which induced inner ear issues, causing the mice to shake their heads and walk in circles due to lack of balance). In 1955, her group moved to the MRC radiobiology unit in Harwell, where there was room for more mouse facilities. There she continued to investigate the mouse mutations. She also scrutinised a 'mottled' mutant, which had a different effect on male and female mice: male embryos sometimes died, and the surviving males had white coats, but females lived and were variegated. Through calculated and deliberated breeding of mutants, she investigated the transition of the mutation and concluded that the mutation was positioned on the X chromosome. This, together with new findings at that time concerning the X chromosome, led her to hypothesize about X chromosome silencing. Lyon published many peer- reviewed papers on radiation and chemical mutagenesis and on studies of mutant genes. She also did extensive work on the mouse t-complex. She was head of the Genetics Section of the MRC Radiology Unit at Harwell from 1962 to 1987. Although she retired from research in 1990, according to an interview from 2010, she was still active in the laboratory a few times a week. X-inactivation It was while working on radiation hazards in 1961 that she discovered X-chromosome inactivation, for which she is best known, and the phenomenon is sometimes known as Lyonization in her honour. Her subsequent research helped elucidate the genetic control mechanisms of the X chromosome and helped explain why female 'carriers' of X-linked genetic disorders can display mild symptoms. Awards and honours Lyon was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1973, a Foreign Associate of the US National Academy of Sciences, and a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1994 she won the Mauro Baschirotto Award in Human Genetics, in 1997 the Wolf Prize for Medicine, for her hypothesis concerning the random inactivation of X-chromosomes in mammals. In 1997 she also received the Amory Prize, for genetic discoveries relating to mammalian sex chromosomes. In 2004 she was awarded the March of Dimes Prize in Developmental Biology. In 2006 she received the Pearl Meister Greengard Prize awarded by the Rockefeller University. Since 2015 The Genetics Society has awarded the Mary Lyon Medal in her honour.

Dinocephalians included herbivorous, carnivorous, and omnivorous forms. Many species had thickened skulls with many knobs and bony projections. Dinocephalian fossils are known from Russia, China, Brazil, South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Tanzania. Description Life restoration of Moschops capensis Skull of Titanophoneus Apart from the Biarmosuchians, the dinocephalians are the least advanced therapsids, although still uniquely specialised in their own way. They retain a number of primitive characteristics (e.g. no secondary palate, small dentary) shared with their pelycosaur ancestors, although they are also more advanced in possessing therapsid adaptations like the expansion of the ilium and more erect limbs. They include carnivorous, herbivorous, and omnivorous forms. Some were semiaquatic, others were fully terrestrial. They were among the largest animals of the Permian period; only the biggest Caseidae and Pareiasauridea rivaling or exceeding them in size. Size Dinocephalians were generally large. The biggest herbivores (Tapinocephalus) and omnivores (Titanosuchus) may have massed up to , and were some long, while the largest carnivores (such as Titanophoneus and Anteosaurus) were at least as long, with heavy skulls long, and overall masses of around a half-tonne. Skull All dinocephalians are distinguished by the interlocking incisor (front) teeth. Correlated features are the distinctly downturned facial region, a deep temporal region, and forwardly rotated suspensorium. Shearing contact between the upper and lower teeth (allowing food to be more easily sliced into small bits for digestion) is achieved through keeping a fixed quadrate and a hinge- like movement at the jaw articulation. The lower teeth are inclined forward, and occlusion is achieved by the interlocking of the incisors. The later dinocephalians improved on this system by developing heels on the lingual sides of the incisor teeth that met against one another to form a crushing surface when the jaws were shut. Most dinocephalians also developed pachyostosis of the bones in the skull, which seems to have been an adaptation for intra-specific behaviour (head-butting), perhaps for territory or a mate. In some types, such as Estemmenosuchus and Styracocephalus, there are also horn-like structures, which evolved independently in each case. Evolutionary history The dinocephalians are an ancient group and their ancestry is not clear. It is assumed that they must have evolved during the earlier part of the Roadian, or possibly even the Kungurian epoch, but no trace has been found. These animals radiated at the expense of the dying pelycosaurs, who dominated during the early part of the Permian. Even the earliest members, the estemmenosuchids and early brithopodids of the Russian Ocher fauna, were already a diverse group of herbivores and carnivores. During the Wordian and early Capitanian, advanced dinocephalians radiated into a large number of herbivorous forms, representing a diverse megafauna. This is well known from the Tapinocephalus Assemblage Zone of the Southern African Karoo. At the height of their diversity (middle or late Capitanian age) all the dinocephalians suddenly died out. The reason for their extinction is not clear; although disease, sudden climatic change, or other factors of environmental stress may have brought about their end. They were replaced by much smaller therapsids; herbivorous Dicynodontia and carnivorous Biarmosuchians, Gorgonopsians and Therocephalians.

It is named after Miguel de Cervantes (1547‚Äì1616), the author of Don Quixote and perhaps the most important figure in the history of Spanish literature. The Cervantes Institute, a government agency, is the largest organization in the world responsible for promoting the study and the teaching of Spanish language and culture. This organization has branched out in over 45 different countries with 86 centres devoted to the Spanish and Hispanic American culture and Spanish Language. Article 3 of Law 7/1991, created by the Instituto Cervantes on March 21, explains that the ultimate goals of the Institute are to promote the education, the study and the use of Spanish universally as a second language, to support the methods and activities that would help the process of Spanish language education, and to contribute to the advancement of the Spanish and Hispanic American cultures throughout non-Spanish-speaking countries. Functions * It designs Spanish language courses, offering two kinds of courses: general and special. * It offers the Diplomas of Spanish as Foreign Language (DELE) examinations on behalf of the Spanish Ministry of Education. This is an official qualification certifying levels of competence in the Spanish language, and is the only certificate for non-native Spanish speakers that is officially recognised in Spain.

The Director is in charge of guiding the management of the institute, and other pertinent executive and administrative tasks. Virtual presence Centro Virtual Cervantes is an online service that was created in December 1997 by the Instituto Cervantes of Spain to contribute to the diffusion of the Spanish language and Hispanic cultures. It became one of the most important reference sites devoted to Spanish language and culture, having reached an average of over 100,000 visitors a month, including both professionals and the general public. It offers resources and services to teachers, students, translators, journalists and other professionals involved with the Spanish language, and as well as to Hispanists throughout the world, who study Hispanic cultures, and to any person who is interested in the language and Hispanic cultures. It also includes announcements of cultural events (Actos Culturales), four discussion forums, each of which focuses on a specific topic, and the language classroom, Aula de Lengua, designed for both teachers and learners of Spanish. The Instituto Cervantes also has a virtual presence in the 3D virtual world Second Life. Centro de Formaci√≥n de Profesores On 13 December 2004, the Cervantes Institute formed its Centro de Formaci√≥n de Profesores in its headquarters, located in Alcal√° de Henares, where Cervantes was born. This institution was founded to encourage the teaching of Spanish as a foreign language and to provide useful resources to its members. Throughout the year, it organises the specific activities and programmes for the centre, with several different goals, which include teaching, providing the resources to the teachers to use in their education field, and developing specialised knowledge of the Spanish language for educational purposes. The centre supports the future teachers of Spanish through its 'Master of Education in Spanish as a Foreign Language', in collaboration with the International University Men√©ndez Pelayo. For teachers already involved in teaching, the Centre provides advanced activities that produce a deeper knowledge, focusing on research or discussion in the classroom, and improving the students‚Äô skills in Spanish language for them to become responsive in any communicational situations. Free translator service The Automatic Translator Service of the Cervantes Institute, \\"Portal de las Tecnolog√≠as Ling√ºisticas en Espa√±a\\", was launched by the Cervantes Institute on 10 January 2005. It is a free service of machine translation sponsored by Telef√≥nica. Since its launch, demand has steadily increased monthly to 55%, and it has performed more than 582,000 free translations. The Cervantes Institute's purpose in creating this service was to facilitate the access of Spanish to those information technology contents developed in other languages, and so people who speak other languages can have access to contents that are only available in Spanish. This service permits translation of texts and text files, as well as web pages, from Spanish to Catalan, French, Galician, English or Portuguese and vice versa.

The name \\"Guadalupian\\" was first proposed in the early 1900s, and approved by the International Subcommission on Permian Stratigraphy in 1996. References to the Middle Permian still exist. The Guadalupian was preceded by the Cisuralian and followed by the Lopingian. It is named after the Guadalupe Mountains in New Mexico. The International Chronostratigraphic Chart (v2018/07) provides a numerical age of 272.3 ¬± 0.5 ‚Äì 259.8 ¬± 0.4 Mya. Biodiversity Therapsids became the dominant land animals in Guadalupian, displacing the pelycosaurs. Therapsids evolved from a group of pelycosaurs called sphenacodonts. Therapsida consists of four major clades: the dinocephalians, the herbivorous anomodonts, the carnivorous biarmosuchians, and the mostly carnivorous theriodonts. After a brief burst of evolutionary diversity, the dinocephalians died out in the later Guadalupian. Titanophoneus, top of the food chain in the Guadalupian A mass extinction occurred in the early Guadalupian before the larger Permian‚ÄìTriassic extinction event. This extinction was originally called Olson's Gap because it was thought to be a problem in preservation of fossils. Since the 1990s it has been renamed Olson‚Äôs Extinction. This extinction event occurred near the beginning of the epoch and led to an extended period of low diversity when two-thirds of terrestrial vertebrate life was lost worldwide. Global diversity rose dramatically by the end probably the result of disaster taxa filling empty guilds, only to fall again when the end-Guadalupian event caused a diversity drop in the Wuchiapingian. There is no agreed cause for the Olson's Extinction. Climate change may be a possible cause. Extreme environments were observed from the Permian of Kansas which resulted from a combination of hot climate and acidic waters particularly coincident with Olson‚Äôs Extinction. Whether this climate change was a result of Earth's natural processes or exacerbated by another event is unknown. Climate The climate resembled like that of much of central Asia today. Pangea was a supercontinent and had very hot dry summers and cold bitter winters. The coasts were tropical and had monsoons. The first two-thirds of the epoch were the continuation of a temperate and tropical climate. This started to dry out and the coal forming of the previous epoch stopped. The change in climate also provided a new environment for new tetrapod‚Äòs reptiles fish plants and invertebrates. In the last third the temperature started to drop and many coral reefs died out. If that was not enough, increased volcano activity brought a reduction in oxygen, a greenhouse and mass extinction. Beginning or Roadian The Roadian stage was between 272.3 ¬± 0.5 ‚Äì 268.8 ¬± 0.5 Mya. Olson‚Äôs Extinction was a worldwide loss of terrestrial vertebrate life that occurred during the Roadian and Wordian. Fauna did not recover fully from Olson's Extinction before the impact of the Permian-Triassic extinction event. Estimates of recovery time vary, where some authors indicated recovery was prolonged, lasting 30 million years into the Triassic. Several important events took place during Olson's Extinction, most notably the origin of therapsids, a group that includes the evolutionary ancestors of mammals. Further research on the recently identified primitive therapsid of the Xidagou Formation (Dashankou locality) in China of Roadian age may provide more information on this topic. Middle or Wordian The Wordian stage was between 268.8 ¬± 0.5 ‚Äì 265.1 ¬± 0.4 Mya. The base of the Wordian stage is defined as the place in the stratigraphic record where fossils of conodont species Jinogondolella aserrata first appear. The global reference profile for this stratigraphic boundary is located at Getaway Ledge in the Guadalupe Mountains of Texas. The top of the Wordian (the base of the Capitanian stage) is defined as the place in the stratigraphic record where the conodont species Jinogondolella postserrata first appears. Conclusion or Capitanian The Capitanian stage was between 265.1 ¬± 0.4 ‚Äì 259.8 ¬± 0.4 Mya. The Guadalupian ended with a deteriorating environment, Greenhouse conditions, and several series of mass-extinctions; both the great dinocephalians, other taxa on land and various invertebrates in the sea. They would be succeeded by new types of mammal-like reptiles. A significant mass extinction event (the End-Capitanian extinction event) occurred at the end of this epoch, which was associated with anoxia and acidification in the oceans and possibly caused by the volcanic eruptions that produced the Emeishan Traps. This extinction event may be related to the much larger Permian‚ÄìTriassic extinction event that followed about 10 million years later. Carbon isotopes in marine limestone from the Capitanian age show an increase in Œ¥13C values. The change in carbon isotopes in the sea water reflects cooling of global climates. This climatic cooling may have caused the end-Capitanian extinction event among species that lived in warm water, like larger fusulinids (Verbeekninidae), large bivalves (Alatoconchidae) and rugose corals, and Waagenophyllidae.

Howard started performing as Soltero while living in Boston. He currently resides in Brooklyn, NY. Production history Howard started playing music while attending Wesleyan as a film major in the late 1990s. Soltero has had several incarnations, including a five-piece band (with trumpet and Rhodes piano) and a four-piece band, as well as solo and duo acoustic lineups. The first full- length Soltero album, entitled Science Will Figure You Out, was recorded with members of the Mobius Band and self-released in August 2001. April 2003 saw the release of Defrocked and Kicking the Habit on Handsome Records. The Tongues You Have Tied. an album recorded winter 2003/04 on reel-to-reel 8-track, was put out on Three Ring Records in June 2004. Soltero's 2005 album, Hell Train, was the first to prominently feature his live band of three years. It was first self-released in March, and then released more widely by Three Ring Records in November 2005. Soltero's fifth record, You're No Dream, found Howard returning to the solo recording dynamic of earlier work. Recorded in Philadelphia using an array of borrowed instruments, the album was released in 2008. The band's sixth album, 1943, was recorded at Junxt Studio in Brooklyn and was selected by French production company Microcultures as a featured project for release in late 2011. Career history Tim Howard graduated from Wesleyan University CT in 2000. During a trip through Latin America in 2009, he decided to pursue a career in public radio. He applied for an internship at Radiolab and began working there in part because producer Lulu Miller was a fan of his music. Howard currently works for the Gimlet Media podcast Reply All and continues to write and record music in his spare time.

He co-wrote and co-produced songs including \\"Boogie Fever\\" by the Sylvers, \\"I Will Survive\\" by Gloria Gaynor, and \\"Shake Your Groove Thing\\" by Peaches & Herb. Biography=Early life Perren was born on May 15, 1943, in Englewood, New Jersey, and graduated from Englewood's Dwight Morrow High School with future songwriting partner Alphonse Mizell in 1961. \\"Freddie Perren\\", Contemporary Black Biography:Profiles from the International Black Community, p. 122. Gale (publisher), 2007. . Accessed August 19, 2011. \\"At Dwight Morrow High School, Perren was a member of the marching band, the orchestra, and sang in the chorus.\\" Perren attended Howard University in Washington, D.C. graduating in 1966. It was here he met future Capitol Records R&B; A&R; executive Larkin Arnold. He met Christine Yarian in 1967, and they married in 1970. Motown and The Jackson 5 Shortly after moving to California from Washington, D.C., in 1968, Perren and bassist Mizell met guitarist Deke Richards. They started writing songs together. In 1969 Motown president Berry Gordy invited them to be part of his collective The Corporation, a collection of songwriters and record producers for The Jackson 5. \\"I Want You Back\\" was the first hit from this new collaboration, going to number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1970. They wrote and produced more Jackson 5 hits such as \\"ABC\\", \\"The Love You Save\\", \\"Mama's Pearl\\", and \\"Maybe Tomorrow\\", among others. Perren and The Corporation continued their work for Motown on soundtracks such as Hell Up in Harlem and Cooley High, which featured \\"It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday\\" (later a hit for Boyz II Men). The birth of disco and a break with Motown Perren then moved into the disco arena with the hits \\"Do It Baby\\" and \\"Love Machine\\" for The Miracles. By 1976, Perren had left Motown and headed over to Capitol Records where another old college friend, Larkin Arnold, was now vice-president. In the next two years, Perren had success with The Sylvers, producing their first two Capitol albums. They had two Gold singles, \\"Boogie Fever\\" & \\"Hot Line\\", and a top ten single \\"High School Dance\\". Tavares and Fever Also successful collaborations for Perren were Tavares, for whom he produced three albums‚ÄîSky High!, Love Storm, and Future Bound. Commercial highlights of his work with the group include co-writing and producing the number-one disco hits \\"Don't Take Away The Music\\" and \\"Heaven Must Be Missing An Angel\\", and producing the group's take on The Bee Gees' \\"More Than A Woman\\". Both groups' versions were featured in the landmark 1977 movie and soundtrack to Saturday Night Fever. The Bee Gees recorded another of their own compositions, \\"If I Can't Have You\\", for the film and its soundtrack, but after hearing the Perren-produced version by Yvonne Elliman, preferred it to their own, which was relegated to a b-side. The Elliman production topped the Hot 100 and went Gold for U.S. sales over 1 million. The Saturday Night Fever soundtrack album sold over 15 million copies and in 1979 Perren received a Grammy Award for Album of the Year for his contribution, the first of two back-to-back Grammys he earned. MVP Productions and \\"Reunited\\" In 1978, Perren signed Peaches & Herb to his production company, MVP Productions. Through him, the duo inked a deal with Polydor Records. Their first Polydor album, 2 Hot, included the Gold single and Top Five pop and R&B; hit \\"Shake Your Groove Thing\\" as well the number-one crossover smash \\"Reunited\\" and third single \\"We've Got Love\\". 2 Hot went Platinum on the strength of those three hits, occupying the number-two pop albums spot for six weeks in early 1979. Peaches & Herb follow-up Twice the Fire went Gold and yielded the singles, \\"Roller Skate Mate (Part 1)\\", and \\"I Pledge My Love\\". \\"Survive\\": the peak and death of disco He received his second accolade from the Recording Academy by winning the first Grammy Award for Best Disco Recording in 1980 for Gloria Gaynor's \\"I Will Survive.\\" Gaynor's recording went to number one in both the U.S. and the UK, eventually being certified Double Platinum by the RIAA for sales of over four million copies in the U.S. The song became a disco classic and has been recorded by dozens of artists in the decades since its debut including charting versions by Cake, Chantay Savage, and Diana Ross. However, the disco craze had been so overwhelming in some quarters that it caused a backlash so strong that the Recording Academy reacted by omitting the category before the following year; this, then, was the only Grammy specifically awarded for the disco genre. Later years Perren last worked with New Edition in 1986 on their Under the Blue Moon, but by the end of the decade he was largely inactive as a writer and producer. In the 1990s, Perren experienced a resurgence of success as the boyband phenomenon sought musical credibility and instant recognizability with covers of 1970s soul-disco hits. Boyz II Men eclipsed the success of the G.C. Cameron original with their cover of Perren's \\"It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday\\", hitting number two on the Hot 100 and the top spot on the Hot R&B; Singles chart. The song was later covered by Irish boyband Westlife. In 1998, British boyband 911 took a cover of \\"More Than a Woman\\" to number two in the UK Singles Chart. In 1993, Perren suffered a massive stroke. He died 11 years later at the age of 61 in his home in Chatsworth, Los Angeles. He is interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills).

The village has footpath links which run through surrounding fields and rural landscape. The Essex Way is not far from the Northern boundary of the parish. Transport Feering is close to the A12 and M11 (the latter via the A120). The village has recently been affected by the A120 proposal to construct a dual carriageway to the north of the village. This extension of the dual carriageway section of the A120 will stretch from the current A12 near Marks Tey to Braintree \\"cutting travelling time to Stansted by 10 minutes\\". The Highways Agency has not released information concerning new routes, which has angered some local residents, who oppose the new proposals.

MHD generators are different from traditional electric generators in that they operate without moving parts (e.g. no turbine) to limit the upper temperature. They therefore have the highest known theoretical thermodynamic efficiency of any electrical generation method. MHD has been extensively developed as a topping cycle to increase the efficiency of electric generation, especially when burning coal or natural gas. The hot exhaust gas from an MHD generator can heat the boilers of a steam power plant, increasing overall efficiency. An MHD generator, like a conventional generator, relies on moving a conductor through a magnetic field to generate electric current. The MHD generator uses hot conductive ionized gas (a plasma) as the moving conductor. The mechanical dynamo, in contrast, uses the motion of mechanical devices to accomplish this. Practical MHD generators have been developed for fossil fuels, but these were overtaken by less expensive combined cycles in which the exhaust of a gas turbine or molten carbonate fuel cell heats steam to power a steam turbine. MHD dynamos are the complement of MHD accelerators, which have been applied to pump liquid metals, seawater and plasmas. Natural MHD dynamos are an active area of research in plasma physics and are of great interest to the geophysics and astrophysics communities, since the magnetic fields of the earth and sun are produced by these natural dynamos. Principle The Lorentz Force Law describes the effects of a charged particle moving in a constant magnetic field. The simplest form of this law is given by the vector equation. : \\\\mathbf{F} = Q (\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{B}) where * F is the force acting on the particle. * Q is the charge of the particle, * v is the velocity of the particle, and * B is the magnetic field. The vector F is perpendicular to both v and B according to the right hand rule.  Power generation  Typically, for a large power station to approach the operational efficiency of computer models, steps must be taken to increase the electrical conductivity of the conductive substance. The heating of a gas to its plasma state or the addition of other easily ionizable substances like the salts of alkali metals can accomplish this increase. In practice, a number of issues must be considered in the implementation of an MHD generator: generator efficiency, economics, and toxic byproducts. These issues are affected by the choice of one of the three MHD generator designs: the Faraday generator, the Hall generator, and the disc generator.  Faraday generator  The Faraday generator is named after the man who first looked for the effect in the Thames river (see history). A simple Faraday generator would consist of a wedge-shaped pipe or tube of some non-conductive material. When an electrically conductive fluid flows through the tube, in the presence of a significant perpendicular magnetic field, a voltage is induced in the field, which can be drawn off as electrical power by placing the electrodes on the sides at 90 degree angles to the magnetic field. There are limitations on the density and type of field used. The amount of power that can be extracted is proportional to the cross sectional area of the tube and the speed of the conductive flow. The conductive substance is also cooled and slowed by this process. MHD generators typically reduce the temperature of the conductive substance from plasma temperatures to just over 1000 ¬∞C. The main practical problem of a Faraday generator is that differential voltages and currents in the fluid short through the electrodes on the sides of the duct. The most powerful waste is from the Hall effect current. This makes the Faraday duct very inefficient. Most further refinements of MHD generators have tried to solve this problem. The optimal magnetic field on duct-shaped MHD generators is a sort of saddle shape. To get this field, a large generator requires an extremely powerful magnet. Many research groups have tried to adapt superconducting magnets to this purpose, with varying success. (For references, please see the discussion of generator efficiency, below.)  Hall generator  Diagram of a Hall MHD generator showing current flows The typical solution, historically, has been to use the Hall effect to create a current that flows with the fluid. (See illustration.) This design has arrays of short, segmented electrodes on the sides of the duct. The first and last electrodes in the duct power the load. Each other electrode is shorted to an electrode on the opposite side of the duct. These shorts of the Faraday current induce a powerful magnetic field within the fluid, but in a chord of a circle at right angles to the Faraday current. This secondary, induced field makes current flow in a rainbow shape between the first and last electrodes. Losses are less than a Faraday generator, and voltages are higher because there is less shorting of the final induced current. However, this design has problems because the speed of the material flow requires the middle electrodes to be offset to \\"catch\\" the Faraday currents. As the load varies, the fluid flow speed varies, misaligning the Faraday current with its intended electrodes, and making the generator's efficiency very sensitive to its load.  Disc generator  Diagram of a disk MHD generator showing current flows The third and, currently, the most efficient design is the Hall effect disc generator. This design currently holds the efficiency and energy density records for MHD generation. A disc generator has fluid flowing between the center of a disc, and a duct wrapped around the edge. (The ducts are not shown.) The magnetic excitation field is made by a pair of circular Helmholtz coils above and below the disk. (The coils are not shown.) The Faraday currents flow in a perfect dead short around the periphery of the disk. The Hall effect currents flow between ring electrodes near the center duct and ring electrodes near the periphery duct. The wide flat gas flow reduced the distance, hence the resistance of the moving fluid. This increases efficiency. Another significant advantage of this design is that the magnets are more efficient. First, they cause simple parallel field lines. Second, because the fluid is processed in a disk, the magnet can be closer to the fluid, and in this magnetic geometry, magnetic field strengths increase as the 7th power of distance. Finally, the generator is compact for its power, so the magnet is also smaller. The resulting magnet uses a much smaller percentage of the generated power.  Generator efficiency  The efficiency of the direct energy conversion in MHD power generation increases with the magnetic field strength and the plasma conductivity, which depends directly on the plasma temperature, and more precisely on the electron temperature. As very hot plasmas can only be used in pulsed MHD generators (for example using shock tubes) due to the fast thermal material erosion, it was envisaged to use nonthermal plasmas as working fluids in steady MHD generators, where only free electrons are heated a lot (10,000‚Äì20,000 kelvins) while the main gas (neutral atoms and ions) remains at a much lower temperature, typically 2500 kelvins. The goal was to preserve the materials of the generator (walls and electrodes) while improving the limited conductivity of such poor conductors to the same level as a plasma in thermodynamic equilibrium; i.e. completely heated to more than 10,000 kelvins, a temperature that no material could stand. But Evgeny Velikhov first discovered theoretically in 1962 and experimentally in 1963 that an ionization instability, later called the Velikhov instability or electrothermal instability, quickly arises in any MHD converter using magnetized nonthermal plasmas with hot electrons, when a critical Hall parameter is reached, hence depending on the degree of ionization and the magnetic field. Such an instability greatly degrades the performance of nonequilibrium MHD generators. The prospects about this technology, which initially predicted awesome efficiencies, crippled MHD programs all over the world as no solution to mitigate the instability was found at that time. Consequently, without implementing solutions to master the electrothermal instability, practical MHD generators had to limit the Hall parameter or use moderately heated thermal plasmas instead of cold plasmas with hot electrons, which severely lowers efficiency. As of 1994, the 22% efficiency record for closed-cycle disc MHD generators was held by Tokyo Technical Institute. The peak enthalpy extraction in these experiments reached 30.2%. Typical open-cycle Hall & duct coal MHD generators are lower, near 17%. These efficiencies make MHD unattractive, by itself, for utility power generation, since conventional Rankine cycle power plants easily reach 40%. However, the exhaust of an MHD generator burning fossil fuel is almost as hot as a flame. By routing its exhaust gases into a heat exchanger for a turbine Brayton cycle or steam generator Rankine cycle, MHD can convert fossil fuels into electricity with an estimated efficiency up to 60 percent, compared to the 40 percent of a typical coal plant. A magnetohydrodynamic generator might also be the first stage of a gas-cooled nuclear reactor.  Material and design issues  MHD generators have difficult problems in regard to materials, both for the walls and the electrodes. Materials must not melt or corrode at very high temperatures. Exotic ceramics were developed for this purpose, and must be selected to be compatible with the fuel and ionization seed. The exotic materials and the difficult fabrication methods contribute to the high cost of MHD generators. Also, MHDs work better with stronger magnetic fields. The most successful magnets have been superconducting, and very close to the channel. A major difficulty was refrigerating these magnets while insulating them from the channel. The problem is worse because the magnets work better when they are closer to the channel. There are also severe risks of damage to the hot, brittle ceramics from differential thermal cracking. The magnets are usually near absolute zero, while the channel is several thousand degrees. For MHDs, both alumina (Al2O3) and magnesium peroxide (MgO2) were reported to work for the insulating walls. Magnesium peroxide degrades near moisture. Alumina is water-resistant and can be fabricated to be quite strong, so in practice most MHDs have used alumina for the insulating walls. For the electrodes of clean MHDs (i.e. burning natural gas), one good material was a mix of 80% CeO2, 18% ZrO2, and 2% Ta2O5. Coal-burning MHDs have intensely corrosive environments with slag. The slag both protects and corrodes MHD materials. In particular, migration of oxygen through the slag accelerates corrosion of metallic anodes. Nonetheless, very good results have been reported with stainless steel electrodes at 900K. Another, perhaps superior option is a spinel ceramic, FeAl2O4 \\\\- Fe3O4. The spinel was reported to have electronic conductivity, absence of a resistive reaction layer but with some diffusion of iron into the alumina. The diffusion of iron could be controlled with a thin layer of very dense alumina, and water cooling in both the electrodes and alumina insulators. Attaching the high temperature electrodes to conventional copper bus bars is also challenging. The usual methods establish a chemical passivation layer, and cool the busbar with water.  Economics  MHD generators have not been employed for large scale mass energy conversion because other techniques with comparable efficiency have a lower lifecycle investment cost. Advances in natural gas turbines achieved similar thermal efficiencies at lower costs, by having the turbine's exhaust drive a Rankine cycle steam plant. To get more electricity from coal, it is cheaper to simply add more low-temperature steam-generating capacity. A coal-fueled MHD generator is a type of Brayton power cycle, similar to the power cycle of a combustion turbine. However, unlike the combustion turbine, there are no moving mechanical parts; the electrically conducting plasma provides the moving electrical conductor. The side walls and electrodes merely withstand the pressure within, while the anode and cathode conductors collect the electricity that is generated. All Brayton cycles are heat engines. Ideal Brayton cycles also have an ideal efficiency equal to ideal Carnot cycle efficiency. Thus, the potential for high energy efficiency from an MHD generator. All Brayton cycles have higher potential for efficiency the higher the firing temperature. While a combustion turbine is limited in maximum temperature by the strength of its air/water or steam-cooled rotating airfoils; there are no rotating parts in an open-cycle MHD generator. This upper bound in temperature limits the energy efficiency in combustion turbines. The upper bound on Brayton cycle temperature for an MHD generator is not limited, so inherently an MHD generator has a higher potential capability for energy efficiency. The temperatures at which linear coal-fueled MHD generators can operate are limited by factors that include: (a) the combustion fuel, oxidizer, and oxidizer preheat temperature which limit the maximum temperature of the cycle; (b) the ability to protect the sidewalls and electrodes from melting; (c) the ability to protect the electrodes from electrochemical attack from the hot slag coating the walls combined with the high current or arcs that impinge on the electrodes as they carry off the direct current from the plasma; and (d) by the capability of the electrical insulators between each electrode. Coal-fired MHD plants with oxygen/air and high oxidant preheats would probably provide potassium seeded plasmas of about 4200¬∞F, 10 atmospheres pressure, and begin expansion at Mach1.2. These plants would recover MHD exhaust heat for oxidant preheat, and for combined cycle steam generation. With aggressive assumptions, one DOE-funded feasibility study of where the technology could go, 1000 MWe Advanced Coal-Fired MHD/Steam Binary Cycle Power Plant Conceptual Design, published in June 1989, showed that a large coal-fired MHD combined cycle plant could attain a HHV energy efficiency approaching 60 percent‚Äîwell in excess of other coal-fueled technologies, so the potential for low operating costs exists. However, no testing at those aggressive conditions or size has yet occurred, and there are no large MHD generators now under test. There is simply an inadequate reliability track record to provide confidence in a commercial coal-fuelled MHD design. U25B MHD testing in Russia using natural gas as fuel used a superconducting magnet, and had an output of 1.4 megawatts. A coal-fired MHD generator series of tests funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) in 1992 produced MHD power from a larger superconducting magnet at the Component Development and Integration Facility (CDIF) in Butte, Montana. None of these tests were conducted for long-enough durations to verify the commercial durability of the technology. Neither of the test facilities were in large- enough scale for a commercial unit. Superconducting magnets are used in the larger MHD generators to eliminate one of the large parasitic losses: the power needed to energize the electromagnet. Superconducting magnets, once charged, consume no power, and can develop intense magnetic fields 4 teslas and higher. The only parasitic load for the magnets are to maintain refrigeration, and to make up the small losses for the non-supercritical connections. Because of the high temperatures, the non-conducting walls of the channel must be constructed from an exceedingly heat-resistant substance such as yttrium oxide or zirconium dioxide to retard oxidation. Similarly, the electrodes must be both conductive and heat-resistant at high temperatures. The AVCO coal-fueled MHD generator at the CDIF was tested with water-cooled copper electrodes capped with platinum, tungsten, stainless steel, and electrically-conducting ceramics.  Toxic byproducts  MHD reduces overall production of hazardous fossil fuel wastes because it increases plant efficiency. In MHD coal plants, the patented commercial \\"Econoseed\\" process developed by the U.S. (see below) recycles potassium ionization seed from the fly ash captured by the stack-gas scrubber. However, this equipment is an additional expense. If molten metal is the armature fluid of an MHD generator, care must be taken with the coolant of the electromagnetics and channel. The alkali metals commonly used as MHD fluids react violently with water. Also, the chemical byproducts of heated, electrified alkali metals and channel ceramics may be poisonous and environmentally persistent.  History  The first practical MHD power research was funded in 1938 in the U.S. by Westinghouse in its Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania laboratories, headed by Hungarian Bela Karlovitz. The initial patent on MHD is by B. Karlovitz, U.S. Patent No. 2,210,918, \\"Process for the Conversion of Energy\\", August 13, 1940. World War II interrupted development. In 1962, the First International Conference on MHD Power was held in Newcastle upon Tyne, UK by Dr. Brian C. Lindley of the International Research and Development Company Ltd. The group set up a steering committee to set up further conferences and disseminate ideas. In 1964, the group set up a second conference in Paris, France, in consultation with the European Nuclear Energy Agency. Since membership in the ENEA was limited, the group persuaded the International Atomic Energy Agency to sponsor a third conference, in Salzburg, Austria, July 1966. Negotiations at this meeting converted the steering committee into a periodic reporting group, the ILG-MHD (international liaison group, MHD), under the ENEA, and later in 1967, also under the International Atomic Energy Agency. Further research in the 1960s by R. Rosa established the practicality of MHD for fossil-fueled systems. In the 1960s, AVCO Everett Aeronautical Research began a series of experiments, ending with the Mk. V generator of 1965. This generated 35MW, but used about 8 MW to drive its magnet. In 1966, the ILG-MHD had its first formal meeting in Paris, France. It began issuing a periodic status report in 1967. This pattern persisted, in this institutional form, up until 1976. Toward the end of the 1960s, interest in MHD declined because nuclear power was becoming more widely available. In the late 1970s, as interest in nuclear power declined, interest in MHD increased. In 1975, UNESCO became persuaded the MHD might be the most efficient way to utilise world coal reserves, and in 1976, sponsored the ILG-MHD. In 1976, it became clear that no nuclear reactor in the next 25 years would use MHD, so the International Atomic Energy Agency and ENEA (both nuclear agencies) withdrew support from the ILG-MHD, leaving UNESCO as the primary sponsor of the ILG-MHD.  Former Yugoslavia development  Over more than a ten-year span, engineers in former Yugoslavian Institute of Thermal and Nuclear Technology (ITEN), Energoinvest Co., Sarajevo, had built the first experimental Magneto-Hydrodynamic facility power generator in 1989. It was here it was first patented.  U.S. development  In the 1980s, the U.S. Department of Energy began a vigorous multiyear program, culminating in a 1992 50 MW demonstration coal combustor at the Component Development and Integration Facility (CDIF) in Butte, Montana. This program also had significant work at the Coal-Fired-In-Flow-Facility (CFIFF) at University of Tennessee Space Institute. This program combined four parts: # An integrated MHD topping cycle, with channel, electrodes and current control units developed by AVCO, later known as Textron Defence of Boston. This system was a Hall effect duct generator heated by pulverized coal, with a potassium ionisation seed. AVCO had developed the famous Mk. V generator, and had significant experience. # An integrated bottoming cycle, developed at the CDIF. # A facility to regenerate the ionization seed was developed by TRW. Potassium carbonate is separated from the sulphate in the fly ash from the scrubbers. The carbonate is removed, to regain the potassium. # A method to integrate MHD into preexisting coal plants. The Department of Energy commissioned two studies. Westinghouse Electric performed a study based on the Scholtz Plant of Gulf Power in Sneads, Florida. The MHD Development Corporation also produced a study based on the J.E. Corrette Plant of the Montana Power Company of Billings, Montana. Initial prototypes at the CDIF were operated for short durations, with various coals: Montana Rosebud, and a high-sulphur corrosive coal, Illinois No. 6. A great deal of engineering, chemistry and material science was completed. After final components were developed, operational testing completed with 4,000 hours of continuous operation, 2,000 on Montana Rosebud, 2,000 on Illinois No. 6. The testing ended in 1993.  Japanese development  The Japanese program in the late 1980s concentrated on closed-cycle MHD. The belief was that it would have higher efficiencies, and smaller equipment, especially in the clean, small, economical plant capacities near 100 megawatts (electrical) which are suited to Japanese conditions. Open-cycle coal-powered plants are generally thought to become economical above 200 megawatts. The first major series of experiments was FUJI-1, a blow-down system powered from a shock tube at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. These experiments extracted up to 30.2% of enthalpy, and achieved power densities near 100 megawatts per cubic meter. This facility was funded by Tokyo Electric Power, other Japanese utilities, and the Department of Education. Some authorities believe this system was a disc generator with a helium and argon carrier gas and potassium ionization seed. In 1994, there were detailed plans for FUJI-2, a 5 MWe continuous closed-cycle facility, powered by natural gas, to be built using the experience of FUJI-1. The basic MHD design was to be a system with inert gases using a disk generator. The aim was an enthalpy extraction of 30% and an MHD thermal efficiency of 60%. FUJI-2 was to be followed by a retrofit to a 300MWe natural gas plant.  Australian development  In 1986, Professor Hugo Karl Messerle at The University of Sydney researched coal-fueled MHD. This resulted in a 28MWe topping facility that was operated outside Sydney. Messerle also wrote one of the most recent reference works (see below), as part of a UNESCO education program. A detailed obituary for Hugo is located on the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering (ATSE) website..  Italian development  The Italian program began in 1989 with a budget of about 20 million $US, and had three main development areas: # MHD Modelling. # Superconducting magnet development. The goal in 1994 was a prototype 2m long, storing 66MJ, for an MHD demonstration 8m long. The field was to be 5teslas, with a taper of 0.15T/m. The geometry was to resemble a saddle shape, with cylindrical and rectangular windings of niobium-titanium copper. # Retrofits to natural gas powerplants. One was to be at the Enichem-Anic factor in Ravenna. In this plant, the combustion gases from the MHD would pass to the boiler. The other was a 230MW (thermal) installation for a power station in Brindisi, that would pass steam to the main power plant.  Chinese development  A joint U.S.-China national programme ended in 1992 by retrofitting the coal-fired No. 3 plant in Asbach. A further eleven-year program was approved in March 1994. This established centres of research in: # The Institute of Electrical Engineering in the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, concerned with MHD generator design. # The Shanghai Power Research Institute, concerned with overall system and superconducting magnet research. # The Thermoenergy Research Engineering Institute at the Nanjing's Southeast University, concerned with later developments. The 1994 study proposed a 10W (electrical, 108MW thermal) generator with the MHD and bottoming cycle plants connected by steam piping, so either could operate independently.  Russian developments  U-25 scale model In 1971 the natural-gas fired U-25 plant was completed near Moscow, with a designed capacity of 25 megawatts. By 1974 it delivered 6 megawatts of power.Donald G. ink, H. Wayne Beatty (ed), Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers, 11th Edition, Mc Graw Hill, 1978 page 11‚Äì52 By 1994, Russia had developed and operated the coal-operated facility U-25, at the High-Temperature Institute of the Russian Academy of Science in Moscow. U-25's bottoming plant was actually operated under contract with the Moscow utility, and fed power into Moscow's grid. There was substantial interest in Russia in developing a coal-powered disc generator. In 1986 the first industrial power plant with MHD generator was built, but in 1989 the project was cancelled before MHD launch and this power plant later joined to Ryazan Power Station as a 7th unit with ordinary construction.

The objective of the Code is to facilitate production by controlling strikes & lockouts, occupational safety and health, and some employment standards. Generally speaking, the Code only applies to those industries in which the federal government has jurisdiction instead of the provinces. These industries include: broadcasting, telecommunications, chartered banks, postal service, airports and air transportation, shipping and navigation, interprovincial or international transportation (i.e., road, railway, ferry or pipeline). It also applies to businesses in the Territories, on First Nations reserves, and certain Crown Corporations. It also applies to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and the military, and those covered under the (now repealed) Public Service Staff Relations Act (RS 1985, c. P-35) or its successor Public Service Modernization Act (2003, c. 22).  Origin  Industrialization in Canada, as elsewhere, brought with it increasingly poor employment standards. Employers often took advantage of their workers by providing them with little to no health and safety elements in the workplace and no job security. When the workers formed unions, negotiations between the employer and union often dragged on or broke down completely. In these instances, the unions would use techniques such as strikes and sabotage to impress on the employer the idea that the workers had rights as humans and even deserved respect. The unionism would then often build solidarity between workers, even in different industries. In response, the Government of Canada established the Conciliation Act of 1900. This Act created the federal Department of Labour whose purpose was to help settle labour disputes and promote fair wages and proper conditions for workers. Prior to the act disputes were handled by the Postmaster General.https://www.monster.ca/career-advice/article/celebrating- onehundredfifty-year-of-working-in-canada The Department had little success but determined that they required the authority to impose conciliation amongst the union and employer. After the 1906 Lethbridge coalfield strike, this requirement became paramount and was introduced in the Industrial Disputes Investigation Act of 1907 (IDI). This act also introduced compulsory investigation of labour disputes, a prohibition of work stoppages pending this investigation, and the requirement for compromise. As the industries continued to resist the demands laid down by the unions, the organizations grew larger and began to plan large-scale tactics such as the Winnipeg General Strike. This created even more fear in the government concerning unions and led to further legislation. During World War II, the wartime government suspended provincial labour legislation and the IDI act. However, the Wartime Labour Relations Regulations (Order in Council P.C. 1003) of 1944 introduced the provisions for certification of unions, leading to the temporary dissolution and outlawing of the major solidarity unions in Canada (including the IWW and the One Big Union). The WLRR also introduced the duty to meet and bargain in good faith, prohibitions of unfair labour practices, and the introduction of a labour relations board. In 1948, this Order in Council and the IDI act were consolidated into the Industrial Relations and Disputes Investigation Act. In 1967, this act was consolidated, along with other statutes, as Part V of the Canada Labour Code, (S.C. 1966-67, c. 62). It came into force on January 1st, 1968. Significant amendments were made to this part of the Code in 1973. These amendments included extending bargaining rights to some previously excluded groups (e.g., supervisors, employed professionals, etc.) and expanding the jurisdiction of the labour relations board to include enforcement and remedial powers. Also, provisions for adjustments to technological changes were introduced. Finally, in 1988 the Code was reissued as part of the Revised Statutes of Canada, (R.S.C. 1985, c. L-2.), wherein Part V became Part I.  Legislation  The Code is divided into three distinct parts. The first part deals with collective bargaining between unions and employers. It comes mostly from the Industrial Relations and Disputes Investigation Act of 1948. The second part deals with health & safety in the workplace. The third part deals with employment standards but defers mostly to Provincial legislation for each province of employment.  Part 1: Industrial Relations  This part of the Code is divided into seven divisions and deals with collective bargaining, dispute resolution, strikes and lockouts. It, first of all, establishes basic freedoms, in accordance with Convention C87 of the International Labour Organization, by setting out that employees are \\"free to join the trade union of their choice and to participate in its lawful activities\\" [s.8(1)] and employers, likewise, are free to organize. Divisions III, IV, V.1, and VI, set out the procedures and regulations for collective bargaining. In short, a trade union for employees or an organization representing employers must first be certified by the Canada Labour Relations Board, whose composition and procedures are detailed in Division II. The Code places a duty on the two sides to meet and negotiate \\"in good faith and make every reasonable effort to enter into a collective agreement\\" [s.50 (a) i,ii]. The role of the Canada Labour Relations Board is to interpret the code and to investigate allegations of unfair labour practices and failures to bargain in good faith. Division V details the role of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. It is \\"responsible for fostering harmonious relations between trade unions and employers by assisting them in the negotiation of collective agreements and their renewal.\\" [s.70.1(1)] They are employees of the Human Resources Development Canada and report to the Minister of Labour. Divisions V.1 and VI set out conditions for strikes and lockouts. Before such work stoppages occur a secret ballot vote must result in a majority wishing to proceed with a work stoppage. However, this cannot occur during the term of an agreement, only once it expires. The union (for strikes) or the employers (for lockouts) must give the Minister of Labour 72 hours' notice before the work stoppage can occur. The Minister can prevent or cease a work stoppage by appointing a conciliation officer, commissioner, or board, to mediate negotiations. Section 100 of the Code sets a limit of $1000 per day is set for illegal lockouts or strikes. Also of note, Division IV sets out special arrangements for interruptions in employment due to technological change. It also allows union dues to be deducted from an employee's wages, and, in case of religious objections, forward the amount deducted to a registered charity mutually agreed on by the employee and the trade union. Division V.1 prohibits work stoppages \\"to the extent necessary to prevent an immediate and serious danger to the safety or health of the public.\\" [s.87.4(1)]  Part 2: Occupational Health and Safety  This part of the Code deals with maintaining the health and safety of workers in the workplace. It focuses on the recognition and prevention of hazards. The beginning of this part states the purpose here \\"is to prevent accidents and injury to health arising out of, linked with or occurring in the course of employment.\\" [s.122.1] Sections 124 and 125 set out the duties of employers with regard to the health and safety of their employees. A list is provided of 45 general and specific duties for the employer to follow. For example, these duties include providing first-aid facilities, potable water, sanitary and personal facilities (i.e., washrooms), prescribed safety materials, equipment, devices and clothing, safety manuals in telecommunications companies and other industries and so on. These duties extend beyond the workplace and include all areas in which an employee may travel in the course of a work day. The employers are responsible for employees, that is with those with whom they are in an employment relationship. As well, the employer has responsibility to ensure other persons, including visitors and contractors, do not imperil employee safety. Sections 122.3 and 132 establish conditions for employees with a special needs and pregnant and nursing employees. Section 126 sets out the duties of employees. It is their duty to \\"take all reasonable and necessary precautions to ensure the health and safety of the employee, the other employees and any person likely to be affected by the employee's acts or omissions\\" [s.126(1)(c)] and to use any safety features that the employer provides. In cases of conflict between the employee and employer sections 127.1 and 128 set out a resolution process. An employee is permitted to \\"refuse to use or operate a machine or thing, to work in a place or to perform an activity, if the employee while at work has reasonable cause to believe that the performance of the activity constitutes a danger to the employee or to another employee.\\" [s.128 (1)(c)] All complaints must be reasonably investigated to find if the claim is justified. In order to facilitate investigations sections 134 to 140 establish requirements, regulations, and procedures for health and safety committees, representatives, and officers. For workplaces with 20 or more employees, a committee must be established consisting of at least two employees. For workplaces with fewer than 20 employees, at least one representative must be selected by the non-managerial employee as a Health and Safety Representative. The employer must be readily accessible to this representative in order to address health and safety matters. Regional Health and Safety Officers are appointed by the Minister of Labour and investigate incidents and complaints concerning health and safety in the workplace. Violations for this part of the Labour Code can be punishable by up to two years in jail and a $1,000,000 fine as set out in section 148. A death or injury that resulted in combination with a violation of this part of the act can be viewed as a criminal act and prosecuted as such. Special conditions are set out for coal mines. Section 137.1 establishes the composition, procedures and regulations of a Coal Mining Safety Commission. Section 125.3 requires employers to submit their plans and procedures to this commission.  Part 3: Federal Labour Standards  The third part of the Code is divided into 16 divisions which deal with terms and conditions of employment concerning hours, wages, leave, holidays, and sexual harassment. It also sets the conditions for the termination of employment. Division I establishes the eight-hour day and forty hour week but permits averaging if the profession demands extended hours. Workers must get at least one full day, \\"Sunday shall be the normal day of rest,\\" [s.173] and overtime is paid at least one and one-half times the normal wage. Division II establishes that the Province of employment's minimum wage, with the exception of those based on age discrimination, shall be used for workers in industries under federal jurisdiction. This division also deals with wage deduction with respect to room, board, uniforms, tools, etc. Division III refers to the Canadian Human Rights Act for prohibition to discriminatory wage practices. These first three divisions should also be read with the Fair Wages and Hours of Labour Act (R.S. 1985, c. L-4 ) which concerns public works and those on government contracts. Also, division XV requires that payment of wages must be made within thirty days. Divisions IV and V establish the amount, length and pay for vacations and holidays. Division VI allows the Governor in Council to make special regulations for industries that use multiple employers for the same job. Divisions VII, VIII, XIII, and XIII.1 make arrangements for maternity, parental, compassionate care, bereavement, and sick leave. These sections say that \\"no employer shall dismiss, suspend, lay off, demote or discipline an employee because of absence due to illness or injury‚Ä¶\\"[s.239(1)], or any other of these aforementioned leave periods and that \\"pension, health and disability benefits and the seniority of any employee‚Ä¶[during] a leave of absence‚Ä¶shall accumulate during the entire period of the leave.\\"[s209.2(1)] Specifically, an employee is permitted 17 weeks of maternity leave, 63 weeks for parental leave, 8 weeks for compassionate care leave, and 3 days for bereavement leave. The leave period, and its associated benefits, due to illness or injury, depends upon the nature of the illness or injury and the period of absence. Divisions IX to XII, XIV set the procedures for termination of employees. Division IX deals with lay-offs of 50 or more people wherein a 16-week notice must be given to the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development and the Canada Employment Insurance Commission and a 2-week notice to individual employees. Division X deals with the termination of fewer than 50 people wherein 2 weeks' notice or 2 weeks' pay in lieu of notice must be given to the employee. Division XI deals with the allotment of severance pay and division XII prohibits termination or any other disciplinary action due to any garnishment proceedings of any employee. Division XIV makes provisions in cases of unjust dismissals. A complaint of an unjust dismissal may be made to an inspector who in turn can require the employer to provide a written statement of the reasons for the dismissal. If the inspector cannot settle the dispute then the Minister may appoint an adjudicator to resolve the dispute. Division XV.1 prohibits sexual harassment by saying that \\"every employee is entitled to employment free of sexual harassment.\\" [s.247.2]. It defines sexual harassment as \\"any conduct, comment, gesture or contact of a sexual nature (a) that is likely to cause offence or humiliation to any employee; or (b) that might, on reasonable grounds, be perceived by that employee as placing a condition of a sexual nature on employment or on any opportunity for training or promotion.\\" [s.247.1] Group terminations With group terminations, an employer that is in a federally-regulated industry like a CDIC bank or a CRTC phone company is also required to co-operate with the Canada Employment Insurance Commission, provide affected employees with a statement of benefits, and establish a joint planning committee. On 21 May 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, WestJet sought an exemption on Part 3 Division IX law from Labour minister Filomena Tassi. The company said: \\"unprecedented circumstances with regards to the coronavirus pandemic and the subsequent decline in air travel prompted by containment measures worldwide\\" were to blame. Passenger loads at the airline \\"dropped by more than 95 per cent due to travel restrictions imposed because of the coronavirus outbreak\\".

It is named after the community of Port Hood immediately to the east on Cape Breton Island. Before this name, the island was known as Smith Island. Originally, Port Hood Island was connected to Cape Breton Island by a sand spit. It housed a booming lobster cannery, however, during a winter storm in the late 19th century, the thin sand spit connecting Port Hood Island was washed away. In the late 1950s, a road was constructed from the (then) main fishing wharf of the mainland to the fishing wharf on the island but it did not stand up to the weather and washed away shortly after completion. Rocks that made up the road still remain and now form what residents call the \\"Breakwater\\". The island was originally settled by Protestant Loyalists, giving contrast to the Catholic majority in the Port Hood area. In the 1950s Port Hood Island had approximately 28 families, mostly fishermen and small lot farmers, along with a one-room school which handled grades 1-8/9, after which students boarded in Port Hood and attended Port Hood Academy. The island church enjoyed the services of the Port Hood minister who also served Mabou. The Island is the subject of a song, \\"Lonely Island\\" written by Jimmy Rankin and featured on The Rankin Family's debut album. (1989).

She was the third wife of Jacob Adler and the mother of prominent actors Luther and Stella Adler, and lesser-known actors Jay, Julia Adler, Frances, and Florence.Adler, Jacob, A Life on the Stage: A Memoir, translated and with commentary by Lulla Rosenfeld, Knopf, New York, 1999, . 266, passim. The most famous of her 300 or so leading roles was the redeemed prostitute Katusha Maslova in Jacob Gordin's play based on Tolstoy's Resurrection.(22 August 1914). Mme. Sarah Adler, The Moving Picture World, p. 1086. Biography She was born in Odessa, Russian Empire (currently in Ukraine), and grew up speaking Russian, and only learned Yiddish through her participation in Yiddish theater. In Russia, she married Maurice Heine, leader of a Yiddish theater troupe. After the 1883 ban on Yiddish theater in Imperial Russia, Maurice and Sara Heine left in 1884 for New York City. They had two sons Joseph and Max Heine.New York Times, April 29, 1953, obituary: \\"Sarah Adler Dies; Yiddish Stage Star\\", p. 29. Jacob Adler recorded that when she first performed at his London theater, around 1886, \\"she spoke no Yiddish ... but came out before the curtain and sang Russian songs\\". In 1890, Maurice and Sara divorced, and in 1891 she married Jacob Adler, himself recently divorced from a brief second marriage to Dinah Shtettin. She and Adler would be among the most prominent actors in Yiddish theater in New York for the next three decades. Both she and Jacob starred in the 1908 play The Worthless written by Jacob Gordin, and in 1911 she appeared in Gordin's play Elisha Ben Abuyah (originally staged in 1906). In 1914, she starred in the silent film, Sins of the Parents directed by Ivan Abramson. The film was one of only two movies in which she appeared. After her husband's 1920 stroke and 1926 death, she performed only infrequently. Although probably most remembered for her lead roles opposite her husband, Sara Adler also set out on her own with the Novelty Theater in Brooklyn where she presented (in Yiddish) works of Ibsen and Shaw well before they were familiar to an English-language audience. She also presented works of the French feminist Eug√®ne Brieux. After Rudolph Schildkraut quarrelled with Max Reinhardt in Vienna, Sara Adler brought him to Brooklyn to play the husband in Jacob Gordin's stage adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's The Kreutzer Sonata. That production also included Jacob Ben-Ami (associated with the Vilna Troupe, as well as Adler offspring Stella and Luther Adler (Adler, 1999, 361 (commentary)).

He joined the Canadian Forces in 1942 and fought in World War II. When he returned to Canada following the war, he settled in Kirkland Lake, where he purchased the Prince George Hotel, working as joint owner from 1946 to 1948, then owner from 1948 to 1950 and then became a radio host for CJKL. He subsequently moved to Timmins and applied for a broadcasting license; CFCL went to air in 1952 as the first French language radio station in Ontario. In 1956, Lavigne also received a television license. CFCL-TV went to air that year as a dual affiliate of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's English and French television networks. Lavigne subsequently added rebroadcast transmitters in several other communities. By 1965, he owned the largest private microwave transmission network in the world. In 1971, Lavigne expanded into Sudbury and North Bay. CKNC in Sudbury and CHNB in North Bay went to air that year as CBC affiliates, while the former CBC affiliates in those cities, CKSO and CKNY, reaffiliated with CTV, and their owner, Cambrian Broadcasting, established a new CTV station, CITO, in Timmins.\\"Rebroadcast programs: CRTC grants Sudbury licences\\". The Globe and Mail, August 6, 1970. In 1974, Lavigne also acquired CHRO in Pembroke. By 1980, Lavigne divested himself of his broadcast holdings, primarily because he was refused permission to operate a cable service in the north, as authorities feared a monopoly. His communication companies were in a financial crisis, due to aggressive competition for advertising dollars in small markets. As a result, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission approved a merger into the MCTV twinstick.\\"CRTC approves amalgamation of Northern Ontario TV firms\\". The Globe and Mail, February 29, 1980. In the end, his private network stretched from Moosonee to Ottawa, and from Hearst and Chapleau to Matagami, Quebec. He was serving a population of 1.5 million. In 1983, Lavigne received an honorary doctorate from Sudbury's Laurentian University, and was named a member of the Order of Canada, in recognition of his pioneering contributions to Canadian broadcasting. He was also named to the Order of Ontario in 1994, and to the Canadian Communications Foundation's Broadcasting Hall of Fame. In his later years, Lavigne was a prominent residential real estate developer in Timmins, and as a director of the National Bank of Canada. Lavigne died in Timmins on April 16, 2003.

He played in Major League Baseball as a first baseman, most notably for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Nicknamed \\"Mr. Clean\\" because of his wholesome image during his career in baseball, Garvey was the 1974 National League Most Valuable Player Award winner, a two-time National League Championship Series MVP (1978 and 1984), a 10-time All-Star, and a two- time MVP of the All-Star Game (1974 and 1978). He holds the National League record for consecutive games played (1,207). Playing career Born in Tampa, Florida to parents who had recently relocated from Long Island, New York,WFAN radio interview Steve Garvey on Mike and the Mad Dog, April 18, 2008 from 1956 to 1961, Garvey was a bat boy for the Brooklyn Dodgers, New York Yankees and Detroit Tigers during spring training. Garvey played football and baseball at Michigan State University after graduating from Chamberlain High School. Garvey played his entire career in the National League West for two teams; the Los Angeles Dodgers (1969‚Äì82) and San Diego Padres (1983‚Äì87). He batted and threw right-handed. In a 19-year career, Garvey was a .294 hitter with 272 home runs and 1308 RBI in 2332 games played. Michigan State University Garvey credits Spartan head football coach Duffy Daugherty encouraging him to be a multi-sport athlete in his choosing MSU. He recorded 30 tackles and earned a letter as a defensive back in 1967. His first at-bat in a Spartan uniform resulted in a grand-slam home run, with the ball landing in the Red Cedar River. His baseball jersey number 10 was retired from Michigan State University in 2014, he was named Michigan State Baseball Distinguished Alumnus of the Year in 2009, and he was inducted into the Michigan State University Hall of Fame in 2010. Garvey was featured in the LA Times as one of the three Spartan athletes that have helped Los Angeles professional sports teams win a combined seven world championships. Los Angeles Dodgers Steve Garvey at bat in the mid-1970s against Cincinnati, in Dodger Stadium Garvey was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1st round of the 1968 MLB draft (June secondary phase). He made his Major League debut on September 1, 1969 at the age of 20. He appeared in the 7th inning to pinch hit for Ray Lamb. He struck out in his one appearance at the plate. He had two more plate appearances in 1969, all as a pinch hitter, and recorded his first hit on September 10, off Denny Lemaster of the Houston Astros. He played third base for the Dodgers in 1970 and hit his first home run on July 21, 1970, off Carl Morton of the Montreal Expos. He moved to first base in 1973 after the retirement of Wes Parker. Garvey was part of one of the most enduring infields in baseball history along with third baseman Ron Cey, shortstop Bill Russell and second baseman Davey Lopes. The four infielders stayed together as the Dodgers' starters for eight and a half years. Garvey is one of only two players to have started an All-Star Game as a write-in vote, doing so in 1974. That year he won the NL MVP award, and had the first of six 200-hit seasons. Only 16 players in all of Major League Baseball history have had six or more 200 hit seasons (as of the end of 2017). In the 1978 National League Championship Series, which the Dodgers won over the Philadelphia Phillies, Garvey hit four home runs, and added a triple for five extra base hits, both marks tying Bob Robertson's 1971 NLCS record and earning him the League Championship Series Most Valuable Player Award; Jeffrey Leonard would tie the NLCS home run record in the 1987 NLCS. With the Dodgers, Garvey played in 1,727 games over 14 seasons and hit .301 with 211 homers and 992 RBI. He was selected to eight All-Star Games, and won the All-Star Game MVP Award for the 1974 and 1978 games. He also won the 1981 Roberto Clemente Award, finished in the top 10 in the NL MVP Award voting five times and won four straight Gold Glove Awards from 1974‚Äì1977. San Diego Padres In December 1982 Garvey signed with the Padres for $6.6 million over five years in what some felt was a \\"masterstroke\\" to General Manager Jack McKeon's effort to rebuild the team. Though San Diego had vastly outbid the Dodgers, McKeon particularly noted Garvey's value in providing a role model for younger players. Additionally, Garvey's \\"box office appeal\\"‚Äîhis impending departure from the Dodgers provoked some Girl Scouts to picket the stadium‚Äîhelped San Diego increase its season ticket sales by 6,000 seats in Garvey's first year. Sports Illustrated ranked the signing as the 15th best free agent signing ever as of 2008. His first season in San Diego allowed him to break the National League's record for consecutive games played, a feat that landed him on the cover of Sports Illustrated as baseball's \\"Iron Man\\". In an unusual homecoming, Garvey tied the record in his first appearance back at Dodger Stadium in Padre brown. For breaking the record, he was named the National League Player of the Week. He played in 100 games while having 114 hits, 22 doubles, 14 home runs and 59 RBIs while batting for .294 with a .344 OBP and .802 OPS. He had 29 walks to 39 strikeouts. In fielding, he played 867.2 innings at first base, the lowest at the position since 1973 when he played 647.2 innings. He made 888 putouts, 49 assists, six errors and 69 double plays for a .994 fielding percentage. It was Garvey's second season in San Diego, however, that would provide his highlight in a Padres uniform. Led by Garvey, winning his second National League Championship Series MVP award, the Padres won their first National League pennant over the Chicago Cubs in 1984. Game 4, \\"the best game of the series, and one of the best games in memory\\", provided a particularly notable effort by Garvey. His hot bat provided excellent insurance for the top of the order, including future Hall of Famer Tony Gwynn, who drew an intentional walk that Garvey converted into one of his four crucial RBI. After supplying critical hits in the third, fifth, and seventh innings, Garvey capped off his efforts with a two-run walk-off home run off future all-time saves leader Lee Smith in the ninth inning. As he rounded third base, Garvey, who after the game would be compared by teammates to fictional baseball hero Roy Hobbs, was met by fellow Padres who later carried him off the field in celebration. Following the 7‚Äì5 Padres victory, grateful fans thronged against stadium barricades chanting Garvey's name. Garvey, about to play in his fifth World Series, called the experience \\"the greatest playoffs I've ever seen.\\" Garvey made his final appearance in a game on May 23, 1987, pinch-hitting for Lance McCullers in the ninth inning. He hit a flyout in his one appearance at the plate. Honors Padres retired numbers, including Garvey's No. 6, at Petco Park Garvey set a National League record with 1207 consecutive games played, from September 3, 1975, to July 29, 1983. The streak ended when he broke his thumb in a collision at home plate against the Atlanta Braves. It is the fourth- longest such streak in Major League Baseball history. Garvey is a member of the Irish American Hall of Fame and the Michigan State University Athletics Hall of Fame. In 1978, Steve Garvey Junior High School, in Lindsay, California, was named for him but was eventually renamed as part of Reagan Elementary in 2011.Steve Garvey ‚Äì Brooks International Speakers & Entertainment Bureau Garvey's jersey No. 6, worn when he was both a Padre and Dodger, is retired by the Padres. His number was displayed at the site of his 1984 NLCS home run in right field at Qualcomm Stadium. In 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their book The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time. During the 1984 season, Garvey set the record as the only first baseman in baseball history to commit no errors while playing 150 or more games. He handled 1,319 total chances (1,232 putouts, 87 assists) flawlessly in 159 games for the Padres. He was inducted into the Dodgers team hall of fame, Legends of Dodgers Baseball, as part of their inaugural class in 2018. In his 15 years (1993‚Äì2007) on the National Baseball Hall of Fame ballot of the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA), Garvey failed to reach the 75% required for induction. His highest percentage of votes was 42.6% in ; he received 21.1% in his final year on the ballot. He was subsequently considered by the Expansion Era Committee in voting for and , and by the Modern Baseball Era Committee in voting for and , falling short of the 75% threshold each time. In December 2019 voting for the 2020 induction class, Garvey received six votes from the 16-member committee (37.5%). Post- baseball career In 1983 Garvey started Garvey Media Group while playing baseball for the San Diego Padres. Its strength was in Sports Marketing and Corporate Branding and worked on sponsorships for America‚Äôs Cup teams during the 80‚Äôs. In 1988, he headed Garvey Communications, mainly involved in television production including infomercials. He also hosted Baseball's Greatest Games. In addition he did motivational speaking for corporations. Garvey Communications and began producing TV specials for PrimeTicket and ESPN. The show ‚ÄúInternational Sportsman‚Äù became extremely popular as its theme focused on celebrities, sports and exotic locations around the world. The 2000s saw a focus change, and Garvey Media Group became a force in corporate branding, through the use of sports, combined with new media technology. Over the years, clients like Pepsi Cola, General Motors, Nestle, McDonald's, Rawlings, American Airlines, Cardservice International, California Pizza Kitchen, Kings Hawaiian, Natural Balance, Sycuan Indian Gaming Casino and more, have benefited from each enhancement of Steve Garvey‚Äôs love of business and its development in America.

The generic name is given in honor of Dr. Daniel Rossouw Kannemeyer, the South African fossil collector who discovered the original specimen. It is one of the first representatives of the family, and hence one of the first large herbivores of the Triassic.  Description  Restoration of Kannemeyeria Kannemeyeria was about in length, about the size of an ox. Although it had a large head, it was lightweight due to the size of the eye sockets and nasal cavity. It also had limb girdles which formed massive plates of bone that helped support its heavily built body. Despite the large size, Kannemeyeria may have been prey to large thecodonts like Erythrosuchus. Kannemeyeria was well-adapted to living as a herbivore; it had a powerful beak and strong jaw muscles built for shearing plant material. Kannemeyeria had a massive head with unusually large openings for the eyes, nostrils and jaw muscles. It evidently tore up roots, stripped leaves from the vegetation with its horny break and ground them up with its toothless jaws.  Distribution  Kannemeyeria skull Kannemeyeria is known from the Subzone B of Burgersdorp Formation of South Africa, the Ntawere Formation of Zambia, the Omingonde Formation of Namibia, the Lifua member of Manda Formation of Tanzania. If the synonymy of the genus Shaanbeikannemeyeria from Hessahngou Formation and Lower Ermaying Formation of China and Uralokannemeyeria from Donguz Formation of Russia is correct then Kannemeyeria had a wider distribution.

The band broke up in April 2007, less than a year after their major label debut was released through Epic and Trustkill Records. After over a decade of absence, the band reformed in 2017. They announced their sixth album, \\"XVIII\\", would be released via their new label home at Rise Records. History= Beginnings (1995‚Äì2000)  Eighteen Visions was founded in October 1995 by James Hart, Dave Peters, Billy Sisler, and Kenneth Floyd under the name \\"Macabre\\". The band wrote a bit of material and started to play shows, beginning at the \\"Koo's Cafe\\" in early 1996, in their local area. Soon after a second guitarist, Jeff Boullt (from Excessive Force), was added to the mix, and in March, Billy left the group and was replaced by Richie Taylor. Richie only lasted a short while, and Javier Van Huss soon took over the bass duties. Later in the year, Jeff also left the band, and Brandan Schieppati was added to complete a first stable line-up. Their debut release, Lifeless was released on Life Sentence Records in 1997. Shortly after, Dave Peters left the band and Steve Parilla replaced him for the ep's tour. The first full-length album, Yesterday Is Time Killed was announced to be released on Cedargate Records (the label of Zac Phelps, who was at the time a temporary bassist in the band) in February 1999. The band was brought to the attention Trustkill Records, which was still in its early beginnings. The label released the No Time for Love 7\\" in October 1999. Keith Barney then joined the band to replace Steve and ten months after the 7\\", their second full-length Until the Ink Runs Out was released. It became one of the label's best-selling albums, which led to a lot of the band's earlier material getting bought out and going out of print. Javier was asked to leave the band after touring for the album, and was told he would be replaced by Mick Morris of the band xClearx. Javier played two remaining shows with the band and went on to tour for Poison the Well.  Rise of success (2000‚Äì2004)  For their next album, The Best of Eighteen Visions, the band re-recorded some of their earlier material, some of which was out of print, with the addition of a new song, \\"Motionless and White\\". Trustkill and the band felt it would feel much more like a new record, rather than re-releasing the two previous albums on the label. Despite raw production where mistakes weren't always edited, the album was a vast improvement in production values. This would mark the beginning of the band's tentative approach to more melodic hardcore, rather than their older metalcore approach. They went on to record Vanity in 2002, which, while still containing heavy breakdowns, metal riffs and odd time signatures, featured better production work, and bits of melodic vocals in nearly all of the songs, complete with hints at balladry with the songs \\"Gorgeous\\", an acoustic piece written and performed by then-drummer Ken Floyd, and \\"Love in Autumn\\", the album's closer. While the fanbase grew after this release, this was the last album to feature guitarist Brandan Schieppati, who left the band in order to handle full-time vocal duties in metalcore OC band Bleeding Through. Eighteen Visions went on to tour for Vanity as a four-piece. A video was made for \\"You Broke Like Glass,\\" which played in heavy rotation on MTV2's Headbangers Ball.  The era of Obsession (2004‚Äì2006)  Eighteen Visions poster as a four- piece band After touring, they went into the studio to record Obsession with producer Mudrock. Material was equally written by Keith Barney and Ken Floyd, who not only played drums, but also played guitar on a fair number of songs. Dramatically changing styles, the album showcased a new sound that was much more accessible to a wider audience, featuring hard rock riffs, but also an arena rock feel to it, with less complex song structures and a much more diverse and melodic range of vocals. The band then went on a worldwide tour as a supporting act for bands like HIM, Lostprophets and Killswitch Engage, with Ken Floyd switching to second guitar, and Jason Shrout (later replaced by Trevor Friedrich) being added to the band's line-up for all drumming duties. The songs \\"Waiting for the Heavens,\\" \\"Tower of Snakes,\\" and \\"I Let Go\\" were released as singles on United States and UK pressing and had videos made for them. The album went on to sell a disappointing 200,000 copies, which is twice what the previous record had sold, but was still not enough to break the band into the mainstream. Obsession went on to be the band's last album for Trustkill Records, after they signed a contract with major label Epic Records for their next effort. Obsession would become Eighteen Visions's most successful album and would give them their new sort of depressive/apathetic image, which would prove hard to be rid of.  Mainstream success (2006‚Äì2007)  Now a solidified 5-piece band, Eighteen Visions went into pre-production with producer Machine and 32 demos to work on. On July 18, 2006 they released their self-titled major label debut, which featured slick production, anthemic choruses √† la Def Leppard, dark industrial electronic programming and all- melodic vocals reminiscent of the then-current hard rock trend successfully embraced by fellow OC band Avenged Sevenfold. Although a video and a promotional ad campaign had been made for the radio friendly song \\"Tonightless\\" (which was a leftover from the previous album writing session), the band decided to scrap it all in order to go with the more hard-rocking \\"Victim,\\" supposedly against the record label's will. Still, a video was made for \\"Victim,\\" with little effort from Epic to promote it, even though the song was featured in the WWE Vengeance (2006) pay-per-view event. Witnessing album sales not taking off and dropping off the Billboard 200 after only one week, the band embarked a variety of tours to promote the record, as a supporting act again. They played opening slots for Avenged Sevenfold, Coheed and Cambria, Hinder, and Bullet for My Valentine, among others. Even though the catchy power ballad \\"Broken Hearted\\" was released to radio stations and managed to get some airplay, no video was made, and the album ended up as a commercial flop. Even though the number of total sales has not been made official, it is widely rumored to have ended below the 100k bar. Break-up (2007) In 2007, while still playing a few shows in Australia and posting daily MySpace bulletins asking fans to request \\"Broken Hearted\\" on the radio, band coverage, press and blog updates started decreasing considerably, leading fans to believe the band had been dropped by Epic Records, though no official word on that has been released. This also led to break-up rumors, which were soon confirmed. On April 9, 2007 bassist Mick Morris confirmed the band's breakup on MySpace through this statement: \\"After several years of touring and quite a few album releases we have decided that it is time to go our separate ways. We have been a band for a very long time and feel good about everything we were able to accomplish. At this point in our lives and our careers we feel its time to move on to something fresh and new. Whether it be music, touring or just being at home to live and enjoy life. We would like to thank all of our fans, friends and families for all of the great support over the years. We would also like to thank all of the bands we have shared the stage with and everyone who has ever worked with the band, opened a door or reached out a hand. We will be playing our final two shows in April. One in San Diego and one in Orange County. Come rock with us one more time.\\" While the break-up might have appeared somewhat abrupt, frontman James Hart stated on his MySpace blog that this was not the case on July 13, 2007: \\"18V had been a band for 10+ years, [...] it just got to the point where we all had different goals and ideas for the band on a musical and touring basis. We all felt it was time to move on to something fresh and new.\\"  A decade of inactivity / post-18v acts  Trevor Friedrich was hired by Eleven Seven recording artist Sixx:A.M. for the \\"Accidents Can Happen\\" video. He is now the drummer in the band Never Enough with Eighteen Visions' Keith Barney on guitar. He also drums for the industrial acts Imperative Reaction and Combichrist. He is currently the singer of The Witch Was Right. He also formed a band called Monkeys Are Machine Guns. Trevor was also the drummer for Suffer Well with Bleeding Through's Brandan Schieppati on vocals. Keith Barney also recently joined hardcore band Monument to Thieves. He also joined California hardcore band Love Thyne just before they officially disbanded. He is currently working as a graphic designer. Ken Floyd is currently working on a new wave band called Hi- Deaf. He was touring guitarist for Saosin in 2010. Mick Morris joined Hatebreed on tour, doing tech work. He also launched Dethless Clothing, held a popular weekly updated eBay store, and modeled for several clothing lines. Morris stated that he would be willing to have an Eighteen Visions reunion if the other members were willing to. This never came to fruition, however, as Morris died on June 3, 2013, almost 4 years before the actual reunion he wished for. Hart has been working with former Nixons frontman Zac Maloy on a project named Burn Halo. Maloy's previous collaborations include songwriting credits for Chris Daughtry and Bowling for Soup, among others. Keith Barney and Avenged Sevenfold lead guitarist Synyster Gates appear to have also contributed to the project, which has evolved from a solo project into a full band. Burn Halo signed to Island Records, but after the album was completed in early 2008, Island elected not to release Burn Halos debut, leaving Hart with the tough job of finding a new home for his project. Burn Halo's manager, Bret Bair, formed his own label through Warner Music Group, Rawkhead Rekords, to release the record. Burn Halo played their first ever live show, opening for Avenged Sevenfold on December 9, 2008 at Ram's Head Live in Baltimore, MD. The band released their debut record on March 31, 2009. It also released full- length albums in 2011 and 2015 before amicably parting ways with Hart who allowed the other members to use the band's name and the entire music catalog for live shows.  Reunion and \\"XVIII\\" (2017‚Äìpresent)  On February 9, 2017, an official Instagram account of the band was launched, with James Hart, Keith Barney, and Trevor Friedrich being tagged on the first picture that contained the message \\"the countdown begins...\\". All three members uploaded the same picture onto their respective private accounts as well. The band have since shared some footage of them working in the studio, along with a 15-second long clip of a new song. Mick Kenney was chosen by the band to do production, mixing, and mastering of the comeback record. On April 20, 2017, ten years from the day of the farewell live performance, the band confirmed the details surrounding their new album, \\"XVIII\\", which would be released on June 2, 2017 via their new label home at Rise Records, and released a full stream and music video for the album's first single, \\"Oath\\". On May 9, 2017, \\"Crucified\\", the second single off the new record, was released as a lyric video on YouTube. Both songs were under 2 minutes in length and marked the return of heavy screaming as a prominent element of the band's sound. The band also confirmed that one of the album's tracks, \\"Live Again\\", is a tribute to Mick Morris. On May 25, 2017, \\"The Disease, the Decline, and Wasted Time\\", the third single off \\"XVIII\\", was released. In June 2017, it was revealed that a founding member, guitarist Ken Floyd, could not take part in the reunion due to his full-time job as a tour manager for Zedd. It was also reported that the band decided not to replace the late Mick Morris with any other bass players, primarily out of respect for him. Instead, his bass tracks will be used at live shows for the songs released prior to 2017. Keith Barney, however, ruled out the possibility of an extensive touring in the near future due to full- time jobs that band members have. \\"XVIII\\" was released as planned on June 2, 2017. It is the first album since 2002's Vanity to feature movie quotes at the beginning of some songs. A music video for the song \\"Live Again\\" was also released on the same day. On August 28, 2017, Josh James was announced as an official member of the band. In September 2017, it was revealed that the band contemplated reunion as early as 2010 and, later on, in 2013. However, the idea was eventually called off due to various reasons. It was also stated that the track \\"The Disease, the Decline, and Wasted Time\\" was written back then. On July 10, 2019 The band posted a new photo from a recording studio, leading many to believe a new album was being worked on. On January 29th, the band was announced as one of the performers for Furnace Fest 2020. On September 8th, 2020 the band announced their new EP \\"Inferno\\", and debuted their new song \\"Sink\\". The new album is said to be inspired by Dante Aligheri's Divine Comedy.

The name derives from Greek kalos (beautiful) and melos (black) because it turns black on reaction with ammonia. This was known to alchemists. Calomel occurs as a secondary mineral which forms as an alteration product in mercury deposits. It occurs with native mercury, amalgam, cinnabar, mercurian tetrahedrite, eglestonite, terlinguaite, montroydite, kleinite, moschelite, kadyrelite, kuzminite, chursinite, kelyanite, calcite, limonite and various clay minerals.The Handbook of Mineralogy The type locality is Moschellandsburg, Alsenz-Obermoschel, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. History Mahogany medicine chest, England, 1801-1900 The first time that the substance that would come to be known as calomel was documented was in Ancient Persia by the Persian medical historian, Rhazes in year 850; however, only a few of the compounds he mentioned could be positively identified as calomel as not every alchemist disclosed what compounds went into their drugs. Calomel first entered Western medical literature in 1608, when Oswald Croll wrote about the drug‚Äôs preparation in his ‚ÄúTyroncium Chemicum,‚Äù although it was not called calomel until 1655 when the name was created by Th√©odore de Mayerne. In 1618, Mayerne was the first to publish the preparation and formula for calomel in ‚ÄúPharmacopoeia of Londinensis.‚Äù By the 19th century, calomel was viewed as a panacea, or miracle drug, and was used to cure almost every disease. Some of these diseases included: syphilis, bronchitis, cholera, ingrown toenails, teething, gout, tuberculosis, influenza, and cancer. Although during the 18th and early 19th century pharmacists used calomel sparingly, by the late 1840s calomel was being prescribed in heroic doses. This was, in part, due to the research of Benjamin Rush who coined the term heroic dose to mean about 20 grains taken four times daily. This stance was supported by Dr. Samuel Cartwright who believed that taking large doses was the ‚Äúgentlest‚Äù on the body. As calomel rose in popularity, more research was done into how it worked. J. Annesley was one of the first to write about the different effects of calomel when taken in small or large doses. Through experimentation on dogs, Annesley concluded that calomel acted more like a laxative on the whole body rather than acting specifically on the vascular system or liver as previous physicians believed. In 1853, Samuel Jackson described the harmful effects of calomel on children in his publication for Transactions of Physicians of Philadelphia. He noted that calomel had harmful effects causing gangrene on the skin, loss of teeth, and deterioration of the gums. On May 4, 1863, William A. Hammond, the United States‚Äô Surgeon-General, stated that calomel would no longer be used in the army as it was being abused by soldiers and physicians alike. This caused much debate in the medical field, and eventually led to his removal as Surgeon-General. Calomel continued to be used well into the 1890s and even into the early 20th century. Eventually calomel‚Äôs popularity began to wane as more research was done, and scientists discovered that the mercury in the compound was poisoning patients. Calomel was the main of the three components of the pill number 9 of the British army during the First World War. name=\\"https://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-49457082\\" Electrochemistry Calomel is used as the interface between metallic mercury and a chloride solution in a saturated calomel electrode, which is used in electrochemistry to measure pH and electrical potentials in solutions. In most electrochemical measurements, it is necessary to keep one of the electrodes in an electrochemical cell at a constant potential. This so-called reference electrode allows control of the potential of a working electrode.. PDF available.  Chemical properties  Packets of calomel. Calomel is a powder that is white when pure. When it is exposed to light or contains impurities it takes on a darker tint. Calomel is made up of mercury and chlorine with the chemical formula Hg2Cl2. Depending on how calomel was administered, it affected the body in different ways. Taken orally, calomel damaged mainly the lining of the gastrointestinal tract. Mercury salts (such as calomel) are insoluble in water and therefore do not absorb well through the wall of the small intestine. Some of the calomel in the digestive system will likely be oxidized into a former of mercury that can be absorbed through the intestine, but most of it will not. Oral calomel was actually the safest form of the drug to take, especially in low doses. Most of the calomel ingested will be excreted through urine and stool. Powdered forms of calomel were much more toxic, as their vapors damaged the brain. Once inhaled, the calomel enters the bloodstream and the mercury binds with the amino acids methionine, cysteine, homocysteine and taurine. This is because of the sulfur group these amino acids contain, which mercury has a high affinity for. It is able to pass through the blood brain barrier and builds up in the brain. Mercury also has the ability to pass through the placenta, causing damage to unborn babies if a pregnant mother is taking calomel. Calomel was manufactured in two ways - sublimation and precipitation. When calomel first started being manufactured it was done through sublimation. Calomel made through sublimation tends to be a very fine white powder. There was some controversy over the sublimation of calomel. Many argued that the more times calomel was sublimed, the purer it got. Opponents believed that the repeated sublimation made calomel lose some of its therapeutic ability. In 1788 pharmacist Carl Wilhelm Scheele came up with the mechanism to make precipitated calomel. This became rapidly popular in the pharmaceutical industry because it was both a cheaper and safer form of production. Precipitation also tended to form very pure calomel salts. Medicine Calomel was a popular medicine used during the Victorian period and was widely used as a treatment for a variety of ailments during the American Civil War. The medication was available in two forms, blue pills and blue masses. The blue pill was an oral form of calomel containing mercury that was often mixed with a sweet substance, like licorice or sugar in order to be taken by mouth. The blue mass was a solid form of calomel in which a piece could be pinched off and administered by a physician or other medical provider. Neither form of the medication came with a standardization of dosing. There was no way of knowing how much mercurous chloride each dose contained.  Uses  Calomel was marketed as a purgative agent to relieve congestion and constipation, however, physicians at the time had no idea what the medication‚Äôs mechanism of action was. They learned how calomel worked through trial and error. It was observed that small doses of calomel acted as a stimulant, often leading to bowel movements, while larger doses caused sedation. During the 19th century, calomel was used to treat numerous illnesses and diseases like mumps, typhoid fever, and others‚Äîespecially those that impact the gastrointestinal tract, such as constipation, dysentery, and vomiting. As mercury softened the gums, calomel was the principal constituent of teething powders until the mid-twentieth century. Babies given calomel for teething often suffered from acrodynia.  Side effects  Medical label. It became popular in the late 18th century to give calomel in extremely high doses, as Benjamin Rush normalized the heroic dose. This caused many patients to experience many painful and sometimes life-threatening side effects. Calomel, in high doses, led to mercury poisoning, which had the potential to cause permanent deformities and even death. Some patients experienced gangrene of the mouth generated by the mercury in the medicine, which caused the tissue on the cheeks and gums inside the mouth to break down and die. Some patients would lose teeth, while others were left with facial deformities. High doses of calomel would often lead to extreme cramping, vomiting, and bloody diarrhea, however, at the time, this was taken as a sign that the calomel was working to purge the system and rid the disease. Calomel was often administered as a treatment for dysentery; the effects of calomel would often worsen the severe diarrhea associated with dysentery and acted as a catalyst in speeding up the effects of dehydration. One victim was Alvin Smith, the eldest brother of Joseph Smith, founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It was also used by Charles Darwin to treat the severe gastrointestinal infection that presumably began the inductive phase of his documented Crohn's disease. Eventually, it was determined that calomel was causing more harm than good, as the side effects were often worse than the illness it was being used to treat; because of this, calomel was removed from medical supply shelves.

She is the opposite of fairies such as Z√¢nƒÉ. She is also the protector of the animals and plants, brewing potions and helping injured animals. She cures the forest if it is dying and she keeps unwanted trespassers away by driving them mad and scaring them. She can be associated with witches (like the witch from the story of \\"Hansel and Gretel\\"), but she's a neutral \\"creature\\", harming only those who harm the forest. Etymology Muma PƒÉdurii literally means \\"mother of the forest\\", though \\"mumƒÉ\\" is an archaic version of \\"mamƒÉ\\" (mother), which has a fairy tale overtone for the Romanian reader (somewhat analogous to using the archaic pronouns like \\"thou\\" and \\"thy\\" in English). A few other such words, typically protagonists of folktales, have this effect. Characteristics Muma PƒÉdurii is a spirit of the forest in a very ugly and old woman's body. Sometimes she has the ability to change her shape. She lives in a dark, dreadful, hidden little house. She is thought to attack children and because of this a large variety of spells (desc√¢ntece in Romanian) are used against her. This (step-) mother of the forest kidnaps little children and enslaves them. In one popular story, at some point, she tries to boil a little girl alive in a soup. However the little girl's brother outsmarts Muma PƒÉdurii and pushes the woman-monster in the oven instead, similar to the story of Hansel and Gretel. The story ends on a happy note when all kids are free to go back to their parents. In modern culture Instead of saying \\"She's ugly\\", Romanians sometimes say \\"She looks like Muma PƒÉdurii\\".

Mahone Bay is a bay on the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia, Canada along the eastern end of Lunenburg County. The bay has many islands, and is a popular sailing area. Since 2003 the Mahone Islands Conservation Association has been working to protect the natural environment of the bay. The bay and its islands contain a variety of habitats including forests, rocky shores, beaches, wetlands, and mudflats. Wildlife in the area include black guillemots, eagles, osprey, leach's storm petrels, puffins, razorbills, and great blue herons.

The first Europeans in the area were the French, the early maps of whom labelled the bay as La Baye de Toutes Iles (The Bay of Many Islands). The current name derives from the French mahonne, a type of barge. In 1754 the British brought German speakers from Europe to colonize the area, starting in Lunenburg. German was the main language spoken in the area for many years, and today in the Bayview Cemetery, there are several gravestones dating from the late 1700s marked in German. Early settlers' names commemorated there include Zwicker, Eisenhauer, Heyson, and Kedy. The site was the scene of hostilities during the French and Indian War and the War of 1812.Archibald MecMechan.

The Chester Peninsula juts several kilometres into Mahone Bay at roughly its midpoint. The bay's geological history differs from its eastern neighbour, St. Margarets Bay, in that Mahone Bay shows a greater variety of soils and bedrock. Numerous glacial drumlins on the western shore near the towns of Mahone Bay and Lunenburg have produced soil conditions suitable for small-scale farming operations. Mahone Bay also differs from St. Margarets Bay in that it is dotted with innumerable small and medium-sized islands throughout its waters. The shelter provided by these islands, along with the summer southwesterly flow, led to the scenery around Mahone Bay becoming a tourist attraction in itself. Today the towns of Chester and Mahone Bay have become a destination for cruising in pleasure yachts. A scenic provincial park at Graves Island just east of Chester is a popular camping destination. Mahone Bay is home to numerous picturesque working fishing communities, one of the most famous being the communities of Big Tancook and Little Tancook, on Big Tancook Island and Little Tancook Island respectively. Other important fishing ports include Blandford. In popular culture Frank Parker Day's novel Rockbound takes place on the fictional island of the same name, which was based on the nearby island of East Ironbound and includes references to many other Mahone Bay islands and towns. Day visited the area and created Rockbound as a fictionalized, exaggerated account of life on the islands. Mahone Bay contains Oak Island, well known in connection with tales of buried treasure. The 2006 independent movie 'A Stone's Throw' was filmed primarily in and around Mahone Bay.  References External links * \\"Mahone Bay\\". The Canadian Encyclopedia.

It is mostly observed in South Korea by singles. The day is associated with Valentine's Day and White Day as a holiday on the 14th day of the month. On this day, people who did not receive gifts on the previous two days gather and eat Jajangmyeon, noodles with black sauce. This day is specifically for single people. Origins In South Korea, Valentine's Day and White Day are both celebrated as occasions to give gifts to significant others. Valentine's Day is celebrated on February 14, when women buy men gifts (usually chocolate). White Day is celebrated on March 14, when men reciprocate the gifts with their own, also present in the form of chocolate. As both occasions fall on the 14th, other holidays were created by the government of South Korea for all other months to continue this trend. The creation has also been attributed to marketers. Meaning Black Day builds on the romantic aspect of Valentine's Day and White Day. As the chocolates received on Valentine's Day are interpreted to symbolize a man's popularity and the chocolates given on White Day are used solely for romantic purposes, Black Day focuses on the people, especially singles, who did not receive any gifts on either of the holidays. On the day, singles who have not received presents on both days gather wearing black to 'commiserate' over black-colored food, especially jajangmyeon. During the meal, they complain about their lack of intimate relationships and chocolate gifts. Impact This day is targeted by businesses, who hold various events and advertise their products, a strategy known as 'day marketing.' The events are highly popular, and include matchmaking events such as speed dating, jajangmyeon-eating contests, and discounts on items.

Design and development The Model 45 was a development of designer James Wedell's earlier Model 44 and was a low-wing cantilever monoplane with tailwheel undercarriage, the main units of which were retractable. Operational history The Model 45 flew for the first time on June 28, 1933 and showed promising performance achieving an average speed of 264.703 mph on a 100 km closed course. Wedell-Williams pilot, John Worthen flew the 45 to a second place in the 1934 Bendix Trophy race and if not for a navigation error would have demolished the 44's first place time by at least 50 minutes.Hirsch and Schultz 2001, p. 74. On June 24, 1934, Jimmy Wedell died in an accident while piloting a Gypsy Moth on a flying lesson. Development of the 45 was delayed following the loss of its creator. Even so, the 45 was entered in the 1934 Thompson Trophy Race. In a preliminary event, the Shell Speed Dash Unlimited, Worthen placed first with an average speed of 302.13 mph.Schmid and Weaver 1983, p. 291. He then qualified the 45 with a speed of 292.14 mph, third behind the 44 and Turner's racer in the main event. However the 45 was still suffering from development problems and was withdrawn due to instability. During the Thompson race Doug Davis crashed the 44 and was killed instantly. Devastated, the Wedell-Williams team dismantled and trucked the 45 to Patterson. It never flew again. In rapid succession, the remaining Wedell- Williams principals were killed in air crashes: Walter Wedell, Jimmy's brother, was killed in a crash on July 18, 1935. Company co-founder Harry Palmerston Williams and chief test pilot, John Worthen were both killed on May 19, 1936 in a crash. After the death of Williams, the Model 45 was donated to Louisiana State University, where it eventually disappeared, its final fate unknown. A full-scale replica Model 45, constructed by Jim B. Clevenger of Kissimmee, Florida, is on display at the Louisiana State Museum in Patterson, Louisiana. Specifications (Model 45)See alsoReferences ;Notes ;Bibliography * Foxworth, Thomas G.

Blood flow is blocked by constriction and blood clots (thrombosis). A collateral circulation develops around the blocked vessels to compensate for the blockage, but the collateral vessels are small, weak, and prone to bleeding, aneurysm and thrombosis. On conventional MR angiography, these collateral vessels have the appearance of a \\"puff of smoke\\" (described as \\"„ÇÇ„ÇÑ„ÇÇ„ÇÑ (moyamoya)\\" in Japanese). When moyamoya is diagnosed by itself, with no underlying correlational conditions, it is diagnosed as moyamoya disease. This is also the case when the arterial constriction and collateral circulation are bilateral. Moyamoya syndrome is unilateral arterial constriction, or occurs when one of the several specified conditions is also present. This may also be considered as moyamoya being secondary to the primary condition. Mainly, occlusion of the distal internal carotid artery occurs. On angiography, a \\"puff of smoke\\" appearance is seen, and the treatment of choice is surgical bypass.  Presentation  Patients usually present with TIA, ischemic/hemorrhagic stroke, or seizure. The age distribution is bimodal being either young adolescence or mid-forties. Cause About 10% of cases of moyamoya disease are familial, and some cases result from specific genetic mutations. Susceptibility to moyamoya disease-2 (MYMY2; 607151) is caused by variation in the RNF213 gene (613768) on the long arm of chromosome 17 (17q25). Moyamoya disease-5 (MYMY5; 614042) is caused by mutation in the ACTA2 gene (102620) on the long arm of chromosome 10 (10q23.3); and moyamoya disease-6 with achalasia (MYMY6; 615750) is caused by mutation in the GUCY1A3 gene (139396) on the long arm of chromosome 4 (4q32). Loci for the disorder have been mapped to the short arm of chromosome 3 (MYMY1) and the long arm of chromosome 8 (8q23) (MYMY3; 608796). See also MYMY4 (300845), an X-linked recessive syndromic disorder characterized by moyamoya disease, short stature, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, and facial dysmorphism. and linked to q25.3, on chromosome 17.Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, https://omim.org/entry/252350 In Japan the overall incidence is higher (0.35 per 100,000). In North America, women in the third or fourth decade of life are most often affected, but the condition may also occur during infancy or childhood. These women frequently experience transient ischaemic attacks (TIA), cerebral hemorrhage, or may not experience any symptoms at all. They have a higher risk of recurrent stroke and may be experiencing a distinct underlying pathophysiology compared to patients from Japan. Moyamoya disease can be either congenital or acquired. Patients with Down syndrome, sickle cell anemia, neurofibromatosis type 1, congenital heart disease, fibromuscular dysplasia, activated protein C resistance, or head trauma can develop moyamoya malformations. It is more common in women than in men, although about a third of those affected are male. Pathophysiology The disease moyamoya, which is a Japanese mimetic word, gets its characteristic name due to the appearance of smoke on relevant angiographs resultant from the tangle of tiny vessels in response to stenosis. This makes the blood leak out of the arteries, causing pressure to the brain and subsequent headaches. The pathogenesis of moyamoya disease is unknown, although the gene ring finger protein 213 (RNF213) has been implicated. Once it begins, the vascular occlusion tends to continue despite any known medical management. In some people this leads to transient ischemic attacks or repeated strokes with severe functional impairment or even death. In others, the blockage may not cause any symptoms. The disease causes constrictions primarily in the internal carotid artery, and often extends to the middle and anterior cerebral arteries, branches of the internal carotid artery inside the skull. When the internal carotid artery becomes completely blocked, the fine collateral circulation that it supplies is obliterated. Patients often survive on the collateral circulation from the back (posterior) of the circle of Willis, arising from the basilar artery. The arterial constrictions in moyamoya disease are unlike the constrictions in atherosclerosis. In atherosclerosis, the walls of arteries are damaged, leading to the deposition of fat and immune cells, and ultimately the accumulation of immune cells laden with fat. In moyamoya, the inner layer of the carotid artery proliferates within the arterial lumen. The artery also fills with blood clots, which may cause strokes. Moyamoya disease tends to affect adults in the third to fourth decade of life. In children it tends to cause strokes or seizures. In adults it tends to cause strokes or bleeding. The clinical features are strokes, recurrent transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), sensorimotor paralysis (numbness and paralysis of the extremities), convulsions and/or migraine-like headaches. Moreover, following a stroke, secondary bleeding may occur. Such bleeding, called hemorrhagic strokes, may also stem from rupture of the weak neovascular vessel walls. Diagnosis Left: MIP reconstructed MR angiography of a 11-year-old girl with moyamoya disease. Right: healthy patient, for comparison. Cerebral angiography is the gold standard of diagnosing Moyamoya disease and its progression. According to the Suzuki's system, it can be classified into: six stages: *Stage 1 Narrowing of carotid fork *Stage 2 Initiation of the moyamoya and dilatation of intracranial main arteries *Stage 3 Intensification of the moyamoya and defects of the anterior cerebral artery and middle cerebral artery *Stage 4 Minimization of the moyamoya and defects of the posterior cerebral artery *Stage 5 Reduction of the moyamoya and development of external carotid artery collaterals *Stage 6 Disappearance of the moyamoya and circulation only via external cerebral artery and vertebral artery Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is also useful in diagnosing the disease with good correlation with Suzuki's grading system. Proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the walls of the moyamoya-affected arteries has been found to be representative of the disease. A study of six autopsies of six patients who died from moyamoya disease lead to the finding that there is evidence that supports the theory that there is a thickening, or proliferation, of the innermost layer of the vessels affected by moyamoya. These vessels are the ACA (anterior cerebral artery), MCA (middle cerebral artery), and ICA (internal carotid artery). The occlusion of the ICA results in concomitant diminution of the \\"puff-of-smoke\\" collaterals, as they are supplied by the ICA. Often nuclear medicine studies such as SPECT (single photon emission computerized tomography) are used to demonstrate the decreased blood and oxygen supply to areas of the brain involved with moyamoya disease. Conventional angiography provides the conclusive diagnosis of moyamoya disease in most cases and should be performed before any surgical considerations. Darren B. Orbach, MD, PhD explains how the disease progresses as well as the role angiography plays in detecting the progression of Moyamoya in a short video.Moyamoya disease program: Moyamoya treatment videos  Boston Children's Hospital [Video file]. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://www.childrenshospital.org/centers-and- services/programs/f-_-n/moyamoya-disease-program/patient-resources/videos- about-moyamoya/moyamoya-treatment-videos In 2019, author and artist Sarah Lippett published a graphic novel about her decade-long struggle to get a diagnosis and treatment for moyamoya disease, called A Puff of Smoke (published with Jonathan Cape). The book was praised in the Guardian newspaper as a 'wonderfully drawn memoir of a serious childhood illness'. It was one of the paper's 'graphic novels of the year' in 2019 and the Observer newspaper's 'graphic novel of the month' in November 2019. Associated biomarkers Smith (2015) conducted a study that looked into specific biological markers that correlate to moyamoya disease. Some of the categories of these biomarkers include phenotypes - conditions commonly related to moyamoya, radiographical markers for the diagnosis of moyamoya, and proteins as well as cellular changes that occur in cases of moyamoya. Similar to Moyamoya disease, there are conditions that are closely associated with Moyamoya disease. Some of the more common medical conditions that are closely associated with Moyamoya disease include trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome), sickle cell disease, and neurofibromatosis type 1. There is also evidence that identifies hyperthyroidism and congenital dwarfing syndromes as two of the more loosely associated syndromes that correlate with the possibility of being diagnosed with Moyamoya disease later in life. There is also research that has shown that certain radiographic biomarkers that lead to the diagnosis of moyamoya disease have been identified. The specific radiographic markers are now considered an acceptable key component to Moyamoya Disease and have been added to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). These biomarkers of moyamoya are \\"stenosis of the distal ICA's up to and including the bifurcation, along with segments of the proximal ACA and MCA...dilated basal collateral vessels must be present\\" Some other common findings that have not been added to the classification index of those with moyamoya disease which are found using radiography involve very distinct changes in the vessels of the brain. These changes include newly formed vessels made to compensate for another change noted, ischemia and cerebrovascular reserve, both found on MRI. Functional changes include evidence of ischemia in vessels of the brain (ICA, ACA, MCA, specifically). It is important to also note that the radiographic biomarkers, in order to be classified as moyamoya disease, all findings must be bilateral. If this is not the case and the findings are unilateral, it is diagnosed as Moyamoya Syndrome. There are also several protein biomarkers that have been linked to the Moyamoya disease diagnosis. Although the sample size of the studies performed are small due to the rarity of the disease, the findings are indicative of a correlation between the disease and several specific protein biomarkers. Other studies have confirmed the correlation of Moyamoya and adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) being increased as compared to normal vascular function counterparts. Furthermore, it has been concluded that the localization of inflammatory cells suggests that the inflammation stimulus iteself may be responsible for the proliferation and occlusion in the ICA, ACA, and MCA found in those with Moyamoya disease. Treatment Drugs such as antiplatelet agents (including aspirin) are usually given to prevent clots, but surgery is usually recommended. Since moyamoya tends to affect only the internal carotid artery and nearby sections of the adjacent anterior and middle cerebral arteries, surgeons can direct other arteries, such as the external carotid artery or the superficial temporal artery to replace its circulation. The arteries are either sewn directly into the brain circulation, or placed on the surface of the brain to reestablish new circulation after a few weeks. There are many operations that have been developed for the condition, but currently the most favored are the in-direct procedures EDAS, EMS, and multiple burr holes and the direct procedure STA-MCA. Direct superficial temporal artery (STA) to middle cerebral artery (MCA) bypass is considered the treatment of choice, although its efficacy, particularly for hemorrhagic disease, remains uncertain. Multiple burr holes have been used in frontal and parietal lobes with good neovascularisation achieved. The EDAS (encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis) procedure is a synangiosis procedure that requires dissection of a scalp artery over a course of several centimeters and then making a small temporary opening in the skull directly beneath the artery. The artery is then sutured to a branch of the middle cerebral artery on the surface of the brain and the bone is replaced. In the EMS (encephalomyosynangiosis) procedure, the temporalis muscle, which is in the temple region of the forehead, is dissected and through an opening in the skull placed onto the surface of the brain. In the multiple burr holes procedure, multiple small holes (burr holes) are placed in the skull to allow for growth of new vessels into the brain from the scalp. In the STA-MCA procedure, the scalp artery (superficial temporal artery or STA) is directly sutured to an artery on the surface of the brain (middle cerebral artery or MCA). This procedure is also commonly referred to as an EC-IC (External Carotid-Internal Carotid) bypass. All of these operations have in common the concept of a blood and oxygen \\"starved\\" brain reaching out to grasp and develop new and more efficient means of bringing blood to the brain and bypassing the areas of blockage. The modified direct anastomosis and encephalo-myo-arterio-synangiosis play a role in this improvement by increasing cerebral blood flow (CBF) after the operation. A significant correlation is found between the postoperative effect and the stages of preoperative angiograms. It is crucial for surgery that the anesthesiologist have experience in managing children being treated for moyamoya, as the type of anesthesia they require is very different from the standard anesthetic children get for almost any other type of neurosurgical procedure. Prognosis The natural history of this disorder is not well known. The long term outlook for patients with treated moyamoya seems to be good when direct bypass is used. While symptoms may seem to improve almost immediately after the in-direct EDAS, EMS, and multiple burr holes surgeries, it will take probably 6‚Äì12 months before new vessels can develop to give a sufficient blood supply. With the direct STA-MCA surgery, increased blood supply is immediate. Once a major stroke or bleeding takes place, even with treatment, the patient may be left with permanent loss of function so it is very important to treat this condition promptly. Research Recent investigations have established that both moyamoya disease and arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) of the lining of the brain, the dura, are associated with dural angiogenesis. These factors may represent a mechanism for ischemia contributing to the formation of dural AVFs. At least one case of simultaneous unilateral moyamoya syndrome and ipsilateral dural arteriovenous fistula has been reported at the Barrow Neurological Institute. In this case a 44-year-old man presented with headache, tinnitus, and an intraventricular hemorrhage, as seen on computed tomographic scans. Cerebral angiography showed a right moyamoya pattern and an ipsilateral dural AVF fed by branches of the external carotid artery and draining into the transverse sinus. This extremely rare coincidental presentation may have deeper pathogenic implications.

The spelling of the word tekno is made to deliberately differentiate the musical style from that of techno. The music is fast and it can vary between 150 and 185 bpm and is characterised by a pounding repetitive kick drum.Dover, Wanz 10 Dance Music Documentaries That Will Make You an Expert Dallas Observer. July 25, 2015 Nevertheless, bass drum distortion by clipping is used less often as in the related genre of mainstyle hardcore. Nowadays, some tekno producers also use drum sets that rather sound trancey, since many members of the tekno subculture as well as the psytrance subculture frequently attend the same raves and the two scenes are closely connected. History Freetekno party Tekno evolved in tandem with the teknival movement in the early 1990s since many of the teknival organisers and DJs were also making music. The music drew on influences such as hardcore, rave, jungle, early hardcore and techno, with the producers taking the sound in a darker direction. Spiral tribe were the first to start making and widely disseminating this genre taking it to France and Eastern Europe after the Criminal Justice act was implemented in the UK. An emphasis is placed on samples from TV shows, films and popular culture which are placed at strategic moments in the tracks. The music was produced with whatever was available: drum machines, synthesisers and keyboards as well as computer programs such as audio/MIDI sequencers and Trackers, sometimes even hitting a random table with a pen. Starting from year 2001 there has been a trend using laptop and laptops for live performances, because the capabilities of both the hardware and software were improving very quick. With the evolution of the genre it has come to be known by a number of names, including spiral tekno, hardtek, tribetek, tribe and lately evolved in many other subgenres like pumping tek, hardfloor and French core which is a sort of mixture between mainstream Hardcore and Hardtekno, with funny and pumping samples taken from different media supports. Tekno producers come from numerous places, particularly in Europe, including the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Italy, France, Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic. Some of the most active artist who from the early 1990s up till the mid 2000s were Spiral Tribe, Crystal Distortion, Lego, Liqitex, 69db, Ixy, Kaos, Jack Acid, Curley, Unit Moebius, Les Boucles Etranges, Yale, FKY, Babyon Joke, Arobass, Gotek, Floxytek, Suburbass, Zone-33, Mat Weasel Buster, Narkotek, Kernel Panik, Revolt99, Infrabass, Vinka, Banditos, La Bloukak, Diablo (LSDF), Teknambul, Spiralheadz, Asphalt-Pirates, Aya Soundsystem, Puissance K, Guigoo, Billx, Maissouille, Key Gen, Psychospores, Fractal, Sceletor, and Lyzor-sak. Many record labels contributed spreading the sound mostly via underground distribution operated mostly by record shops / labels such as Hokus Pokus (Paris) and Toolbox Records (Paris), and record labels such as Tek No Logique (TNL), Narkotek and Astrofonik.

Artists within this genre usually follow a very different ideology when compared to more modern and mainstream producers: * Artists often use many pseudonyms, as they are not interested in mainstream success or recognition * Most are not interested in profit * They also support the free distribution of their works, as they do not see it as their own material, but as something that belongs to the fans and the community This is described as \\"returning to the roots\\". Subgenres Jungletek and Raggatek is a subgenres derived directly from Hardtek. These well known genres collide to create fast energetic 190 BPM dance floor smashers. Kicked of around 2008 here in the UK Mandidextrous & Vandal were among the first producers to start writing this genre of music. It breathed new life into the underground rave scene not only here in the UK but also picking up a strong following in Italy, Spain and Austria to mention a few. Massive influence for this music also came from the Techno scene in Europe where some of the first underground music lovers started to up the bpm and add variations in structure thus becoming Tekno. Techno in the UK in the early 1990s was based on a bpm of 130-140. By the 2000s music on its never ending journey of progression had gained more speed and Hardtek was starting to dominate UK raves especially in the South and London.. Even Trance had progressed from sweeping delicate melody's to whats now known as Hardtrance a faster, harder more bouncy music to its predecessor. Music all over the underground was getting harder and faster. In today's world the most recent and noticeable evaluation in music is the progression of DnB into Neuro Funk, very similar to DnB but with grittier and harsher bass and synth sounds often using masses of compression to get those tearing bass line which is now worlds apart from one of the original DnB genres pioneered by Carl Cox Jungletechno. Raggatek is predominantly influenced by Reggae and Ragga music, incorporating Jungle, DnB, Dancehall, Reggae, Ragga and Techno music. Well known MC's such as YT and Top Cat are a massive influence on the world of Raggatek. Producers loving this type of sound wanted to bring it to the dance floors of the underground. Upping the bpm to between 180 ‚Äì 200 adding amen breaks and the basic structure of Hardtek that kick bass kick bass format was the formula for a new hybrid music. The big sounding Ragga style vocals are often a massive presence on Raggatek productions. Jungletek works on exactly the same formula as Raggatek just replace the Ragga with Jungle & DnB. Being less known for the vocal arrangements and more about the bass lines. Jungletek takes the basics of the bass line from well known Jungle and DnB tracks and recreates them in a Hardtek format. Original productions also use the simple format of kick bass with amen breaks. European Raggatek and Jungletek is often recognisable by the high energy eletro sounds in the bass lines and synth melody's.

Located on the Fraser River, it is generally considered to be on the dividing line between the Coast and the Interior regions of the British Columbia Mainland. Immediately north of the town, the Fraser Canyon begins and the river is generally considered unnavigable past this point. Rough water is common on the Fraser anywhere upstream from Chilliwack and even more so above Hope, about south of Yale. However, steamers could make it to Yale, good pilots and water conditions permitting, and the town had a busy dockside life as well as a variety of bars, restaurants, hotels, saloons and various services. Its maximum population during the gold rush era was in the 15,000 range. More generally, it housed 5,000-8,000. The higher figure was counted at the time of evacuation of the Canyon during the Fraser Canyon War of 1858. Most of today's population are members of the self-governing Yale First Nation. Non-native businesses include a couple of stores, restaurants and a few motels and other services, as well as a gas station, and automotive repair and rescue outfits. The Yale area is the lowest main destination for the Fraser River rafting expedition companies; several have waterfront campgrounds and facilities near town. All Hallows is now a campground and hostel. Not much of gold rush-era Yale survives, as the docks vanished long ago. The railway was built in the 1880s down the main street of what had been the waterfront town. The Yale Museum is located on old Front Street, adjacent to the tracks. Next to it is the Anglican Church of St. John the Divine, among the oldest in British Columbia. The town has a spectacular natural landscape. Every summer, a historical re-enactment group visits Yale to celebrate the Royal Engineers, who had served under Richard Clement Moody during McGowan's War. They also worked on the Cariboo Wagon Road (later improved as the Trans-Canada Highway) and the Douglas-Lillooet Trail. The men were an integral part of Yale's life from the gold rush to the end of the 1870s.  History  Historic Yale church The town was founded in 1848 by the Hudson's Bay Company as Fort Yale by Ovid Allard, the appointed manager of the new post, who named it after his superior, James Murray Yale, then Chief Factor of the Columbia District. In its heyday at the peak of the gold rush, it was reputed to be the largest city west of Chicago and north of San Francisco. It also earned epithets such as \\"the wickedest little settlement in British Columbia\\" and \\"a veritable Sodom and Gomorrah\\" of vice, violence and lawlessness. Yale played an important role in certain events of the gold rush period which threatened British control in the region with annexation by the United States: the Fraser Canyon War and McGowan's War. The Governor came to Yale during the first crisis, and government officials Matthew Baillie Begbie, Chartres Brew and Richard Clement Moody during the second, to address American miners and take control of matters. The unrest threatened the rule of the Crown over the Mainland (or \\"New Caledonia\\" as it was called before the creation of the mainland colony. (New Caledonia was usually applied to the fur district northwest from present- day Prince George, British Columbia). As Yale was the head of river navigation, it was the best location to be designated for the start of the Cariboo Wagon Road, as there were no usable roads between Yale and the settlements nearer the Fraser's mouth. The Cariboo Road, built in the early 1860s, ran from Yale to Barkerville via Lytton, Ashcroft and Quesnel. By the start of the 1870s, an overland route from New Westminster was finally built - the Yale Road along the south side of the river. It was formerly known as the Grand Trunk Road and in the 21st century as Old Yale Road; it survives in sections from Surrey through Abbotsford and Chilliwack (though no longer entirely a continuous \\"highway\\"). Its counterpart on the north side of the river was the Dewdney Trunk Road, built in the same period in advance of railway construction in the 1880s. That road ran only to Dewdney, just east of Mission City. Because of its unique role as a transshipment point for the Cariboo Road, Yale prospered for another twenty years after the gold rush. Although it declined in population, it retained some prestige and such sophistication as had grown up within the rough gold town. It was as familiar to early provincial high society as were New Westminster and distant Barkerville. During the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway, construction ran directly through the village, built on flatland by the river. It destroyed the town's old commercial core and the connection of the town life to the waterfront. As Yale was handy for travel to and from New Westminster and the railway's destination on Burrard Inlet (soon after named Vancouver), it became the headquarters and residence of the American railway contractor Andrew Onderdonk, who supervised its construction. The town boomed with population and new businesses because of railway spending and employment. Yale and nearby Emory City, in the vicinity of Hill's Bar, where the gold rush had begun, as well as all the major Canyon towns to Ashcroft, thronged with temporary residents and business of various kinds and legitimacies. Three- times daily rail service to Vancouver - begun in the early 1880s before construction in the Canyon was finished in 1885 - made Yale a popular excursion run. With construction ended, however, the population dropped dramatically in Yale by 1890, and continued to decline afterward. Daily return service remained in effect until World War I. When Onderdonk moved on in 1886, he donated his estate for a girls' school, All Hallows. This was ranked as one of the main society schools in the colony and continued to operate for decades, into the 1920s. Construction of the railway destroyed parts of the Cariboo Wagon Road, which was severed between Yale and Boston Bar and between Lytton and Spences Bridge. A new highway north from Yale was not built until the Cariboo Highway in 1922, partly built using surviving roadgrades of the original wagon road and since upgraded to the Trans-Canada Highway. For a long time, this was the main route between the Interior and the Coast. After major reconstruction of the Cariboo Highway in the 1950s, involving the construction of several major tunnels, the difficult old canyon stretch of the route achieved highway quality (instead of in name only), and towns such as Yale boomed once again. With the opening of the faster Coquihalla Highway in the 1980s, Yale's economy and population fell off as traffic bypassed it.

The crash site is roughly equidistant between the Whalesback Memorial and another memorial at Bayswater, Nova Scotia, located on the Aspotogan Peninsula on the western shore of the bay, opposite Peggys Cove. The monument reads in English and French: \\"In memory of the 229 men, women and children aboard Swissair Flight 111 who perished off these shores September 2nd, 1998. They have been joined to the sea, and the sky. May they rest in peace.\\" The site of the crash and the two monuments form a triangle. The three notches on the monument at Whalesback represent the numerals 111. The sight line from the three grooves in the stone points to the crash site, while the markings on the facing stone point to the memorial at Bayswater. The memorial wall at Bayswater lists the names of the passengers and crew. The facing stone points to the crash site. War Plan Red In the period between World War I and World War II the US military drew up a series of Colour Coded War Plans based on likely global threats.

It is a collaboration between American authors Daniel Ravipinto and Star Foster. Slouching Towards Bedlam was finalist for eight 2003 XYZZY Awards, winning four: Best Game, Setting, Story, and Individual NPC (for the protagonist's cybernetic assistant, Triage). The game takes place in a steampunk Victorian era setting. Its title is inspired by a line from The Second Coming, a poem by W.B. Yeats. Summary The player character awakens in an office in Bedlam Asylum. From context it appears that the character is Doctor Xavier, a doctor at the Asylum. The Doctor, however, has no memory of his past. After investigation, it becomes clear that a now deceased patient, Cleve Anderson, has infected the player character with a mental virus known as the \\"Logos\\". The virus spreads by spoken language, taking the form of a glossolalic babble uttered by the vector. The patient tried to stop the spread of the virus by not speaking to others, not realizing that the player character (in the back-plot) had been secretly listening in on the patient. Part of the result of being infected with the virus is that the character recognizes and has access to some ability to control time, as represented by the normally meta-game commands \\"undo\\", \\"save,\\" \\"restore,\\" and \\"restart.\\" Throughout the game the player is given cryptic messages that come from the Logos. Investigation can optionally reveal that a secret society accidentally released the Logos while experimenting with magic. The game has five distinct endings. There are three endings in which the virus is stopped; either by having the player character commit suicide before interacting with any other people (Ending A), by having the player character kill any characters he interacted with before committing suicide (Ending D), or by having the player character kill any characters he interacts with then waiting (Ending E). The virus's end is explained in the endgame for Ending E: the player character goes home and cuts out his own tongue - and asks all his written works to be destroyed, afraid that the Logos will reproduce by writing. There are two endings in which the virus spreads: the player character can willfully transmit the virus over a wireless broadcast (Ending C), quickly spreading it across the world, or the player character can simply infect several other people who will slowly spread the virus (Ending B). Each ending comes with an appendix that provides additional information on it. Authors Slouching Towards Bedlam was Daniel Ravipinto's second publicly released game after 1996's Tapestry. Ravipinto works professionally as a computer programmer. Co-author Star Foster was a newcomer to writing Interactive Fiction. Foster worked professionally in marketing. She died in December 2006. The two both lived in Philadelphia and met there. They collaborated on design and development. Actual programming was entirely done by Ravipinto.

The building faces Catherine Street (earlier named Bridges or Brydges Street) and backs onto Drury Lane. The building is the most recent in a line of four theatres which were built at the same location, the earliest of which dated back to 1663, making it the oldest theatre site in London still in use. According to the author Peter Thomson, for its first two centuries, Drury Lane could \\"reasonably have claimed to be London's leading theatre\\". For most of that time, it was one of a handful of patent theatres, granted monopoly rights to the production of \\"legitimate\\" drama in London (meaning spoken plays, rather than opera, dance, concerts, or plays with music). The first theatre on the site was built at the behest of Thomas Killigrew in the early 1660s, when theatres were allowed to reopen during the English Restoration. Initially known as \\"Theatre Royal in Bridges Street\\", the theatre's proprietors hired prominent actors who performed at the theatre on a regular basis, including Nell Gwyn and Charles Hart. In 1672, the theatre caught fire and Killigrew built a larger theatre on the same plot, renamed the \\"Theatre Royal in Drury Lane\\"; it opened in 1674. This building lasted nearly 120 years, under the leaderships of Colley Cibber, David Garrick and Richard Brinsley Sheridan, the last of whom employed Joseph Grimaldi as the theatre's resident Clown. In 1791, under Sheridan's management, the building was demolished to make way for a larger theatre which opened in 1794. This new Drury Lane survived for 15 years before burning down in 1809. The building that stands today opened in 1812. It has been the residency of well known actors including; Edmund Kean, comedian Dan Leno, and the musical composer and performer Ivor Novello. From the Second World War, the theatre has primarily hosted long runs of musicals, including Oklahoma! (1947‚Äì1953), My Fair Lady (1958‚Äì1963), 42nd Street (1984‚Äì1989, 2017‚Äì2019) and Miss Saigon (1989‚Äì1999), the theatre's longest- running show. The theatre is owned by the composer Andrew Lloyd Webber. The theatre is currently undergoing refurbishment but, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in England, it won't reopen until sometime in the autumn of 2020; the delayed reopening of the building has affected its newest production of Disney's Frozen, which is expected to launch in early April 2021.  First theatre: Theatre Royal, Bridges Street (1663)  Thomas Killigrew as he appeared in 1650 After the eleven-year-long Puritan Interregnum, which had seen the banning of pastimes regarded as frivolous, such as theatre, the English monarchy was restored to the throne with the return of Charles II in 1660. Soon after, Charles issued Letters Patent to two parties licensing the formation of new acting companies. One of these went to Thomas Killigrew, whose company became known as the King's Company, and who built a new theatre in Drury Lane. The Letters Patent also granted the two companies a shared monopoly on the public performance of legitimate drama in London; this monopoly was challenged in the 18th century by new venues and by a certain slipperiness in the definition of \\"legitimate drama,\\" but remained legally in place until 1843. The new playhouse, architect unknown, opened on 7 May 1663 and was known from the placement of the entrance as the \\"Theatre Royal in Bridges Street.\\" It went by other names as well, including the \\"King's Playhouse.\\" The building was a three-tiered wooden structure, long and wide; it could hold an audience of 700. Set well back from the broader streets, the theatre was accessed by narrow passages between surrounding buildings.. See also this scale reconstruction, crediting Richard Leacroft, The Development of the English Playhouse, Eyre Methuen Ltd 1973, p. 83. The King himself frequently attended the theatre's productions, as did Samuel Pepys, whose private diaries provide much of what we know of London theatre-going in the 1660s. The day after the Theatre Royal opened, Pepys attended a performance of Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher's The Humorous Lieutenant. He has this to say in his diary: Location of the Theatre Royal on a map of London from 1700; the inset shows the streets as they are in 2006. Performances usually began at 3 pm to take advantage of the daylight: the main floor for the audience, the pit, had no roof in order to let in the light. A glazed dome was built over the opening, but according to one of Pepys' diary entries, the dome was not entirely effective at keeping out the elements: he and his wife were forced to leave the theatre to take refuge from a hail storm. Green baize cloth covered the benches in the pit and served to decorate the boxes, additionally ornamented with gold-tooled leather, and even the stage itself.Spiers, Theatres. The backless green benches in the pit were in a semicircular arrangement facing the stage, according to a May 1663 letter from one Monsieur de Maonconys: \\"All benches of the pit, where people of rank also sit, are shaped in a semi-circle, each row higher than the next.\\"Spiers, Theatres, citing The three galleries formed a semicircle around the floor seats; both the first and second galleries were divided up into boxes. The King's Company was forced to commission the technically advanced and expensive Theatre Royal playhouse by the success of the rival Duke's Company, which was drawing fascinated crowds with their \\"moveable\\" or \\"changeable\\" scenery and visually gorgeous productions at the former Lisle's Tennis Court at Lincoln's Inn Fields.Langhans, p. 16 Imitating the innovations at Lincoln's Inn Fields, the Theatre Royal also featured moveable scenery with wings or shutters that could be smoothly changed between or even within acts. When not in use, the shutters rested out of sight behind the sides of the proscenium arch, which also served as a visual frame for the on-stage happenings. The picture-frame-like separation between audience and performance was a new phenomenon in English theatre, though it had been found on the Continent earlier. Theatre design in London remained ambivalent about the merits of the \\"picture-box\\" stage, and for many decades to come, London theatres including Drury Lane had large forestages protruding beyond the arch, often including the thrust stages found in the Elizabethan theatres. The players could still step forward and bridge the distance between performer and audience, and in addition, it was not unusual for audience members to mount the stage themselves.\\"A History of a Night at the Theatre\\" , Victoria and Albert Museum website, retrieved 14 March 2015 Killigrew's investment in the new playhouse put the two companies on a level as far as technical resources were concerned, but the offerings at the Theatre Royal nevertheless continued to be dominated by actor-driven \\"talk\\" drama, contrasting with William Davenant's baroque spectacles and operas at Lincoln's Inn Fields. Internal power structures were the main reason for this difference: while Davenant skilfully commanded a docile young troupe, Killigrew's authority over his veteran actors was far from absolute.\\"Apparently the King's Company had no strong, centralized management ... Of course Killigrew would have had trouble getting Mohun's troupe to accept the kind of absolute control Davenant was able to impose upon his fledglings. But squabbles over management and shares were to characterize the King's Company throughout its stormy career, and ultimately they led to its downfall\\". Experienced actors Michael Mohun (who Pepys called \\"the best actor in the world\\") and Charles Hart held out for shares and good contracts in the King's Company. Such a division of power between the patentee, Killigrew, and his chief actors led to frequent conflicts that hampered the Theatre Royal as a business venture. Nevertheless, it was mostly at the struggling Theatre Royal, rather than at the efficiently run Lincoln's Inn Fields, that the plays were acted that are classics today. This applies especially to the new form Restoration comedy, dominated in the 1660s by William Wycherley and the Theatre Royal's house dramatist John Dryden. Actors such as Hart and Charles II's mistress Nell Gwyn developed and refined the famous scenes of repartee, banter and flirtation in Dryden's and Wycherley's comedies. With the appearance of actresses for the first time at Drury Lane and Lincoln's Inn Fields in the 1660s, British playwrights wrote parts for outspoken female characters, daring love scenes and provocative breeches roles.Byrd, Ann Marie. \\"Violently Erotic: Representing Rape in Restoration Drama\\" in Greenfield (2015), p. 69 In any case, the competition between the King's Company and the Duke's was good for the rebirth and development of English drama. The Great Plague of London struck in the summer of 1665, and the Theatre Royal, along with all other public entertainment, was shut down by order of the Crown on 5 June. It remained closed for 18 months until the autumn of 1666, during which time it received at least a little interior renovation, including widening of the stage.Pepys' 19 March 1666 s:Diary of Samuel Pepys/1666/March#19th describes a visit to the play house during the renovations, noting \\"God knows when they will begin to act again.\\" For the royal order closing the playhouses see Latham & Matthews 'Diary of Samuel Pepys,' vol vii (1666), p. 76 note 5. Located well to the west of the City boundary, the theatre was unaffected by the Great Fire of London, which raged through the City in September 1666, but it burned down six years later on 25 January 1672.

During the 20th century, one illustration was repeatedly ‚Äì and wrongly ‚Äì published as \\"Christopher Wren, design for the Theatre Royal Drury Lane, 1674\\".It was published by Hamilton Bell, \\"Contributions to the History of the English Playhouse,\\" Architectural Record XXXIII (1913) in plate 5a in Volume 35 of The Survey of London; Peter Holland, The Ornament of Action (1979), 30; J.

David Wilmore (Theatresearch) and Professor David Thomas recorded a television programme, from inside the current Drury Lane auditorium, claiming to show how the Theatre Royal might have looked upon its opening in 1674, based on the drawing. During the programme, Thomas repeatedly described this drawing as \\"by Wren\\", without noting that Wren's signature does not appear on the drawing. Most recently, for example, supervisors of Graduate College of Bowling Green State University allowed Hope Celeste Bernar to inadvertently reproduce it on page 108 of her \\"Playing (with) Space in the Author on the Wheel.\\" Diss. PhD. May 2009 as \\"Wren's drawing provides detailed evidence of Theatre Royal Drury Lane's design. Since 1964, this presumption has been disputed by scholars.E. A.

Careful inspection of the drawing at All Souls' College, Oxford Library shows that it has one pencil inscription: \\"Play house\\" , which may have been added by a librarian or by anyone else. No sign of a signature (by Wren or anyone else) or a date appears anywhere on the drawing.Howell-Meri, Mark. \\"Acting Spaces and Carpenters' Tools: from the Fortune to the Theatre Royal, Bristol\\" , New Theatre Quarterly, Vol. 25, Issue 2, May 2009, pp. 148‚Äì158 Robert D.

The building was smaller than this, as reliable surveys and maps of the period show three passageways measuring between wide surrounding the Theatre Royal on three sides. The building probably measured between wide (the average width of all \\"Restoration\\" Theatres) and between long. Architect Robert Adam designed Drury Lane's 1674 interior. The theatre was managed, from 1747 to Adam's retirement in the 1770s, by David Garrick. The King's Company never recovered financially from the loss of the old Theatre Royal Bridges Street. The cost of constructing the new theatre, replacing their costumes and scenery lost in the fire and competitive pressure from the rival Duke's Company contributed to its decline. Eventually, in 1682, the King's Company merged with the Duke's. The 1674 Theatre Royal building contained a warren of rooms, including storage space and dressing rooms used by the management and performers, nearly seventy people in total, as well as some fifty technical staff members. Additionally three rooms were provided for scripts, including a library for their storage, a separate room for copying actors' parts and a special library for the theatre's account books, ledger books and music scores. This jumble of rooms often made communication among various departments difficult, a problem that Garrick corrected during his tenure as manager. The entire complex occupied bounded by Drury Lane (east), Brydges Street (west), Great Russell Street (north) and Little Russell Street (south). From 1674, theatregoers accessed the Drury Lane via a long ten foot wide passageway from Bridges Street. The passageway opened onto a yard (previously a \\"Riding Yard\\"The Survey of London, Volume 35, London: Athlone Press, University of London (1970), p. 30) in which the theatre stood. It's likely that the yard remained open to the sky at this date, on three sides of the Theatre Royal walls. Henri Misson, a visitor from France, offers a description of the theatre in 1698: his use of the word \\"amphitheatre\\" supports the view that Drury Lane had a circular line of boxes surrounding its pit: As Misson points out, the seating was divided by class, and tickets were priced accordingly. Box seats, used by the nobility and wealthy gentry, cost 5 shillings; the benches in the pit where some gentry sat, but also critics and scholars, cost 3 shillings; tradesmen and professionals occupied the first gallery with seats costing 2 shillings, while servants and other \\"ordinary people\\", as Misson refers to them, occupied the 1 shilling seats of the upper gallery. Seats were not numbered and were offered on a \\"first come, first served\\" basis, leading many members of the gentry to send servants to reserve seats well ahead of performances. The stage was wide and deep with a raked floor from the footlights to the backdrop. The angle of the rake rose one inch for every of horizontal stage. The stage floor included grooves for wings and flats in addition to trap doors in the floor. The proscenium arch covered the stage equipment above the stage that included a pair of girondels ‚Äì large wheels holding many candles used to counteract the light from the footlights. Towards the latter part of the 18th century, doors were placed on either side of the stage, and a series of small spikes traced the edge of the stage apron to prevent audiences from climbing onto the stage. At the very back of the stage, a wide door opened to reveal Drury Lane. An added difficulty for Killigrew and his sons Thomas and Charles was the political unrest of 1678‚Äì1684 with the Popish Plot and the Exclusion Bill crisis distracting potential audiences from things theatrical. This affected both the King's and the Duke's companies, but most of all the King's which had no profit margin to carry them through the lean years. In 1682, the companies merged, or rather, the King's was absorbed by the Duke's. Led at the time by Thomas Betterton, the United Company, as it was now called, chose Drury Lane as their production house, leaving the Duke's Company's theatre in Dorset Garden closed for a time. In 1688, Betterton was removed from managerial control by Alexander Davenant, son of William Davenant, the original patent holder for the Duke's Company. Davenant's management (with Charles Killigrew) proved brief and disastrous, and by 1693 he was fleeing to the Canary Islands in the wake of embezzlement charges. The Theatre Royal found itself in the hands of lawyer Christopher Rich for the next 16 years.Spiers, Companies. Neither Davenant's nor Killigrew's sons were much better than crooks, and Rich attempted to recoup their depredations of the company's resources by cost-cutting tyranny, pitting actor against actor and slashing salaries. By 1695, the actors, including day-to-day manager and acting legend Thomas Betterton, were alienated and humiliated enough to walk out and set up a cooperative company of their own. Nine men and six women departed, all of them established professional performers, including such draws as tragedian Elizabeth Barry and comedian Anne Bracegirdle, leaving the United Company ‚Äì henceforth known as the \\"Patent Company\\" ‚Äì in \\"a very despicable condition,\\" according to an anonymous contemporary pamphlet: David Garrick, the theatre manager 1747‚Äì1776, is portrayed in the title role of Richard III in this painting by William Hogarth. A private letter from 19 November 1696 reported that Drury Lane \\"has no company at all, and unless a new play comes out on Saturday revives their reputation, they must break.\\" The new play is assumed to have been John Vanbrugh's The Relapse, and it turned out the success the company needed. Christopher Rich continued as its head until 1709, when the patent in question was actually revoked amid a complex tangle of political machinations. A lawyer named William Collier was briefly given the right to mount productions in Drury Lane, but by 1710 the troupe was in the hands of the actors Colley Cibber, Robert Wilks, and Thomas Doggett ‚Äì a triumvirate that eventually found themselves sharply satirised in Alexander Pope's Dunciad. In 1713, Barton Booth replaced Doggett. On 2 March 1717 was the premiere of the ballet The Loves of Mars and Venus choreographed by John Weaver, and was the first ballet to be performed in England. Cibber was the de facto leader of the triumvirate, and he led the theatre through a controversial but generally successful period until 1733, when he sold his controlling interest to John Highmore. It is likely that the sale was at a vastly inflated price and that Colley's goal was simply to get out of debts and make a profit (see Robert Lowe in his edition of Cibber's Apology). Members of the troupe at the time were most displeased; an actor's revolt was organised and executed; Charles Fleetwood came to control the theatre. Fleetwood's tenure was tumultuous; his abolition of the practice of allowing footmen free access to the upper gallery led to riots in 1737, and Fleetwood's gambling problems entangled the theatre in his own financial difficulties. It was during this period that actor Charles Macklin (a native of Inishowen in County Donegal in Ulster) rose to fame, propelled by a singular performance as Shylock in an early 1741 production of The Merchant of Venice, in which he introduced a realistic, naturalistic style of acting, abandoning the artificial bombast typical to dramatic roles prior. The facade on Bridges Street. Added in 1775, this gave the theatre its first on-street entrance. In 1747, Fleetwood's playhouse patent expired. The theatre and a patent renewal were purchased by actor David Garrick (who had trained under Macklin earlier) and partner James Lacy. Garrick served as manager and lead actor of the theatre until roughly 1766, and continued on in the management role for another ten years after that. He is remembered as one of the great stage actors and is especially associated with advancing the Shakespearean tradition in English theatre ‚Äì during his time at Drury Lane, the company mounted at least 24 of Shakespeare's plays.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Eleventh Edition . Some of Shakespeare's surge in popularity during this period can be traced to the Licensing Act of 1737, which mandated governmental approval of any play before it could be performed and thereby created something of a vacuum of new material to perform. Garrick shared the stage with company including Peg Woffington, Susannah Cibber, Hannah Pritchard, Kitty Clive, Spranger Barry, Richard Yates and Ned Shuter. It was under Garrick's management that spectators were for the first time barred from the stage itself. Garrick commissioned Robert Adam and his brother James to renovate the theatre's interior, which they did in 1775. Their additions included an ornate ceiling and a stucco facade facing Bridges Street. This facade was the first time any structure that might be considered part of the theatre proper actually abutted the street: the building, like the 1663 original, had been built in the centre of the block, hemmed in by other structures. The narrow passage from Bridges street to the theatre now became an interior hallway; some theatre office space also went up behind the new facade. The interior of the third and largest theatre to stand at Drury Lane, c. 1808 With a series of farewell performances, Garrick left the stage in 1776 and sold his shares in the theatre to the Irish playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan. Sheridan and his partners, Thomas Linley the elder and Doctor James Ford (court physician to King George III), completed their purchase of Drury Lane two years later, and Sheridan owned it until 1809.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Eleventh Edition . Sheridan premiered his own comedy of manners The School for Scandal in 1777. Active management of the theatre was carried out by several parties during Sheridan's ownership, including himself, his father Thomas, and, from 1788 to 1796 and 1800 to 1802, the popular actor John Philip Kemble. Linley took up the post of Musical Director at the theatre, receiving a retainer of ¬£500 per annum. Sheridan employed dozens of children as extras at Drury Lane including Joseph Grimaldi who made his stage debut at the theatre in 1780. Grimaldi became best known for his development of the modern day white-face clown and popularised the role of Clown in many Pantomimes and Harlequinades. Towards the end of the 1790s, Grimaldi starred in Robinson Crusoe, which confirmed him as a key Christmas pantomime performer. Many pantomimes followed, but his career at Drury Lane became turbulent, and he left the theatre for good in 1806.Grimaldi (Boz edition), pp. 117‚Äì119.  Third theatre (1794)  The theatre pictured as it was in 1809 (from an 1811 engraving). The view is from the north-east, looking down Russell Street at its intersection with Drury Lane. This shows the rear of the theatre with its dressing rooms and stage door. The theatre was in need of updating by the end of the 18th century and was demolished in 1791, with the company moving temporarily to the new King's Theatre, in the Haymarket. A third theatre was designed by Henry Holland and opened on 12 March 1794. In the design of the theatre boxes, Henry Holland asked John Linnell for assistance. The designs by Linnell survive in the V&A; Print Room ‚Äì there are also designs by Henry Holland and Charles Heathcote Tatham who were involved in the design process. This was a cavernous theatre, accommodating more than 3,600 spectators. specifies 3611. The motivation behind building on such a large scale? In the words of one owner: New technology facilitated the expansion: iron columns replaced bulky wood, supporting five tiers of galleries. The stage was large, too: wide and deep. Holland, the architect, said it was \\"on a larger scale than any other theatre in Europe.\\" Except for churches, it was the tallest building in London. The \\"very popular notion that our theatres ought to be very small\\" proved hard to overcome. Various accounts from the period bemoan the mammoth size of the new theatre, longing for the \\"warm close observant seats of Old Drury,\\" as one May 1794 theatre-goer put it. Actress Sarah Siddons, then part of the Drury Lane company, called it \\"a wilderness of a place\\" (and left Drury Lane along with her brother John Philip Kemble in 1803). Not only was any sense of intimacy and connection to the company on stage lost, but the very size of the theatre put a great deal of the audience at such a distance from the stage so as to make hearing a player's voice quite difficult. To compensate, the productions mounted in the new theatre tended more toward spectacle than the spoken word. An example of such a spectacle is a 1794 production that featured real water flowing down a rocky stream into a lake large enough on which to row a boat. This water issued from tanks in the attics above the house, which were installed ‚Äì along with a much-touted iron safety curtain ‚Äì as proof against fire. After standing only 15 years, the third Drury Lane theatre building burned down on 24 February 1809. This painting from the period, artist unknown, shows the view of the fire from the Westminster Bridge. Richard Sheridan continued as theatre owner during the entire lifetime of this third building. He had grown in stature as a statesman during this time, but troubled finances were to be his undoing. The 1794 rebuilding had cost double the original estimate of ¬£80,000, and Sheridan bore the entirety of the debt. Productions were more expensive to mount in the larger structure, and increased audience revenues failed to make up the difference. An assassination attempt against King George III took place at the theatre on 15 May 1800. James Hadfield fired two pistol shots from the pit toward the King, sitting in the royal box. The shots missed by inches, Hadfield having been jostled by a Mr Dyte. Hadfield was quickly subdued, and George, apparently unruffled, ordered the performance to continue. The comedy actor John Bannister became acting-manager in 1802. With Sheridan's son Tom, and in the circle of Richard Wroughton (stage-manager), William Dowton, Michael Kelly, Tom Dibdin and their likes, he helped to see the Theatre Royal through its next catastrophe.H. van Thal (ed), Solo Recital: The Reminiscences of Michael Kelly, abridged with a Biographical Index (Folio Society, London 1972), pp. 282‚Äì288. On 24 February 1809, despite the previously mentioned fire safety precautions, the theatre burned down. On being encountered drinking a glass of wine in the street while watching the fire, R.B. Sheridan was famously reported to have said: \\"A man may surely be allowed to take a glass of wine by his own fireside.\\"The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, OUP (1999). Michael Kelly (Memoirs, ed. van Thal 1972, p. 283) states that Sheridan was engaged in a debate in the House when the news of the fire came, but although on his behalf it was moved that the House should adjourn, he insisted that 'Public duty ought to precede all private interest' and remained there with Roman fortitude while his theatre burned. Already on the shakiest financial ground, Sheridan was ruined entirely by the loss of the building. He turned to brewer Samuel Whitbread, an old friend, for help.Morning Chronicle, 7 July 1815. As well as investing strongly in the project, Whitbread agreed to head a committee that would manage the company and oversee the rebuilding of the theatre, but asked Sheridan to withdraw from management himself, which he did entirely by 1811.  Modern theatre (1812‚Äìpresent)  The present-day Theatre Royal in Drury Lane, sketched when it was new, in 1813 The present Theatre Royal in Drury Lane, designed by Benjamin Dean Wyatt on behalf of the committee led by Whitbread, opened on 10 October 1812 with a production of Hamlet featuring Robert Elliston in the title role. The new theatre made some concessions toward intimacy, seating 3,060 people, about 550 fewer than the earlier building (though this size is still considered an extremely large theatre). On 6 September 1817, gas lighting was extended from the audience area to the stage, making it the first British theatre to be gaslit throughout. In 1820, the portico that still stands at the theatre's front entrance on Catherine Street was added, and in 1822 the interior underwent a significant remodelling. The colonnade running down the Russell Street side of the building was added in 1831.Details in this paragraph from Productions relying more on scenery and effects than on dialogue and acting remained commonplace in the new facility. The 1823 production of Cataract of the Ganges had a finale featuring a horseback escape up a flowing cataract \\"with fire raging all around.\\" Effects for an 1829 production were produced by hydraulic apparatus that reportedly could discharge 39 tons of water. There were those concerned that the theatre was failing in its role as one of the very few permitted to show legitimate drama. Management of the theatre after it reopened in 1813 fell to Samuel James Arnold, overseen by an amateur board of directors and a subcommittee focusing on the theatre as a centre for national culture. (Lord Byron was briefly on this subcommittee, from June 1815 until leaving England in April 1816.) Actor Edmund Kean was the on-stage highlight; like Macklin before him, he made his reputation as Shylock, premiering in the role in 1814. Kean remained until 1820 through praise and notorious disputes with local playwrights such as Charles Bucke.The Works of Lord Byron, footnote p. 202 Shakespeare's King John at the theatre, as depicted in the Illustrated London News Elliston leased the theatre from 1819 until he went bankrupt in 1826. An American, Stephen Price of New York City's Park Theatre, followed from 1826 to 1830. Through most of the remainder of the 19th century, Drury Lane passed quickly from one proprietor to another. A colonnade was added to the Russell Street frontage, in 1831, by architect Samuel Beazley. In 1833, Alfred Bunn gained control of both Drury Lane and Covent Garden, managing the former from 1833 to 1839, and again from 1843 to 1850. Following the lead of the Lyceum Theatre, London, Bunn championed English opera, rather than the Italian operas that had played earlier at the theatre. These included Fair Rosamond and Farinelli by John Barnett; a series of twelve operas by Michael Balfe including The Maid of Artois and The Bohemian Girl; Maritana and others by William Vincent Wallace and several by Julius Benedict.Gordon-Powell, Robin. Ivanhoe, full score, Introduction, vol. I, p. VII, 2008, The Amber Ring In 1837, actor-manager Samuel Phelps (1804‚Äì1878) joined the company at Drury Lane, appearing with William Charles Macready, the gifted actor-manager in several Shakespeare plays. He also created the role of Captain Channel in Douglas Jerrold's melodrama, The Prisoner of War (1842), and of Lord Tresham in Robert Browning's A Blot in the 'Scutcheon (1843). Macready was briefly manager in 1841‚Äì1843, putting significant reforms in place. Nevertheless, most productions there were financial disasters. Pantomime characters from the Augustus Harris era including Dan Leno, Marie Lloyd and Little Tich by Phil May The theatrical monopoly first bestowed by Royal Letters Patent 183 years earlier was abolished by the Theatres Act 1843, but the patent had been largely toothless for decades and this had little immediate effect. On the other hand, other theatres, used to presenting musical entertainments, continued to do so, and Drury Lane continued as one of the most accepted venues for legitimate theatre. The 19th-century run of financial and artistic failures at Drury Lane was interrupted by four plays produced over a twenty- five-year period by the actor-playwright Dion Boucicault: The Queen of Spades (1851), Eugenie (1855), Formosa (1869), and The Shaughraun (1875). But this period of general decline culminated with F. B. Chatterton's 1878 resignation; in his words, \\"Shakespeare spells ruin, and Byron bankruptcy.\\" During the 19th century, Drury Lane staged ballet as well, with performers including Italy's Carlotta Grisi. One famous musical director of Drury Lane was the eccentric French conductor and composer of light music Louis-Antoine Jullien (1812‚Äì1860), who successfully invited Berlioz to visit London and give concerts in the Theatre. The house's fortunes rose again under the management of Augustus Harris from 1879. In the 1880s and 1890s, the theatre hosted many of the productions of the Carl Rosa Opera Company. Harris focused increased resources on the theatre's annual pantomime, beginning at Christmas 1888, adding a well-known comedian, Dan Leno. These spectacular Christmas shows were a major success, often playing into March. They were choreographed by the theatre's dance master, John D'Auban. Many of the designs under Harris were created by the imaginative designer C. Wilhelm, including the spectacular drama, Armada (1888), and many of the pantomimes.\\"Mr. Pitcher's Art\\" ‚Äì Obituary, The Times, 3 March 1925 Productions relying on spectacle became the norm at Drury Lane under the managements first of Harris, from 1879 to 1896, and then of Arthur Collins from 1896 to 1923. Examples include the 1909 play, The Whip, which featured not only a train crash, but also twelve horses recreating the 2,000 Guineas Stakes on an on-stage treadmill.\\"19th century spectacle\\", Victoria and Albert Museum, 2012, accessed 24 September 2014 Jimmy Glover, Director of Music from 1893 to 1923, was a significant figure at the theatre during the Collins years and wrote books which record much more than its musical life.Peter Gammond, ed., The Oxford Companion to Popular Music (Oxford University Press, 1991), p. 228 Oliver! billboard at the theatre in 2009  Interior renovation (1922)  In 1922, under the ownership of managing director Sir Alfred Butt, the theatre underwent its last major interior renovation of the 20th century.

The most famous ghost is the \\"Man in Grey\\", who appears dressed as a nobleman of the late 18th century: powdered hair beneath a tricorne hat, a dress jacket and cloak or cape, riding boots and a sword. Legend says that the Man in Grey is the ghost of a knife-stabbed man whose skeletal remains were found within a walled-up side passage in 1848.Morley, Sheridan Theatre's Stranges Acts Robson Books 2006 p.26 Google Books Various people have reported seeing the ghost, including W. J. MacQueen-Pope, who described its usual path as starting at the end of the fourth row in the upper circle and then proceeding via the rear gangway to the wall near the royal box, where the remains were found. The ghosts of actor Charles Macklin and clown Joseph Grimaldi are also supposed to haunt the theatre. Macklin appears backstage, wandering the corridor which now stands in the spot where, in 1735, he killed fellow actor Thomas Hallam in an argument over a wig (\\"Goddamn you for a blackguard, scrub, rascal!\\" he shouted, thrusting a cane into Hallam's face and piercing his left eye).From the testimony of witness Thomas Arne, reported in 1847's Celebrated Trials of All Countries, and Remarkable Cases of Criminal Jurisprudence, J.

Paulo (, The State of S√£o Paulo), also known as Estad√£o (, Big State), is a daily newspaper published in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. It is the fourth largest newspaper in Brazil and its format is broadsheet. It has the second- largest circulation in the city of S√£o Paulo, behind only Folha de S. Paulo. The journal was founded on 4 January 1875, and was first called A Prov√≠ncia de S√£o Paulo History of Estado de S. Paulo (\\"The Province of S√£o Paulo\\"). An active supporter of the military dictatorship in Brazil which lasted from 1964 to 1985, O Estado de S. Paulo is described by observers as having a right- wing, conservative editorial stance.  History  The term Prov√≠ncia (\\"Province\\") was preserved until January 1890, one month after the fall of the monarchy and the subsequent republican regime in Brazil. Although the newspaper supported the change, it showed that it was completely independent, refusing to serve the interests of the ascendant Republican Party of S√£o Paulo. Current symbol of the newspaper When the then editor in chief Francisco Rangel Pestana left to work in a project of the Constitution, in Petr√≥polis, the young editor Julio de Mesquita effectively took control of Estado and initiated a series of innovations. One of the innovations was the engagement of the agency Havas, which back then the largest in the world. The Estad√£o pioneered the newspaper selling system in 1875, where it was sold on the streets, instead of by the subscription-only system adopted by all other newspapers in Brazil before that time. At first, this new way of selling resulted in jokes and mockery, but ultimately all rivals adopted the same system. Today, newspapers in Brazil are sold in small street newspapers/magazines shops, and by single sellers located in the main avenues of the biggest cities. Back in the 19th century, the Estad√£o was sold by only one man, a French immigrant, who carried his newspapers in a bag, while riding a horse, and announcing himself with a cornet.  19th century  In the end of the 19th century, the Estado was already the largest newspaper in S√£o Paulo, exceeding the circulation of the Correio Paulistano. Property of the Mesquita family since 1902, History of Estado de S. Paulo (Cont.3) the Estado supported the Allied cause in World War I, suffering reprisals from the German community in the city, which removed all advertising announcements from the newspaper. Despite this, the Mesquitas maintained their editorial position. During the war, the afternoon edition of the newspaper began to circulate throughout the country. It was known as Estadinho (lit. \\"Little Estado\\"), directed by the then young J√∫lio de Mesquita Filho. In 1924, the newspaper Estado was banned from circulation for the first time, after the defeat of the tenants' rebellion that shook the city. J√∫lio Mesquita, who tried to mediate a dialogue between the rebels and the government, was imprisoned and taken to Rio de Janeiro, before being freed shortly thereafter. History of Estado de S. Paulo (Cont.4) With the death of the old director of 1927, his son J√∫lio de Mesquita Filho assumed the directory along with his brother Franscisco, the latter managing the financial aspects of the newspaper. In 1930 the Estado, connected to the Democratic Party, supported the candidature of Get√∫lio Vargas for the Liberal Alliance. With the victory of Vargas, the newspaper saw the Brazilian Revolution of 1930 as a mark of the end of the oligarchy system. The so-called Grupo Estado assumed in 1932 the leadership of the constitutionalist revolution. With its defeat, many people from the directory were exiled, including J√∫lio de Mesquita Filho and Francisco Mesquita One year later, in August, Get√∫lio Vargas invited Armando de Salles Oliveira to be the governor in S√£o Paulo. Armando Salles, son-in-law of J√∫lio Mesquita (by then already deceased), imposed as a condition for his acceptance the position the amnesty of the rebels of 1932 and a convocation of a constituent assembly. Vargas agreed and J√∫lio de Mesquita Filho and Francisco Mesquita, as well as other exiled people, returned to Brazil. History of Estado de S. Paulo (Cont.5) Headquarters of the newspaper, on the Marginal Tiet√™. Years later, with the appearance of the \\"Estado Novo\\", the newspaper maintained its opposition to the regime and, in March 1940, it was invaded by DOPS (part of the government that controlled and restrained opponents and movements that were antithetical to the Estado Novo regime) and the paper was altered by them to state that, with absurdity and mockery, \\"guns were arrested\\" in the redaction. The newspaper was initially closed and afterwards was confiscated by the dictatorship, being administrated by DIP (Department of the Press [Port.\\"Imprense\\"] and Propaganda) until 1945, when the Estado was returned back by the Supreme Federal Court to its legitimate owners. The numbers published during this governmental intervention are not considered part of the actual history of the paper. Shortly after World War II the Estado enjoyed great advances, with the increase in editing and of its good reputation. In the 1950s, the Major Quedinho Street headquarters were built, adjacent to the Hotel Jaragu√°. That was the phase when the section Internacional (\\"International\\") of the newspaper, directed by the journalist Giannino Carta and by Ruy Mesquita, became known as the most complete of any national newspaper. From that time until the 1970s, O Estado showed almost exclusively international news on its first page. ƒê  Rep√∫blica Nova  During the Rep√∫blica Nova (\\"New Republic\\") (1946‚Äì1964) the Estado profiled itself to the National Democratic Union of Carlos Lacerda and opposed all the other governments, especially Jo√£o Goulart. In 1954, O Estado de S. Paulo led a national campaign against the elected democratic President, Get√∫lio Vargas, leading him to commit suicide. In 1962, the director J√∫lio de Mesquita Filho even wrote a Roteiro da Revolu√ß√£o (\\"Guide to Revolution\\"), in an attempt to unify civilian opposition against the army, the then called \\"boasting party\\", which had intervened in Brazilian politics since the beginning of the Republic. In 1964, the Estado supported the military coup and the indirect election of Castelo Branco. Shortly after the Institutional Act n¬∞ 2 which dissolved the other political parties, the journal broke away from the regime. Censorship On 13 November 1968, the editor of the Estado was arrested because of Mesquita Filho's refusal to eliminate from the section Notas e Informa√ß√µes (\\"Notes and Information\\") the editorial Institui√ß√µes em Frangalhos (\\"Institutions in Frazzles\\"). where he denounced the end of any normal and simple democratic appearance. From then on, the newspaper began disputing censored editions of its news by the Brazilian Federal Police, unlike other national newspapers that did not dispute censorship by the government. With the death of Mesquita Filho, the Estado was directed by Julio de Mesquita Neto. Then, the newspaper gained worldwide visibility when it denounced the preemptive censorship of articles and replaced them with verses of the Portuguese classic The Lusiads, by Lu√≠s de Cam√µes. History of Estado de S. Paulo (Cont.6) In 1974, it received the Golden Pen of Freedom Award, bestowed by the International Federation of Editions and Newspapers. In the 1970s, the newspaper ran into debt because of the construction of its new headquarters by the Tiet√™ river, leading to a financial crisis, as it competed with a new standard of journalism represented by Folha de S. Paulo.  After military dictatorship  In 1986, the Estado hired the renowned journalist Augusto Nunes to be its chief editor. He updated the news bulletin of Estado and endeavored upon a series of reformed graphics, that would result in the adoption, in 1991, of colored printing in its daily editions. Before that, Estado was not issued on Monday and holidays. In 1996, J√∫lio de Mesquita Neto died and Ruy Mesquita, his brother, became the new director. Previously, Ruy directed Jornal da Tarde, owned by the Estado network. After an unsuccessful experience in the area of telecommunications, the Estado network was restructured in 2003 and most of the Mesquita family lost their directorship roles. Massive layoffs also occurred. After balancing its budget, the Estado embarked upon a new graphic reformulation in October 2004. It also created new notebooks and received many prizes for excellence in graphic displays. Grupo Estado Besides the newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo, the Estado network has control over the OESP M√≠dia (1984), a company that runs advertisements. Grupo Estado also owns the radios R√°dio Eldorado AM and FM (1972) and the Estado Agency (1970), the largest news agency in Brazil. Jornal da Tarde (1966) was discontinued in 2012. In 2013, another big reorganization followed. Employees were laid off and the paper reduced the number of pages.  Political stance  The oldest of all the sections, known as Notas e Informa√ß√µes (\\"Notes and Information\\"), which appears on page 3 and presents a republican institutionalist view, emphasizing liberty of expression, economic liberalism and Rechtsstaat ‚Äì one of flagship columns of O Estado de S.

The earliest form is Tamilish (dating from 1972), then Tinglish (1974), Tamglish (1991), Tamlish (1993), Thanglish (1997), and Tanglish (1999).Lambert, James. 2018. A multitude of ‚Äòlishes‚Äô: The nomenclature of hybridity. English World-wide, 39(1): 31-32. DOI: 10.1075/eww.38.3.04lam Distribution=Tamil Nadu The use of Tanglish has been common in Chennai, possibly due in part to the use of English in education. Also, the influx to the city of speakers of other languages (such as Telugu, Gujarati, and Kannada) has increased the importance of English as the language that people have in common. In The Hindu in 2010, a student in Chennai told of the widespread use of Tanglish by teenagers in her city. She said Tanglish was \\"something almost every teenager in Chennai uses\\", but noted that her mother said Tanglish was \\"murdering the [Tamil] language\\". That same year, a Tamil teacher in a matriculation school in Chennai reported that few of her students had a large enough Tamil vocabulary to be able to speak Tamil without including some words of English. Tanglish is increasingly used in advertising aimed at consumers in Tamil Nadu, particularly for promotion of international products. For example, Pepsi has mixed English with Tamil in its slogan \\"ullam kekkuthae more\\". In 2004, The Hindu commented on a mobile phone advertising campaign in Chennai that used slogans that combined Tamil and English, such as \\"Konjam Samaiyal... Konjam Serial\\", \\"Konjam Advice... Konjam Udaans\\", and \\"Konjam Kadhal... Konjam Modhal.\\" It also is common for advertising to use the Tamil language rendered in the English alphabet, a trend that leads to concern that people are losing the ability to read Tamil script. The Tanglish lyrics of the film song \\"Why This Kolaveri Di\\", which went viral on Internet social networking sites in November 2011, have been identified as a factor in the song's popularity. Tamil diasporas Use of Tanglish, or code-switching between Tamil and English, has been reported among Tamil-speaking immigrant populations in Malaysia and Canada, particularly by young people. Characteristics A study of code switching in everyday speech in Tamil Nadu found that English words are commonly inserted into sentences that otherwise follow Tamil syntax. A characteristic of Tanglish or Tamil-English code- switching is the addition of Tamil affixes to English words. The sound \\"u\\" is added at the end of an English noun to create a Tamil noun form, as in \\"soundu\\" and the words \\"girl-u heart-u black-u\\" in the lyrics of \\"Why This Kolaveri Di\\". English nouns often are combined with Tamil case markers, as in \\"journeyai\\", \\"driverkku\\" (dative case, used to mean \\"for the driver\\"), and \\"teacheroda\\". Verbs and some nouns from the English language are converted to Tamil verb forms by adding Tamil verbalizers that indicate verb tense. For example, the Tamil \\"paNNu\\" is added to the English verb \\"drive\\", resulting in \\"drive paNNu\\", used to mean \\"do the driving\\". Another pattern that has been noted by speakers or observers of Tanglish is the addition of the syllable \\"fy\\" at the end of a Tamil word (e.g., maatify, Kalaachify).Music composed by D.Imman \\"Fy Fy Fy Kalaachify\\" by Remya Nambeesan from \\"Pandiya Naadu\\" Tamil Movie See also * Indian English * Regional differences and dialects in Indian English * Madras Bashai, a related, but distinct, language variant, a slang form of Tamil used in Chennai that is a blend of Tamil with Indian English, Telugu and Hindustani References Category:Macaronic forms of English Category:Tamil language ","title":"Tanglish"},{"id":"1503083","text":"Celia Adler as a child Celia Feinman Adler (December 6, 1889 - January 31, 1979) was an American actress, known as the \\"First Lady of the Yiddish Theatre\\". Early life She was born in New York City, as Tzirele Adler (soon after known as Celia), the daughter of Jacob Adler and Dinah Shtettin, who were both actors in the Yiddish theater.\\"Celia Adler Forman\\" (1995). Dictionary of American Biography. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons. She was the half-sister of Stella Adler, Luther Adler, and Jacob Adler's five other children. Unlike Stella and Luther, who became well known for their work with the Group Theater, their film work and as theorists of the craft of acting, she was almost exclusively a stage actress. Celia's mother, Dinah Shtettin, was the second wife of Jacob Adler. The couple had met and married in London, and they arrived in the United States from there shortly before Celia's birth. They divorced when Celia was a young child, although they continued to work together in the theater. Stettin subsequently married the actor and playwright Sigmund Feinmann. Celia used her stepfather's last name when she was growing up but later changed her name to \\"Adler\\" for her stage career. Career After playing many child roles in the Yiddish theater, Adler distanced herself from the theater for a time during her teenage years, but then resumed her acting career with the encouragement of the actress Bertha Kalisch, with whom she co-starred in a production of Hermann Sudermann's play Heimat. She was associated with the Yiddish Art Theater movement of the 1920s and 1930s. She also gave one of the first theatrical portrayals of a Holocaust survivor, in Luther Adler's 1946 Broadway production of A Flag Is Born (written by Ben Hecht and featuring a 22-year-old Marlon Brando, Stella Adler's prize pupil in method acting). Adler, along with co-stars Paul Muni and Marlon Brando, refused to accept compensation above the Actor's Equity minimum wage because of her commitment to the cause of creating a Jewish State in Israel.Medoff, Rafael. \\"Ben Hecht's 'A Flag is Born': A Play That Changed History .\\" David S.

Another type of firearm referred to as a swivel gun was an early flintlock combination gun with two barrels that rotated along their axes to allow the shooter to switch between rifled and smoothbore barrels. Swivel guns should not be confused with pivot guns, which were far larger weapons mounted on a horizontal pivot, or screw guns, which are a mountain gun with a segmented barrel. An older term for the type is peterero (alternative spellings include \\"paterero\\" and \\"pederero\\"). The name was taken from the Spanish name for the gun, pedrero, a combination of the word piedra (stone) and the suffix -ero (-er), because stone was the first type of ammunition fired. Configuration Swivel guns are among the smallest types of cannon, typically measuring less than in length and with a bore diameter of up to . They can fire a variety of ammunition but were generally used to fire grapeshot and small caliber round shot.McLaughlin 2014, p. 280 They were aimed through the use of a wooden handle, somewhat similar in shape to a baseball bat, attached to the breech of the weapon. Most swivel guns were muzzleloaders, but there were some breech-loading swivel guns as early as the 14th century, making them among the first such examples of this type of weapon (see cetbang). Breech-loading swivel guns had a breech shaped like a beer mug, which the gunner would take by the handle and insert into the body of the swivel gun with the breech's opening facing forwards. The gunpowder and projectiles were loaded into the breech before it was inserted into the gun. If a number of breeches were prepared beforehand, the gunner could maintain a high rate of fire for a brief period simply by swapping out the used breech and replacing it with a freshly loaded one.Kenneth Chase, Firearms: A Global History to 1700, p. 143. Cambridge University Press, 2003. Applications Lynx Swivel guns were used principally aboard sailing ships, serving as short-range anti-personnel ordnance. They were not ship-sinking weapons, due to their small caliber and short range, but could do considerable damage to anyone caught in their line of fire. They were especially useful against deck- to-deck boarders, against approaching longboats bearing boarding parties, and against deck gun crews when ships were hull-to-hull. Due to their relatively small size, swivel guns were highly portable and could be moved around the deck of a ship quite easily (and certainly much more easily than other types of cannon). They could be mounted on vertical timbers (pillars) which were either part of the ship's structure or were firmly bolted to that structure along either side, which provided the gunner with a reasonably steady platform from which to fire. Their portability enabled them to be installed wherever they were most needed; whereas larger cannon were useless if they were on the wrong side of the ship, swivel guns could be carried across the deck to face the enemy. The small size of swivel guns enabled them to be used by a wide variety of vessels, including those too small to accommodate larger cannons, and also permitted their use on land; they were commonly issued to forts in North America in the 18th century, and Lewis and Clark took one with them on their famous expedition into the American interior in 1804.Michael Haynes, Lewis & Clark Tailor Made, Trail Worn: Army Life, Clothing & Weapons of the Corps of Discovery, p. 263. Farcountry Press, 2003. Swivel guns also had peaceful uses. They were used for signalling purposes and for firing salutes, and also found uses in whaling, where bow-mounted swivel guns were used to fire harpoons, and fowling, where swivel guns mounted on punts were used to shoot flocks of waterfowl (see also punt gun). Swivel guns were extensively used by the kingdoms and empires of Asia, particularly China, Korea, and kingdoms in Nusantara. The Majapahit conquest (1335-1350) was fought using breech-loading swivel guns called cetbang by the Majapahit navy, against more traditional boarding style warfare of other kingdoms in Nusantara. The first Chinese swivel guns were cast as early as 1520 after being introduced from Europe, and Korea followed suit by the 1560s. During the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592‚Äì1598), Korean naval forces used swivel guns and larger cannon to great effect in interdicting the invading Japanese forces.Kenneth Chase, Firearms: A Global History to 1700, p. 174-175.

A modern botanical garden exploring the theme of sustainability A domed city is a hypothetical structure that encloses a large urban area under a single roof. In most descriptions, the dome is airtight and pressurized, creating a habitat that can be controlled for air temperature, composition and quality, typically due to an external atmosphere (or lack thereof) that is inimical to habitation for one or more reasons. Domed cities have been a fixture of science fiction and futurology since the early 20th century, and may be situated on Earth, a moon or other planet. Origin It is not clear exactly when the concept of a domed city first appeared. The phrase \\"domed city\\" had come into use by the 19th century in a different sense, meaning a skyline with dome-topped buildings. One catalogue of early science fiction mentions the 1881 fantasy Three Hundred Years Hence by British author William Delisle Hay (not to be confused with an earlier novel of the same title, by Mary Griffith). Hay's book describes a future civilization where most of humanity lives in glass- domed cities beneath the sea, allowing the surface of the earth to be used primarily for agriculture. Several examples from the early 20th century are also listed. In fiction Authors used domed cities in response to many problems, sometimes to the benefit of the people living in them and sometimes not. The problems of air pollution and other environmental destruction are a common motive, particularly in stories of the middle to late 20th century. As in the Pure trilogy of books by Julianna Baggott. In some works, the domed city represents the last stand of a human race that is either dead or dying. The 1976 film Logan's Run shows both of these themes. The characters have a comfortable life within a domed city, but the city also serves to control the populace and to ensure that humanity never again outgrows its means. The domed city in fiction has been interpreted as a symbolic womb that both nourishes and protects humanity. Where other science fiction stories emphasize the vast expanse of the universe, the domed city places limits on its inhabitants, with the subtext that chaos will ensue if they interact with the world outside. In some works cities are getting \\"domed\\" to quarantine its inhabitants. Engineering proposals During the 1960s and 1970s, the domed city concept was widely discussed outside the confines of science fiction. In 1960, visionary engineer Buckminster Fuller described a 3 km geodesic dome spanning Midtown Manhattan that would regulate weather and reduce air pollution.Weird Science The New Yorker on Fuller dome over Manhattan A domed city was proposed in 1979 for Winooski, Vermont and in 2010 for Houston.Discovery Channel: A Dome over Houston In order to test whether an artificial closed ecological system was feasible, Biosphere 2 (a complex of interconnected domes and glass pyramids) was constructed in the late 1980s. Its original experiment housed eight people and remains the largest such system attempted to date. In 2010, a domed city known as Eco-city 2020 of 100,000 was proposed for the Mir mine in Siberia. In 2014, the ruler of Dubai announced plans for a climate-controlled domed city covering an area of 48 million square feet (4.5 square kilometers), but as of 2016, the project has been redesigned without the dome.

They also won a bronze medal at the 1994 Winter Olympics. Early life Dean grew up in Calverton, Nottinghamshire. When he was six, his mother left and his father remarried. Dean never talked about this with his father or stepmother, both of whom have died. He has regained contact with his mother.Piers Morgan's Life Stories, 8 March 2013 From 1974 to 1980, he was a police constable with Nottinghamshire Police. Skating career Christopher Dean began to skate at the age of 10 after he received a pair of skates as a Christmas present. His parents were keen ballroom dancers. At school he was captain of the football team and he saw ice skating as a sport that was athletic and graceful. Dean's first ice partner was Sandra Elson. They began skating together when he was 14 and competed as ice dancers for a few years under their instructor Len Sayward. However, despite becoming British Junior Dance champions, the team parted, as Dean and Elson did not get along well. Dean then agreed to try out Jayne Torvill, another skater at the Nottingham rink. The pair were first coached by Janet Sawbridge but in 1978 Betty Callaway became their coach. Dean left school at age 16 and joined the Nottingham Police Force in 1974. It was challenging for him to undergo police cadet training, as his schedule often clashed with his skating training sessions. Thus Torvill and Dean had to practise during his off-hours. These difficult times brought them closer and gave them a sense of discipline that was to prove vital throughout their career. By 1980 Torvill and Dean had progressed to not only become British National Dance Champions but were in medal contention in international competitions as well. It was then that Chris realised he could no longer balance his skating and police careers, and he resigned from the police force. Torvill soon left her job as well, this was made possible with a Nottingham City Council grant of ¬£42,000. Dean also served as the chief choreographer for the Torvill and Dean team. Torvill and Dean performing in 2011 Torvill and Dean's free program at the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo, performed to the music of Maurice Ravel's Bol√©ro, became world-famous. They received nine 6.0 marks for artistic impression, (three more for technical merit for a total of twelve 6.0 marks) the highest possible score and the only time ever that an all-perfect score was achieved. It was one of the most popular achievements in the history of British sport, watched by a British television audience of 24 million people. Since the time limit was four minutes and ten seconds and their music was four minutes 28 seconds, they moved their bodies to the music for 18 seconds before starting to skate. Torvill and Dean turned professional after their 1984 Olympic win. Under then existing Olympic Games rules as professionals they became ineligible to participate in Olympic competition.

He was well-recognized for his resonant voice, crisply descriptive style of play-by- play, and signature on-air exclamations \\"Go to war, Miss Agnes!\\" and \\"Ain't the beer cold!\\" Biography=Early life and career Thompson was born in Palmer, Massachusetts, and moved with his family to Reading, Pennsylvania, in 1927. He began his broadcasting career in 1939 at WRAW-AM in Reading, working there until 1942. After spending only a month at WKBN-AM in Youngstown, Ohio, that same year, he joined WIBG-AM in Philadelphia as an on-air announcer. His career was interrupted in October 1943, when he was drafted into the U.S. Army. Promoted to the rank of sergeant, he was sent to Europe aboard the Queen Mary in January 1945 and fought in the Battle of the Bulge. After an honorable discharge in August 1945, he returned to WIBG. For three years starting in 1946, he, along with Byrum Saam and Claude Haring, called all the home games of both Philadelphia professional baseball teams, the Athletics and Phillies.Thompson, Chuck & Beard, Gordon. Ain't the Beer Cold!. South Bend, Indiana: Diamond Communications, Inc., 1996. He also called Temple University football during this period. Career in Baltimore In 1949, Thompson was hired by the Gunther Brewing Company to be WITH-AM's play-by-play voice for both the International League Orioles and the Colts, at the time a member of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Despite being laid off following the 1951 IL season because the brewery felt no need for a salaried announcer, he joined WITH in order for him to continue doing the broadcasts. When the American League's St. Louis Browns moved to Baltimore, Maryland, and were rechristened the Orioles in 1954, his previous connections with Gunther prevented him from becoming a broadcaster for the franchise. The National Brewing Company had purchased the team's broadcast rights and hired Ernie Harwell as the lead voice, but still wanted Thompson to be part of the coverage. He agreed to work with Harwell on Orioles broadcasts on WCBM-AM and WMAR-TV in 1955. Two years later he joined Bob Wolff to call Washington Senators games on WWDC and WTOP-TV, succeeding Arch McDonald as a result of National Brewing's becoming the team's new sponsor. Thompson returned to broadcast Orioles games on both radio and television (WBAL-AM and WJZ-TV from 1962-1978, WFBR-AM from 1979-1982, and WMAR-TV from 1979-1987). He resigned from the radio broadcasts after the 1982 season and the death of longtime broadcast partner Bill O'Donnell. However, he remained on the television broadcasts until his first retirement after the 1987 season. The prime of his career was the 17 years he shared the broadcast booth with O'Donnell beginning in 1966. During that span, the pair would describe two World Series Championships (1966 and 1970), five American League Pennants (1966, 1969, 1970, 1971, and 1979), six A.L. Eastern Division titles (1969, 1970, 1971, 1973, 1974, and 1979), and only one losing season. Others who worked with Thompson on Orioles broadcasts included Frank Messer (1964-1967), Jim Karvellas (1968-1969), John Gordon (1970-1972), Brooks Robinson (1978-1987), and Tom Marr (1979-1982). Thompson was also the narrator of the official 1966 World Series highlight film jointly produced by both major leagues. Besides his baseball-related achievements, Thompson also called Colts football for many years, first on CBS television in the 1950s and '60s, and then alongside Vince Bagli on WCBM Radio from 1973 until the team's relocation to Indianapolis in 1984. From 1964‚Äì1969, he narrated the Colts' season review films produced by NFL Films, making on-camera appearances in the first two. The National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association named Thompson as Maryland Sportscaster of the Year for eight consecutive years from 1959 to 1966. National work Thompson's national television debut was in 1954 when he succeeded Ray Scott as the voice of the NFL's Saturday night Game of the Week on the DuMont Television Network, as well as that year's NFL Championship Game. Four years later, he teamed with Chris Schenkel to call the telecast of the legendary 1958 Championship Game on NBC. The announcers flipped a coin to determine play-by-play assignments for the two halves. Schenkel won the toss and chose the second half. Thompson ended up broadcasting the first-ever sudden-victory overtime in professional football history. Thompson also called the 1959 and 1964 Championship Games for NBC and CBS, respectively, and regular-season NFL games for the Mutual radio network. In 1988, he was among several veteran announcers who called some September NFL telecasts for NBC while many of the network's regular broadcasters were working that year's Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. Thompson also did baseball work for NBC, beginning with the Game of the Week in 1959 and 1960. He, along with Curt Gowdy, covered the Memorial Stadium legs of the World Series in 1966, 1970 and 1971, and conducted the victorious post-Series clubhouse interviews in 1966 and 1970. He is particularly remembered for his flawed but endearing call of Bill Mazeroski's championship-clinching home run to end the 1960 World Series, for which he was the play-by-play announcer for NBC Radio.(Audio) This event was replayed in full on an MLB radio special some years ago, during one of the players' strikes. The pitcher was actually Ralph Terry; Art Ditmar was warming up in the bullpen, and besides that error, Thompson just got caught up in the moment: > Well, a little while ago, when we mentioned that this one, in typical > fashion, was going right to the wire, little did we know‚Ä¶Art Ditmar > throws‚Äîhere's a swing and a high fly ball going deep to left, this may do > it!‚Ä¶Back to the wall goes Berra, it is‚Ä¶over the fence, home run, the Pirates > win!‚Ä¶(long pause for crowd noise)‚Ä¶Ladies and gentlemen, Mazeroski has hit a > one-nothing pitch over the left field fence at Forbes Field to win the 1960 > World Series for the Pittsburgh Pirates by a score of ten to nothing!‚Ä¶Once > again, that final score‚Ä¶The Pittsburgh Pirates, the 1960 world champions, > defeat the New York Yankees. The Pirates ten, and the Yankees NINE!... and > Forbes Field... is an insane asylum! In 1985, Thompson's Ditmar-Terry flub became a commercial hit, featured as an audio-over in a nostalgia-immersed Budweiser TV ad during that year's World Series. A libel lawsuit subsequently filed by Ditmar against Anheuser-Busch and its advertising agency for the commercial was ultimately rejected by a United States District Court. Later career Thompson came out of retirement in 1991 to work part-time on Orioles games for WBAL-AM when Jon Miller was away broadcasting ESPN Sunday Night Baseball. Failing eyesight caused by macular degeneration forced him to retire for good in 2000. He received the Ford C. Frick Award from the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in 1993. In January 2009, the American Sportscasters Association ranked Thompson 34th on its list of Top 50 Sportscasters of All Time.ASA's Top 50 Sportscasters of All Time Death Thompson, who lived in Lutherville, Maryland, at the time, died at Greater Baltimore Medical Center on March 6, 2005, after suffering a stroke. Catch phrase origins \\"Go to war, Miss Agnes!\\" was picked up from a golfing friend who never swore and whose putting failed to improve even after reading a book about it. Thompson explained the details in Curt Smith's Voices of the Game: > He was a great guy, very proper, and like any golfer, he had some real > frustrations. But instead of cussing, he'd come up with the phrase, 'Go to > war, Miss Agnes!' I didn't know what it meant, but don't feel bad ‚Äì he may > not have known. What I did know was that it sounded so funny. I picked it up > and used it to emphasize something big and exciting on the ball field, and > it just caught on ‚Äì with listeners, it snowballed. Thompson phased out the expression when the Vietnam War was protracted, although it was later picked up by North Carolina Tar Heels football and basketball broadcaster Woody Durham. \\"Ain't the beer cold!\\" became the title of Thompson's autobiography, in which he described the story behind the exclamation: > For years in my game broadcasts I had used the expression, 'Ain't the beer > cold!' when things were going especially well for the home team. I got that > phrase from Bob Robertson, a spotter who worked with me on Baltimore Colts > football games (that were sponsored by the makers of National Beer). > Eventually, I received lots of mail from people in the Carolinas, the area > sometimes referred to as the Bible Belt. The listeners felt they shouldn't > have to put up with my ad libs about beer with all the beer advertisements > they were already exposed to, and I thought they had a legitimate beef. So, > I stopped using the line sometime in the 1970s.

The city has a population of 21,659 (2015) and an area of 1458 km2. The municipality is 30 km away from the state's capital, S√£o Lu√≠s. Founded by French explorers in the 16th century, Alc√¢ntara was later conquered by the Portuguese, who used the small village as a base to take S√£o Lu√≠s from the Dutch in 1646. The city was declared by the Brazilian government as a National Historical Patrimony. The city's economy is based mainly on tourism and fishing. The climate is favorable, characterized by two well-defined seasons: a rainy season from January to June, and a dry season from July to December. The annual average temperature is 26.5 ¬∞C, and the wind blows predominantly from the east at an average speed of 12 m/s. Helton da Silva Arruda, a famous Brazilian goalkeeper, was born in the city. The municipality contains a small part of the Baixada Maranhense Environmental Protection Area, a sustainable use conservation unit created in 1991 that has been a Ramsar Site since 2000. Rocket Launch Center The Brazilian Space Agency maintains a launch site in Alc√¢ntara. The Alc√¢ntara Launch Center is located in the historic city of Alc√¢ntara, close to city of Sao Luis, capital of the State of Maranh√£o. The geographic coordinates are 2¬∞18‚Ä≤S and 44¬∞22‚Ä≤W. The Launch Center comprises the Cyclone-4 Launch Site, under the responsibility of ACS, and a set of facilities under the responsibility of the Brazilian Air Force (FAB), and the Brazilian Space Agency (AEB), which include general infrastructure and dedicated complexes for the launching of the Brazilian Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV). The overall infrastructure consists of an airport with a 2,600 meter-long runway, a Command and Control Sector equipped with telemetry, communication, meteorology, radar and electricity supply systems, and an Administrative center with hotels, a hospital and administrative buildings. The general infrastructure also includes roads, and a project for a seaport which is currently underway. Technical Complex The main components of the Cyclone-4 launch site are the Technical Complex and the Launch Complex. The Satellite Assembly Integration and Testing Building is located in the Technical Complex. This building has clean rooms for receiving, testing, fuelling and satellite integration to the launch vehicle payload unit. This building is connected to the Launch Vehicle Assembly, Integration and Testing Building, where the launch vehicle parts are received and tested, and the entire vehicle assembled. The integration of the payload unit, already with the satellite, to the launch vehicle is performed in this building. The Launch Complex receives the Cyclone-4 launch vehicle horizontally by a railway that connects the launch complex to the technical complex. The launch vehicle is tilted to the vertical position, and the final tests are performed automatically. The launch complex is designed so that the launch vehicle fuelling and launching are performed automatically, thus allowing a safe and reliable operation. On August 22, 2003, an accident occurred when a VLS-1 rocket accidentally exploded, killing 21 Brazilian technicians.

Yoo is the Emanuel S. Heller Professor of Law at the University of California, Berkeley. Yoo became known in the mid-2000s for his legal opinions concerning executive power, warrantless wiretapping, and the Geneva Conventions while serving in the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) of the Department of Justice, during the George W. Bush administration. In 2009, President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13491, rescinding the legal guidance on interrogation authored by Yoo and his successors in the Office of Legal Counsel after September 11, 2001. In 2008 and 2014 some individuals and groups called for the investigation and prosecution of Yoo under various anti-torture and anti-war crimes statutes. Early life and education Born in Seoul, South Korea, Yoo immigrated to the United States with his family when he was a young child and grew up in Philadelphia. He attended high school at Episcopal Academy and graduated in 1985. After high school, Yoo went to Harvard University, where he majored in American history and was a resident of Winthrop House. He graduated from Harvard in 1989 with an A.B. summa cum laude. He then studied law at the Yale Law School, where he was a member of the Yale Law Journal. He graduated from Yale with a Juris Doctor degree in 1992. Yoo was admitted to practice law in Pennsylvania in 1993.  Career  Yoo was a law clerk for Judge Laurence H. Silberman of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. He also served as general counsel of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Yoo has been a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law since 1993. He has written two books on presidential power and the war on terrorism, and many articles in scholarly journals and newspapers. He has held the Fulbright Distinguished Chair in Law at the University of Trento and has been a visiting law professor at the Free University of Amsterdam, the University of Chicago, and Chapman University School of Law. Since 2003, Yoo has also been a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington. He writes a monthly column, entitled \\"Closing Arguments\\", for The Philadelphia Inquirer. He wrote and continues to write academic books including Crisis and Command.  Bush administration  Yoo has been principally associated with his work from 2001 to 2003 in the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) under Attorney General John Ashcroft during the George W. Bush Administration. Yoo's expansive view of presidential power led to a close relationship with Vice President Dick Cheney's office. He played an important role in developing a legal justification for the Bush administration's policy in the war on terrorism, arguing that prisoner of war status under the Geneva Conventions does not apply to \\"enemy combatants\\" captured during the war in Afghanistan and held at the Guant√°namo Bay detention camp. = Torture memos = In what was known as the Bybee memo, Yoo asserted that executive authority during wartime allows waterboarding and other forms of torture, which were euphemistically referred to as \\"enhanced interrogation techniques\\". Yoo's memos narrowly defined torture and American habeas corpus obligations. They authorized what were called enhanced interrogation techniques and were issued to the CIA. Yoo argued in his legal opinion that the president was not bound by the War Crimes Act. Yoo's legal opinions were not shared by everyone within the Bush Administration. Secretary of State Colin Powell strongly opposed what he saw as an invalidation of the Geneva Conventions, while U.S. Navy general counsel Alberto Mora campaigned internally against what he saw as the \\"catastrophically poor legal reasoning\\" and dangerous extremism of Yoo's opinions. In December 2003, Yoo's memo on permissible interrogation techniques, also known as the Bybee memo, was repudiated as legally unsound by the OLC, then under the direction of Jack Goldsmith. In June 2004, another of Yoo's memos on interrogation techniques was leaked to the press, after which it was repudiated by Goldsmith and the OLC. On March 14, 2003, Yoo wrote a legal opinion memo in response to the General Counsel of the Department of Defense, in which he concluded that torture not allowed by federal law could be used by interrogators in overseas areas. Yoo cited an 1873 Supreme Court ruling, on the Modoc Indian Prisoners, where the Supreme Court had ruled that Modoc Indians were not lawful combatants, so they could be shot, on sight, to justify his assertion that individuals apprehended in Afghanistan could be tortured. Yoo's contribution to these memos has remained a source of controversy following his departure from the Justice Department; he was called to testify before the House Judiciary Committee in 2008 in defense of his role. The Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) began investigating Yoo's work in 2004 and in July 2009 completed a report that was sharply critical of his legal justification for waterboarding and other interrogation techniques. The OPR report cites testimony Yoo gave to Justice Department investigators in which he claims that the \\"president's war-making authority was so broad that he had the constitutional power to order a village to be 'massacred.'\\" The OPR report concluded that Yoo had \\"committed 'intentional professional misconduct' when he advised the CIA it could proceed with waterboarding and other aggressive interrogation techniques against Al Qaeda suspects,\\" although the recommendation that he be referred to his state bar association for possible disciplinary proceedings was overruled by David Margolis, another senior Justice department lawyer. In December 2005, Doug Cassel, a law professor from the University of Notre Dame, asked Yoo, \\"If the President deems that he's got to torture somebody, including by crushing the testicles of the person's child, there is no law that can stop him?\\", to which Yoo replied, \\"No treaty.\\" Cassel followed up with \\"Also no law by Congress‚Äîthat is what you wrote in the August 2002 memo,\\" to which Yoo replied, \\"I think it depends on why the President thinks he needs to do that.\\" =War crimes accusations= Glenn Greenwald has argued that Yoo could potentially be indicted for crimes against the laws and customs of war, the crime of torture, and/or crimes against humanity. Criminal proceedings to this end have begun in Spain: in a move that could have led to an extradition request, Judge Baltasar Garz√≥n in March 2009 referred a case against Yoo to the chief prosecutor. The Spanish Attorney General recommended against pursuing the case. On November 14, 2006, invoking the principle of command responsibility, the German attorney Wolfgang Kaleck filed a complaint with the Attorney General of Germany (Generalbundesanwalt) against Yoo, along with 13 others, for his alleged complicity in torture and other crimes against humanity at Abu Ghraib in Iraq and Guant√°namo Bay. Kaleck acted on behalf of 11 alleged victims of torture and other human rights abuses, as well as about 30 human rights activists and organizations. The co- plaintiffs to the war crimes prosecution included Adolfo P√©rez Esquivel, Mart√≠n Almada, Theo van Boven, Sister Dianna Ortiz, and Veterans for Peace. Responding to the so-called \\"torture memoranda,\\" Scott Horton noted > the possibility that the authors of these memoranda counseled the use of > lethal and unlawful techniques, and therefore face criminal culpability > themselves. That, after all, is the teaching of United States v. Altst√∂tter, > the Nuremberg case brought against German Justice Department lawyers whose > memoranda crafted the basis for implementation of the infamous 'Night and > Fog Decree'. Legal scholars speculated shortly thereafter that the case has little chance of successfully making it through the German court system. Jordan Paust of the University of Houston Law Center concurred with supporters of prosecution and in early 2008 criticized the US Attorney General Michael Mukasey's refusal to investigate and/or prosecute anyone who relied on these legal opinions: > [I]t is legally and morally impossible for any member of the executive > branch to be acting lawfully or within the scope of his or her authority > while following OLC opinions that are manifestly inconsistent with or > violative of the law. General Mukasey, just following orders is no defense! In 2009, the Spanish Judge Baltasar Garz√≥n Real launched an investigation of Yoo and five others (known as the Bush Six) for war crimes. On April 13, 2013, the Russian Federation banned Yoo and several others from entering the country because of alleged human rights violations. The list was a direct response to the so-called Magnitsky list revealed by the United States the day before. Russia stated that Yoo was among those responsible for \\"the legalization of torture\\" and \\"unlimited detention\\". After the December 2014 release of the executive summary of the Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture, Erwin Chemerinsky, then the dean of the University of California, Irvine School of Law, called for the prosecution of Yoo for his role in authoring the Torture Memos as \\"conspiracy to violate a federal statute\\". On May 12, 2012, the Kuala Lumpur War Crimes Commission found Yoo, along with former President Bush, former Vice President Cheney, and several other senior members of the Bush administration, guilty of war crimes in absentia. The trial heard \\"harrowing witness accounts from victims of torture who suffered at the hands of US soldiers and contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan\\". = Warrantless wiretapping = Yoo provided a legal opinion backing the Bush Administration's warrantless wiretapping program. Yoo authored the October 23, 2001 memo asserting that the President had sufficient power to allow the NSA to monitor the communications of US citizens on US soil without a warrant (known as the warrantless wiretap program) because the Fourth Amendment does not apply. As another memo says in a footnote, \\"Our office recently concluded that the Fourth Amendment had no application to domestic military operations.\\" That interpretation is used to assert that the normal mandatory requirement of a warrant, under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, could be ignored. In a 2006 book and a 2007 law review article, Yoo defended President Bush's terrorist surveillance program, arguing that \\"the TSP represents a valid exercise of the President's Commander-in-Chief authority to gather intelligence during wartime\\". He claimed that critics of the program misunderstand the separation of powers between the President and Congress in wartime because of a failure to understand the differences between war and crime, and a difficulty in understanding the new challenges presented by a networked, dynamic enemy such as Al Qaeda. \\"Because the United States is at war with Al Qaeda, the President possesses the constitutional authority as Commander-in-Chief to engage in warrantless surveillance of enemy activity.\\" In a Wall Street Journal opinion piece in July 2009, Yoo wrote it was \\"absurd to think that a law like FISA should restrict live military operations against potential attacks on the United States.\\" =Presidential emergency action documents (PEADS)= During an interview on CSPAN in August 2020, Yoo defended the use of enhanced executive privileges within the Trump administration. He stated in a concurrent interview on CBS with Ted Koppel that his support for Trump may be guided by his possible reading of PEADs (Presidential Emergency Action Documents) as further supplementing his support for enhanced executive privilege during war-time and other national emergencies.CSPAN. Interview with John Yoo on Book-Tv from August 15, 2020. Commentary=Unitary executive theory Yoo suggested that since the primary task of the President during a time of war is protecting U.S. citizens, the President has inherent authority to subordinate independent government agencies, and plenary power to use force abroad. Yoo contends that the Congressional check on Presidential war-making power comes from its power of the purse. He says that the President, and not the Congress or courts, has sole authority to interpret international treaties such as the Geneva Conventions \\"because treaty interpretation is a key feature of the conduct of foreign affairs\\". His positions on executive power are controversial because the theory can be interpreted as holding that the President's war powers afford him executive privileges which exceed the bounds which other scholars associate with the President's war powers., Vanderbilt University His positions on the unitary executive are controversial as well because they are seen as an excuse to advance a conservative deregulatory agenda; the unitary executive theory says that every president is able to roll back any regulation passed by previous presidents, and it came to prominence in the Reagan administration as a \\"legal strategy that could enable the administration to gain control of the independent regulatory agencies that were seen as impeding the ... agenda of deregulating business.\\" Following his tenure as an appointee of the George W. Bush administration, Yoo criticized certain views on the separation of powers doctrine as allegedly being historically inaccurate and problematic for the global war on terrorism. For instance, he wrote, \\"We are used to a peacetime system in which Congress enacts the laws, the president enforces them, and the courts interpret them. In wartime, the gravity shifts to the executive branch.\\" In 1998 Yoo criticized what he characterized as an imperial use of executive power by the Clinton administration. In an opinion piece in the WSJ, he argued that the Clinton administration misused the privilege to protect the personal, rather than official, activities of the President, such as in the Monica Lewinsky affair. At the time, Yoo also criticized President Clinton for contemplating defiance of a judicial order. He suggested that Presidents could act in conflict with the Supreme Court, but that such measures were justified only during emergencies. In 2000 Yoo strongly criticized what he viewed as the Clinton administration's use of powers of what he termed the \\"Imperial Presidency\\". He said it undermined \\"democratic accountability and respect for the law\\".John Yoo, Chapter 12: \\"The Imperial President Abroad\\"; The Rule of Law in the Wake of Clinton, p. 159, edited by Roger Pilon, Cato Institute, 2000. . Yet, Yoo has defended President Clinton, for his decision to use force abroad without congressional authorization. He wrote in The Wall Street Journal on March 15, 1999, that Clinton's decision to attack Serbia was constitutional. He then criticized Democrats in Congress for not suing Clinton as they had sued presidents Bush and Reagan to stop the use of force abroad.  Trump administration  In 2019, on Fox news, Yoo made the comment \\"Some might call that espionage\\" when discussing Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council. Vindman served for over two decades in the United States Army and was awarded a Purple Heart after being injured in an IED attack while serving in Iraq. Vindman was set to testify in front of Congress the next day about Trump requesting that the Ukrainian President start an investigation into his political rival Joe Biden. Yoo subsequently said \\"I really regret the choice of words\\" and that he had been referring to Ukrainian officials rather than Vindman. In 2020, Yoo praised Trump as a \\"constitutional conservative.\\" He wrote a 2020 book about Trump, titled, Defender in Chief: Donald Trump's Fight for Presidential Power. Federal tort suit On January 4, 2008, Jos√© Padilla, a U.S. citizen convicted of terrorism, and his mother sued John Yoo in the U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (Case Number 08-cv-00035-JSW), known as Padilla v. Yoo. The complaint sought $1 in damages based on the alleged torture of Padilla, attributed to the authorization by Yoo's torture memoranda. Judge Jeffrey White allowed the suit to proceed, rejecting all but one of Yoo's immunity claims. Padilla's lawyer says White's ruling could have a broad effect for all detainees. Soon after his appointment in October 2003 as chief of the Office of Legal Counsel, DOJ, Jack Goldsmith withdrew Yoo's torture memoranda. The Padilla complaint, on page 20, cited Goldsmith's 2007 book The Terror Presidency in support of its case. In it Goldsmith had claimed that the legal analysis in Yoo's torture memoranda was incorrect and that there was widespread opposition to the memoranda among some lawyers in the Justice Department. Padilla's attorney used this information in the lawsuit, saying that Yoo caused Padilla's damages by authorizing his alleged torture by his memoranda. While the District Court ruled in favor of Padilla, the case was appealed by Yoo in June 2010. On May 2, 2012, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that Yoo had qualified immunity at the time of his memos (2001‚Äì2003), because certain issues had not then been settled legally by the U.S. Supreme Court. Based on the Supreme Court's decision in Ashcroft v. al- Kidd (2011), the Appeals Court unanimously ruled against Padilla, saying that, when he was held as a detainee, it had not been established that an enemy combatant had the \\"same constitutional protections\\" as a convicted prisoner or suspect, and that his treatment had not been legally established at the time as torture. Retired Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, chief of staff to General Colin Powell in the Persian Gulf War and while Powell was Secretary of State in the Bush Administration, has said of Yoo and other administration figures responsible for these decisions: > Haynes, Feith, Yoo, Bybee, Gonzales and‚Äîat the apex‚ÄîAddington, should never > travel outside the US, except perhaps to Saudi Arabia and Israel. They broke > the law; they violated their professional ethical code. In the future, some > government may build the case necessary to prosecute them in a foreign > court, or in an international court. Office of Professional Responsibility report The Department of Justice's Office of Professional Responsibility concluded in a 261-page report in July 2009 that Yoo committed \\"intentional professional misconduct\\" when he \\"knowingly failed to provide a thorough, objective, and candid interpretation of the law\\", and it recommended a referral to the Pennsylvania Bar for disciplinary action. But David Margolis, a career Justice attorney, countermanded the recommended referral in a January 2010 memorandum. While Margolis was careful to avoid \\"an endorsement of the legal work,\\" which he said was \\"flawed\\" and \\"contained errors more than minor\\", concluding that Yoo had exercised \\"poor judgment\\", he did not find \\"professional misconduct\\" sufficient to authorize OPR \\"to refer its findings to the state bar disciplinary authorities\\". Yoo contended that the OPR had shown \\"rank bias and sheer incompetence\\", intended to \\"smear my reputation\\", and that Margolis \\"completely rejected its recommendations\\". Although stopping short of referral to the bar, Margolis had also written: > [Yoo's and Bybee's] memoranda represent an unfortunate chapter in the > history of the Office of Legal Counsel. While I have declined to adopt OPR's > findings of misconduct, I fear that John Yoo's loyalty to his own ideology > and convictions clouded his view of his obligation to his client and led him > to author opinions which reflected his own extreme, although sincerely held, > views of executive power while speaking for an institutional client. Margolis's decision not to refer Yoo to the bar for discipline was criticized by numerous commentators. Publications Yoo's writings and areas of interest have fallen into three broad areas: American foreign relations; the Constitution's separation of powers and federalism; and international law. In foreign relations, Yoo has argued that the original understanding of the Constitution gives the President the authority to use armed force abroad without congressional authorization, subject to Congress's power of the purse; that treaties do not generally have domestic legal force without implementing legislation; and that courts are functionally ill-suited to intervene in foreign policy disputes between the President and Congress. With the separation of powers, Yoo has argued that each branch of government has the authority to interpret the Constitution for itself. In international law, Yoo has written that the rules governing the use of force must be understood to allow nations to engage in armed intervention to end humanitarian disasters, rebuild failed states, and stop terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Yoo's academic work includes his analysis of the history of judicial review in the U.S. Constitution. Yoo's book, The Powers of War and Peace: The Constitution and Foreign Affairs after 9/11, was praised in an Op- Ed in The Washington Times, written by Nicholas J. Xenakis, an assistant editor at The National Interest. It was quoted by Senator Joe Biden during the Senate hearings for then-U.S. Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito, as Biden \\"pressed Alito to denounce John Yoo's controversial defense of presidential initiative in taking the nation to war\\". Yoo is known as an opponent of the Chemical Weapons Convention. During 2012 and 2014, Yoo published two books with Oxford University Press. Taming Globalization was co-authored with Julian Ku in 2012, and Point of Attack was published under his single authorship in 2014. His 2017 book Striking Power: How Cyber, Robots, and Space Weapons Change the Rules for War is co-authored with by Jeremy Rabkin. Yoo's latest book, Defender in Chief: Donald Trump's Fight for Presidential Power, was published in July 2020. Bibliography   * Defender in Chief: Donald Trump's Fight for Presidential Power, 2020.

A serving of tobiko can contain several pieces, each having a different color. When prepared as sashimi, it may be presented on avocado halves or wedges. Tobiko is used in the creation of many other Japanese dishes. Often, it is used as an ingredient in California rolls.

The Hasty Pudding is the oldest theatrical organization in the United States and the third oldest in the world, behind only the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise and the Oberammergau Passion Players. The Hasty Pudding Theatricals was described by John Wheelwright in 1897 as a \\"kindly association of men of all ages in a gay evening of simple enjoyment.\\" It is a comedy show. History Formed in 1795 as an artistic-minded fraternity, the Hasty Pudding was formed to \\"cultivate the social affections and cherish the feelings of friendship & patriotism [...]\\". Soon after, Pudding members began hosting mock trials of such phenomena as timely Harvard presidents and the study of mathematics. On December 13, 1844, the Pudding put up its first full performance, of a well-known tragic burlesque entitled Bombastes Furioso. After a period of producing popular comedies written by established playwrights, students at Harvard who were members of the Pudding began to write their own shows, starting with a production of Dido and Aeneas written by Owen Wister in 1882. It has performed a production every year since, except two years during World War I and two years during World War II. Previous members of Hasty Pudding have included John Adams, John Quincy Adams, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, J.P. Morgan, Oliver Wendell Holmes, William Randolph Hearst, lyricist Alan Jay Lerner, Oscar winner Jack Lemmon, humorist Andy Borowitz, artist Henry Ives Cobb, Jr., actress Rashida Jones, and former Massachusetts governor William Weld. Although women were a part of the company in the role of costumers for many years prior to this, In 1948, Felisa Vanoff (1925‚Äì2014) became the first female choreographer of the company. In 1978, Diane Nabatoff became the first female Producer of the show. In 2009, Megan Amram and Alexandra Petri became the first all-female team to write the show. Although the cast of the show had traditionally been all-male, on January 25, 2018, then-President Amira Weeks announced that the cast would officially go co-ed beginning with the company's 171st production. However, the technical, band, creative, and business boards had also historically been co-ed. The 171st Hasty Pudding Show, entitled France France France Revolution, marked the first ever show with women in the cast. Under the healm of then- President Grace Ramsey and Cast Vice President David Lynch, the cast was evenly divided, with six men and six women; furthermore, sticking to Hasty Pudding tradition, the gender of the actor was not necessarily taken into account whilst casting the show (in fact, 8 of the performers were in drag, and 4 were not). The show was well reviewed and, since, the cast has been constructed without taking gender into account. Each spring, the Pudding's Theatricals holds a 5-week run in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and then tours to New York City and Bermuda. The Pudding is, maybe paradoxically, both a museum for antique theatrical practices and a magnet or training ground for innovative new talents. On the one hand its deliberately retro theatrical trappings (a once all-male cast; all-live pit orchestra with no computers or synthesizers; silly plots full of crude jokes, low-tech production values, collegiate humor and anachronistic puns) seem to preserve a museum-piece approach to musical theater. Yet for decades the Pudding has been incubating new talents at a steadily increasing rate, and is often compared in this way to other influential collegiate theatre groups such as Carnegie Mellon University's Scotch'n'Soda Theatre. Pudding graduates are leaders in the fields of writing, directing, and performing in theater, television, movies and the other arts. At least three winners of the prestigious annual Ed Kleban Award for achievement in lyric writing have each been Pudding graduates. Pudding librettist Mark O'Donnell won a Tony Award in 2003 for co-authoring the book for Hairspray. He also co-authored the book for the Broadway musical Cry-Baby; its lyrics were penned by fellow Pudding alum David Javerbaum, who has since won 13 Emmy Awards, including 11 as head writer for The Daily Show‚Äîwhich also featured comedian Mo Rocca, a former Pudding librettist and President. Pudding actor Jerry Colker won the Drama Desk Award for authoring the book for the Off-Broadway musical Three Guys Naked From the Waist Down. Actress Rashida Jones (seen in Parks and Recreation, The Office, Boston Public, and the film I Love You, Man) co-composed the score of the show during her senior year. Paris Barclay wrote two Pudding shows and is now an Emmy- winning director and producer for dozens of film and television projects including NYPD Blue, Sons of Anarchy and Glee, and in 2013 was elected President of the Directors Guild of America. Pudding actor and composer Laurence O'Keefe wrote the music and lyrics for the Off-Broadway shows Bat Boy: The Musical and Heathers: The Musical. O'Keefe co-wrote the score to the Broadway musical Legally Blonde with his wife, Pudding librettist Nell Benjamin, who herself wrote the award-winning play The Explorers Club and is currently collaborating with Tina Fey on the musical adaptation of the film Mean Girls. Pudding bookwriter Mark O'Keefe co-wrote and co-produced the movies Bruce Almighty and Click. Pudding librettist Megan Amram became famous shortly after graduating for her comic Twitter feed and now writes for television shows like Parks and Recreation and Silicon Valley, and her co- writer Alexandra Petri now writes a regular column for the Washington Post, a newspaper. BJ Averell, a Pudding actor alumnus, was a Grand Prize winner of The Amazing Race and is also an accomplished sea captain. John Berman, a Pudding actor and President, is now a news anchor for CNN.

It is not clear whether the dish was originally a staple or a dessert, but it is now served for dessert at the banquets thrown by the Pudding, such as opening night celebrations and the annual 'roasts' for their Man/Woman of the Year (see below). Honorary awards The society is notable for their annual selection of famous entertainers as Woman of the Year (since 1951) and Man of the Year (since 1967). These awards are usually treated with great seriousness by the honorees, who, since the unanticipated personal appearance of Jane Fonda to accept her award in 1961, always attend the awards ceremony, and are treated to a celebratory \\"roast,\\" and a parade.  Symbols  Over the course of its rich history, the Hasty Pudding Theatricals has adopted many significant symbols. The Hasty Pudding Theatricals has two official logos. The first is a sphinx holding a pudding pot. The second is a pudding pot depicted hanging over a fire. The Hasty Pudding Theatricals main color is a deep blue, though: crimson is also used due to its ties with Harvard University; green due to its connection with the Harvard Krokodiloes, an all-male A cappella group on campus; and yellow due to its connection with the Hasty Pudding Club, a social organization on campus. The shade of yellow used by the club is an ode to the color of traditional hasty pudding. The Hasty Pudding Theatricals, Hasty Pudding Club, and Harvard Krokodiloes are all organizations of the Hasty Pudding Institute of 1770 and share the same meeting space and social events on Harvard's campus.  Mottos  Concordia Discors is the official motto of the Hasty Pudding, literally meaning: Discordant Harmony, or organized chaos, in English.

John Henry Twachtman, J. Alden Weir, and Childe Hassam were the driving forces behind the organization. Dissatisfied with the conservatism of the American art establishment, the three artists recruited seven others from Boston, New York City, and elsewhere on the East Coast, with the intention of creating an exhibition society that valued their view of originality, imagination, and exhibition quality. The Ten achieved popular and critical success,‚ÄúTen American Painters: The First Exhibition, Catalogue of the Pictures, from the Thomas Wilmer Dewing and Dewing Family Papers - Image and Media Gallery  Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution.‚Äù Accessed September 16, 2015. http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/items/detail/ten-american-painters- first-exhibition-catalogue-pictures-14281. and lasted two decades before dissolving. Foundation In America, popular painting styles usually originated on the east coast in cities like New York and Boston. The Ten continued a tradition of artists forming new groups in reaction to a lack of support from existing artists' groups. Thus, the National Academy of Design (founded in 1825 by students dissatisfied by the conservatism of the older American Academy of the Fine Arts) eventually became too conservative to suit the artists who in 1877 initiated the Society of American Artists so they could meet and exhibit their work as a collective. The Ten American Painters was born from this group in 1898, when Twachtman, Weir, and Hassam found the Society hostile to the Impressionist style they had adopted. Leaving the group was considered a bold move by the general public, but the Society of American Artists felt that it was easier to let the members that were leaving go than appease them. Impressionism Impressionism was a French art movement that emerged in the 1870s, and was picked up by American painters towards the end of the 19th century. Painters like Edgar Degas, Claude Monet and Auguste Renoir are generally considered the masters of the impressionist movement. An Impressionist painting will often use small dabs of color in order to make the painting distinguishable from afar, but indistinguishable from up close.‚ÄúImpressionism.‚Äù Accessed September 21, 2015. http://www.artmovements.co.uk/impressionism.htm. Members The founding members of The Ten were Frank W. Benson, Joseph Rodefer DeCamp, Thomas Wilmer Dewing, Childe Hassam, Willard Leroy Metcalf, Robert Reid, Edward Simmons, Edmund C. Tarbell, John Henry Twachtman, and J. Alden Weir. All were former members of the Society of American Artists. Winslow Homer declined an invitation to join the group; Abbott Handerson Thayer accepted membership but withdrew before the group's first exhibition. After J. H. Twachtman died in 1902, William Merritt Chase joined in his place. Unanimous approval was required to admit a new member to the society. It was also decided that there would never be less than ten members active for the group to remain as one. For twenty years The Ten exhibited in New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and other American cities. After this it dissolved due to death in its ranks and lack of public interest.

It was written by Barbara Kesel, and penciled by a number of artists including Joshua Middleton and Steve McNiven. Meridian ran for 44 issues, from July of 2000 to April of 2004. Storyline details Meridian, the series' namesake, is one of many island city-states upon the world of Demetria. At some point in the world's history, a great natural cataclysm threw massive chunks of earth into the sky, creating the current system of floating islands. The islands, as well as the airships crucial to trade and transport, defy gravity due to the mysterious properties of a certain 'ore' which is not named. Each island is headed by a Minister, who has more or less monarchic power over their respective island, and while many communities still survive on the surface, contact and trade between the surface and the islands is rare. The main character of the series is Sephie, the daughter of Turos, the Minister of Meridian. Her childhood friend Jad Takarty is in love with her. Her father dies at the beginning of the series, and Sephie becomes Minister of Meridian, acquiring at the same time a mysterious Sigil, a mark upon her forehead, which grants her an array of powers. Gradually, she learns to use it to allow her to fly, to heal others, to repair things, and in a handful of other ways. However, her Uncle Ilahn, Minister of Cadador, another of the floating island city-states, has a Sigil as well, which allows him to destroy things and teleport. He attempts to use his powers, and his significant political influence, to seize Meridian from Sephie's control, and to create an economic and industrial empire, demanding tribute from other islands, if not conquering them outright. Sephie sets out to stop him. After learning more about her powers and her family's past, acquiring equipment and support, and meeting new friends and allies, she sets about perpetrating piracy upon her uncle's trade routes and fights him directly on a number of occasions. As with most of the core CrossGen titles, Meridian crosses over into the other titles to some extent, and into the underlying 'uberplot' that connects all the core titles together. While not fully central to the conflict between Sephie and her uncle Ilahn, there are appearances by members of The First who are the Gods of the CrossGen universe, as well as by Samandahl Rey, the main hero of the title Sigil, and others. In the end, Sephie and Ilahn join the heroes (and villains) of the other core titles to fight an enemy called \\"the Negation\\" in a limited series called Negation War. Negation War was left unfinished when CrossGen filed for bankruptcy in the middle of 2004. The background of the series is expanded upon in CrossGen Chronicles #3, which concerns the early life of Turos and Ilahn.

It was founded in 1958 as a small library with a few books on economics, currently its collection has about 2'000.000 works. Today the library has been expanded and occupies two entire city blocks spanning about 45,000m¬≤ (nearly 54,000 sq. yards). Its collection has grown to become the country's premier library and has come to be considered the most important public library in Latin America, and one of the most visited in the world. It has over 1.1 million books and seating for 1900 readers; it received 6.7 million visitors in 2008. The library is named after the lawyer and businessman Luis Angel Arango, the general director (Governor) of the \\"Banco de la Republica\\" in Colombia from 1947 to 1957, and a champion of culture and literature for all. The library is part of the cultural affairs wing of Colombian Central Bank (Banco de la Rep√∫blica), Banrepcultural network, which today runs 23 additional libraries, cultural centers and museums across Colombia. Notable Books and documents of its collection include, multimedia documentary materials of the Colombian Constitution, rare books and manuscripts purchased from private collections from around the world, as well as the Luis L√≥pez de Mesa perodicals archive (Hemeroteca) which is an extensive newspaper archive collection. The Library also offers a collection of audio-visual materials. Additionally, there is a Concert Hall, art exhibits, reprography service, a cafeteria and parking facilities. It centralizes the \\"digital collection\\" and the \\"Virtual Library\\" (Biblioteca Virtual del Banco de la Rep√∫blica) a growing repository of digitized content from the network of libraries of the Banco de la Rep√∫blica. The Botero Museum is housed in one of the contiguous buildings purchased for the expansion of the library. The main entrance features a bronze statue of Athena or Minerva, Greek goddess of wisdom, the arts, trade and defense. There is also a bookstore in the first floor of the library. The bookstore specializes in books about Colombia, scientific magazines, and literature related to Colombia and its values.  History  The first library of the bank, was established in 1932. It was located on the second floor of the Pedro A. L√≥pez building in the bank headquarters in the Avenida Jim√©nez. Its collection comprised documents on economic, legal and fiscal issues and issues pertaining the activity of the central bank, with the archives from the currency council of the Banco de la Rep√∫blica. The bank acquired several private libraries, objects and documents of historic and patrimonial value to the Colombian nation as well as receiving donated private collections. Consequently, the bank conditioned a room then with only 25 people seating capacity and limited viewing time (open then from 2:00pm to 4:30pm Monday through Friday) to the general public. In 1945 the bank purchases the largest collection to date the Laureano Garc√≠a Otiz personal library. left Two city blocks and several buildings comprise the cultural complex of which the Biblioteca Luis √Ångel Arango Library is part. The graph shows the south and north block. Graph created by ElTiempo.com on April 2006. After the bank moved its headquarters to a new building, General Director, Luis √Ångel Arango, sought to relocate the library. The Old Mint House (Casa de la Moneda) was nearly destroyed in the Bogotazo riots and it was decided that the new expanded location of the library would be the remodeled and reconditioned building. The bank purchased the adjacent buildings to the Old Mint House and the block north from it. In all two entire city blocks (Manzana Sur y Manzana Norte), each were unified and communicated internally. For the new expanded building of the library the architect firm was Esguerra Saenz Urdaneta Samper in three separate expansions. Some of the buildings that make up the library are, The Vengoechea building, an art deco building (also described as \\"Arquitectura Racionalista\\") where administrative offices are located, the Republican House (Casa Republicana) which houses the Museum of Religious Art, the Colonial House (Old Mint House, Casa de la Moneda), the Old Bishop Palace (Palacio Arzobispal) now the Botero Museum of Pastiche architecture and the two modern sections. The first opened in 1958 when the new location opened, currently the main entrance and the Periodicals Archive (Hemeroteca) of \\"Modern Architecture\\" and the second of International architecture opening on May 5, 1990 in which the chamber music concert hall, the art gallery and the Musical Instruments Collection are located. Across the street, the Miguel Urrutia Museum of Art (MAMU).  Computerization  In 1983 Cultural Vice-Director Jaime Duarte French, promoter of many of the cultural enterprises of the Bank retired while a major overhaul of the library was under study. He was succeeded by Lina Espitaleta de Villegas. After approval of the project and years of construction the new sections of the library opened on May 5, 1990.

For that purpose, the then state-of-the-art system, NOTIS was purchased in 1986. In 1990 the NOTIS database handled 200,000 entries and by its retirement in 1998 had about 780,000 and included bibliographical inventory of several databases of other local and national institutions. By the mid 90s, the library begun to offer access to remote databases like Juriscol (about Colombian jurisprudence) and other specialized databases, CD-ROM, and Internet. Since 1995 under the direction of Jorge Orlando Melo, there was an increased interest in the acquisition of new collections, the use of Internet for academic research and the creation of the Virtual Library with special interest in compiling and digitizing entire entries of the Colombian cultural heritage. By 2007 the system migrated to the system AbsysNet for easier and more effective national coverage of other nodes of the Banrepcultural network of libraries. Currently the Virtual Library has 80,000 texts, audio and video with 860 books, 4,700 magazine articles, 815 biographies and a considerable number of interactive pages for children and of art related topics.

The Winter Garden Theatre formerly occupied the site until 1965. On 1 May 2018, the theatre was officially renamed the Gillian Lynne Theatre in honour of Gillian Lynne. It is the first theatre in the West End of London to be named after a non-royal woman.New London Theatre to be renamed the Gillian Lynne Theatre accessed 15 March 2018 Previous buildings The modern theatre is built on the site of previous taverns and music hall theatres, where a place of entertainment has been located since Elizabethan times. Nell Gwynn was associated with the tavern, which became known as the Great Mogul by the end of the 17th century, and presented entertainments in an adjoining hall, including \\"glee clubs\\" and \\"sing-songs\\". The Mogul Saloon was built on the site in 1847, which was sometimes known as the \\"Turkish Saloon\\" or the \\"Mogul Music Hall.\\" In 1851, it became the Middlesex Music Hall, known as The Old Mo. This in turn was rebuilt as the New Middlesex Theatre of Varieties, in 1911 by Frank Matcham for Oswald Stoll. In 1919, the theatre was sold to George Grossmith, Jr. and Edward Laurillard, refurbished and reopened as the Winter Garden Theatre. They produced Kissing Time (1919, with a book by P. G. Wodehouse and Guy Bolton and music by Ivan Caryll), followed by A Night Out (1920), both starring Stanley Holloway.Stanley Holloway#Musical, theatre and concert party credits Grossmith and Laurillard also became managers of the Apollo Theatre in 1920.

Grossmith co-wrote some of the Winter Garden pieces, directed many of his own productions and starred in several, notably as Otis in Sally. Several of the later productions lost money, and Grossmith and Malone ended the partnership. The Vagabond King was produced at the theatre in 1927, and in 1929, Fred and Adele Astaire starred in Funny Face. In 1930, Sophie Tucker played in the Vivian Ellis musical Follow a Star, and in 1923, Gracie Fields appeared here in Walk This Way. In 1933, the theatre hosted Lewis Casson in George Bernard Shaw's On the Rocks, followed in 1935 by Love on the Dole, starring Wendy Hiller. The theatre closed in the late 1930s, reopening in 1942. In 1945, it hosted a Donald Wolfit season, and in 1953, Agatha Christie's Witness for the Prosecution played. 1956 saw The Water Gypsies by Vivian Ellis and A P Herbert; Hotel Paradiso starring Alec Guinness, Douglas Byng, Irene Worth and Billie Whitelaw; and Tyrone Power starred in Shaw's The Devil Disciple. 1958 included The Iceman Cometh. The theatre closed permanently in 1959 when it was sold by the Rank Organisation to a developer. It was then gutted and remained vacant until 1965 to be replaced in 1973 by the current building. New London and Gillian Lynne Designed by architect Paul Tvrtkovic and scenic designer Sean Kenny (Blitz!, Oliver!, Pickwick (musical)), modelled after the Walter Gropius Total-Theater, and seating 960 on 2 levels, the theatre's auditorium first opened with a television recording of Marlene Dietrich's one-woman show. The theatre officially opened on 2 January 1973 with a production of The Unknown Soldier and His Wife starring Peter Ustinov. It then hosted Grease, starring Richard Gere as Danny. Beginning in 1977, the theatre was used as a television studio for several years and then returned to use as a theatre. The theatre's biggest hit was the Andrew Lloyd Webber and Trevor Nunn musical Cats, choreographed by Gillian Lynne which premi√®red in the theatre on 11 May 1981. Closing in 2002, this production became the longest running musical in West End history. The theatre also hosted the 1977 BBC Sports Personality of the Year and the Masters snooker between 1976 and 1978. Also in 1977, the theatre hosted the BBC's A Song For Europe contest, the preliminary heat to choose the UK entry for the Eurovision Song Contest. However, the show was blacked out on TV due to a last minute strike by technicians. The music video for the song \\"We Are the Champions\\" by Queen was shot there in October 1977, following a 70-min. concert. Between 2003 and 2005 the theatre hosted Bill Kenwright's revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical, Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. This closed after a two and a half-year run on 3 September 2005. Most recently, the venue played host to the London transfer of the off- Broadway production, Blue Man Group, which closed in June 2007, to make way for the Royal Shakespeare Company's repertory productions of The Seagull and King Lear, starring Ian McKellen. In Spring 2008, a new musical adaptation of Gone with the Wind ran for only two-month. New musical Imagine This closed after only being open for one month. The National Theatre production of War Horse transferred into the theatre from 28 March 2009 where it stayed until 12 March 2016 after over 3,000 performances. The theatre was home to the Sheffield Cruicible's production of the musical Show Boat which opened on 9 April 2016. Despite positive reviews, the production closed early, on 27 August 2016. On 22 October 2016 the London production of Andrew Lloyd Webber's School of Rock the musical opened, direct from Broadway and will close after a three and a half year run before undergoing a refurbishment. From 15 September 2020, Lloyd Webber's new musical Cinderella will have its world premiere at the theatre. The theatre has been owned since 1991 by Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Group.

A family of functions is locally bounded if for any point in their domain all the functions are bounded around that point and by the same number. Locally bounded function A real-valued or complex-valued function f defined on some topological space X is called locally bounded if for any x0 in X there exists a neighborhood A of x0 such that f(A) is a bounded set. That is, for some number M > 0 one has :f(x) \\\\le M for all x in A. In other words, for each x one can find a constant, depending on x, which is larger than all the values of the function in the neighborhood of x. Compare this with a bounded function, for which the constant does not depend on x. Obviously, if a function is bounded then it is locally bounded. The converse is not true in general (see below). This definition can be extended to the case when f takes values in some metric space. Then the inequality above needs to be replaced with :d\\\\left(f(x), a\\\\right) \\\\le M for all x in A, where d is the distance function in the metric space, and a is some point in the metric space. The choice of a does not affect the definition; choosing a different a will at most increase the constant M for which this inequality is true.  Examples  * The function f: R ‚Üí R defined by :f(x)=\\\\frac{1}{x^2+1} is bounded, because 0 ‚â§ f(x) ‚â§ 1 for all x. Therefore, it is also locally bounded. * The function f: R ‚Üí R defined by :f(x)=2x+3 is not bounded, as it becomes arbitrarily large. However, it is locally bounded because for each a, f(x) ‚â§ M in the neighborhood (a ‚àí 1, a + 1), where M = 2a + 5\\\\. * The function f: R ‚Üí R defined by :f(x) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\frac{1}{x}, & \\\\mbox{if } x eq 0, \\\\ 0, & \\\\mbox{if } x = 0 \\\\end{cases} is neither bounded nor locally bounded. In any neighborhood of 0 this function takes values of arbitrarily large magnitude. * Any continuous function is locally bounded. Here is a proof for functions of a real variable. Let f: U ‚Üí R be continuous where U ‚äÜ R, and we will show that f is locally bounded at a for all a in U. Taking Œµ = 1 in the definition of continuity, there exists Œ¥ > 0 such that f(x) ‚àí f(a) < 1 for all x in U with x ‚àí a < Œ¥. Now by the triangle inequality, f(x) = ‚â§ < 1 + f(a), which means that f is locally bounded at a (taking M = 1 + f(a) and the neighborhood (a ‚àí Œ¥, a + Œ¥)). This argument generalises easily to when the domain of f is any topological space. * The converse of the above result is not true however, i.e. a discontinuous function may be locally bounded. For example consider the function f: R ‚Üí R given by and for all x ‚â† 0. Then f is discontinuous at 0 but f is locally bounded; it is locally constant apart from at zero, where we can take M = 1 and the neighborhood (‚àí1, 1), for example.  Locally bounded family  A set (also called a family) U of real-valued or complex-valued functions defined on some topological space X is called locally bounded if for any x0 in X there exists a neighborhood A of x0 and a positive number M such that :f(x)\\\\le M for all x in A and f in U. In other words, all the functions in the family must be locally bounded, and around each point they need to be bounded by the same constant. This definition can also be extended to the case when the functions in the family U take values in some metric space, by again replacing the absolute value with the distance function.  Examples  * The family of functions fn: R ‚Üí R :f_n(x) = \\\\frac{x}{n} where n = 1, 2, ... is locally bounded. Indeed, if x0 is a real number, one can choose the neighborhood A to be the interval (x0 ‚àí 1, x0 + 1). Then for all x in this interval and for all n ‚â• 1 one has :f_n(x) \\\\le M with M = x0 + 1\\\\. Moreover, the family is uniformly bounded, because neither the neighborhood A nor the constant M depend on the index n. * The family of functions fn: R ‚Üí R :f_n(x) = \\\\frac{1}{x^2+n^2} is locally bounded, if n is greater than zero. For any x0 one can choose the neighborhood A to be R itself. Then we have :f_n(x) \\\\le M with M = 1\\\\. Note that the value of M does not depend on the choice of x0 or its neighborhood A. This family is then not only locally bounded, it is also uniformly bounded. * The family of functions fn: R ‚Üí R :f_n(x) = x+n is not locally bounded. Indeed, for any x0 the values fn(x0) cannot be bounded as n tends toward infinity. Topological vector spaces Local boundedness may also refer to a property of topological vector spaces, or of functions from a topological space into a topological vector space. Locally bounded topological vector spaces Let X be a topological vector space. Then a subset B ‚äÇ X is bounded if for each neighborhood U of 0 in X there exists a scalar s > 0 such that :B ‚äÇ tU for all t > s. A topological vector space is said to be locally bounded if X admits a bounded neighborhood of 0. Locally bounded functions Let X be a topological space, Y a topological vector space, and f : X ‚Üí Y a function. Then f is locally bounded if each point of X has a neighborhood whose image under f is bounded. The following theorem relates local boundedness of functions with the local boundedness of topological vector spaces: :Theorem. A topological vector space X is locally bounded if and only if the identity map idX: X ‚Üí X is locally bounded.

Named after the whale in the novel Moby-Dick by Herman Melville, it was also known by the alternate titles \\"Pat's Delight\\" (early 1968‚Äì1969 version with completely different guitar riff) and \\"Over the Top\\" (with \\"Out on the Tiles\\" intro section and original closing reprise) during various points of the band's career. Composition and recording The tune emerged after Led Zeppelin guitarist and producer Jimmy Page would often catch drummer John Bonham jamming or improvising in the studio, recorded parts of his solos and pieced it all together. The beginning and end of the song feature a power trio of Bonham, Page and bassist John Paul Jones performing a 12 bar blues riff in Drop D tuning, leaving the remainder of the song open for Bonham alone. The structure of the main riff is that of the twelve-bar blues. Singer Robert Plant did not sing at all and in concert would simply introduce Bonham to the audience before the tune started. Studio outtakes from the Led Zeppelin II sessions reveal that the drum solo recorded was edited down from a much longer version. The guitar riff can be traced back to the BBC unused session track \\"The Girl I Love She Got Long Black Wavy Hair\\" which was recorded in the summer of 1969. The riff is also similar to that of Bobby Parker's 1961 single, \\"Watch Your Step\\", although the progression is in a different key and tempo. Live performances Bonham's drum solo was often played at Led Zeppelin concerts from the first North American tour in November 1968, being his solo performance showcase on concert tours through 1977. Over this period it went through three different name changes. During their early 1968‚Äì1969 tours it was known as \\"Pat's Delight\\" (a reference to Bonham's wife), from 1969‚Äì1975 it was \\"Moby Dick\\" and during Led Zeppelin's 1977 North American Tour it was \\"Over the Top\\" as the solo began with the opening riff to \\"Out on the Tiles\\" before segueing into a lengthy drum solo (in the same time ending with a \\"Moby Dick\\" riff). The last time \\"Moby Dick\\" was played by Led Zeppelin was on 17 July 1977 at the Seattle Kingdome and can be found on various audio and video bootleg recordings. When played live, Bonham's drum solo would last as little as 6 minutes or, more frequently, as long as 30 minutes, while the rest of the band would leave the stage after having played the introduction. During the performance Bonham would often set aside or throw his drumsticks into the audience and then continue the solo with his hands (sometimes drawing blood as a result). Live versions of \\"Moby Dick\\" are included on the live album How the West Was Won (lasting 19:20, performed at L.A. Forum 25 June 1972) and on Led Zeppelin's 1976 concert film, The Song Remains the Same as part of Bonham's fantasy sequence. It was also included on the film's accompanying soundtrack. Both of them were cut to a shorter version. The Led Zeppelin DVD also has a 15-minute-long version that was performed and recorded at the Royal Albert Hall in 1970.

The members were Larry Livermore on guitar and vocals, Kain Kong (Kain Hanschke) on bass and vocals, and Tr√© Cool on drums and vocals. All three contributed on songwriting. The band is most famous for being Tr√© Cool's first band before joining Green Day. History Looking to start a punk band, Livermore had trouble finding members, citing the majority of the local musicians being hippies and \\"completely uninterested in the music we wanted to make.\\" Eventually, Livermore recruited 14-year-old Kain Hanschke on bass and 12-year-old Frank Edwin \\"Tr√©\\" Wright III on drums. Although he had never before played drums, young Tr√© showed an instant affinity for them, likely because, as Livermore said, \\"he loved making a lot of noise and getting everyone to look at him.\\" Claiming that the members needed \\"punk rock names,\\" Livermore gave his fellow musicians new last names. Kain's surname went from Hanschke to \\"Kong,\\" while Tr√© went from Wright to \\"Cool.\\" It has often been claimed that Livermore was the person to dub Cool with \\"Tr√©.\\" His family had long before given him the nickname, a play on the word \\"tres,\\" or \\"three,\\" as he was the third Frank Edwin in his family. The Lookouts recorded three albums,Lookout! It's the Lookouts, One Planet One People, and Spy Rock Road, and two EPs, Mendocino Homeland and IV. :On July 10, 1990, we went into The Art Of Ears studio in San Francisco and recorded nine songs, six of which would ultimately be released [as IV], and then went over to Oakland to play what would be, though we didn‚Äôt know it at the time, our last show. I was never that great at lead guitar (or rhythm guitar, for that matter, if we‚Äôre going to be honest), so I asked a friend named Billie Joe to play on the recordings. From there, Livermore went on to running his record label, named Lookout Records; One Planet One People was the first release in the label's history. Livermore eventually sold Lookout Records to business partner Chris Appelgren in the mid-1990s. Kong became a National Park Service park ranger. Cool became drummer for Green Day, after they were left in a lurch by their first drummer. In 2015, Don Giovanni Records released Spy Rock Road and Other Stories, a compilation featuring all of the tracks from Spy Rock Road, Mendocino Homeland and IV, a few compilation tracks and one from their demo Lookout! It's the Lookouts.

He played with some of the most influential blues and rock-and- roll performers of his time and received numerous honors, including a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and induction into the Blues Hall of Fame. Life and career=Early career Perkins was born in Belzoni, Mississippi and raised on a plantation in Honey Island, Mississippi. He began his career as a guitarist but then injured the tendons in his left arm in a knife fight with a chorus girl in Helena, Arkansas. Unable to play the guitar, he switched to the piano at about 12 or 13 years old. He also moved from Robert Nighthawk's radio program on KFFA to Sonny Boy Williamson's King Biscuit Time. He continued working with Nighthawk, however, accompanying him on \\"Jackson Town Gal\\" in 1950. In the 1950s, Perkins joined Earl Hooker and began touring. He recorded \\"Pinetop's Boogie Woogie\\" at Sam Phillips's Sun Studio in Memphis, Tennessee. The tune was written by Pinetop Smith, who created the original recording in 1928. Perkins didn't write; he \\"got as high as third grade in school.\\" He learned to play-off Smith's records. As Perkins recalled, \\"They used to call me 'Pinetop' because I played that song.\\" Perkins then relocated to Illinois and left the music business until Hooker persuaded him to record again in 1968. Perkins replaced Otis Spann in the Muddy Waters band when Spann left the band in 1969. After ten years with that organization, he formed the Legendary Blues Band with Willie \\"Big Eyes\\" Smith, recording from the late 1970s to the early 1990s. Later career Perkins played a brief musical cameo on the street outside Aretha's Soul Food Cafe in the 1980 movie The Blues Brothers, having an argument with John Lee Hooker over who wrote \\"Boom Boom.\\" He also appeared in the 1987 movie Angel Heart as a member of guitarist Toots Sweet's band. Perkins was a sideman on countless recordings but never had an album devoted solely to his artistry until After Hours, released by Blind Pig Records in 1988. The tour in support of the album featured Jimmy Rogers and guitarist Hubert Sumlin. The death of Perkin's common law wife, Sara Lewis, in 1995, triggered a depression and periods of drinking. In 1998, he released the album Legends, featuring Sumlin. In 2001, Perkins performed at the Chicago Blues Festival with Ike Turner. Turner credited Perkins with inspiring him to play piano. Perkins was driving his automobile in 2004 in La Porte, Indiana, when his car was hit by a train. The car was wrecked, but the 91-year-old driver was not seriously hurt. Until his death, Perkins lived in Austin, Texas. He usually performed a couple of nights a week at Momo's, on Sixth Street. The song \\"Hey Mr. Pinetop Perkins\\", performed by Perkins and Angela Strehli, played on the common misconception that he wrote \\"Pinetop's Boogie Woogie\\": ::Hey Mr. Pinetop Perkins ::I got a question for you ::How'd you write that first boogie woogie ::The one they named after you Death On March 21, 2011, Perkins died of cardiac arrest at his home in Austin, Texas. At the time of his death, he had more than 20 performances booked for 2011. Shortly before he died, while discussing his late career resurgence with an interviewer, he conceded, \\"I can't play piano like I used to either. I used to have bass rolling like thunder. I can't do that no more. But I ask the Lord, please forgive me for the stuff I done trying to make a nickel.\\" Perkins and David \\"Honeyboy\\" Edwards were the last surviving original Delta blues musicians. Perkins was also one of the last surviving bluesmen to have known Robert Johnson. Legacy= Influence  Bruce Iglauer, founder of Chicago's Alligator Records, stated Perkins was \\"absolutely the premier blues piano player.\\" He added, \\"His career spanned literally over 80 years. He was the symbol of a whole generation of musicians.\\" Perkins influenced blues musicians such as Ike Turner, who he taught how to play piano. \\"Pinetop would be the birth of rock 'n' roll, because he taught me what I played,\\" Turner said. Perkins collaborated with various bluesmen, including Muddy Waters, Robert Nighthawk, Earl Hooker, and B.B. King.  Awards and honors  Perkins was named a National Heritage Fellow by the National Endowment for the Arts in 2000. In 2003, Perkins was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame. In 2005, Perkins received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2008, Perkins, together with Henry Townsend, Robert Lockwood, Jr. and David \\"Honeyboy\\" Edwards, received a Grammy Award for Best Traditional Blues Album for Last of the Great Mississippi Delta Bluesmen: Live in Dallas. He was also nominated in the same category for his solo album Pinetop Perkins on the 88's: Live in Chicago. At the age of 97, Perkins won a Grammy Award in the category Best Traditional Blues Album for Joined at the Hip, which he recorded with Willie \\"Big Eyes\\" Smith, thus becoming the oldest winner of a Grammy Award, edging out the comedian George Burns, who had won in the spoken word category 21 years earlier.

Toronto Star, July 17, 2014. It is syndicated to several radio stations, mostly but not exclusively Corus-owned, across Canada. The Ongoing History chronicles the history of alternative rock, from its roots in punk and new wave to the modern day. An episode of the show may profile an important musician or band (Sex Pistols, The Smiths, R.E.M., Foo Fighters, The Cure, Nirvana, U2, Nine Inch Nails, The Velvet Underground, etc.), a significant musical trend such as grunge or Madchester, or a theme such as payola, gay musicians or significant cult figures. Some topics are covered in a single show, while more substantial topics may be presented over two, three or four episodes. History The program first aired in 1993 on CFNY-FM in Toronto. It was produced directly by CFNY until 2008, when Cross left the station to become the head of Corus' new media division. Although the program continued to air on CFNY, it became a production of Corus' interactive ExploreMusic division until Cross left the company in 2011. The show was discontinued at that time, although it resumed production in September 2014 after Cross was rehired by CFNY. Shorter Ongoing History segments, about a minute long, air at various times throughout the day on some of the program's affiliate stations during commercial breaks. In 2005, Cross also began production of a daily podcast available freely from their website. The minute-long podcasts share a similar format to the weekly show and detail one interesting rock fact each day. Cross has also licensed the program's name to a number of Canadian compilation albums collecting classic alternative rock songs. Bandomynology On April 8, 2007, Cross created a new word: Bandomynology, which is the study of the origins of band names. Cross devoted several segments of the show to investigate the nature of band names, consulting Dr. Sheila Embleton, a professor of linguistics at York University in Toronto, and Marc Hershon of Simmer Branding Studio, a ‚Äúbranding‚Äù agency in Sausalito, California and Priscilla Ord, in helping to create the term The Ongoing History of New Music. Bandomynology Cross hopes to slowly introduce the term into academic studies of rock and alternative music, as well as music of all genres. Cross describes the term in the notes from the episode Bandomynology: Naming Your Band - Part 1 - Seg. 1 below:  Episode guide  Please note that this list may not be complete. There have been over 800 episodes produced since the show began in 1993. *Ep 001 (1993-02-28) Series Preview *Ep 002 (1993-03-07) The History of Alternative Music: Punk 1963‚Äì72 *Ep 003 (1993-03-14) The History of Alternative Music: Punk 1972‚Äì74 *Ep 004 (1993-03-21) The History of Alternative Music: Punk 1975 *Ep 005 (1993-03-28) The History of Alternative Music: Punk 1976 *Ep 006 (1993-04-04) The History of Alternative Music: Punk 1977A *Ep 007 (1993-04-11) The History of Alternative Music: Punk 1977B *Ep 008 (1993-04-18) The History of Alternative Music: 1978 *Ep 009 (1993-04-25) The History of Alternative Music: 1979 *Ep 010 (1993-05-02) The History of Alternative Music: 1980 *Ep 011 (1993-05-09) The History of Alternative Music: 1981 *Ep 012 (1993-05-16) The History of Alternative Music: 1982 *Ep 013 (1993-05-23) The History of Alternative Music: 1983 *Ep 014 (1993-05-30) The History of Alternative Music: 1984 *Ep 015 (1993-06-06) The History of Alternative Music: 1985 *Ep 016 (1993-06-13) The History of Alternative Music: 1986 *Ep 017 (1993-06-20) The History of Alternative Music: 1987 *Ep 018 (1993-06-27) The History of Alternative Music: 1988 *Ep 019 (1993-07-04) The History of Alternative Music: 1989 *Ep 020 (1993-07-11) The History of Alternative Music: 1990 *Ep 021 (1993-07-18) The History of Alternative Music: 1991 *Ep 022 (1993-07-25) The History of Alternative Music: 1992 *Ep 023 (1993-08-01) Ten Bands That Mattered # 1 (R.E.M.) *Ep 024 (1993-08-08) Ten Bands That Mattered # 2 (Smiths) *Ep 025 (1993-08-15) Ten Bands That Mattered # 3 (Clash) *Ep 026 (1993-08-22) Ten Bands That Mattered # 4 (Cure) *Ep 027 (1993-08-29) Ten Bands That Mattered # 5A (Joy Division) *Ep 028 (1993-09-05) Ten Bands That Mattered # 5B (New Order) *Ep 029 (1993-09-12) Ten Bands That Mattered # 6 (Depeche Mode) *Ep 030 (1993-09-19) Ten Bands That Mattered # 7 (Sex Pistols) *Ep 031 (1993-09-26) Ten Bands That Mattered # 8 (Ramones) *Ep 032 (1993-10-03) Ten Bands That Mattered # 9 (Talking Heads) *Ep 033 (1993-10-10) Ten Bands That Mattered # 10 (U2)/MARATHON *Ep 034 (1993-10-17) Cool Labels 1: 4AD *Ep 035 (1993-10-24) Cool Labels 2: Sub Pop *Ep 036 (1993-10-31) Cool Labels 3: Factory *Ep 037 (1993-11-07) Cool Labels 4: Stiff *Ep 038 (1993-11-14) Cool Labels 5: Mute *Ep 039 (1993-11-21) Cool Labels 6: Beggars Banquet *Ep 040 (1993-11-28) Cool Labels 7: WaxTrax/SST/Rough Trade *Ep 041 (1993-12-05) Velvet Underground *Ep 042 (1993-12-12) Great Moments in Censorship *Ep 043 (1993-12-19) Recording Cheap *Ep 044 (1993-12-26) What Ever Happened To?

The Grand Olympic Auditorium is a former sports venue in southern Downtown Los Angeles, California. The venue was built in 1924 at 1801 South Grand Avenue, now just south of the Santa Monica Freeway. The grand opening of the Olympic Auditorium was on August 5, 1925, and was a major media event, attended by such celebrities as Jack Dempsey and Rudolph Valentino. One of the last major boxing and wrestling arenas still in existence, the venue now serves as a worship space for the Korean-American evangelical church, \\"Glory Church of Jesus Christ\\". History Throughout the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s it was home to some of the biggest boxing, wrestling, and roller derby events. 1932 Olympics The Auditorium was leased by the 1932 Summer Olympics Organizing Committee for a very nominal sum sufficient to cover expenses, for the purpose of conducting the training and competitions of the boxing (1932), wrestling (1932) and weightlifting (1932) events of the Games. At the time it was the largest indoor venue in the United States. Boxing It has become somewhat of a landmark for boxing history. Charles Bukowski wrote about the Olympic: \\"even the Hollywood (Legion Stadium) boys knew the action was at the Olympic. Raft came, and the others, and all the starlets, hugging those front row seats. the gallery boys went ape and the fighters fought like fighters and the place was blue with cigar smoke, and how we screamed, baby baby, and threw money and drank our whiskey, and when it was over, there was the drive in, the old lovebed with our dyed and vicious women. you slammed it home, then slept like a drunk angel.\\"Bukowski, Charles (1982) \\"Goodbye Watson\\" in Erections, Ejaculations, Exhibitions, and General Tales of Ordinary Madness. City Lights Books: San Francisco. Page 315. The 1960s and 1970s were a major boom period for the Olympic, as major boxing and wrestling events were held at the arena every other Friday night, as well as being the home to the Roller Games Los Angeles T-Birds. Closure The arena closed its doors in the mid-1980s when promoter Mike Le Bell discontinued his weekly wrestling shows due to low attendance figures when the boom of the professional wrestling era began. This was when the wrestling scene shifted from Los Angeles to Dallas' World Class, Minneapolis' AWA, Jim Crockett Promotions Mid-Atlantic/NWA, and Stamford's WWF, now known as the WWE. Reopening It reopened in 1993, but the capacity was reduced from 10,400 to just over 7,300. In the 2000s the Auditorium sat 7,030 for boxing and wrestling, 4,514 for seated concerts, and 7,007 for general admission concerts. Up to 773 seats could be put on the arena floor, which measured 12,100 square feet (110' by 110'). Throughout the early and mid 1990s, the venue was often the host of many large, all-night rave parties, often held outdoors in the back parking lot, as well as inside the auditorium. On New Year's Eve of 1996/1997, a large-scale rave called In Seventh Heaven was being held at the Olympic. Dozens of people had to be taken to the hospital from a suspected overdose of a legal high called Liquid fX, which was being handed out at the party. The event which had already gathered over 10,000 ravers was shut down by the LAPD before midnight, sending much of the crowd into the street, where a melee broke out between upset revelers and riot police. On July 16, 2000, ECW held its Heatwave pay-per-view at the Grand Olympic Auditorium. It was ECW's first and only West Coast appearance. Prior to the main event, six wrestlers from the LA-based Xtreme Pro Wrestling promotion, who were given front row tickets by promotion owner Rob Zicari, donned shirts of their promotion, which caught the attention of Tommy Dreamer and ECW security and were promptly ejected. A brawl followed in the parking lot between XPW ring crew and the ECW locker room, based on false reporting that Francine had been touched by someone from XPW. On February 23, 2002, XPW held its Freefall event at the Grand Olympic Auditorium where New Jack tossed Vic Grimes off a 40-foot scaffold. Wrestling legends such as Jim Londos, Joe Stecher, Ed \\"Strangler\\" Lewis, Gus Sonnenberg, Ray Steele, Frank Sexton, Man Mountain Dean, Everett Marshall, Ed Don George, Enrique Torres, Baron Michele Leone, Freddie Blassie, John Tolos, Buddy Roberts, The Sheik, Fritz Von Erich, Gorgeous George, The Great Goliath, Black Gordman, Bobo Brazil, Buddy Rogers, Roddy Piper and Chris Adams competed in the arena at one point in their careers, along with the legendary Lou Thesz, Mil Mascaras and Andr√© the Giant. Adams was one of the last big draws at the Olympic before promoters Mike Le Bell and Gene LeBell ended its wrestling cards in 1982. Adams went to Portland afterwards and eventually to Dallas to join Fritz Von Erich's World Class Championship Wrestling, as the sport's top wrestling city shifted from Los Angeles to Dallas and Atlanta before Vince McMahon's WWF reached national prominence. Music venue Until 2005, the Olympic Auditorium was host to many music concerts and shows, as well as boxing and wrestling. The arena is famous for its box office number \\"RI-9-5171\\" (213) 749-5171 which is no longer in use. As far back as 1951, there had been rhythm and blues concerts at the Grand Olympic. In 1969-70, The Grand Olympic Auditorium hosted concerts by hard rock acts such as Mountain, Jack Bruce, and Ten Years After. It would be used more extensively as a musical venue after 1980. This period in music performances began with a concert by the band Public Image Ltd. which was produced by Punk Rock impresario David Ferguson and his independent CD Presents production company. This was the first concert held at the auditorium since the early 1970s and is credited with beginning the Olympic's reputation for being a notorious Punk Rock venue. Thereafter legendary promoter Gary Tovar and Goldenvoice Productions started booking shows at the venue, with monthly concerts by the likes of GBH, The Exploited, T.S.O.L., SIN 34, Suicidal Tendencies, UK Subs, New Regime, Circle Jerks, Angelic Upstarts, The Dickies, Wasted Youth, Dead Kennedys, The Vandals, D.O.A., Love Canal, Bad Religion, FEAR, M.I.A. and many others. Black Flag was the headliner for a New Year's Eve show 1981-82. Famous musical celebrities have also used the Olympic Auditorium for their music videos. Below are a few named who have used the venue. * 1985: Survivor's music video for Burning Heart was shot in the venue in October 1985. * 1986: Bon Jovi films the music videos for \\"You Give Love A Bad Name\\" and \\"Livin' On A Prayer\\" in the auditorium, with Wayne Isham directing them. The music videos for Air Supply's two 1986 hit singles, \\"Lonely Is the Night\\" and \\"One More Chance\\" were filmed in the same venue on the same year. * 1987: Kiss filmed the music video of the namesake track of their 1987 album Crazy Nights in the same venue. The music video for Janet Jackson's \\"Control\\" was recorded here as well in the same year. Rage Against the Machine played their final show in September 2000 at the Olympic Auditorium before their break-up a month later. The concert was filmed and later released in 2003 as a DVD and CD Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium. Glory Church of Jesus Christ In June 2005, the Glory Church of Jesus Christ, a Korean-American Christian church, purchased the entire property. Although the name Grand Olympic Auditorium ceased to exist, many locals and longtime residents of Los Angeles still refer to the property by its former names. In 2007, the arena was given a new facelift back to its original brown coat of paint that was abandoned in 1993 when the arena reopened.

They can coincide or overlap with one or more metropolitan areas, though rural regions with few significant population centers can also be designated as markets. Conversely, very large metropolitan areas can sometimes be subdivided into multiple segments. Market regions may overlap, meaning that people residing on the edge of one media market may be able to receive content from other nearby markets. They are widely used in audience measurements, which are compiled in the United States by Nielsen Media Research. Nielsen measures both television and radio audiences since its acquisition of Arbitron, which was completed in September 2013. Markets are identified by the largest city, which is usually located in the center of the market region. However, geography and the fact that some metropolitan areas have large cities separated by some distance can make markets have unusual shapes and result in two, three, or more names being used to identify a single region (such as Wichita-Hutchinson, Kansas; Chico-Redding, California; Albany-Schenectady-Troy, New York; and Harrisburg-Lebanon-Lancaster-York, Pennsylvania). In the United States, radio markets are generally a bit smaller than their television counterparts, as broadcast power restrictions are stricter for radio than TV, and TV reaches further via cable. AM band and FM band radio ratings are sometimes separated, as are broadcast and cable television. Market researchers also subdivide ratings demographically between different age groups, genders, and ethnic backgrounds; as well as psychographically between income levels and other non- physical factors. This information is used by advertisers to determine how to reach a specific audience. In countries such as the United Kingdom, a government body defines the media markets; in countries such as the United States, media regions are defined by a privately held institution, without government status. United States=Television Map of United States Television Market Areas as of 2013 A Television Market Area (TMA) is a group of counties in the United States covered by a specific group of television stations. The term is used by the U.S. Government's Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to regulate broadcast, cable, and satellite transmissions, according to the Code of Federal Regulations, at 47 CFR ¬ß 76.51 and FCC.gov. The TMAs not only have full control over local broadcasts, but also delineate which channels will be received by satellite or cable subscribers (\\"must- carry\\" rules). These market areas can also be used to define restrictions on rebroadcasting of broadcast television signals. Generally speaking, only stations within the same market area can be rebroadcast. The only exception to this rule is the \\"significantly viewed\\" list.FCC.gov Virtually all of the United States is located within the boundaries of exactly one TMA. A similar term used by Nielsen Media Research is the Designated Market Area (DMA), and they control the trademark on it. DMAs are used by Nielsen Media Research to identify TV stations that best reach an area and attract the most viewers. There are 210 Nielsen DMAs in the United States, 70 of which are metered (in other words, viewership in these markets are estimated automatically instead of through the archaic diary system still in use in the smaller markets).See the PDF's at See the 2017 map of Nielsen Designated Market Areas at TMAs may cover a much larger area than the stations that serve it, especially since the digital television transition. This is particularly true in markets that have hilly or mountainous terrain that is ill-suited for digital broadcasting. In these cases, the outlying areas of a TMA may only be served by cable and satellite, or perhaps by small translators. (There are some cases, such as that of Olean, New York, where a sizable number of independent stations operate, but none carry any major network affiliation unless they operate as translators. Because of this, Olean is considered part of the Buffalo, New York market despite none of that city's major signals reaching the city from 70 miles away.) Conversely, a geographically small market such as Erie, Pennsylvania may have stations where their signal spills well over into neighboring TMAs (most of Chautauqua County, New York is closer to Erie than Buffalo, but the county is also located within the Buffalo DMA). Arbitron (now Nielsen Audio) at one time also maintained similar areas for television ratings, each called an area of dominant influence (ADI). There were 286 ADI's in the United States. Arbitron stopped offering a television ratings service. Radio Nielsen Audio (previously Arbitron) maintains smaller areas for radio stations; each is called an Arbitron Radio Metro. Whereas a typical TMA may cover ten counties, an Arbitron market generally covers two to four, and a TMA may contain two to four separate Radio Metros. There are 302 Radio Metros in the United States, but not all areas of the country are covered. In 2009, Nielsen began offering radio ratings in competition with Arbitron, starting in those markets ranked 101st and smaller.

According to art historian Michael Ryan the hoard \\"represents the most complex and sumptuous expression of the ecclesiastical art-style of early-medieval Ireland as we know it in its eighth- and ninth-century maturity.\\"Ryan 1997:997. The area known as Derrynaflan is an island of pastureland surrounded by bogland, which was the site of an early Irish abbey. The chalice was found with a composite silver paten, a hoop that may have been a stand for the paten, a liturgical strainer and a bronze basin inverted over the other objects.Michael Ryan, \\"The Derrynaflan Hoard and Early Irish Art\\" Speculum 72.4 (October 1997:995‚Äì1017) p. 997, with wide-ranging notes. The group is among the most important surviving examples of Insular metalwork. It was donated to the Irish State and the items are now on display in the National Museum of Ireland. The hoard was probably secreted during the turbulent 10th to 12th centuries, when Viking raids and dynastic turmoil created many occasions when valuables were hidden. The early and later 10th century is marked by a particular concentration of hoarding in Ireland.Ryan 1997:998. Discovery Detail Derrynaflan is a small island of dry land situated in a surrounding area of peat bogs, in the townland of Lurgoe, Co. Tipperary, northeast of Cashel. The monastery was an important foundation in the period preceding the Viking raids; the present modest ruins of a small Cistercian nave-and-chancel abbey church there, however, date from a later period. The Derrynaflan Hoard was discovered on 17 February 1980 by Michael Webb from Clonmel and his son, also Michael, while they were exploring the ancient monastic site of Derrynaflan with a metal detector.Trafficking Culture, http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case- studies/derrynaflan-hoard/ They had the implied permission of the owners of the land on which the ruins stood to visit the site but they had no permission to dig on the lands. A preservation order had been made in respect of the ruin under the National Monuments Act, 1930, so that it was an offence to injure or to interfere with the site. Webb v Ireland [1988] IR 353 The discovery was initially kept secret for three weeks. Derrynaflan Strainer The Ardagh Chalice was discovered in County Limerick, at Reerasta Rath in U√≠ Fidgenti, 1868. The behaviour of the Webbs, and nearly seven years of litigation, culminating in the Supreme Court action where they unsuccessfully sought over ¬£5,000,000 for the find, led to the replacement of Irish laws of treasure trove by the law in the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994, with a new Section 2 being included in the legislation. The Ardagh Chalice dates from around the same period, perhaps a century earlier, of the Derrynaflan Hoard and was found close by in neighbouring County Limerick. At the time, the ruling dynasty in Tipperary and most of Munster were the E√≥ganachta, while their longtime allies and possible cousins the U√≠ Fidgenti ruled in the Limerick area. Feidlimid mac Cremthanin, king-bishop of Cashel, who became King of Munster in 821 and died in 847, was a patron of the monastic foundation at Derrynaflan and has been suggested as a possible patron of the chalice.Ryan, with reservations, 1997:997: \\"This sort of particularism is dangerous as hypotheses of this nature tend to be elevated into 'facts'\\". As a masterpiece of Insular art, the Derrynaflan chalice was included in the exhibition \\"The Work of Angels: Masterpieces of Celtic Metalwork, 6th‚Äì9th Centuries AD\\" (London, 1989, included in the catalogue).

It has a seating capacity of 588.  Building the theatre  In 1870, the caterers Spiers and Pond began development of the site of the White Bear, a seventeenth-century posting inn. The inn was located on sloping ground stretching between Jermyn Street and Piccadilly Circus, known as Regent Circus.Wheatley, Henry B. Round About Piccadilly and Pall Mall, London: Smith Elder (1870), p. 45 A competition was held for the design of a concert hall complex, with Thomas Verity winning out of 15 entries. He was commissioned to design a large restaurant, dining rooms, ballroom, and galleried concert hall in the basement. The frontage, which was the fa√ßade of the restaurant, showed a French Renaissance influence using Portland stone. After the building work began, it was decided to change the concert hall into a theatre. The composers' names, which line the tiled staircases, were retained and can still be seen. The redesign placed the large Criterion Restaurant and dining rooms above the theatre, with a ballroom on the top floor. When Spiers and Pond applied for a licence to operate, the authorities were unhappy because the theatre was underground and lit by gas, creating the risk of toxic fumes. The Metropolitan Board of Works had to vote twice before the necessary licence was issued, and fresh air had to be pumped into the auditorium to prevent the audience from being asphyxiated. It was not until October 1881, at the Savoy, that the first theatre was lit electrically. The building was completed in 1873 with the interior decoration carried out by Simpson and Son.  Early years  The first production opened on 21 March 1874 under the management of Henry J. Byron & EP Hingston. The programme consisted of An American Lady written and performed by Byron and a piece by W. S. Gilbert, with music by Alfred Cellier, entitled Topsyturveydom. The event apparently did not make much of an impression on Gilbert. In a 1903 letter to Thomas Edgar Pemberton, author of the book on The Criterion, Gilbert wrote: \\"I am sorry to say that in my mind is an absolute blank to the opening of The Criterion. I never saw Topseyturveydom. If you happen to have a copy of it and could lend it to me for a few hours it might suggest some reminiscences: as it is I don't even know what the piece was about!\\"Pemberton, T. Edgar. Sir Charles Wyndham: a Biography. London: Hutchinson and Co., 1904 Gilbert had, however, been back at the theatre in 1877 with his farce, On Bail (a revised version of his 1874 work, Committed for Trial); in 1881, with another farce, Foggerty's Fairy; and in 1892, with a comic opera, Haste to the Wedding, with music by George Grossmith (an operatic version of Gilbert's 1873 play, The Wedding March). Haste to the Wedding was a flop, but it introduced the 18-year-old George Grossmith, Jr., the composer's son, to the London stage. The younger Grossmith would go on to become a major star in Edwardian musical comedies.Lamb, Andrew. \\"From Pinafore to Porter: United States-United Kingdom Interactions in Musical Theater, 1879‚Äì1929\\", American Music, Vol. 4, No. 1, British-American Musical Interactions (Spring, 1986), pp. 34‚Äì49, University of Illinois Press, retrieved 24 November 2015 Charles Wyndham became the manager and lessee in 1875, and under his management the Criterion became one of the leading light comedy houses in London. The first production under the manager was The Great Divorce Case, opening on 15 April 1876. When Wyndham left in 1899 to open his own theatre, The Wyndham's Theatre (and then the New Theatre, now called the No√´l Coward Theatre, in 1903) he remained the lessee bringing in various managements and their companies. In March 1883, the theatre closed for alterations demanded by the Metropolitan Board of Works. The pumping of fresh air into the ten-year-old auditorium, some thirty feet below street level, was deemed unsatisfactory. Thomas Verity supervised the alterations (Verity by now had also designed the Comedy Theatre in 1881 and the Empire Theatre in 1882). The new direct access ventilation shaft meant cutting off a considerable portion of the adjoining Criterion Restaurant. New corridors were built, with several new exits. The auditorium was reconstructed and the stage re-equipped. The old dressing rooms were demolished and new ones built. Most importantly, electricity was installed. Dramatic Notes (1884) states \\"The Criterion Theatre, transformed from a stuffy band-box to a convenient, handsome, and well ventilated house, reopened on April 16\\". Further alterations and redecorations took place in 1902‚Äì03, when the theatre was closed for seven months.  20th century  Between the world wars, productions included Musical Chairs with John Gielgud and in 1936, French Without Tears which ran for 1,039 performances and launched the writing career of Terence Rattigan. During the Second World War, the Criterion was requisitioned by the BBC ‚Äì as an underground theatre it made an ideal studio safe from the Blitz ‚Äì and light entertainment programmes were both recorded and broadcast live. After the war, the Criterion repertoire included avant- garde works such as Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot. The early part of 1956 saw the arrival of Anouilh's popular comedy, The Waltz of the Toreadors, with impressive performances by Hugh Griffith and Beatrix Lehmann. In the 1970s, the Criterion site was proposed for redevelopment, which caused protest, as people feared the theatre would be lost. In February 1975, the GLC Planning Committee approved the development on the condition that the theatre continued in \\"full, continuous and uninterrupted use\\" while the redevelopments took place. Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s the argument increased, and the Equity Save London's Theatre Committee organised high-profile demonstrations (campaigners included John Gielgud, Edward Woodward, Diana Rigg, Robert Morley and Prunella Scales) as they feared that the theatre would still be lost. In the 1980s, the theatre building was purchased by Robert Bourne, a property tycoon and patron of the arts, and his wife, theatre impresario Sally Greene. The couple set up the Criterion Theatre Trust, a registered charity created to protect the Criterion's future. From 1989 to 1992 the theatre was renovated both in the back and front of the house. During that time, the block that exists today was built around it. After the refurbishment, the Criterion retains a well-preserved Victorian auditorium with an intimate atmosphere. Major productions in the last two decades of the century included Tom Foolery (1980‚Äì1981), Can't Pay? Won't Pay! (1981‚Äì1983), and the long-running Run for Your Wife (1983‚Äì1989).  Recent years  Criterion Theatre in 2007 From 1996 to 2005, the theatre was home to productions of the Reduced Shakespeare Company, notably The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged). The theatre hosted the first round of recalls for successful auditionees in ITV's Pop Idol. The theatre is also used by leading drama institutions as a venue for their graduating students' annual showcases. From 2006 to 2015, the Criterion hosted the long-running melodrama The 39 Steps, adapted for the stage by Patrick Barlow from John Buchan's 1915 novel, which was adapted for film by Alfred Hitchcock in 1935. Peppa Pig's Party transferred to the Criterion Theatre for the 2010 Christmas period to play alongside The 39 Steps and returned for the following 4 Christmas periods up to 2014. Criterion Presents, launched in October 2011, is an ancillary programme of shows, events and platforms that run alongside the main production, taking place at lunchtimes, early evenings and late nights.

The song was recorded by the Beatles on 31 January 1969. \\"Two of Us\\" was originally released as the opening track on Let It Be (1970) and a remix of that recording was later included on Let It Be... Naked (2003). An outtake of the song, recorded on 24 January 1969, was released on Anthology 3 (1996). The song's title was used for the 2000 TV movie Two of Us, which depicts a fictionalized version of a 1976 reunion between McCartney and Lennon. History The song was originally titled \\"On Our Way Home\\". Ian MacDonald claimed the lyrics (e.g.: \\"you and I have memories/longer than the road that stretches out ahead\\" or \\"you and me chasing paper/getting nowhere\\") sounded like McCartney was probably addressing Lennon and contractual troubles. \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\", a different composition by McCartney from the previously released album, but recorded after Let It Be, Abbey Road, also refers to The Beatles' contract with Allen Klein as \\"funny paper\\". An early performance of the song, in a guitar-driven rock style, can be seen in the Let It Be film. Unsatisfied with this style, which McCartney described as \\"chunky\\", the band reworked the song around acoustic guitars. The Beatles performed a finished version of the song live at Apple Studios on 31 January 1969; this performance was included in both the Let It Be film and album. The clip was also broadcast on The Ed Sullivan Show on 1 March 1970 as the final appearance by the Beatles on the program. In between several takes of the song on 24 January 1969, the band spontaneously started playing a hammed-up version of traditional Liverpudlian song \\"Maggie Mae\\". The 38-second song would also end up on the Let It Be album, but is omitted in Let It Be... Naked. A version of Two of Us on the same day is released on Anthology 3. In May 1969, McCartney produced a recording of the song using this title by the group Mortimer, a New York City trio that briefly recorded for Apple, but this recording was never released. On the Let It Be album, producer Phil Spector added, as a spoken introduction to the song, a snippet of unrelated studio humour by Lennon, who says: \\"'I Dig A Pygmy' by Charles Hawtrey and the Deaf-Aids! Phase one, in which Doris gets her oats!\\" This intro, with its passing mention of the British comic actor, was removed in the Let It Be... Naked version.

Biography  Pierce was the son of a stockbroker, Samuel Cuppels Pierce, who in turn was the son of Edward S. Pierce, a long-serving treasurer of the St. Louis-based Samuel Cuppels Woodenware Company. Pierce completed his education through the fourth year of high school, according to the 1940 census records.1940 census record Pierce spent the majority of his career as a writer for the Warner Bros. \\"Termite Terrace\\" animation studio, working alongside fellow luminaries such as Chuck Jones and Michael Maltese. Pierce also worked as a writer at Fleischer Studios from 1939 to 1941. Jones credited Pierce in his autobiography Chuck Amuck: The Life and Times of an Animated Cartoonist (1989) as being the inspiration for the character Pep√© Le Pew, the haplessly romantic French skunk due to Pierce's self-proclamation that he was a ladies' man.David Germain blog entry In early credits, his name was spelled \\"T-E-D\\". He was said to have added an extra \\"D\\" to his name as a way of lampooning puppeteer Bil Baird when he dropped one of the \\"L\\"s from his first name. He contributed (with Bill Danch) the story of the Tom and Jerry short Tall in the Trap (1962), directed by Gene Deitch. Originally the short would have starred Sylvester the cat and Speedy Gonzales and would have been directed by Robert McKimson. However, McKimson disapproved of the storyline, and decided not to use it. Instead, Pierce sold it to Danch and Deitch, who were desperately looking for suitable storylines for Tom and Jerry. In his Warners career, Pierce worked with three of the three best-known Warner animation directors (Jones, McKimson and Friz Freleng). He contributed many storylines for them, including Freleng's Hare Do (1949), Bad Ol' Putty Tat (1949), Bunker Hill Bunny (1950) and Big House Bunny (1950); Jones' Hare Tonic (1945, an early success for both of them) and Broom-Stick Bunny (1956); and McKimson's Hillbilly Hare (1950), Lovelorn Leghorn (1951) and Cat-Tails for Two (1953), the last of which was Speedy Gonzales' first appearance. Because much of Pierce's Termite Terrace career was spent with McKimson's unit, however, it would follow that Pierce was generally overshadowed by his contemporaries as story writers at Warners, Warren Foster and Michael Maltese. Pierce also got occasional voice work in the shorts: he gave voice to Jack Bunny in I Love to Singa (1936), King Bombo in Gulliver's Travels (1939), and the villainous C. Bagley Beetle in Mr. Bug Goes to Town (1941), in addition to writing on those films. He imitated Bud Abbott in one Warner short casting Abbott and Costello as alley cats Babbit and Catstello (A Tale of Two Kitties) and two Warner shorts casting them as mice (Tale of Two Mice and The Mouse- Merized Cat). Pierce also voiced Tom Dover in The Dover Boys, the \\"tall, thin\\" character in Wackiki Wabbit, and the French chef Louis in French Rarebit. In addition, in a few shorts containing Jones' Hubie and Bertie characters, Pierce voiced Bertie, and Maltese played Hubie. Thereafter they were voiced by the principal voice actor, Mel Blanc, and Stan Freberg, who had also voiced secondary Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies duos such as the Goofy Gophers and Spike the Bulldog and Chester the Terrier. While it has been speculated that Pierce did voice-work for coming-attractions trailers for Universal Studios, experts in the voice acting field such as Keith Scott have disputed this point.

History  The theatre was designed in 1930 by Edward A. Stone,The exterior of the theatre was based on Stone's \\"Streatham Astoria Cinema\\" with an interior designed by Marc-Henri Levy and Gaston Laverdet.Earl and Sell (2000) pp. 132 Named after Prince Edward (at the time Prince of Wales, briefly Edward VIII and later Duke of Windsor), it opened on 3 April 1930 with a performance of the musical Rio Rita. Other notable events in its opening years included the London debut of famed cabaret artiste Josephine Baker, who performed her famous 'Bananas Dance'. In 1935, Stone converted the theatre to a dance and cabaret hall, being renamed the \\"London Casino\\". As the London Casino, it was badly damaged and all its windows lost on 10 May 1941, in London's worst air raid of the Second World War. All neighbouring buildings directly across Greek Street were destroyed. Stage alterations were undertaken by Thomas Braddock in 1942, and that year the building re-opened as the \\"Queensberry All Services Club\\"‚Äîa club for servicemen where the shows were broadcast on the BBC. After the war, the architects T. and E. Braddock restored the building to theatrical use, becoming the \\"London Casino\\" once again ‚Äî where the 'King of Yiddish Music', Leo Fuld, was a major attraction. The last production before Cinerama took over the building was Wish You Were Here, which included a full-size swimming pool on stage. Cinerama The three-projector, very-wide-screen Cinerama process had made its debut in New York in September 1952 with This Is Cinerama, a spectacular travelogue designed to make the most of the process, and an enormous box office success. The Cinerama Corporation chose the Casino Theatre for the UK debut of the system, and in 1954 architects Frank Baessler and T. and E. Braddock drew up plans for the conversion. This required the installation of three separate projection boxes at stalls level, and a 65 ft- wide-by-26 ft-high deeply curved screen in front of the proscenium. Five speakers behind the screen and others around the auditorium supported the system's seven-track stereophonic sound. Many front stall's seats were removed, and others were lost by the installation of the projection boxes. The sightlines from the upper circle were too poor, and it was taken out of use. Seating capacity was reduced to 1,337. The premiere of This Is Cinerama took place on 30 September 1954. Like all subsequent presentations, the film was shown on a theatrical basis, with reserved seats and an intermission, which was required to load the spools for the second half onto the single projectors in each box. Unlike future 'roadshow' practice, there were three shows a day and the film ran until 28 January 1956. From 3 February 1956, the second Cinerama film, Cinerama Holiday was presented, running until 22 February 1958. From 25 February 1958, the third Cinerama travelogue, Seven Wonders of the World played, running until 31 October 1959 before being replaced by South Seas Adventure from 3 November 1959 to 4 March 1961. The final Cinerama travelogue presentation was Search for Paradise from 8 March 1961 to 27 October 1962. The Casino was chosen for the World Premiere of How the West Was Won, the second (and final) narrative film in the three-strip Cinerama process. The premiere took place on 2 November 1962, and the film ran for 123 weeks, closing on 13 March 1965. This was the final three-strip presentation at the Casino, for the Cinerama corporation had in 1963 adopted 70mm \\"single lens\\" Cinerama as the future standard. The two outer projection boxes at the Casino were taken out of use, and the centre box enlarged to take two Philips DP70 projectors capable of 35mm and 70mm projection. The single-strip system had made its debut in the UK at the Coliseum Cinerama at the end of 1963, and the first film in the process at the Casino was The Greatest Story Ever Told, which ran from 8 April to 28 July 1965. The Casino now entered into a period of large-scale 70mm \\"presented in Cinerama\\" roadshow runs:- *The Hallelujah Trail (29 July ‚Äì 15 December 1965) *Battle of the Bulge (17 December 1965 ‚Äì 8 June 1966) *Khartoum (9 June 1966 ‚Äì 8 March 1967), a Royal World Premiere in the presence of HRH Princess Margaret *Grand Prix (9 March 1967 ‚Äì 8 November 1967) *Custer of the West (9 November 1967 ‚Äì 30 April 1968) *2001 A Space Odyssey (1 May 1968 ‚Äì 25 March 1969) *Ice Station Zebra (27 March ‚Äì 8 October 1969) *Winning (9 October ‚Äì 1 December 1969), a 35mm blow-up *Ben-Hur (26 December 1969 ‚Äì 6 May 1970) *Patton (7 May ‚Äì 14 October 1970) *Two Mules for Sister Sara (15 October ‚Äì 9 December 1970), a 35mm blow-up *Song of Norway (10 December 1970 ‚Äì 2 February 1972), a Royal Premiere in the presence of HRH Princess Alexandra For the next two years the Casino found the going increasingly tough, with revivals of old films and premieres of not-very-good new ones.

It is located in the historic region of Kuyavia. The town of Koronowo has an area of 2,818 ha and this makes it one of the largest towns in Bydgoszcz County. The Koronowo municipality has an area of 41,170 ha and 23,052 inhabitants. History In the Early Middle Ages, a Slavic stronghold was built in present-day Koronowo. It was included into the emerging Polish state in the 10th century and finally integrated with it in the 12th century. In 1288 the Cistercians from nearby Byszewo founded an abbey in Koronowo. The settlement prospered due to its location at the intersection of trade routes from Kuyavia and Greater Poland to Gda≈Ñsk, and from the Che≈Çmno Land to Western Pomerania. In 1359 King Casimir III the Great vested it with town privileges, which however were not implemented until 1370. The name Koronowo comes from the word korona (\\"crown\\"). Administratively it was located within the Inowroc≈Çaw Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province of the Polish Crown. A significant battle took place nearby in 1410 during the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian‚ÄìTeutonic War, in which Poland defeated the Teutonic Knights. King Casimir IV of Poland by virtue of privileges of 1476 and 1484, established two annual fairs and a weekly market. Among the main activities of the population were crafts, pottery, brewing and agriculture. In the 17th and early 18th century Koronowo suffered due to Swedish invasions, the Great Northern War and epidemics. King Augustus III of Poland established two more annual fairs to help revive the town. The town was annexed by Prussia in the late 18th century Partitions of Poland and was restored to Poland, after the country regained independence in 1918. German-occupied Koronowo 13 Polish soldiers were killed on September 2, 1939, during the German invasion of Poland, which started World War II.

It was a spin-off of Broadway's flagship series Powers That Be, in which the lead character had first appeared in 1995. Created by former Marvel Comics editor Jim Shooter, Fatale follows the adventures of Desir√©e Hopewell, a woman who has the ability to leech memories and energy from people by kissing them, and her battles with an evil organization called The Brotherhood. The series addressed the trend of super-muscular/voluptuous female heroes by featuring a lead character who was likewise large-breasted, and the series often poked fun at her physique and appearance; for several issues, Hopewell is shown with a bandaged, broken nose. The series ran for six issues, published between January and October 1996 (with an \\"ashcan\\" preview issue published in September 1995).

It was developed to ease the cumbersome nature of the large encryption/decryption matrix used in the four-square cipher while still being slightly stronger than the single-square Playfair cipher. The technique encrypts pairs of letters (digraphs), and thus falls into a category of ciphers known as polygraphic substitution ciphers. This adds significant strength to the encryption when compared with monographic substitution ciphers, which operate on single characters. The use of digraphs makes the two-square technique less susceptible to frequency analysis attacks, as the analysis must be done on 676 possible digraphs rather than just 26 for monographic substitution. The frequency analysis of digraphs is possible, but considerably more difficult, and it generally requires a much larger ciphertext in order to be useful.  History  F√©lix Delastelle described the cipher in his 1901 book Trait√© √©l√©mentaire de cryptographie under the name damiers bigrammatiques r√©duits (reduced digraphic checkerboard), with both horizontal and vertical types. The two-alphabet checkerboard was described by William F. Friedman in his book Advanced Military Cryptography (1931) and in the later Military Cryptanalysis and Military Cryptanalytics series. Friedman's co-author on Military Cryptanalytics, Lambros D. Callimahos described the cipher in Collier's Encyclopedia in the Cryptography article. The encyclopedia description was then adapted into an article in The Cryptogram of the American Cryptogram Association in 1972. After this, the cipher became a regular cipher type in ACA puzzles. In 1987, Noel Currer‚ÄêBriggs described the double Playfair cipher used by Germans in World War II. In this case, double Playfair refers to a method using two Polybius squares plus seriation. Even variants of Double Playfair that encipher each pair of letters twice are considered weaker than the double transposition cipher. WGBH Educational Foundation. \\"The Double Playfair Cipher\\". 2000\\\\. Other slight variants, also incorporating seriation, are described in Schick (1987) and David (1996). The two-square cipher is not described in some other 20th century popular cryptography books e.g. by Helen Fouch√© Gaines (1939) or William Maxwell Bowers (1959), although both describe the Playfair cipher and four-square cipher.  Using two-square  The two-square cipher uses two 5x5 matrices and comes in two varieties, horizontal and vertical. The horizontal two-square has the two matrices side by side. The vertical two-square has one below the other. Each of the 5x5 matrices contains the letters of the alphabet (usually omitting \\"Q\\" or putting both \\"I\\" and \\"J\\" in the same location to reduce the alphabet to fit). The alphabets in both squares are generally mixed alphabets, each based on some keyword or phrase. To generate the 5x5 matrices, one would first fill in the spaces in the matrix with the letters of a keyword or phrase (dropping any duplicate letters), then fill the remaining spaces with the rest of the letters of the alphabet in order (again omitting \\"Q\\" to reduce the alphabet to fit). The key can be written in the top rows of the table, from left to right, or in some other pattern, such as a spiral beginning in the upper-left-hand corner and ending in the center. The keyword together with the conventions for filling in the 5x5 table constitute the cipher key. The two-square algorithm allows for two separate keys, one for each matrix. As an example, here are the vertical two-square matrices for the keywords \\"example\\" and \\"keyword:\\" E X A M P L B C D F G H I J K N O R S T U V W Y Z K E Y W O R D A B C F G H I J L M N P S T U V X Z  Algorithm  Encryption using two-square is basically the same as the system used in four- square, except that the plaintext and ciphertext digraphs use the same matrixes. To encrypt a message, one would Follow these steps: * Split the payload message into digraphs. (help me obi wan kenobi becomes he lp me ob iw an ke no bi) * For a vertical two-square, the first character of both plaintext and ciphertext digraphs uses the top matrix, while the second character uses the bottom. * For a horizontal two-square, the first character of both digraphs uses the left matrix, while the second character uses the right. * Find the first letter in the digraph in the upper/left text matrix.

The method for decrypting is identical to the method for encryption. Just like Playfair (and unlike four-square), there are special circumstances when the two letters in a digraph are in the same column for vertical two- square or in the same row for horizontal two-square. For vertical two-square, a plaintext digraph that ends up with both characters in the same column gives the same digraph in the ciphertext. For horizontal two-square, a plaintext digraph with both characters in the same row gives (by convention) that digraph with the characters reversed in the ciphertext. In cryptography this is referred to as a transparency. (The horizontal version is sometimes called a reverse transparency.) Notice in the above example how the digraphs \\"HE\\" and \\"AN\\" mapped to themselves. A weakness of two-square is that about 20% of digraphs will be transparencies. E X A M P L B C D F G H I J K N O R S T U V W Y Z K E Y W O R D A B C F G H I J L M N P S T U V X Z  Two-square cryptanalysis  Like most pre-modern era ciphers, the two-square cipher can be easily cracked if there is enough text. Obtaining the key is relatively straightforward if both plaintext and ciphertext are known. When only the ciphertext is known, brute force cryptanalysis of the cipher involves searching through the key space for matches between the frequency of occurrence of digraphs (pairs of letters) and the known frequency of occurrence of digraphs in the assumed language of the original message. Cryptanalysis of two-square almost always revolves around the transparency weakness. Depending on whether vertical or horizontal two-square was used, either the ciphertext or the reverse of the ciphertext should show a significant number of plaintext fragments. In a large enough ciphertext sample, there are likely to be several transparent digraphs in a row, revealing possible word fragments. From these word fragments the analyst can generate candidate plaintext strings and work backwards to the keyword. A good tutorial on reconstructing the key for a two-square cipher can be found in chapter 7, \\"Solution to Polygraphic Substitution Systems,\\" of Field Manual 34-40-2, produced by the United States Army.

Greek mathematics refers to mathematics texts written during and ideas stemming from the Archaic through the Hellenistic periods, extant from the 7th century BC to the 4th century AD, around the shores of the Eastern Mediterranean. Greek mathematicians lived in cities spread over the entire Eastern Mediterranean from Italy to North Africa but were united by Greek culture and the Greek language. The word \\"mathematics\\" itself derives from the , meaning \\"subject of instruction\\". The study of mathematics for its own sake and the use of generalized mathematical theories and proofs is an important difference between Greek mathematics and those of preceding civilizations.Boyer, C.B. (1991), A History of Mathematics (2nd ed.), New York: Wiley, . p. 48 Origins of Greek mathematics The origin of Greek mathematics is not well documented. The earliest advanced civilizations in Greece and in Europe were the Minoan and later Mycenaean civilizations, both of which flourished during the 2nd millennium BC. While these civilizations possessed writing and were capable of advanced engineering, including four-story palaces with drainage and beehive tombs, they left behind no mathematical documents. Though no direct evidence is available, it is generally thought that the neighboring Babylonian and Egyptian civilizations had an influence on the younger Greek tradition. Between 800 BC and 600 BC, Greek mathematics generally lagged behind Greek literature, and very little is known about Greek mathematics from this period‚Äînearly all of which was passed down through later authors, beginning in the mid-4th century BC.Boyer & Merzbach (1991) pp. 43‚Äì61 Archaic and Classical periods Historians traditionally place the beginning of Greek mathematics proper to the age of Thales of Miletus (ca. 624‚Äì548 BC). Little is known about the life and work of Thales, so little indeed that his date of birth and death are estimated from the eclipse of 585 BC, which probably occurred while he was in his prime. Despite this, it is generally agreed that Thales is the first of the seven Wise Men of Greece. The two earliest mathematical theorems, Thales' theorem and the intercept theorem are attributed to Thales. The former, which states that an angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle, may have been learned by Thales while in Babylon but tradition attributes to Thales a demonstration of the theorem. It is for this reason that Thales is often hailed as the father of the deductive organization of mathematics and as the first true mathematician. Thales is also thought to be the earliest known man in history to whom specific mathematical discoveries have been attributed. Although it is not known whether or not Thales was the one who introduced into mathematics the logical structure that is so ubiquitous today, it is known that within two hundred years of Thales the Greeks had introduced logical structure and the idea of proof into mathematics. Statue of Euclid in the Oxford University Museum of Natural History Another important figure in the development of Greek mathematics is Pythagoras of Samos (ca. 580‚Äì500 BC). Like Thales, Pythagoras also traveled to Egypt and Babylon, then under the rule of Nebuchadnezzar,Heath (2003) pp. 36‚Äì111 but settled in Croton, Magna Graecia. Pythagoras established an order called the Pythagoreans, which held knowledge and property in common and hence all of the discoveries by individual Pythagoreans were attributed to the order. And since in antiquity it was customary to give all credit to the master, Pythagoras himself was given credit for the discoveries made by his order. Aristotle, for one, refused to attribute anything specifically to Pythagoras as an individual and only discussed the work of the Pythagoreans as a group. One of the most important characteristics of the Pythagorean order was that it maintained that the pursuit of philosophical and mathematical studies was a moral basis for the conduct of life. Indeed, the words philosophy (love of wisdom) and mathematics (that which is learned) are said to have been coined by Pythagoras. From this love of knowledge came many achievements. It has been customarily said that the Pythagoreans discovered most of the material in the first two books of Euclid's Elements. Distinguishing the work of Thales and Pythagoras from that of later and earlier mathematicians is difficult since none of their original works survive, except for possibly the surviving \\"Thales-fragments\\", which are of disputed reliability. However, many historians, such as Hans-Joachim Waschkies and Carl Boyer, have argued that much of the mathematical knowledge ascribed to Thales was developed later, particularly the aspects that rely on the concept of angles, while the use of general statements may have appeared earlier, such as those found on Greek legal texts inscribed on slabs.Hans- Joachim Waschkies, \\"Introduction\\" to \\"Part 1: The Beginning of Greek Mathematics\\" in Classics in the History of Greek Mathematics, pp. 11‚Äì12 The reason it is not clear exactly what either Thales or Pythagoras actually did is that almost no contemporary documentation has survived. The only evidence comes from traditions recorded in works such as Proclus‚Äô commentary on Euclid written centuries later. Some of these later works, such as Aristotle‚Äôs commentary on the Pythagoreans, are themselves only known from a few surviving fragments. Thales is supposed to have used geometry to solve problems such as calculating the height of pyramids based on the length of shadows, and the distance of ships from the shore. He is also credited by tradition with having made the first proof of two geometric theorems‚Äîthe \\"Theorem of Thales\\" and the \\"Intercept theorem\\" described above. Pythagoras is widely credited with recognizing the mathematical basis of musical harmony and, according to Proclus' commentary on Euclid, he discovered the theory of proportionals and constructed regular solids. Some modern historians have questioned whether he really constructed all five regular solids, suggesting instead that it is more reasonable to assume that he constructed just three of them. Some ancient sources attribute the discovery of the Pythagorean theorem to Pythagoras, whereas others claim it was a proof for the theorem that he discovered. Modern historians believe that the principle itself was known to the Babylonians and likely imported from them. The Pythagoreans regarded numerology and geometry as fundamental to understanding the nature of the universe and therefore central to their philosophical and religious ideas. They are credited with numerous mathematical advances, such as the discovery of irrational numbers. Historians credit them with a major role in the development of Greek mathematics (particularly number theory and geometry) into a coherent logical system based on clear definitions and proven theorems that was considered to be a subject worthy of study in its own right, without regard to the practical applications that had been the primary concern of the Egyptians and Babylonians. Hellenistic and Roman periods The Hellenistic period began in the 4th century BC with Alexander the Great's conquest of the eastern Mediterranean, Egypt, Mesopotamia, the Iranian plateau, Central Asia, and parts of India, leading to the spread of the Greek language and culture across these areas. Greek became the language of scholarship throughout the Hellenistic world, and Greek mathematics merged with Egyptian and Babylonian mathematics to give rise to a Hellenistic mathematics. Greek mathematics and astronomy reached an advanced level during the Hellenistic and Roman period, represented by scholars such as Hipparchus, Apollonius and Ptolemy, who were able to construct simple analogue computers, such as the Antikythera mechanism. The most important centre of learning during this period was Alexandria, in Egypt, which attracted scholars from across the Hellenistic world (mostly Greek and Egyptian, but also Jewish, Persian, Phoenician and even Indian scholars).George G. Joseph (2000). The Crest of the Peacock, p. 7-8. Princeton University Press. . Most of the mathematical texts written in Greek have been found in Greece, Egypt, Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, and Sicily. The Antikythera mechanism, an ancient mechanical calculator. Archimedes was able to use infinitesimals in a way that is similar to modern integral calculus. Using a technique dependent on a form of proof by contradiction he could reach answers to problems with an arbitrary degree of accuracy, while specifying the limits within which the answers lay. This technique is known as the method of exhaustion, and he employed it to approximate the value of œÄ (Pi). In The Quadrature of the Parabola, Archimedes proved that the area enclosed by a parabola and a straight line is times the area of a triangle with equal base and height. He expressed the solution to the problem as an infinite geometric series, whose sum was . In The Sand Reckoner, Archimedes set out to calculate the number of grains of sand that the universe could contain. In doing so, he challenged the notion that the number of grains of sand was too large to be counted, devising his own counting scheme based on the myriad, which denoted 10,000. Achievements Greek mathematics constitutes an important period in the history of mathematics: fundamental in respect of geometry and for the idea of formal proof. Greek mathematics also contributed importantly to ideas on number theory, mathematical analysis, applied mathematics, and, at times, approached close to integral calculus. Euclid, fl. 300 BC, collected the mathematical knowledge of his age in the Elements, a canon of geometry and elementary number theory for many centuries. The most characteristic product of Greek mathematics may be the theory of conic sections, which was largely developed in the Hellenistic period. The methods used made no explicit use of algebra, nor trigonometry. Eudoxus of Cnidus developed a theory of real numbers strikingly similar to the modern theory of the Dedekind cut, developed by Richard Dedekind, who acknowledged Eudoxus as inspiration. Transmission and the manuscript tradition Although the earliest Greek language texts on mathematics that have been found were written after the Hellenistic period, many of these are considered to be copies of works written during and before the Hellenistic period. The two major sources are * Byzantine codices, written some 500 to 1500 years after their originals, and * Syriac or Arabic translations of Greek works and Latin translations of the Arabic versions. Nevertheless, despite the lack of original manuscripts, the dates of Greek mathematics are more certain than the dates of surviving Babylonian or Egyptian sources because a large number of overlapping chronologies exist. Even so, many dates are uncertain; but the doubt is a matter of decades rather than centuries.

Early life  Pavlos Sidiropoulos was born on 27 July 1948 in Athens in a wealthy family. His father Kostas has been raised in a known family of merchants from Pontos and he owned the paper production company ELFOT, however politically was a supporter of the left. His mother Jenny was granddaughter of George Zorbas (the real person behind the novel Alexis Zorbas of Nikos Kazantzakis). He was also nephew of writer Elli Alexiou and poet Galatea Kazantzaki who was the first wife of Nikos Kazantzakis. He lived in Thessaloniki until the age of six in the house of his grandfather but after the birth of his sister Melina the family moved permanently to Athens, in the beginning at the neighborhood of Patisia and then in Kypseli. During his school years he was a good student although he was not studying a lot. He got interested in rock music during mid 60's through the music of the Animals and soon found himself attending concerts of Greek rock groups like the Charms. He finished school in 1967 and started his studies in the Department of Mathematics of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. There he met with fellow student and soon after songwriter Vangelis Germanos and they became roommates. During this period Pavlos Sidiropoulos was playing percussion and he was playing music together with his roommate. He was following the rock music scene of the city without having plans to follow a music career path. This was a period of intense political activity among students because of the military dictatorship governing Greece, but Sidiropoulos was not satisfied with the political student movement of his era and soon after he dropped out from his studies.  Art  Sidiropoulos began his career in 1970 in Thessaloniki, where he was studying math. Together with Pantelis Delleyannidis he founded the rock group \\"Damon and Phintias\\". A song of that era (\\"Clown\\") later came out in the album \\"Zorba the Freak\\". He never finished his studies, and he returned to Athens, disappointed by the revolutionary youth of Thessaloniki at the time, where he worked to his father's factory. They soon met, at \\"Kittaro\\" the Greek musician Dionysis Savvopoulos and his group \\"Bourboulia\\". They joined that group and participated in the album \\"Damis the tough\\" (Greek: ŒùœÑŒ¨ŒºŒ∑œÇ Œø œÉŒ∫ŒªŒ∑œÅœåœÇ). They stayed in this group for two years until 1974. It was through this group that Sidiropoulos first experimented with combining Greek and rock music. Afterward Sidiropoulos collaborated with the Greek composer Yannis Markopoulos: he sang in his compositions \\"Oropedio\\", \\"Thessalikos Kiklos\\" and \\"Electric Theseus\\" on lyrics by the poet Dimitris Varos. In 1976, together with Spiropoulos brothers, he founded the music group \\"Spiridoula\\". They created the album \\"Flou\\". It is considered to be the greatest rock album in the Greek rock scene ever, as \\"Flou\\" inspired many musicians and opened a completely different path to Greek audience. It was during this period that Sidiropoulos made his two film appearances. He had the leading role in the film \\"O Asymvivastos\\", directed by Andreas Thomopoulos. He also sang all of the songs of the soundtrack, written mostly by Thomopoulos, including 'Na m' Agapas'. At the same time, he starred (together with Dimitris Poulikakos) in another movie by Thomopoulos, \\"Aldevaran\\". Sidiropoulos also made one appearance on TV in a series called \\"Oikogeneia Zarnti\\", directed by Kostas Ferris. In 1980, Sidiropoulos joined the band \\"Oi Aprosarmostoi\\", where he remained until his death. They released several albums and made numerous live performances. In 1982 the album \\"En Leyko\\" was published, of which many of the songs were censored. In 1985, the LP \\"Zorba the Freak\\" was released, and in 1989 they released \\"Without Make-up\\" (in Greek), which was recorded live at Metro club in Athens. In the summer of 1990 and after his mother's death, his left hand started getting paralyzed, as a result of his long term drug use that he was trying to overcome for many years. He continued his live performances but the deterioration of his health had serious psychological implications. On 6 December 1990 he died from heart attack, caused by heroin overdose.  Posthumous releases  In 1991, his band \\"Oi Aprosarmostoi\\" released the album \\"Ante... ke Kali Tichi Maghes\\", named after one of his songs (released in 1985), the title of which can be interpreted as \\"So long folks\\". Some of the songs were sung by Sidiropoulos in earlier recordings; others by various artists. In 1992, the album \\"The Blues of the Prince\\" (in Greek) was released. It contained experimental recordings from 1979 to 1981. In this disc, Sidiropoulos combined the blues with the Greek musical style rebetiko. In 1994, the album \\"En Archi in o Logos\\" came out; it contained recordings between the years 1978 and 1989 and fragments of an interview of his on the Greek channel ET2. In 2001, the EP \\"Day after Day\\" came out; composed by the rocker's friend, Michael Karras, the songs were recorded in 1973 with Sidiropoulos, the band \\"Bourboulia\\" and bouzouki player Thanassis Polykandriotis. After Sidiropoulos's death, Karras discovered the lost recording and orchestrated the release of \\"Day after Day\\" through Minos-EMI in 2001.

Biography=Early life Blanche Stuart Scott was born on April 8, 1884, in Rochester, New York, to Belle and John Scott (1838-1903). Her father was a successful businessman who manufactured and sold patent medicine. Scott became an early enthusiast of the automobile. Her father bought a car and she drove it about the city in a time before there were minimum age restrictions on driving. In 1900 the family, still in Rochester, lived at 116 Weld Avenue. Scott's family considered her a tomboy and sent her to a finishing school. Automobile adventure Blanche Scott's Lady Overland motor trip stopping in Toledo, approximately 1910 In 1910 Scott became the second woman, after Alice Huyler Ramsey, to drive an automobile across the United States and the first driving westwards from New York City to San Francisco, California. The trip was sponsored by the Willys-Overland Company and the car was named the \\"Lady Overland\\". Scott and her passenger, a woman reporter called Gertrude Buffington Phillips, left New York on May 16, 1910, and reached San Francisco on July 23, 1910. The New York Times wrote on May 17, 1910: > Miss Scott, with Miss Phillips as only companion, starts on long trip with > the object of demonstrating the possibility of a woman driving a motor car > across the country and making all the necessary repairs en route. Miss > Blanche Stuart Scott yesterday started in an Overland automobile on a > transcontinental journey which will end in San Francisco. Achievements in aviation Poster for an air show in Oakland, California The publicity surrounding the automobile journey brought her to the attention of Jerome Fanciulli and Glenn Curtiss who agreed to provide her with flying lessons in Hammondsport, New York. She was the only woman to receive instruction directly from Curtiss. He fitted a limiter on the throttle of Scott's airplane to prevent it gaining enough speed to become airborne while she practiced taxiing on her own. On September 6 either the limiter moved or a gust of wind lifted the biplane and she flew to an altitude of forty feet before executing a gentle landing.Scott's first flight took place between September 2‚Äì12, 1910, but there is no verifiable evidence for an exact date so the Early Birds of Aviation certified Scott's achievement as occurring on the averaged date of September 6. Some U.S. institutions, such as the Smithsonian, prefer to give the earliest possible date of September 2. Her flight was short and possibly unintentional but Scott is credited by the Early Birds of Aviation as the first woman to pilot and solo in an airplane in the United States, although Bessica Medlar Raiche's flight on September 16 was accredited as first by the Aeronautical Society of America at the time. Scott subsequently became a professional pilot. On October 24, 1910, she made her debut as a member of the Curtiss exhibition team at an air meet in Fort Wayne, Indiana. She was the first woman to fly at a public event in America. Her exhibition flying earned her the nickname \\"Tomboy of the Air\\". She became an accomplished stunt pilot known for flying upside down and performing \\"death dives\\", diving from an altitude of 4000 feet and suddenly pulling up only 200 feet from the ground. In 1911 she became the first woman in America to fly long distance when she flew 60 miles non-stop from Mineola, New York. In 1912 Scott contracted to fly for Glenn Martin and became the first female test pilot when she flew Martin prototypes before the final blueprints for the aircraft had been made. In 1913 she joined the Ward exhibition team. She retired from flying in 1916 because she was bothered by the public's interest in air crashes and an aviation industry which allowed no opportunity for women to become mechanics or engineers. Scriptwriting and museum work In the 1930s Scott worked as a scriptwriter for RKO, Universal Studios and Warner Brothers in California. She also wrote, produced and performed on radio shows aired in California and Rochester. On September 6, 1948, Scott became the first American woman to fly in a jet when she was the passenger in a TF-80C piloted by Chuck Yeager. Knowing Scott's history as a stunt pilot, Yeager treated her to some snap rolls and a 14,000 foot dive. In 1954 Scott began working for the United States Air Force Museum, helping to acquire early aviation materials. Death and afterward Scott died on Monday, January 12, 1970, at Genesee Hospital in Rochester, New York, at age 84. She was cremated at Mount Hope Cemetery. Her grave is at Rochester's Riverside Cemetery.Blanche Stuart Scott Find-a-grave bio On December 30, 1980, the United States Postal Service issued an air mail stamp commemorating Scott's achievements in aviation.

The Ikhwan (, The Brethren), also Akhwan, was the first Saudi army made up of traditionally nomadic tribesmen which formed a significant military force of the ruler Ibn Saud and played an important role in establishing him as ruler of most of the Arabian Peninsula in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Ikhwan later became the Saudi Arabian National Guard. The Ikhwan first appeared around 1902. They were the product of clergy who aimed to break up the Bedouin tribes and settle them around the wells and oases of the sedentary Arab populations, mainly those of the Najd, on the grounds that nomadic life was incompatible with the strict conformity of their interpretation of Islam. The newly Islamicized Bedouin would be converted from nomad raiders to soldiers for Islam. The cleric/teachers of the Ikhwan were dedicated to their idea of the purification and the unification of Islam, and some of the newly converted Ikhwan rebelled against their emir Ibn Saud, accusing him of religious laxity. The conquest of the Hejaz in 1924 brought all of the current Saudi state under Ibn Saud's control. The monarch then found himself in conflict with elements of the Ikhwan. He crushed their power at the Battle of Sabilla in 1929,See Wilfred Thesiger's book Arabian Sands, Penguin, 1991, pps 248‚Äì249 following which the militia was reorganised into the Saudi Arabian National Guard. Background Faisal bin Sultan Al-Duwish One of the leaders of Ikhwan Sultan bin Bajad Al-Otaibi According to scholar David Commins, around 1913, the same time that Ibn Saud regained al-Hasa, there emerged in obscure circumstances a zealous movement known as the Ikhwan (Brethren). Salafi ulama went out to domesticate nomadic tribesmen, to convert them from idolatry to Islam and to make them soldiers for Saudi expansion. The Ikhwan became zealous religious warriors united and motivated by idealism more than allegiance to Ibn Saud. The result was a rebellion by some of the Ikhwan against their creator, who crushed them and in so doing reasserted dynastic power over the religious mission. The arid, remote region of Najd had been ruled by the House of Saud and religiously dominated by the Islamic revival movement known as Ikhwan-men-tah-allah (with some exceptions) since the mid-18th century. Ikhwant-men-tah-allah was a movement of townspeople, and traditionally thought of the beduin nomadic herders as \\"bearers of religious ignorance, jahiliyyah, and thus as raw material for conversion\\". To remedy this situation, the beduin were gathered in agricultural settlements known as hijra, where they were to be taught farming, crafts or trades and how to be \\"proper Muslims\\". There were 52 hujar (plural of hijra) by 1920 and 120 by 1929.Vassiliev, History of Saudi Arabia, p.225 Ikhwan were known for wearing white turbans rather than the traditional Arab Kufiya (roped headcloth), and for covering their faces when they encountered Europeans or Arabs from outside Saudi Arabia.Gold, Dore, Hatred's Kingdom, (Regnery Publishing, 2003), p.45 The pacification of the tribesmen was not entirely a success, and the former nomads continued their raids, which now had religious sanction and were bloodier than before. Unlike nomadic raiders, the Ikhwan earned \\"notoriety for routinely killing male captives\\" and for sometimes putting \\"children and women to death\\". From 1914 to 1926 Ibn Saud and Ikhwan-men-tah-allah leadership allied with him urged the Ikhwan to not attack or harass other nomads and townspeople of the Najd. From 1926 and 1930, the conflict was more serious, and effectively a rebellion and attempt to overthrow Ibn Saud by a minority of the Ikhwan leaders. With the conquest of the Hejaz in 1925, Ibn Saud had completed his territorial expansion and negotiated border agreements with his neighbors, the British protectorates of Transjordan, Iraq and Kuwait. Some Ikhwan leaders wanted to continue the expansion of the Ikhwan realm into these states, and launched raids into them. This left Ibn Saud responsible for military attacks originating in his country and facing British military power if he did not stop them. Differences with Ibn Saud In general the Ikhwan wished Ibn Saud to pursue strict Hanbali policies, while Ibn Saud sought more flexibility to adapt \\"policy to local circumstances\\" and maintain political stability, especially in newly conquered lands that had few Sunni believers. After conquest of the two holy cities of Mecca and Medina‚Äîwhich had been part of the Ottoman Empire for four centuries and developed a pluralistic religious culture‚ÄîIbn Saud sought to \\"reassured the Muslim world that a new Saudi regime would not disrupt the pilgrimage\\", while the Ikhwan \\"pressed for strict adherence to norms\\" such as forbidding smoking tobacco and worshiping at shrines. In 1926 meeting of Ikhwan leaders at al-Artawiya, found Ibn Saud at fault for \\"not upholding the sharp separation of belief and infidelity\\". Among his misdeeds were allowing two of his sons to travel to \\"idolatrous lands\\" (Faisal to England and Saud to Egypt); allowing (what they believed to be) idolatrous nomads from Iraq and Transjordan to pasture their animals in \\"the abode of Islam\\"; leniency towards Shiites; the introduction of modern inventions (car, telephone and telegraph); and (what they considered) illegal taxation of nomadic tribes. Ibn Saud attempted to mollify the Ikhwan by submitting their accusations to the religious scholars ('ulama'), who agreed on the need for more strict policies towards non-Sunni subjects, but also affirmed that only the ruler (Ibn Saud) had the right to declare jihad. Weaponry and combat style Ikhwan on the move The Ikhwan, being irregular tribesmen, relied mainly on traditional weapons such as lances and swords and sometimes old fashioned firearms. Usually, they attacked in the forms of raids which is a style Bedouins had always used in the deserts of Arabia. Those raiders travelled mainly on camels and some horses. Typically, every enemy male captured was killed by cutting his throat.David Howarth, The Desert King -- The Life of Ibn Saud, Collins, 1956 Raids on Transjordan Two notable raids on Emirate of Transjordan, a British protectorate, occurred in 1922 and 1924. In August 1922, some 1,500 Ikhwan camel mounted fighters led by Eqab bin Mohaya, attacked Transjordan. According to one account they retreated before they reached their objective‚Äîthe capital Amman.Noel Joseph Guckian. British Relations with Trans-Jordan, 1920-1930. University College of Wales, Aberystwyth. Ph.D Thesis: pp.217‚Äì218. May 1985. According to another account, they massacred the inhabitants of two small villages before being decimated by British armoured cars and planes.Peter W. Wilson, Douglas Graham. Saudi Arabia: the coming storm . M.E.Sharpe, 1994: p.143 In August 1924, another larger Ikhwan force, numbering around 4,500 raiders, travelled 1,600 kilometres from Najd to come within 15 kilometres of Amman before being spotted and attacked by British RAF aircraft. The Ikhwan army reportedly suffered 500 dead. Without the help of the RAF, Amman would most likely been captured by the Ikhwan.  Revolt and defeat  Ikhwan flag By 1927, the Saudi forces had overrun nearly all of the central Arabian Peninsula. The few areas not under Saudi control had treaties with Britain. Ibn Saud was sober enough to realize that it would be folly to provoke London and forbade further raiding. This edict did not sit well with the Ikhwan, who had been taught that all non-Wahabbis were infidels. In 1927 tribesmen of the Mutayr and Ajman rebelled against the ulama's judgment and the authority of Ibn Saud and engaged in cross-border raids into parts of Trans-Jordan, Iraq and Kuwait.Harold, Dickson. [Kuwait and her Neighbors], \\"George Allen & Unwin Ltd\\", 1956. pg 300-302 The destruction of an Iraqi police post provoked an international incident by violating the Saudi‚ÄìIraqi neutral zone between Iraq and Arabia established by Great Britain and Ibn Sa'ud (1927‚Äì28). The British bombed Najd in retaliation.The First Ikhwan Rebellion 1927-1928  Globe University Wars of the World A congress convened by Ibn Saud in October 1928 deposed Ibn Humayd ad-Dawish, and Ibn Hithlayn, the leaders of the revolt. The Ikhwanis also raided Kuwait in January 1928. With the Ikhwan leadership defiant, Abd al Aziz took to the field to lead his army, which was now supported by four British aircraft (flown by British pilots) and a fleet of 200 military vehicles that symbolized the modernization that the Ikhwan abhorred.Second Ikhwan Rebellion 1929-1930  Globe University Wars of the World After suffering a major defeat at the Battle of Sabilla (30 March 1929), the main body of Ikhwan surrendered to British forces on the Saudi-Kuwaiti frontier in January 1930. Ibn Saud completed the military defeat of the Ikhwan rebels \\"with a deft mix of punishment and rehabilitation\\" to avoid antagonizing the bulk of Ikhwan who had agreed with many of the rebels' complaints but remained on the sidelines. Rebel leaders Duwish and Ibn Bujad \\"died in captivity in Riyadh.\\" Their tribal followers were punished with the confiscation of \\"the lion's share of their camels and horses.\\" The remnants of the irregular Ikhwanis formed units in Ibn Saud's new military institution, initially known as the White Army, later called the National Guard. 1979 Grand Mosque seizure Insurgents who participated in the 1979 Grand Mosque seizure in Mecca referred to themselves as the 'al-Ikhwan', thus in their eyes justifying the seizure as a means to liberate the Kingdom from what they deemed as 'Western apostasy'. They were led by Juhayman al-Otaybi, an echo of his father's charge in 1921 against the former Saudi king. The seizure and its aftermath led to the increased power and influence of conservative clerics over Saudi political, cultural and social life, putting an abrupt end to the comparatively moderate outlook (at the time) of the kingdom towards modernization and Westernization.

History The mailing list was created in 1992 on a public Unix system by Andy Hawks, then in high school. After a fallout with the rest of the group, Andy destroyed the list of members early 1993 and took the list offline. Various subscribers have since continued the Future Culture list at a different address and the list moved from nyx.cs.du.edu, ending up on the UAFSYSB mainframe (fondly remembered as \\"list dad\\") at the University of Arkansas under the care of Clark Wilson Moore (June 27, 1953 - November 3, 2018) who sent and signed his emails \\"Alias Datura\\" (\\"list mom\\"). See here for a brief overview of the early days of Future Culture. Andy Hawk's original Future Culture Manifesto, also known as the Bubble Manifesto, can be considered to be an historical document reflecting the state of mind at the dawn of the Internet, specifically the aspect of \\"virtual culture\\". This document refers to key movements in the early 1990s that have led to ‚Äì and have strongly influenced ‚Äì how society thinks about and uses technology and specifically the internet. The pre-corporate Internet was envisioned as a place of massive movement of thought; the manifesto documents this and approaches the ideas of transformation: from an economic-based world to an ideas-based world. As it turned out, this did not happen, but the idea was documented here and referred to repeatedly in a variety of different media, especially by academics working in Internet-related fields of study. (cf MIT Media Lab (mediaMOO), as well as a variety of people working under the general rubric of PostModernism.) Although many of the Future Culture list were vehemently opposed to making the archives of their postings publicly available, a selectionIndex of /Zines/ASCII/Future.Culture of the emails that were exchanged during the initial period found their way to the web. These archived messages give a good impression of the topics that were typically discussed. An indication for the popularity of Future Culture during its hey- days, is that the group was mentioned on Billy Idol's album Cyberpunk. A document listing a variety of influences this mailing list has had on other groups or that carry on in the same memespace is found on Marius Watz' FutureCulture page. This page also serves as a link to a memorial for Michael Current, who was among the most active members. His death was a huge shock for the Future Culture community. An in-depth coverage of the events leading up his death, a hoax suicide threat, and the painful aftermath has been written Ten Reasons Why Essay: The Word and The Body by a Future Culture's member. This sad event was also an inspiration for Mia Lipner's sound art piece Requiem Digitatem.WandP Issue 17: HEARING THE NET: MIA LIPNERIssue 17 FutureCulture had part in 'liberating' the William Gibson work Agrippa: A Book of the Dead.Gibson, William: Agrippa: A Book of the Dead .Kirschenbaum, Matthew G: \\"Hacking 'Agrippa'\\": The Source of the Online Text\\" in Mechanisms: New Media and the New Textuality (forthcoming from MIT Press). .

The William Gibson quote \\"The street finds its own uses for things\\" was an appropriate guideline for the topics on the list. The topic of the mailing list, as stated in the accompanying, but rarely updated, Future Culture FAQ is to be a forum for \\"real-time discussion of cyberculture/new- edge/technoculture\\" which is a deliberately vague description of its contents. However, as time passed, the topics on the list drifted and the people on the list have, instead, formed a rather tight community discussing everything, including the stated topics, but more often personal and everyday things.

It is located on King Street West, in Toronto's downtown Entertainment District. The theatre's name has a triple meaning: it honours Diana, Princess of Wales, with whose consent the theatre was named; it links the building to its sister theatre, the Royal Alexandra, one block to the east, also named ‚Äì with Royal assent ‚Äì for a former Princess of Wales; and it recalls the Princess Theatre, Toronto's first \\"first-class legitimate\\" playhouse, that stood three blocks to the east until 1931. History Ed and David Mirvish built the theatre as a state-of-the-art facility to stage large- scale musicals for long runs. The family's Mirvish Productions owns Toronto's Royal Alexandra, Ed Mirvish (formerly the Canon), and Panasonic theatres. The Mirvish family owns the former Honest Ed's department store and the Markham Street \\"Markham Village\\" retail district, which are currently being rebuilt. Construction began on August 6, 1991. The project architect was Peter Smith, of the Toronto firm Lett-Smith. Smith was also responsible for the duMaurier Theatre Centre in Toronto and for the restoration of the Grand Theatre, in London, Ontario. For the Princess of Wales Theatre, David Mirvish commissioned a series of murals by American abstract expressionist painter and sculptor Frank Stella. The paintings‚Äî‚Äîcover the auditorium ceiling dome, the proscenium arch, the walls of lounges and lobbies on all four levels of the theatre and the outside back wall of the fly tower. They are believed to comprise one of the largest mural installations of modern times. Stella also designed the decorative fronts of the boxes and balconies and the decorative end-caps of the each seating row. The theatre has seating on three levels‚Äîorchestra, dress circle and balcony‚Äîwith elevator access to all levels and is configured as a traditional 19th century English proscenium theatre. Further, the entire theatre is barrier-free, enabling wheelchair access to all levels ‚Äî not a common occurrence in Toronto considering the age of many of its theatres. The Princess of Wales Theatre is designed to incorporate both traditional and contemporary design elements. The Toronto Star described it as \\"...a glittering glass jewelry case, a sparkling glimpse into a spectacle of total design.\\" It is often used for study by architecture, engineering, design, and theatre students. The theatre opened on May 26, 1993, with a Canadian production of the megamusical Miss Saigon. Subsequent productions in the Princess of Wales have included the musicals Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, Les Mis√©rables, Hairspray, Chicago, Oliver!, Cabaret, The Phantom of the Opera and The Sound of Music. A stage production of The Lord of the Rings made its world premiere in the facilities on February 8, 2006, losing money owing to terrible reviews and a lack of public interest. The original stage was gutted and replaced with a complex stage surface that includes three interlocking turntables and 17 independent elevators for this production. The National Theatre's production of War Horse opened at the theatre on February 10, 2012. On September 29, 2012, after operating for only 19 years, Mirvish Productions announced a plan to demolish the Princess of Wales Theatre in favour of a multi-purpose complex designed by Frank Gehry and which would include an extensive artwork collection available for public viewing, as well as museums, condominium units, and retail spaces. However, in response to criticism from city planners, Mirvish and Gehry announced a revised plan in May 2014 which would spare the structure.

McNeill's book Plagues and Peoples. The process described concerns the role of microbial disease in the conquering of people-groups. Particularly, it describes how diseases such as smallpox, measles, typhus, scarlet fever, and sexually-transmitted diseases have significantly reduced native populations so that they are unable to resist colonization.  Concept  According to McNeill's Law, the microbiological aspect of conquest and invasion has been the deciding principle or one of the deciding principles in both the expansion of certain empires (as during the emigration to the Americas) and the containment in others (as during the crusades). The argument is that less civilized peoples were easily subjugated due to the immunological advantages of those coming from civilized countries. An evidence presented to support the hypothesis involves the manner diseases associated with Europeans were rebuffed in their forays into disease-experienced countries such as China and Japan. McNeill's law also maintains that parasites are not only natural but also social in the sense that these organisms are part of the social continuum and that the human social evolution is inextricably linked with genetic transformations. Instances in history The first people-group fully wiped out due to European expansion (with the possible exception of the Arawaks) was the Guanches of the Canary Islands. Despite an inbred ferocity, superior knowledge of the land and even a possible tactical superiority, they were eventually wiped out through the concentrated efforts of the Spanish and Portuguese. McNeill's Law would place the deciding factor squarely on the introduction of deadly diseases and parasites from the mainland to the previously geographically isolated islanders. This is the likely explanation, as what records still exist show numerous deaths by disease on the islands and a declining birth-rate, leading eventually to the almost complete end of the Guanches as a race. Other instances include the devastation of the Incas by smallpox.

For centuries, the Salish-Kootenai used the island, approximately in size, in order to pasture horses and keep them from being stolen by other tribes. The island was part of the Flathead Indian Reservation from the time of its creation in 1872 up until its dismantlement in 1904, when the island was divided into individual plots of land. A number of attempts were made on the island towards agricultural development, but none succeeded. Between 1910-1915, homesteaders on the island cut down much of the old growth trees and introduced non-native grasses and other plant species. These species have competed with and overtaken much of the short-grass prairie that herbivorous wildlife need to survive. This short grass prairie is one of the last few remaining in Montana, and because of this efforts must be made to control various animal species on the island in order to preserve the grasses from over-pasturing and extinction. Bighorn Sheep, for example, are managed at around 100 sheep. In 2014, the population was between 160-200 sheep, and Montana Fish, Wildlife, & Parks worked to relocate 59 sheep to other herds in Northwest Montana. Three of the top five bighorn sheep recorded by the Boone and Crockett Club during the three years 2015-2018 came from Wild Horse Island in Montana.https://www.news-leader.com/story/news/2019/05/03/boone-crockett- records-barometer-game-species-health-size-bighorn-sheep/3662190002/ In December, 1887, Theodore Roosevelt proposed the formation of the Boone and Crockett Club at a dinner at his residence in New York City, primarily for maintaining a scoring and data collection system by which native North American big game animals are measured and tracked as a gauge of successful wildlife management.Boone and Crockett Club Protected as a state park since 1977, the island near Big Arm Bay is home to abundant wildlife including bighorn sheep, mule deer, waterfowl, and bald eagles. , the wild horse population was five mares and one gelding.

Several of his songs were at one time universally sung, and have obtained a more or less permanent place in the popular repertory. During his lifetime, Abt was a renowned choral conductor and he spent much of the last three decades of his life working as a guest conductor with choirs throughout Europe and in the United States. 500x500px Biography Abt was born at Eilenburg in Prussian Saxony, and showed musical talent at an early age. His father was a clergyman and a talented pianist, and it is he who gave Franz his earliest instruction in music. Like his father, Abt was interested in both music and theology, and he followed both pursuits at the Thomasschule Leipzig and Leipzig University with the ultimate intention of becoming a member of the clergy. While in school, Abt became friends with Albert Lortzing, Felix Mendelssohn, and Robert Schumann.Edward F. Kravitt: \\"Franz Abt\\", Grove Music Online ed. L. Macy (Accessed January 18, 2009), (subscription access) Portrait of Franz Abt, from the cover of an edition of his songs Upon the death of his father in 1837, Abt abandoned his theological studies and decided to concentrate entirely on music. It is at this time that he began to compose and publish music, mostly works for the piano which were written for performance in Leipzig's salons. In 1841 Abt became kapellmeister at Bernburg, then moved to Zurich in the same year where he became an immensely popular and skilled choirmaster, often conducting his own compositions. While in Zurich he was appointed director of almost all of the city's numerous choral societies in succession, often winning prizes for them. In 1852 Abt returned to Germany to become musical director at the court theater in Braunschweig where he served until 1882. Abt also remained active as a choral conductor during his time in Braunschweig. He was appointed director of the Hofkapelle in 1855, serving in that position for many years. He was also frequently invited to conduct choirs in many capital cities of Europe during the 1850s through the 1880s, having at this point developed an international reputation. He notably toured the U.S. in 1872 where he was received with overwhelming enthusiasm by music critics and the public alike. By 1882, his busy schedule wore him down to a state of ill health and he was forced to retire to Wiesbaden where he died in 1885. Music Abt's compositions comprise more than 600 opus numbers which make up over 3,000 individual items. He was primarily a composer of vocal music and was particularly prolific in writing music for male choirs which he thought was lacking in sufficient literature. Indeed, his greatest successes in Germany and Switzerland were obtained in part-songs for men's voices. Abt was also successful in writing choral music for mixed choruses both a cappella and with either piano or orchestral accompianement. He also wrote numerous popular vocal art songs for solo voice, part songs for multiple voices, and several songs for children. Franz Wilhelm Abt monument from 1960 in Braunschweig Abt's compositional style betrays an easy fluency of invention, couched in pleasing popular forms, but without pretence to depth or individuality. Many of his songs, were at one time universally sung, and have obtained a more or less permanent place in the popular repertory. Due to their simple and melodic style some of Abt's songs, such as Wenn die Schwalben heimw√§rts ziehn and Die stille Wasserrose are easily mistaken for genuine folksong. Abt's other compositions include three operas: Des K√∂nigs Scharfsch√ºtz, Die Hauptprobe, and Reisebekanntschaften. In the early part of his life Abt composed much for the piano, chiefly pieces of light salon character. These have never had the same popularity as his vocal works.

Kansas City Southern de M√©xico was originally formed in 1996 when Kansas City Southern Industries and Transportaci√≥n Maritima Mexicana (TMM) purchased a government concession to operate on a rail system in Mexico. It was the Mexican President, Ernesto Zedillo who proposed the privatisation of the Mexican railways because the Mexican railway system had fallen into a state of disrepair and needed drastic work to become profitable. Since the late 1930s, Mexican trains and tracks were property of the government as Ferrocarriles Nacionales de M√©xico (Mexican National Railways). The nationalized railroad operated successfully for many years, yet, by the 1990s, the system was so poorly run, that US railways would not even send rail cars into Mexico, for fear that they would not be returned. When the decision to privatize the railroad was made, only 15% of freight was moved by rail in Mexico (versus 42% in the USOverview of U.S. Freight Railroads , from the National Atlas.gov.). The most sought-after portion of the concessions, called the Northeast Railroad, was bid on by many major companies, including the United States's largest railroad company, Union Pacific Railroad. This concession included about of track with connections to many key cities, including Monterrey, Mexico City, and Laredo.

Sanders later moved to New York and married Anna Reid in 1836. His father-in-law was Samuel Chester Reid. He was involved in the Young America Movement and was an editor for the \\"Democratic Review.\\" Revolutionary ideas and causes Sanders was a supporter of President James K. Polk and was later awarded the position of Consul in London during the administration of Franklin Pierce. He became involved in what, at the time, were regarded as revolutionary and anarchist causes and needed to be recalled. He had supposedly been involved in plans to assassinate heads of state, including French Emperor Napoleon III, or foment causes to bring about democratic reform. During the Civil War, he was involved in activities in Montreal that were supposed to support the Confederacy by unorthodox means. He had also made several trips to Europe to further the cause of the Southern States. Lincoln assassination After the assassination of Lincoln, attempts were made to take Sanders into custody, but he fled to Canada and Europe. He later returned to the United States soon before he died in 1873 in New York. He is buried in an unmarked grave in Greenwood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. In his book Murdering Mr. Lincoln, author Charles Higham asserts that Sanders was involved in the assassination, and was the driving force behind it. He argues that Sanders saw Lincoln had the potential of becoming a dictator. Lincoln had done things that violated the U.S. Constitution during the War. His book alleges that in June 1864, Sanders was in Montreal, Canada, Sanders was plotting against Lincoln with the Confederate Secret Service. Higham asserts that when John Wilkes Booth, Lincoln's assassin, arrived in Montreal in October of 1864, he fell under the influence of Sanders and arranged Lincoln's assassination there. In 1864, General Ulysses S. Grant suspended trade with the Confederate Army, which Lincoln had allowed a limited amount.

State requirements vary by state; for an example, see the New York state portal for withholding tax. *Withholding tax on payments to foreign persons, and *Backup withholding on dividends and interest. The amount of tax withheld is based on the amount of payment subject to tax. Withholding of tax on wages includes income tax, social security and medicare, and a few taxes in some states. Certain minimum amounts of wage income are not subject to income tax withholding. Wage withholding is based on wages actually paid and employee declarations on federal and state Forms W-4. Social Security tax withholding terminates when payments from one employer exceed the maximum wage base during the year. Amounts withheld by payers (employers or others) must be remitted to the relevant government promptly. Amounts subject to withholding and taxes withheld are reported to payees and the government annually. History During World War II, Congress introduced payroll withholding and quarterly tax payments with the vote of the Current Tax Payment Act of 1943 : In their History of the U.S. Tax System, the U.S. Department of Treasury describes tax withholding. > This greatly eased the collection of the tax for both the taxpayer and the > Bureau of Internal Revenue.

Withholding on wages In the US, withholding by employers of tax on wages is required by the federal, most state, and some local governments. Taxes withheld include federal income tax,26 USC 3401-3406 Social Security and Medicare taxes,26 USC 3101-3128 state income tax, and certain other levies by a few states. Income tax withheld on wages is based on the amount of wages less an amount for declared withholding allowances (often called exemptions).See IRS Publication 919. Withholding for allowances are calculated based on the assumption of a full year of wages. Amounts of tax withheld are determined by the employer. Tax rates and withholding tables apply separately at the federal,Current federal tables and withholding rates appear in IRS Publication 15. most state, and some local levels. The amount to be withheld is based on both the amount wages paid on any paycheck and the period covered by the paycheck. Federal and some state withholding amounts are at graduated rates, so higher wages have higher withholding percentages. Withheld income taxes are treated by employees as a payment on account of tax due for the year,26 USC 31 which is determined on the annual income tax return filed after the end of the year (federal Form 1040 series, and appropriate state forms). Withholdings in excess of tax so determined are refunded. Under Internal Revenue Code section 3402(f)(2) and related U.S. Treasury regulations, an employee must provide the employer with a Federal Form W-4, \\"Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate.\\"See generally 26 C.F.R. sec. 31.3402(f)(5)-1 and 26 C.F.R. sec. 31.3402(f)(2)-1. Most states will accept the W4 form, but a few have a similar form, especially if the employee is filing different information at the state level than at the federal (an employee may be paying a different amount in withholding or claiming a different number of exemptions at the state level than the federal level). The form provides the employer with a Social Security number. Also, on the form employees declare the number of withholding allowances they believe they are entitled to. Allowances are generally based on the number of personal exemptions plus an amount for itemized deductions, losses, or credits. Employers are entitled to rely on employee declarations on Form W-4 unless they know they are wrong. Social Security tax is withheld from wages26 USC 3102. at a flat rate of 6.2% (4.2% for 2011 and 2012Payroll Tax Cut to Boost Take-Home Pay for Most Workers). Wages paid above a fixed amount each year by any one employee are not subject to Social Security tax. For 2015, this wage maximum is $118,500.https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc751.html Medicare tax of 1.45% is withheld from wages, with no maximum.26 USC 3101. (This brings the total federal payroll tax withholding to 7.65%.) Employers are required to pay an additional equal amount of Medicare taxes, and a 6.2% rate of Social Security taxes.26 USC 3111. Many states also impose additional taxes that are withheld from wages. Wages are defined somewhat differently for different withholding tax purposes. Thus, federal income tax wages26 USC 3401(a). may differ from Social Security wages26 USC 3121(a). which may differ from state wages. Withholding on payments to foreign persons Companies and individuals who make certain types of payments to foreign persons must withhold federal income tax on those payments.26 USC 1441-1474IRS Publication 515 Foreign persons include nonresident aliens, foreign corporations, and foreign partnerships.[26 USC 7701]. Payments subject to withholding include compensation for services, interest, dividends, rents, royalties, annuities, and certain other payments.26 USC 1441 and 26 USC 1442. Tax is withheld at 30% of the gross amount of the payment. This withholding rate may be reduced under a tax treaty. This tax withheld is usually considered a final determination and payment of tax, requiring no further action or tax return by the foreign person. In addition, partnerships are required to make tax paymentshttps://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/international/article/0,,id=105063,00.html (referred to as withholding) on behalf of foreign partners.26 USC 1441 and 26 USC 1446. These payments are required regardless of whether income is actually distributed to the partner. Payments are also required quarterly or at year end for business income or other undistributed income. Partnership payments on business income are treated like estimated tax payments, and the foreign person must still file a U.S. tax return reporting the business income. Purchasers of U.S. real estate must withhold 10% of the sales price from payments to foreign sellers.26 USC 1445. This amount can be reduced to the anticipated federal income tax due, upon advance application on Form 8288-B to the Internal Revenue Service. These payments are treated like estimated tax payments, and the foreign person must still file a U.S. tax return reporting any gain or loss. Backup withholding Payers of interest, dividends, and certain other items must withhold 28% Federal income tax on such payments in limited circumstances.26 USC 3406. See IRS Publication 1281. Generally, this applies only if the recipient is a U.S. person, and either *the person has failed to provide a tax identification number on Form W-9 to the payer, or *the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has notified the payer that the payer must withhold. Payment of withheld taxes Withheld taxes must be paid to the appropriate government promptly. Rules vary by jurisdiction and by balance of total payments due. Federal employment tax payments are due either monthly or semi-weekly.See IRS Publication 15. Federal tax payments must be made either by deposit to a national bank or by electronic funds transfer. If the balance of federal tax payments exceeds $100,000, it must be paid within one banking day. Beginning January 1, 2011, payments may be made only by electronic funds transfer.https://www.irs.gov/businesses/article/0,,id=227767,00.html State rules vary widely, and generally allow slightly more time for deposit of withheld taxes. Reporting of withheld taxes Employers must file a quarterly report of aggregate withholding taxes, Form 941, with the Internal Revenue Service. This report includes income, Social Security, and Medicare tax totals for the quarter. Partnerships making payments for partners must file Form 8813 quarterly. State requirements vary. All persons withholding taxes must file annual Federal and state reports of the tax withheld and the amount subject to withholding. A copy must be provided to the employee or other payee. The relevant forms are as follows: *Form W-2 series for wages (the Federal report is also used for states), due to employees by January 31. A summary is filed on Form W-3. *Form 1042-S for payments to foreign persons, due to payees by March 15. A summary is filed on Form 1042. *Form 8805 for partnership payments, due at the same time as the partnership return. A summary is filed on Form 8804. *Form 1099 series for backup withholding Federal filings must be done electronically if more than 250 forms are required.See IRS Form W-2 instructions and Form 1099 instructions. States generally do not require separate filings other than for partnerships, instead relying on information provided by the IRS. Penalties Failing to pay Federal taxes withheld can result in a penalty of 100% of the amount not paid. This may be assessed against anyone responsible for the funds from which payment of withheld tax could have been made. Paying withheld Federal taxes late may result in penalties up to 10%, plus interest, on the balance paid late. State penalties vary. Failure to timely file withholding tax forms may result in penalties up to $50 per form not filed. Intentional failures may result in criminal penalties.

As, therefore, the consecration at Mass must be effected in both species, of bread and wine, an abstemius is consequently irregular. de jure divino vs. canonical law St. Alphonsus Liguori, following the opinion of Suarez, teaches that such irregularity is de jure divino (Latin: \\"of divine law\\"); and that, therefore, the Pope cannot dispense from it. The term is also applied to one who has a strong distaste for wine, though able to take a small quantity. A distaste of this nature does not constitute irregularity, but a papal dispensation is required, in order to excuse from the use of wine at the purification of the chalice and the ablution of the priest's fingers at the end of a Mass celebrated in the Tridentine Mass. In these cases the use of wine is a canonical law from whose observance the Church has power to dispense. A decree of the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith, dated 13 January 1665, grants a dispensation in this sense to missionaries in China, on account of the scarcity of wine; various similar rulings are to be found in the collection of the decrees of the Sacred Congregation of Rites. Views of Heretics Abstention from the use of wine has, occasionally, been declared obligatory by heretics. It was one of the tenets of Gnosticism in the 2nd century. Tatian, the founder of the sect known as the Encratites, forbade the use of wine, and his adherents refused to make use of it even in the Sacrament of the Altar; in its place they used water. These heretics, mentioned by St. Iren√¶us (Adversus haereses, I, xxx), are known as Hydroparastes, Aquarians, and Encratites. The great Manichaean heresy followed a few years later. These heretics, in their turn, professed the greatest possible aversion to wine, as one of the sources of sin. St. Augustine, in his book against heresies, ch. xlvi, says of them, Vinum non- bibunt, dicentes esse fel principum tenebrarum ‚Äì \\" They drink no wine, for they say it is the gall of the princes of darkness.\\" They made use of water in celebrating Mass. Aabstemii on a somewhat different principle have appeared in more recent times. These are total abstainers, who maintain that the use of stimulants is essentially sinful, and allege that the wine used by Christ and his disciples at the supper was unfermented. They accordingly communicate in the unfermented \\"juice of the grape.\\" Controversy over the reception of both species At the beginning of the Reformation, one of the grievances alleged against the Church was that she did not allow the faithful to communicate under both kinds. \\"We excuse the Church\\", so runs the Augsburg Confession, \\"which has suffered the injustice of only receiving under one kind, not being able to have both; but we do not excuse the authors of this injustice, who maintain that it was right to forbid the administering of the complete Sacrament.\\" How, then, were those to be admitted to the Lord's Table, who were unable to communicate under the species of wine? A decree of the Synod of Poitiers, in 1560, reads: \\"The Bread of the Lord's Supper shall be administered to those who cannot drink the wine, on condition that they shall declare that they do not abstain out of contempt.\\" Other Protestant synods also lay down the rule that persons unable to take wine shall be admitted to the Lord's Table on condition that they shall at least touch with their lips the cup which holds the species of wine; Jurieu, on the other hand, starting from the principle that Christ has founded the essence of the Eucharist on the two species, held that an abstemius does not receive the Sacrament, because it consists of two parts, and he receives only one. A great controversy ensued among the Protestants themselves on this point. Bossuet held that communion under both kinds could not be of divine obligation, since many would thereby be deprived of the Sacrament owing to a natural weakness.

It is accessed by a dedicated ferry service operating from the Waterton Park Townsite. The first part of the trail offers the choice of two alternate routes for ascent and return running through forest, the longer of which passes the impressive Hellroaring Falls. After that the trail becomes an open walk through a valley crossing small mountain streams and leading up to the views of Crypt Falls. The cascading Crypt Falls are over high and are fed by Crypt Lake in the hanging valley above the falls. The last part of the trail is the ascent to Crypt Lake. This part is more challenging; in parts the walk runs at the edge of steep drops, secured by cable and also involves crawling through a narrow, but short, tunnel. Finally the trail reaches the shores of Crypt Lake through a small forest. The shores of Crypt Lake Crypt Lake Crypt Lake is a pristine alpine lake occupying a cirque that often has ice into August. Most of the area around the lake is covered in scree and/or snow, and hiking around the circumference of the lake requires approximately 45 minutes. Wildlife can be spotted in the mountains towering above including mountain goat and bighorn sheep. From Crypt Lake it is only a short walk to the edge of Crypt Falls with views over the valley below. A view from the brink of Crypt Falls of the valley below. Hiking The Crypt Lake Hike was voted \\"Canada's Best Hike\\" in 1981. The hike is accessed via the local ferry service, and begins with a gradual climb through shaded forests. As visitors progress into the hanging valley, the forest begins to thin out, and the strenuous section of the hike begins. Immediately after Burnt Rock Falls, the hike steadily climbs up onto the open alpine mountain side. This section of the hike, offers views of the Crypt Valley as well as that of the cascading Crypt Falls. After hiking along the mountain side, hikers arrive at the Crypt Lake Campground. This camping area was provided for overnight backpackers and was equipped with an outhouse and fireplace. However, the campground is now permanently closed and is no longer equipped with a fireplace. After continuing over the alpine creek adjacent to the campground, hikers follow the trail towards the ledge and tunnel. The ledge is about wide, and continues over to a steel ladder and access to the tunnel. For nearly , hikers crawl through a natural mountain tunnel before arriving at the cable transverse. This section of the hike involves a scramble along a sheer cliff, with the assistance of a steel cable. After the scramble, the route passes through a shaded forest before arriving at Crypt Lake. The hike is a total of round trip, with a gradual elevation gain. The southern tip of Crypt Lake skirts Canada's international border with the United States, and the trail enters the United States for less than , meaning that hikers technically enter the United States illegally. However, there is no border- related signage or warnings, and no legal consequences for hikers, as entry any further into the United States at this location is impossible due to sheer mountain cliffs at the south end of the lake. Wildlife The slopes along the Crypt Lake Trail serve as primary bear country. Both grizzly bear and black bear can be seen on this trail. It is important to check with the visitor information centre and/or ferry service regarding recent bear sightings on the trail. Other large mammal species that call the Crypt Valley home include bighorn sheep, moose, mountain goat, mule deer and white-tailed deer. It is not uncommon to see striped or least chipmunk frequenting the trail, as well as other rodent species, such as hoary marmot, yellow-bellied marmot, red squirrel and Richardson's ground squirrel. Crypt Lake itself is stocked with cutthroat trout and is one of several destinations for local fishermen in the park. Ferry service Ferry service from the Waterton townsite brings hikers to the trail head twice in the morning and returns to pick them up, twice in the late afternoon (off of peak season [May‚ÄìJune, Sept- Oct], ferry services only make 1 round trip per day.) The time span is reasonable to perform the whole trail, but it's always a good idea to keep an eye on the time. There is no potable drinking water provided at the trail head (ferry landing site) or anywhere along the trail. There is an outhouse at the start of the trail where the ferry docks, and near the top of the trail at the designated campground before crossing to the cave entrance, however hikers are advised to bring their own toilet paper.

He is known for his religious compositions and portraits as well as his extensive output of designs for prints. He was active in Antwerp which he left for some time because of the prosecution of persons adhering to his religious convictions.Chrispijn van den Broeck at the museum boijmans van beuningen Life Chrispijn van den Broeck was born in Mechelen as the son of Jan van den Broeck, a painter. His family members included artists who were active in Mechelen. His family also used the latinised name 'Paludanus'. The latinized name is based on the Latin translation ('palus') of the Dutch word 'broeck' which is part of the family name and means a marsh or swamp land. He was likely a relative of the sculptor and painter Willem van den Broecke and the painter Hendrick van den Broeck.J. Duverger and M.J. Onghena, 'Enkele nieuwe gegevens betreffende beeldhouwer W. van den Broecke alias Paludanus (1530-1580', Gentsche bijdragen tot de kunstgeschiedenis 8 (1942), p. 173-204 He was probably trained by his father. He moved to Antwerp some time before 1555 since Chrispijn was registered as a master painter of the Guild of St. Luke of Antwerp for the first time in 1555.Kerstiaen vanden Broecke at art index Ph. Rombouts and Th. van Lerius, De liggeren en andere historische archieven der Antwerpsche sint Lucasgilde Volume 1, Antwerp, 1864, p. 170 Christ healing the sick Chrispijn was then working in the workshop of the leading history painter Frans Floris. Frans Floris was one of the Romanist painters active in Antwerp. The Romanists were Netherlandish artists who had trained in Italy and upon their return to their home countries painted in a style that assimilated Italian influences into the Northern painting tradition.Ilja M. Veldman. \\"Romanism.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 26 September 2019 Van den Broeck remained in Frans Floris' workshop until the master's death in 1570. He was together with Frans Pourbus the Elder one of the collaborators of Floris who helped finish Floris' paintings after the master had become incapacitated due to the alcoholism in which he had sunk in his later years. According to the Flemish contemporary art historian and artist Karel van Mander, Chrispijn van den Broeck and Frans Pourbus completed an altarpiece for the Grand Prior of Spain left incomplete at the time of Floris' death.Frans Jozef Peter Van den Branden, Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche schilderschool, Antwerpen, 1883, p. 213 The last judgement Van den Broeck became a citizen of Antwerp in 1559. He married Barbara de Bruyn. Their daughter Barbara van den Broeck (1560 -?) became an engraver who mainly created reproductions after her father's work. Crispijn may have lived in Italy for some time, but there is no evidence of this. He received a pupil named Niclaes Ficet in his Antwerp workshop in 1577.De Liggeren, 1864, p. 266 In 1584, van de Broeck resided in Middelburg for a short time to escape the political and religious unrest in Antwerp. His name was last mentioned in the Guild records of 1589 in connection with a payment.De Liggeren, 1864, p. 337 His wife is mentioned as a widow on 6 February 1591. Chrispijn van den Broeck must therefore have died sometime between 1589 and 6 February 1591, most likely in Antwerp. Work Van Mander stated that Chrispijn van den Broeck was 'a good inventor... clever at large nudes and just as good an architect'. The latter may refer to his involvement in temporary constructions and decorations during festivities in the city, such as the theatre competition called the Landjuweel held in Antwerp in 1561 and the Joyous Entries in Antwerp of 1570 and 1582. Two Young Men, Fitzwilliam Museum About 23 paintings are attributed to Chrispijn van den Broeck, some of which are signed. From 16th and 17th century inventories in Antwerp van den Broeck's work is regularly mentioned, which indicates that his output must have been larger. While there is no evidence that the artist visited Italy, his work shows the influence of the Venetian Jacopo Bassano in the use of large, solid figures placed within a landscape. As he was a pupil of the Romanist Frans Floris who did study in Italy he may have received the Italian influence through his master. He may also have seen prints after Italian artworks. Van den Broeck further adopted Floris technique of applying a brown preparatory ground underneath the main colours of his paintings. As a result his works typically display a brown hue. His palette favours pink, brown, grey and yellow tones.Crispin van den Broeck (1524-91), Christ Healing the Sick, at the Royal Collections Trust Avarice, the danger of wealth Van den Broeck's painting Two Young Men (Fitzwilliam Museum) is a double portrait of two cheerful young men or adolescent boys. They are wearing fancy clothes in Italian fashion which were likely also worn by fashionable young men in 16th century Flanders. Their embrace and smiling glances show that the relationship between the two men is close. The boy in black seems to be offering his friend an apple while he looks at the viewer with a smile. The other boy looks with a smile at the boy in black. While an apple was often used as a symbol of physical love, it would be wrong to assume the painting depicts two homosexual lovers. The boys' physical likeness indicates that they are more likely brothers. Based on the symbols used throughout the painting, its subject appears to be death. Two dark owl heads peek out over each shoulder of the boy in black while a crow‚Äôs or raven's head in profile with its sharp beak pointed towards the boy in black juts out from the right side of the head of the boy in red. Both the owl and the raven are traditional symbols of death. The stone panel at the top of the picture bears the artist's initials and recalls funerary sculpture.Crispin van den Broeck, 1524 ‚Äì c.1590, Two young men, at the Fitzwilliam Museum A total of 146 drawings have been attributed with certainty to van den Broeck. Of these, 89 are designs for engravings. His earliest drawing is dated 1560. It is possible that his tendency to accentuate the contours of forms made his drawings suited as designs for prints. Whether Van den Broeck himself also etched or engraved is unknown. From 1566 onwards van den Broeck started to create design drawings for publications by Christoffel Plantin, such as for Benito Arias Montano's Humanae salutis monumenta published in 1571. Van den Broeck also worked for print publishers Gerard de Jode, Adriaen Huybrechts, Hans van Luijck, Willem van Haecht the Elder and Plantin's successor Jan Moretus I.James Clifton, The Triumph of Truth in an Age of Confessional Conflict, in: Walter Melion, Bart Ramakers, 'Personification: Embodying Meaning and Emotion', Brill, 2016, pp 166-167 His designs were engraved by engravers such as Abraham de Bruyn, Jan Collaert the Elder and Johannes Wierix. He designed the illustration of the allegory of the Low Countries used in Lodovico Guicciardini's Descrizione di tutti I Paesi Bassi (1567).

Each week a new theme was chosen and viewers chose the top ten to be featured on the show. The top two games would be put in a Filter Face-off, where the winner was revealed. Shows included the top ten Final Fantasy games, worst games of all time, and all-time top-ten platformers. After the purchase of TechTV, Filter was revamped to include more pop culture lists such as theatrical and DVD movie releases, music concerts, and consumer technology.

With a drainage basin extending over and an average discharge of , the Flathead is the largest tributary of the Clark Fork and constitutes over half of its flow.  Course  The Flathead River rises in forks in the Rocky Mountains of northwestern Montana. The largest tributary is the North Fork, which runs from the Canadian province of British Columbia southwards. The North Fork is sometimes considered the main stem of the Flathead River. Near West Glacier the North Fork combines with the Middle Fork to form the main Flathead River. The river then flows westwards to join the South Fork and cuts between the Whitefish Range and Swan Range via Bad Rock Canyon. All of the headwaters forks are entirely or in part designated National Wild and Scenic Rivers. After the river leaves the canyon it flows into the broad Flathead Valley and arcs southwest, passing Columbia Falls and Kalispell, before it is joined by the Stillwater River and its Whitefish River tributary, and then empties into Flathead Lake, where the Swan River joins. Near Polson the river leaves the natural basin of Flathead Lake, but first passes through Kerr Dam, which maintains the level of Flathead Lake artificially. After flowing through the dam the river turns south and meanders through the Flathead Valley west of the Mission Mountains, and at Dixon it is joined by the small Jocko River. At the Jocko River confluence it turns west, and a few miles after flows into the Clark Fork near Paradise.Course info mainly from:  History  Fur traders employed by the North West Company and Hudson's Bay Company entered the Flathead Valley in the early 19th century.

Both countries claim to be the place of origin of the dish. It is eaten daily in those countries and can be served with accompaniments such as cheese, cuajada (fresh cheese), various meats, chicken, avocado, or diablito (deviled ham spread). It can also be split to make sandwiches. Sizes, maize types, and added ingredients vary its preparation. It is similar in shape to the Mexican gordita and the Salvadoran pupusa. Origins The arepa is a pre-Columbian dish from the area that is now Colombia and Venezuela. Instruments used to make flour for the arepas, and the clay slabs on which they were cooked, were often found at archaeological sites in the area. Although it has not been specified in which country an arepa was cooked for the first time, it has been possible to define the oldest dates of the presence of maize in Colombia and in Venezuela. For example, In Colombia, the first record of the existence of corn dates from about 3,000 years ago, while in Venezuela the estimate is about 2,800 years ago. In other words, the creation of the arepa most likely happened almost simultaneously in both countries, but well before either territory became a country with demarcated borders. Throughout its history, the arepa has stayed mainly unchanged from the arepas that pre-Columbian native peoples would have consumed, making the arepa one of the few pre-contact traditions that have remained popular in the years since colonization. Arepas being prepared Characteristics The arepa is a flat, round, unleavened patty of soaked, ground kernels of maize, or‚Äîmore frequently nowadays‚Äîmaize meal or maize flour that can be grilled, baked, fried, boiled or steamed. The characteristics vary by color, flavor, size, and the food with which it may be stuffed, depending on the region. Simple arepas are filled with butter or cheese and baked. More filling varieties can be topped or filled with combinations of ingredients like beans, meat, avocados, eggs, tomatoes, salad, shrimp, or fish depending on the meal. Production The flour is mixed with water and salt, and occasionally oil, butter, eggs, and/or milk. Because the flour is already cooked, the blend forms into patties easily. After being kneaded and formed, the patties are fried, grilled, or baked. Some varieties of arepas are made with \\"peeled\\" corn using the nixtamalization process, they are known as \\"arepa pelada\\".https://www.canalrcn.com/el-desayuno/amp/recetas/receta-arepas- santandereanas-8387/ Arepa flour is specially prepared (cooked in water, then dried) for making arepas and other maize dough-based dishes, such as hallacas, bollos, tamales, empanadas, atole and chicha. The flour may be called masarepa, masa de arepa, masa al instante, or harina precocida. The most popular brand names of maize flour are Harina PAN, Harina Juana in Venezuela, Areparina in Colombia, and Goya, elsewhere. Regional varieties=Colombia Street vendor selling grilled arepas on bijao leaves in Barranquilla Colombian arepa with cheese The arepa is an iconic food in Colombia, with some 75 distinct forms of preparation. According to a study conducted by the Colombian Academy of Gastronomy, \\"The arepa is part of the Colombian cultural heritage and can be considered a symbol of national gastronomic unity.\\" (in Spanish) In 2006, the arepa was named the cultural symbol of Colombia in a competition organized by Semana magazine with support from Caracol TV, the Minister of Culture and Colombia is Passion. In the Paisa region, the arepa is especially important to the local people and sometimes accompanies all meals of the day. In addition, arepas are strung into necklaces and placed around the necks of honored dignitaries as a sign of praise. In Colombia, the arepa is sold on a commercial level in neighborhood stores, chain supermarkets and market plazas and packaged with preservatives as a pre-molded white or yellow corn dough that is ready to grill or fry at home. It is also sold in the form of industrialized corn flour that requires hydration before preparation. In addition, arepas are sold by street vendors, in cafeterias, and in neighborhood stores. Restaurants of the Paisa Region offer a wide variety of arepas, including a unique style of stuffed arepa that can be filled with eggs, meat, or cheese. The Colombian Arepa Festival is celebrated in the following five major cities: Bogot√°, Medell√≠n, Cali, Barranquilla, and Bucaramanga. According to the program calendar, each city takes turns organizing the festival between the months of August and December. Venezuela The arepa is a symbol of Venezuelan gastronomy and one of the most common pre-Hispanic foods still popular in Venezuela. According to a 2015 survey of the Venezuelan people, nearly 70 percent of the nation ate arepas on a regular basis. It is common for Venezuelans to eat arepas throughout the day, both as snacks and as sides to meals, creating a culture where these corn products can be found almost everywhere. The arepa is seen as a cornerstone of a Venezuelan diet; previous to the 2015 food shortages, it was estimated that each year the average Venezuelan consumed about 30 kilos of the corn flour used to make arepas. Venezuelan arepas are commonly filled with a great variety of different fillings, from beef and avocado to cheese, varying widely by the location of where they are sold and the ingredients that can be obtained. In the Andes region of Venezuela, arepas de trigo are made with wheatflour rather than cornmeal. These lighter arepas are generally eaten as a snack or an accompaniment to heavier meals. Since the 2015 food shortages began, the consumption of arepas has significantly decreased. These shortages have caused the citizens of Venezuela to be unable to obtain sufficient basic food supplies, including the corn flour used to make arepas, resulting in a decrease of corn flour consumption per capita from 30 kilos per year in 2014 to 17.5 in 2016. These shortages have resulted in hours-long lines to buy government price-regulated corn flour as well as the creation of black markets selling flour at \\"many times the official cost.\\" See also * Cachapa * List of maize dishes * List of breads ReferencesFurther reading * Food and Agricultural Organization, United Nations.

A convexity property of positive matrices. Quart. J. Math. Oxford (2) 12,283-284. if {\\\\log}\\\\circ f, the composition of the logarithm with f, is itself a convex function. Definition Let be a convex subset of a real vector space, and let be a function taking non-negative values. Then is: * Logarithmically convex if {\\\\log} \\\\circ f is convex, and * Strictly logarithmically convex if {\\\\log} \\\\circ f is strictly convex. Here we interpret \\\\log 0 as -\\\\infty. Explicitly, is logarithmically convex if and only if, for all and all , the two following equivalent conditions hold: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\log f(tx_1 + (1 - t)x_2) &\\\\le t\\\\log f(x_1) + (1 - t)\\\\log f(x_2), \\\\ f(tx_1 + (1 - t)x_2) &\\\\le f(x_1)^tf(x_2)^{1-t}. \\\\end{align} Similarly, is strictly logarithmically convex if and only if, in the above two expressions, strict inequality holds for all . The above definition permits to be zero, but if is logarithmically convex and vanishes anywhere in , then it vanishes everywhere in the interior of . Equivalent conditions If is a differentiable function defined on an interval , then is logarithmically convex if and only if the following condition holds for all and in : :\\\\log f(x) \\\\ge \\\\log f(y) + \\\\frac{f'(y)}{f(y)}(x - y). This is equivalent to the condition that, whenever and are in and , :\\\\left(\\\\frac{f(x)}{f(y)}\\\\right)^{\\\\frac{1}{x - y}} \\\\ge \\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{f'(y)}{f(y)}\\\\right). Moreover, is strictly logarithmically convex if and only if these inequalities are always strict. If is twice differentiable, then it is logarithmically convex if and only if, for all in , :f(x)f(x) \\\\ge f'(x)^2. If the inequality is always strict, then is strictly logarithmically convex. However, the converse is false: It is possible that is strictly logarithmically convex and that, for some , we have f(x)f(x) = f'(x)^2. For example, if f(x) = \\\\exp(x^4), then is strictly logarithmically convex, but f(0)f(0) = 0 = f'(0)^2. Furthermore, f\\\\colon I \\\\to (0, \\\\infty) is logarithmically convex if and only if e^{\\\\alpha x}f(x) is convex for all \\\\alpha\\\\in\\\\mathbb R.. Properties A logarithmically convex function f is a convex function since it is the composite of the increasing convex function \\\\exp and the function \\\\log\\\\circ f, which is by definition convex. However, being logarithmically convex is a strictly stronger property than being convex. For example, the squaring function f(x) = x^2 is convex, but its logarithm \\\\log f(x) = 2\\\\log x is not. Therefore the squaring function is not logarithmically convex. If f_1, \\\\ldots, f_n are logarithmically convex, and if w_1, \\\\ldots, w_n are non-negative real numbers, then f_1^{w_1} \\\\cdots f_n^{w_n} is logarithmically convex. If {f_i}_{i \\\\in I} is any family of logarithmically convex functions, then g = \\\\sup_{i \\\\in I} f_i is logarithmically convex. If f \\\\colon X \\\\to I \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbf{R} is convex and g \\\\colon I \\\\to \\\\mathbf{R}_{\\\\ge 0} is logarithmically convex and non- decreasing, then g \\\\circ f is logarithmically convex. Examples * f(x) = \\\\exp(x^p) is logarithmically convex when p \\\\ge 1 and strictly logarithmically convex when p > 1. * f(x) = \\\\frac{1}{x^p} is strictly logarithmically convex on (0,\\\\infty) for all p>0 * Euler's gamma function is strictly logarithmically convex when restricted to the positive real numbers. In fact, by the Bohr‚ÄìMollerup theorem, this property can be used to characterize Euler's gamma function among the possible extensions of the factorial function to real arguments.

Although also used in educational institutions as a disciplinary measure, it has most often been applied domestically by parents. This practice has now been abolished by most schools, at least in the Western world, as it is seen by many as abusive and excessive punishment. The instigator might use their own belt (always at hand) or the one worn by the person to be punished. In other cases, especially in an institutional context, a separate belt is kept (e.g. in the head‚Äôs office) solely for disciplinary use, and possibly displayed, again as a warning. The difference with a strapping, although in practice both terms are also used unprecisely as synonyms, is that a strap is harder, made from heavier and/or thicker leather, and may be specially made for discipline and have a handle (notably a prison strap), unlike a 'real' belt. The beating is usually administered to the buttocks or back or both of the recipient who bends over furniture or the punisher's lap. A belt might be used to lash in three ways: *doubled by holding both ends in one hand, this halves its length (necessary in case of bending over knee or lap) but increases its effective thickness, both making it behave more like a strap. *single, while holding the buckle or wrapping that around the fist; its weight is reduced which results in uneven impact, the severity increasing towards the tip of the belt. *least common but most severe, holding the buckle-less end, so that the buckle can 'bite' the flesh particularly hard. In domestic discipline it was mainly used by fathers, while mothers rather used a slipper or wooden spoon. The term is also used figuratively for any beating in general, regardless of the implement (e.g. in Scotland, the tawse, a forked type of strap, was frequently called the belt) or even absence thereof, also in the figurative sense, such as a defeat or other unpleasant, painful and/or humiliating (e.g. verbal) treatment, or even an impersonal misfortune that feels strongly painful, such as a financial loss. In Russia and other countries of the former USSR belting has been a standard form of domestic corporal punishment of children. The punished child has usually laid flat on a sofa or bed, or the children's neck or torso has been clutched between the punisher's legs. The belt has been implemented almost exclusively on bare buttocks and sometimes on bare thighs. Some nervous parent could hit his or her child in the other parts of body, but it has not been regarded as proper punishment and has been condemned by public opinion. Such persons could be prosecuted by law, while the law usually has not \\"noticed\\" \\"proper\\" domestic punishment, which has been also officially regarded as a form of child abuse. Today the usage of corporal punishment of children in Russia, while still not effectively prohibited, is gradually declining just as it has in the western world.

Background In 1974, Stephen Gaskin and The Farm, an intentional community, started an outreach program called Plenty. In response to the devastating 1976 Guatemala earthquake, Plenty sent carpenters who built schools, houses and clinics in remote Mayan villages and a clinic for Mother Teresa. In its first ten years, Plenty established a clinic and orphanage in Bangladesh, an appropriate technology training center and reforestation program in Lesotho, and a wind- powered electric lighting system in a Carib Indian school in Dominica. It provided disaster relief in the \\"Developing\\" World and free ambulance service to the South Bronx which helped to train emergency personnel what then became New York City's EMS. It went to sea with Greenpeace and gave the Rainbow Warrior its ham radio, slo-scan TV, and radiation monitoring equipment. Plenty put Native American FM stations on the air, and pioneered amateur-band television and radio to keep its remote outposts of volunteers connected. Plenty continues to work with Native American primary health care, midwifery, microeconomics, food and ecotourism cooperatives and alternative building programs, including the hemp house on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation with the assistance of The Farm School. Plenty is active in the Central American Food Security Initiative, including programs with ADIBE in Guatemala, Soynica in Nicaragua and the Huichol Center in Mexico. Plenty's \\"Soyarias\\" now operated by ADIBE in Solol√° and San Bartolo, Guatemala, introduced soy dairy and soy ice cream microcredit enterprise in the 1980s. In 1978, Plenty formed a scientific research team, Ethos Research Group, and a litigation project to work on environmental issues and human rights, the Natural Rights Center. Together these groups analyzed mortality and morbidity data to create a cancer-by-county study from 1940 to 1980 for the State of Tennessee and applied biostatistical science to litigate Superfund and other toxic waste sites and limits on point source industrial carcinogens. It later sponsored the Environmental Resource Center in Portland, Oregon, and was a partner in founding the Ecovillage Training Center at The Farm. Following the catastrophic landfall of Hurricane Katrina near New Orleans in August, 2005, Plenty volunteers worked on a neighborhood-by-neighborhood basis to deliver essential supplies and re-establish civil order. Plenty worked with Veterans for Peace, Camp Casey, and others to place volunteers where they were most needed. Plenty stayed on scene for the following year and organized clean-up and repair of the damage along the coastlines of Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana, including the cities of Mobile (Alabama), Biloxi and Gulfport (Mississippi), and Slidell (Louisiana). Plenty also brought displaced and disadvantaged children from the Gulf Coast back to The Farm to participate in its Kids To The Country summer nature school in 2006.

The cover photo was taken on the train line between Belfast and Dublin, near Balbriggan. It was shot under Dylan's direction by D. A. Pennebaker, whose groundbreaking documentary Dont Look Back chronicled Dylan's 1965 British tour. The film was originally commissioned for the ABC television series ABC Stage 67. Though shooting had completed for the film, Dylan's July 1966 motorcycle accident delayed the editing process. Once well enough to work again, Dylan edited the film himself. ABC rejected the film as incomprehensible for a mainstream audience. It has never been released on home video and prints are rarely screened in theaters. Some footage from Eat the Document was used in Martin Scorsese's 2005 documentary on Bob Dylan, No Direction Home, and 3 song excerpts are special features on the DVD. Plot Eat the Document includes footage from the infamous Manchester Free Trade Hall concert, wherein an audience member shouted \\"Judas!\\" during the electric half of Dylan's set. Dylan's band during these shows were The Hawks (later to become The Band). Songs from various shows throughout the tour featured in the film include \\"Tell Me, Momma\\", \\"I Don't Believe You (She Acts Like We Never Have Met)\\", \\"Ballad of a Thin Man\\", and \\"One Too Many Mornings.\\" Other scenes include Dylan and Robbie Robertson in hotel rooms writing and working through new songs, most of which remain unreleased and unpublished. Among these songs are \\"I Can't Leave Her Behind\\", which was later covered by Stephen Malkmus for the I'm Not There soundtrack. The film also includes a piano duet with Johnny Cash performing Cash's \\"I Still Miss Someone\\". John Lennon scene Some bootleg versions of Eat the Document include a long scene featuring a possibly alcohol- or drug-impaired Dylan in a limousine with John Lennon on 27 May 1966. As Dylan shows signs of fatigue, Lennon urges him to get a grip on himself: \\"Do you suffer from sore eyes, groovy forehead, or curly hair? Take Zimdawn!...Come, come, boy, it's only a film. Pull yourself together.\\"Mojo, Launch Issue, October 1993, p.60 Lennon would later recall in an interview with Rolling Stone that he and Dylan were \\"both in shades, and both on fucking junk, and all these freaks around us... I was nervous as shit. I was on his territory, that's why I was so nervous.\\"Rolling Stone article: \\"The Rolling Stone Interview: John Lennon, Part II\\"There's a Riot Going On by Peter Doggett, p. 537. Background and production According to Howard Sounes's biography, Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan, after his motorbike accident in July 1966, Dylan viewed a cut of the material edited by Pennebaker and Bob Neuwirth and thought it was too similar to Dont Look Back. Despite having no filmmaking training, Dylan decided to re-edit the film himself, assisted by longtime associate Howard Alk and with (uncredited) assistant editor Gordon Quinn, co-founder of Kartemquin Films. Pennebaker stated: \\"It's not something you learn parking cars in a garage. You gotta know some of the rules and he didn't know any of the rules.\\" Dylan and Alk's cut was eventually shown to ABC television, who promptly rejected it as incomprehensible to a mainstream audience.Howard Sounes.

In property law, it is a mode of acquiring property that involves the addition of value to property through labour or the addition of new materials. For example, a person who owns a property on a river delta also takes ownership of any additional land that builds up along the riverbank due to natural deposits or man made deposits. In commercial law, accession includes goods that are physically united with other goods in such a manner that the identity of the original goods is not lost.American Law Institute, U.C.C. Article 9, ¬ß 102(a)(2) (2007). In English common law, the added value belongs to the original property's owner. For example, if the buyer of a car has parts added or replaced and the buyer then fails to make scheduled payments and the car is repossessed, the buyer has no right to the new parts because they have become a part of the whole car. In modern common law, if the property owner allows the accession through bad faith, the adder of value is entitled to damages or title to the property. If the individual who adds value to the owner's chattel (personal property) is a trespasser or does so in bad faith, the owner retains title and the trespasser cannot recover labor or materials. The owner of the chattel may seek conversion damages for the value of the original materials plus any consequential damages. Alternatively, the owner may seek replevin (return of the chattel). However, the owner may be limited to damages if the property has changed its nature by accession. For example, if a finder discovers a gemstone and in good faith believes it to be abandoned and then cuts it and integrates it into a work of art, the true owner may be limited to recovery of damages for the value of the gemstone but not of the final art piece by way of replevin. The remedies and application of the law vary by legal jurisdiction.  Roman accession  Accession might also be (from Latin accedere, to go to, approach), in law, a method of acquiring property adopted from Roman law (see: accessio), by which, in things that have a close connection with or dependence on one another, the property of the principal draws after it the property of the accessory, according to the principle, accessio cedet principali. Accession may take place either in a natural way, such as the growth of fruit or the pregnancy of animals, or in an artificial way. The various methods may be classified as: * Land to land by accretion or alluvion * Moveables to land or fixtures * Moveables to moveables * Moveables added to by the art or industry of man Accession in relation to land The general principle was that everything acceded to the land, since the land was the principal. =Buildings (inaedificatio)= Ownership of the house was considered distinct from ownership of the materials used to make the house. Owners of the materials were permitted to vindicate the materials upon demolition of the house, but the demolition of the house was forbidden by the Twelve Tables. Where X built on X's land using Y's materials, X owned the house since it acceded to X's land. Y would be capable of laying one of two actions if X was in good faith (bonas fides) in using Y's materials, but two actions if X was in bad faith (mala fides). These actions were (i) the vindicatio for the materials and (ii) the actio de tigno, which would recoup twice the value of the materials. Additionally, Y would also have an action against a third party if that third party stole the materials. In A Text-Book of Roman Law from Augustus to Justinian, W. W. Buckland discusses a third situation where X builds on Y's land using Z's materials. In such a situation, Buckland suggests that in relation to Y, X should be treated as though an XYX situation has occurred, and in relation to Z, as though an XXZ situation has occurred. =Plants and seeds= X's plants and seeds acceded irreversibly to Y's soil once they have taken root, but Y must pay expenses if X is in legal possession, since X will have the exceptio dolus malus against Y's vindicatio. =Rivers and new islands= * Alluvion * Avulsion Accession in relation to movables The accessory accedes to the principal. The debate is generally over which is the principal and which is the accessory. The principal owner owns regardless of good faith, bad faith, or consent. Possible tests that could be adopted in deciding this question include: * Economic value * Size * Physical identity * Relative non-economic value in terms of aesthetic value or labor In Roman law, there was no consistency. Everything was decided on a casuistic basis. The Physical Identity test was the dominant test, i.e., the principal is that which gives its name to the final product and the accessory is that which has its identity merged and lost in the identity of the other. However, there are a number of special cases with special, and rather idiosyncratic rules, which are as follows: * Writing (scripture) and painting (pictura) * Threads and garments (textura) * Confusio and commixtio References Category:Property law ","title":"Accession (property law)"},{"id":"1503634","text":"Coat of arms, Santa Maria Novella The Acciaioli, Acciaiuoli, Accioly, Acciajuoli or Acioli was an important family of Florence.

This book was written for the Stratemeyer Syndicate by Leslie McFarlane in 1929.Who Wrote the Hardy Boys? Secrets from the Syndicate Files Revealed . Between 1959 and 1973 the first 38 volumes of this series were systematically revised as part of a project directed by Harriet Adams, Edward Stratemeyer's daughter.The Hardy Boys Online: Revisions The original version of this book was rewritten in 1965 by Andrew E. Svenson resulting in two different stories with the same title. Plot summary (revised edition) The book begins with Chet Morton showing off his new metal detector to the Hardy boys and Biff Hooper while inviting them to camp at Honeycomb Caves. Meanwhile, their father, Fenton Hardy, is working to protect a Coastal Radar Station from sabotage during its construction. They are interrupted by Mary Todd who tells them that her brother, Morgan Todd, is missing and asks Fenton to find him. The Hardy boys and their father decide to team up to both find Morgan Todd and protect the Coastal Radar Station. The Hardy boys travel to Kenworthy College and meet Todd's colleague, Cadmus Quill. A clue leads them to Rockaway, but when it is mentioned they notice strange behavior from Cadmus Quill. While driving to Rockaway they hear a radio report that the radar station has been damaged, so they instead return to Bayport. Their help is not needed so they leave for Rockaway, stopping at Palis Paris to purchase a spinning wheel for their Aunt Gertrude. When they stop in at Tuttle's General Store Mr. Tuttle warns them to keep away from Honeycomb Caves because people have seen strange lights and heard shooting coming from the caves. Instead of leaving, the boys decide to camp at Honeycomb Caves with their friends Chet and Biff. At the caves they meet a strange hermit who invites them for breakfast, then chases them off and even shoots at Frank. Their adventure continues with Callie Shaw, Iola Morton and Mary Todd trying to get jobs at the Palis Paris, Biff getting knocked out while waiting in the parking lot, Chet's metal detector suddenly exploding and the Hardy boys' boathouse catching on fire. The story concludes with the Hardy boys finding a submarine delivering supplies to the hermit in the caves. They explore the cave and learn that the caves have an underground passage to Palis Paris where a device was being built to interfere with the new Coastal Radar Station.

It was directed by Frank Tuttle. The film features a number of intricate production numbers choreographed by Busby Berkeley. The song \\"Keep Young and Beautiful\\" is from this film. In addition to the starring actors in the picture, the elaborate dance numbers are performed by the \\"Goldwyn Girls\\" (who in this film include future stars such as Lucille Ball, Paulette Goddard and Barbara Pepper). The title of the film is a pun on Roman sandals. Plot summary When kind-hearted delivery boy and self-acclaimed authority on ancient Rome Eddie (Eddie Cantor) is thrown out of his home-town of West Rome, Oklahoma by scheming and corrupt politicians, he protests that nothing of the sort would have been allowed to happen in ancient Rome. On his way out of town, he imagines that he is back in Imperial Rome, where he is sold in a slave market to good-natured tribune Josephus (David Manners). Eddie soon discovers that Roman society was just as corrupt as in his own town and when he decides to do something about it, he becomes involved in court intrigue and a murder plot against the evil Emperor Valerius (Edward Arnold) himself.Green, Stanley (1999) Hollywood Musicals Year by Year (2nd ed.), pub.

Acciaioli descritta da Angiolo Segni edited by Tommaso Tonelli; Stamperia di L. Marchini, Florence (1841); page 38.28 August 1478) was an Italian scholar and statesman. He was known for his learning, especially in Greek and mathematics, and for his services to his native state. Biography He was born in Florence, Italy. He was educated under the patronage or guidance of Jacopo Piccolomini-Ammannati (1422‚Äì1479), who subsequently was named cardinal. He also putatively gained his knowledge of the classics from Lionardo and Carlo Marsuppini (1399‚Äì1453)Tonelli; page 38-39. and from the refugee scholar from Byzantium, Giovanni Argiropolo.Tonelli; page 41-42. Having previously been entrusted with several important embassies, in 1473 he became Gonfalonier of Florence, one of the nine citizens selected by drawing lots every two months, who formed the government. He died at Milan in 1478, when on his way to Paris to ask the aid of Louis XI on behalf of the Florentines against Pope Sixtus IV. His body was taken back to Florence and buried in the church of the Carthusian order at the public expense, and his daughters were endowed by his fellow-citizens, since he had little in terms of wealth. He wrote Latin translations of some of Plutarch's Lives (Florence, 1478); Commentaries on Aristotle's Ethics and Politics; the lives of Hannibal, Scipio and Charlemagne as well as the biography of the grand seneschal of the Kingdom of Naples, Niccol√≤ Acciaioli by Matteo Palmieri.

Stretch marks, also known as Striae or Striae distensae, are a form of scarring on the skin with an off-color hue. Over time they may diminish, but will not disappear completely. Stretch marks are caused by tearing of the dermis during periods of rapid growth of the body, such as during puberty or pregnancy. In pregnancy they usually form during the last trimester, and usually on the belly, but also commonly occur on the breasts, thighs, hips, lower back and buttocks; these are known as striae gravidarum. Stretch marks may also be influenced by the hormonal changes associated with puberty, pregnancy, bodybuilding, or hormone replacement therapy. There is no evidence that creams used during pregnancy prevent stretch marks. Once they have formed there is no clearly effective treatment, though various methods have been attempted and studied.  Signs and symptoms  Striae, or \\"stretch marks\\", begin as reddish or purple lesions, which can appear anywhere on the body, but are most likely to appear in places where larger amounts of fat are stored; the most common places are the abdomen (especially near the navel), breasts, upper arms, underarms, back, thighs (both inner and outer), hips, and buttocks. Over time, they tend to atrophy and lose pigmentation. The affected areas appear empty, and are soft to the touch. Stretch marks occur in the dermis, the resilient middle tissue layer that helps the skin retain its shape. No stretch marks will form as long as there is support within the dermis; stretching plays a role in where the marks occur and in what direction they run, however, there are a number of contributing factors (see: \\"Causes\\", below) to their formation. They can (but do not always) cause a burning and itching sensation, as well as emotional distress. They pose no health risk in and of themselves, and do not compromise the body's ability to function normally and repair itself, however, they are often considered a cosmetic nuisance. Young women are generally affected the most and often seek treatment for them from a dermatologist and following pregnancy.

File:StretchMark.jpgNormal stretch marks in a teenage male File:Stretch marks on female breast.jpgStretch marks in a female breast File:Central Obesity 008.jpgStriae distensae on an obese male  Causes  Stretch marks appear to be caused by stretching of the skin. This is especially true when there is an increase in cortisone \\\\- an increase in cortisone levels can increase the probability or severity of stretch marks by reducing the skin's pliability. More specifically, it affects the dermis by preventing the fibroblasts from forming collagen and elastin fibers necessary to keep rapidly growing skin taut; this can create a lack of supportive material as the skin is stretched, and lead to dermal and epidermal tearing, which in turn can produce scarring in the form of stretch marks. This is particularly the case when there is new tissue growth (which can interfere with the underlying physical support of the dermis or epidermis, by displacing the supportive tissue). Examples of cases where stretch marks are common, also given by the Mayo Clinic, include weight gain (in the form of fat and/or muscle), pregnancy, and adolescent growth spurts, though it is also noted that some medications, as well as other medical conditions and diseases, may increase the likelihood of stretch marks appearing. In the case of medication, the Clinic points to \\"Corticosteroid creams, lotions and pills and chronic use of oral or systemic steroids\\" as a common contributing factor. Medical conditions that can contribute to stretch marks include Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Cushing's syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and \\"adrenal gland diseases\\". Pregnancy Pregnancy stretch marks, also known as striae gravidarum, are a specific form of scarring of the skin of the abdominal area due to rapid expansion of the uterus as well as sudden weight gain during pregnancy. About 90% of women are affected. A number of additional factors appear to promote the appearance of stretchmarks: one study of 324 women, done just after they had given birth, demonstrated that low maternal age, high body mass index, weight gain over 15 kg (33 pounds) and higher neonatal birth weight were independently correlated with the occurrence of striae. Teenagers were found to be at the highest risk of developing severe striae. These skin marks are symptoms of pregnancy caused by the tearing of the dermis, resulting in atrophy and loss of rete ridges. These scars often appear as reddish or bluish streaks on the abdomen, and can also appear on the breasts and thighs. Some of these striae disappear with time, while others remain as permanent discolorations of the body. Mechanical distension and rapidly developing areas of the body during pregnancy (such as the abdomen, breasts, and thighs) are most commonly associated with striae formation. Some have suggested that relaxin and estrogen combined with higher levels of cortisol during pregnancy can cause an accumulation of mucopolysaccharides, which increases water absorption of connective tissue, making it prime for tearing under mechanical stress. There also seems to be an association between higher body mass indices and in women with bigger babies and the incidence and severity of striae. Also, younger women seem to be at higher risk of developing striae during pregnancy. The prevalence and severity of striae gravidarum varies among populations. The current literature suggest that in the general population of the US, there is a 50%-90% prevalence of striae associated with pregnancy, partly as a result of the normal hormonal changes of pregnancy and partly due to stretching of skin fibers. Many women experience striae gravidarum during their first pregnancy. Nearly 45% percent of women develop striae gravidarum before 24 weeks of gestation. Many women who develop lesions during the first pregnancy do not develop them during later pregnancies. Genetic factors such as genealogy and race also seem to be predictive in the appearance of striae.  Prevention  A systematic review has not found evidence that creams and oils are useful for preventing or reducing stretch marks in pregnancy. The safety in pregnancy of one ingredient, Centella asiatica, has been questioned. Evidence on treatments for reducing the appearance of the scars after pregnancy is limited.  Treatment  There are no clearly useful treatments for stretch marks, although there are many different suggestions on how to remove them or lessen their appearance. Various efforts that have been tried including laser treatments, glycolic acid, and microdermabrasion. Tretinoin (0.1% w/w), which is a retinoid, has found to be effective on early stretch marks in several studies. Hyaluronic acid also improves the appearance of stretch marks. Topical tretinoin is categorized by the FDA as a known teratogen (causing malformations in fetuses) in animals, without adequate human studies on safety in pregnancy. Carboxytherapy is a known procedure; however, there is a lack of evidence to support how effective it is. History Since ancient times, pregnant women have sought remedies to prevent stretch marks during pregnancy. Both ancient Greeks and Romans used olive oil, while Ethiopians and Somalis used frankincense. Striae was first recognized by Roederer in 1773, and was later histologically described by Troisier and M√©n√©trier in 1889. In 1936, Nardelli made the first morphologically correct descriptions. Terminology Medical terminology for these kinds of markings includes striae atrophicae, vergetures, stria distensae, striae cutis distensae, lineae atrophicae, linea albicante, or simply striae.

It also contains a risk assessment matrix. A risk is \\"an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a project's objectives.\\"PMBOK Guide 5th Edition, Glossary pg. 373. Risk is inherent with any project, and project managers should assess risks continually and develop plans to address them. The risk management plan contains an analysis of likely risks with both high and low impact, as well as mitigation strategies to help the project avoid being derailed should common problems arise. Risk management plans should be periodically reviewed by the project team to avoid having the analysis become stale and not reflective of actual potential project risks. Most critically, risk management plans include a risk strategy. Risk response Broadly, there are four potential responses to risk with numerous variations on the specific terms used to name these response options: * Avoid ‚Äì Change plans to circumvent the problem; * Control / mitigate / modify / reduce ‚Äì Reduce threat impact or likelihood (or both) through intermediate steps; * Accept / retain ‚Äì Assume the chance of the negative impact (or auto- insurance), eventually budget the cost (e.g. via a contingency budget line); or * Transfer / share ‚Äì Outsource risk (or a portion of the risk) to a third party or parties that can manage the outcome. This is done financially through insurance contracts or hedging transactions, or operationally through outsourcing an activity. (Mnemonic: SARA, for Share Avoid Reduce Accept, or A-CAT, for \\"Avoid, Control, Accept, or Transfer\\") Risk management plans often include matrices. Examples The United States Department of Defense, as part of acquisition, uses risk management planning that may have a Risk Management Plan document for the specific project. The general intent of the RMP in this context is to define the scope of risks to be tracked and means of documenting reports. It is also desired that there would be an integrated relationship to other processes. An example of this would be explaining which developmental tests verify risks of the design type were minimized are stated as part of the test and evaluation master plan. A further example would be instructions from 5000.2DSECNAVINST 5000.2D 3.4.4.1 that for programs that are part of a system of systems the risk management strategy shall specifically address integration and interoperability as a risk area. The RMP specific process and templates shift over time (e.g. the disappearance of 2002 documents Defense Finance and Accounting Service / System Risk Management Plan, and the SPAWAR Risk Management Process).

She then cast and voice-directed the Teletoon Detour pilot Celebutard Nation, which premiered at the 2009 Ottawa International Animation Festival. From 2011 to 2013, Stevie headed back to Los Angeles to cast and voice-direct two animation series for executive producer Bill Schultz: Guess How Much I Love You (Disney Junior); and Seasons 1 and 2 of Wild Grinders (Nicktoons), starring skateboard guru Rob Dyrdek. From 2014 to 2017, Stevie was based in Toronto as the Voice Director on Season 1-2 of Corus/Nelvana's action- adventure series The Mysticons.  Teaching  Vallance teaches actors how to infuse personality into cartoon characters with her brand name Tooned In! Animation Voice-over Workshops. The first workshop took place in North Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1995. Since then Vallance has taught children and adults how to do cartoon voice-over in Chicago, New York, Ottawa, Orlando, Miami, Atlanta, Toronto, Phoenix, and Los Angeles. In 2009 and 2010, Stevie taught 400 Animators at the Ottawa International Animation Festival. In the fall of 2010, 400 Animation fans participated in her high-energy ‚Äòone-person panel‚Äô seminar at the New York Comic Conference.  Music  In 1995, Vallance moved to Bowen Island, British Columbia where she met Michael Creber (piano; k.d. lang). Together in 1998, they recorded Vallance's debut jazz CD Practically Naked. In Vancouver, she sang jazz regularly at The Jazz Cellar and Rossini's, where she performed alongside some of the city's well-known jazz musicians at the time. For her second CD, Always (A Salute to Patsy Cline), Vallance derived inspiration from her portrayal of Patsy Cline (with whom she shares a birthdate) in Dean Regan's staged production of A Closer Walk with Patsy Cline. Vallance toured western Canada with this production for six years, performing at numerous venues including two runs at the Granville Arts Club in Vancouver and the Alberta Theatre Projects in Calgary. Vallance opened for the Calgary Stampede as \\"Patsy\\", in 1999. Motivated by the loss of a close personal friend, Vallance conceived the Divas for Life jazz benefit concerts held in Vancouver, B.C. In addition to producing the first concert at the Vogue Theater, in 2001, she negotiated a national distribution deal for the CD Divas for Life: Live At The Vogue!, which was released and performed as part of the 2001 Vancouver International Jazz Festival line-up. On Valentine's Day 2002, she produced Divas for Love. The proceeds of all concerts raised C$70,000 for people living with a life-threatening illness. As a result, Vallance was presented with Vancouver's \\"Friend in Deed\\" philanthropy award. In 2004, Vallance debuted as a 'Jazz vocalist' in her hometown, Toronto, where she was accompanied by pianist Don Thompson, bassist Neil Swainson, and drummer Ted Warren. She also performed for the first time in her birth town Montr√©al, at The Upstairs, with jazz pianist Steve Amirault, bassist Zack Lober, and drummer Jim Doxas. Vallance's fourth CD, Make My Night, was released in February 2008. Arranged by guitarist Pat Coleman, it features many other Canadian Jazz musicians: pianist Ross Taggart, trumpeter Mike Herriot, saxophonist Tom Colclough, drummer Buff Allen and bassist Miles Hill. In 2009, Vallance performed in the Medicine Hat Jazz Festival for the second year in a row and was the featured vocalist alongside Ernie Duff and the Stardust Big Band, in and around Saugeen Shores, ON. She also sang with the Charlie Bell Trio in the Thornbury and Kincardine Jazz Festivals.

By country=United States According to the Internal Revenue Service, 77% of tax returns filed in 2004 resulted in a refund check, with the average refund check being $2,100.FDIC: FDIC Consumer News Winter 2004/2005 In 2011, the average tax refund was $2,913.USA Today page 1B published April 13, 2012 \\"Tax refund provides cash to file bankruptcy\\"http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/article/20130104/GPG03/301040162/Changes- don-t-worry-tax-preparers For the 2017 tax year the average refund was $2,035 and for 2018 it was 8% less at $1,865, reflecting the changes brought by the most sweeping changes to the tax code in 30 years. Taxpayers may choose to have their refund directly deposited into their bank account, have a check mailed to them, or have their refund applied to the following year's income tax. As of 2006, tax filers may split their tax refund with direct deposit in up to three separate accounts with three different financial institutions. This has given taxpayers an opportunity to save and spend some of their refund (rather than only spend their refund).https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=161493,00.html Every year, a number of U.S. taxpayers around the country get tax refunds even if they owe zero income tax. This is due to withholding calculations and the earned income tax credit. Because withholding is calculated on an annualized basis, an individual just entering the work force or unemployed for a long period of time will have more tax than is owed withheld. Refund anticipation loans are a common means to receive a tax refund early, but at the expense of high fees that can reach over 200% annual interest. In the 1990s, refunds could take as long as twelve weeks to come back to the taxpayer; however, the average time for a refund is now six weeks, with refunds from electronically filed returns coming in three weeks. Some people believe that getting a large tax refund is not as desirable as more accurate withholding throughout the year, as a large refund represents a loan paid back by the government interest-free. Optimally, a return should result in a payment owed of just less than the amount that would cause a penalty charge, which is 100% of the prior year's tax (110% for high income individuals), 90% of the current year's tax, or $1,000 for individuals who have direct withholding and do not pay estimated tax. In order to decrease the amount of the tax refund which has to be received by taxpayers, they can turn to one or several of the following methods: * adjust the amount of tax the federal government withholds from the paycheck. It is recommended for taxpayers to do this in cases where their adjustments to income, exemptions, and deductions remain relatively steady from year-to-year, and if the government consistently is required to give a large refund. * in the case of people entirely exempt from state tax, they can check with their state income tax authority to see if there is an appropriate form that can be completed and filed, which would exempt them from state withholding * check tax rates and adjusted gross income thresholds (applicable if taxpayers are hovering near the bottom of certain tax brackets and changes have been made to the thresholds and/or tax rates) * take advantage of the medical expense deduction (applicable for medical expenses now imposed for tax years starting in 2013) * maximizing the amount allowed to save tax-free for retirementUsing your 2012 tax-year return to plan for the future Presti & Naegele Accounting Offices However, some people use the tax refund as a simple \\"savings plan\\" to get money back each year (even though it is excess money that they paid earlier in the year). Another argument is that it is better to get a refund rather than to owe money, because in the latter case one might find oneself without sufficient funds to make the necessary payment. When properly filled out, the Form W-4 will withhold approximately the correct amount of tax to eliminate a refund or amount owed, assuming the W-4 was filled out at the beginning of the tax year. A U.S. federal law signed in 1996 contained a provision that required the federal government to make electronic payments by 1999. In 2008, the U.S. Treasury Department paired with Comerica Bank to offer the Direct Express Debit MasterCard prepaid debit card. The card is used to make payments to federal benefit recipients who do not have a bank account. Tax refunds, however, are exempt from the electronic payments requirement. However, many U.S. states send tax refunds in the form of prepaid debit cards to people who do not have bank accounts.‚ÄúFederal government chooses direct deposit and prepaid cards over mailing checks‚Äù , BankCreditNews, 15 Apr 2013, Accessed 22 Apr 2013 New Zealand In New Zealand, income tax is deducted by the employer under the PAYE (Pay As You Earn) tax system. This information is collected and held by the Inland Revenue Department (New Zealand) (IRD) and is not automatically processed. However individual earners can request a summary of earnings to see if they have overpaid or underpaid their tax for each given financial year. To claim a tax refund, a personal tax summary must be filed; this can be done by dealing with the IRD directly or through a Tax Agent. If a personal tax summary is requested in a situation where tax would be owing, a debt is created, so correct calculations prior to this request are important, and these core services are offered by third party Tax Agents.

United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, income tax is deducted by the employer under the PAYE (Pay As You Earn) tax system via HMRC. Some refunds such as those due to changing tax codes or similar circumstances will be automatically processed via a P800 form. A change of circumstances, such as a change of employment or second job, sometimes results in overpaid tax which can be claimed back. It is also possible to make more complex claims under both PAYE and self-employment circumstances, for example if employed by the Ministry of Defence or Construction Industry Scheme used by construction trade subcontractors. In such cases tax refunds for various work related expenses can also be claimed for up to the last four tax years; common examples include costs for accommodation (for example for offshore workers staying overnight before transport to a rig), food purchased while travelling between workplaces, or the purchase or hire or specialist equipment. Ireland In the Republic of Ireland, income tax is deducted by the employer under the PAYE (Pay As You Earn) tax system. If incorrect tax credits are applied by the employer, then a refund of tax is due. Tax refunds may also be due for income deductions that are applied after the tax year has ended, if one finishes working prior to the year end, or for joint assessment of taxes for a married couple. Tax refunds must be claimed within four years of the end of the tax year if the one is assessed under the PAYE tax system.

For self-employed or investment earning individuals, who owe greater than $3000 in net taxes in 2019 and one of the previous two years. Taxes must be paid in a series of quarterly installments during the year that the income is earned. A significant decrease in income for self-employed individuals or a forgotten deduction on the TD1 form can result in an overpayment of taxes. Those who file their taxes online by the deadline of April 30 should receive their refund within 2 weeks, while those who file by paper can expect a longer turnaround period of 8 weeks. The Canada Revenue Agency will pay compounded daily interest on delayed refunds, beginning on the later of May 31 or 31 days after you filling a return. Refunds are paid by cheque or direct deposit, with the direct deposit being the quicker option of the two. In some cases the CRA may keep some or all of a refund. These cases include owed tax balances, Garnishment, and the existence of outstanding government debt.

He was the fifth son of the Qianlong Emperor. Arguably the most outstanding among the Qianlong Emperor's sons, he was, at one point, considered by his father as a potential heir to the throne. However, he died prematurely at the age of 25. Life Yongqi was born in the Manchu Aisin Gioro clan as the fifth son of the Qianlong Emperor. His mother was Noble Consort Yu (ÊÑâË≤¥Â¶É), who was from the Mongol Keliyete (ÁèÇÈáåËëâÁâπ) clan. Yongqi was studious and diligent from a young age. Every day, of all the princes, he was the earliest to reach the palace study to attend classes. He had a close relationship with his younger brother, Yongyan. Yongqi was talented - he was fluent in the Manchu and Mongol languages, he was versed in astronomy, geography and calendrical calculation. One of his works was the Jiaotong Tenggao (ËïâÊ°êÂπêÁ®ø). Yongqi was versed in poetry, painting, and calligraphy. He was also skilled in horse-riding and mounted archery. His talents earned him the favour of his father, the Qianlong Emperor. In 1763, a fire broke out in the Old Summer Palace, and Yongqi carried his father on his back and brought him to safety. Two years later, the Qianlong Emperor conferred Yongqi the title \\"Prince Rong of the First Rank\\", making Yongqi the first of the Qianlong Emperor's sons to officially receive a princely title. Besides the Chinese character \\"Rong\\" (Ê¶Æ) in the title literally means \\"glory\\" or \\"honour\\", which showed that the Qianlong Emperor had high hopes for Yongqi. Yongqi died in 1766 after suffering from bone tuberculosis for several months. He was already ill when he was made \\"Prince Rong\\". He was granted the posthumous name \\"Chun\\" (Á¥î; \\"pure\\"), so his full posthumous title was extended to \\"Prince Rongchun of the First Rank\\" (Ê¶ÆÁ¥îË¶™Áéã). Tomb Yongqi was buried with the Qianlong Emperor's eldest son, Yonghuang (Ê∞∏Áíú; 1728‚Äì1750), who also died in his 20s. The tomb, sometimes referred to as the \\"Crown Prince Tomb\\" (Â§™Â≠êÈôµ), is located in northern part of eastern Beijing near Bulaotun Town (‰∏çËÄÅÂ±ØÈéÆ). In 1958 the tomb was demolished to make way for the construction of the Miyun Reservoir (ÂØÜÈõ≤Ê∞¥Â∫´). Its contents were carefully excavated and transferred to the Capital Museum. Former residence Yongqi and his descendants were merged under the Bordered Red Banner of the Eight Banners. Yongqi's house later became the residence of Prince Chun in the later part of the Qing dynasty. A Prince Rong Residence is located in the southwest of present-day Beijing at Xuanwu Gate on the west side of Taiping Lake. Appraisal Yongqi's mother was not one of the highly ranked consorts of the Qianlong Emperor, but yet Yongqi was instated as a Prince of the First Rank, and there were signs that the emperor had considered designating Yongqi as his heir. Another two princes, Yonglian and Yongcong, became first-rank princes because they were born to Empress Xiaoxianchun. As such it was believed that the Qianlong Emperor truly favoured and loved Yongqi. Yongqi was the most outstanding of the Qianlong Emperor's sons and the best choice to succeed his father, but it was unfortunate that he died at a young age of 25. In 1793, when the Qianlong Emperor met British envoy George Macartney he told the latter that he regarded Yongqi highly because of his many talents, and that it was a pity that he died early.

As Moline is part of the Quad Cities of Illinois and Iowa, the mall serves the population of these cities. The mall is located southwest of the intersection of Interstate 74 and Illinois Route 5 (John Deere Road) at 4500 16th Street. SouthPark Mall is one of two regional malls in the Quad Cities area, the other being NorthPark Mall in Davenport, Iowa. The current owner and operator is Macerich. The mall had been operated by the Simon Property Group, Inc., from 1998 to 2011. Before 1998, General Growth Properties managed and owned the property. The mall's anchor stores are Dillard's, Dick's Sporting Goods, Ashley HomeStore, JCPenney, and Von Maur. There is 1 vacant anchor store that was once Younkers. The one-level mall has over 60 stores and a gross leasable area of 825,000 square feet. History SouthPark Mall was built by General Growth Properties at a cost of $12 million on of land that General Growth purchased in 1966. Montgomery Ward, Petersen Harned Von Maur, and Younkers were the mall's three original anchors when it opened on February 27, 1974. SouthPark has been expanded twice: JCPenney was added in 1978, while Sears and a food court were added in 1990. Montgomery Ward closed in early 2001 when the chain went out of business, and the anchor space remained vacant for three years. Dillard's eventually leased and they rebuilt the space, which they then opened in 2004. A Walgreens pharmacy operated in the mall until 2003, when a new free-standing store was built off-site; Old Navy opened a store in Walgreens' place in 2006, but in May 2013 Old Navy closed their location due to poor sales at both Quad Cities metro locations, the other in Davenport, IA. The mall has struggled to keep tenants since the turn of the century, the mall used to be full of national retailers, but now nearly half of the store fronts are filled with local or regional retailers. Most of the national retailers that left went to NorthPark Mall in Davenport, Iowa. The Sears store closed in October 2013 as part of the national retailer's plan to reduce expenses. Coming not long after the closing of an Old Navy store, Sears' departure left SouthPark with four anchors.http://qctimes.com/news/local/sears-to-close-at- southpark-mall/article_d2a81182-f333-5e44-883c-8c86806dc8f1.html In September 2013, the city of Moline approved a TIF for the mall area, with Macerich and the city working on a plan of redevelopment. A two-phase redevelopment plan, which will eventually involve substantial updates to the appearance and shopping convenience, were slated to begin in April 2014, at which time demolition of the 1990 addition ‚Äì containing the former Sears and food court areas ‚Äì were slated to begin.

In 2015 Macerich worked on landscaping around the mall property, as well as repaving parking lots and bridges entering the mall. On April 18, 2018, it was announced that Younkers would be closing as the parent, Bon-Ton Stores, was going out of business. The store closed on August 29, 2018.

Typical examples resemble a stepped cone, standing 2‚Äì4 feet tall with a crown at the top and stacked tiers over a basin at the bottom. The basin is heated to keep the chocolate in a liquid state so it can be pulled into a center cylinder then vertically transported to the top of the fountain by an Archimedes screw. From there it flows over the tiers creating a chocolate \\"waterfall\\" in which food items like strawberries or marshmallows can be dipped.  History  \\"Chocolate fountain machines\\" were invented by Ben Brisman and popularized in 1991 by a Canadian company called Design & Realisation. They did not become very popular until Design & Realisation began displaying these fountains at the National Restaurant Show in Chicago, starting in the early 1990s. Jay Harlan (an entrepreneur and former Marriott catering executive) collaborated with D & R to introduce the chocolate fountain to the U.S. hotel and resort industry. Jay Harlan's company (Buffet Enhancements International) began distributing the D & R fountain in the U.S. in 2001. It wasn't long after 2001 that Buffet Enhancements copied and improved the D & R fountain idea and began manufacturing their own American-made version.  Types  Imhoff chocolate museum in Cologne, Germany Chocolate fountains can be categorized as commercial-use and personal-use. Commercial chocolate fountains can be categorized as Auger system and Pump system. Commercial chocolate fountains usually range in size from about 20\\" inches to 50\\" inches tall and are designed for use in professional environments such as catering. These fountains are normally constructed of food-grade stainless steel and, as such, are quite durable. Depending on the model, commercial chocolate fountains may hold as much as 35 pounds of chocolate. Originally, chocolate fountains consisted of multiple tiers that formed curtains of chocolate. New models on the market now have a 'cup' design, dropping chocolate from cup to cup which can be much more chocolate efficient than traditional models, and save quite a lot of money. Home chocolate fountains range in size up to about 19\\" tall. They are primarily made of plastic and may have some stainless steel components (although all-stainless models do exist) and are usually dishwasher safe. Home chocolate fountains normally hold 6 or fewer pounds of chocolate.  Chocolate  Woman using a home chocolate fountain Melted chocolate is very temperamental, so rich couverture chocolate, which is high in cocoa butter, is commonly used to ensure consistent flow. If the cocoa butter content of the chocolate is too low, an additive must be mixed in to decrease viscosity. (Vegetable oil is most commonly used to do this.) But even couverture chocolate‚Äîunless specifically designed for fountains‚Äîoften still requires an additive to make it flow smoothly. Because of this, it is highly recommended that chocolate formulated specifically for fountains be used to avoid the need for the addition of vegetable oil, as the oil gives a slimy, gritty taste and texture to the chocolate. Few chocolate fountains are capable of melting chocolate directly in the basin, so chocolate is typically melted in a microwave or double boiler before pouring it into the fountain. The fluid dynamics of home chocolate fountains are particularly problematic (it is a so- called non Newtonian fluid Exploring the physics of chocolate fountains), since the gravitational forces are much lower than the viscous forces; this means that small chocolate fountains need a very high proportion of vegetable oil. There is a trade-off between looks and taste: if perfect smooth flow may be sacrificed, it's possible to use non-oily chocolate. A cheaper alternative to couverture chocolate is chocolate-flavored syrup, also called \\"chocolate coating\\". Chocolate coating is already in liquid form and costs much less than couverture chocolate - although many would argue that the extra expense of gourmet Belgian couverture chocolate is more than worth it. Another alternative is to use dark chocolate, such as 70% cocoa chocolate. This contains much less sugar, so it isn't so sticky; a small quantity of hot water may be added to thin it further. Increasing popularity Originally, the market was entirely commercial, with chocolate fountains costing a large amount of money and requiring significant upkeep. The popularity of chocolate fountains grew to a point of demand at a consumer retail level as people who had seen commercial models at catered events inquired about purchasing their own fountains. Then, at the end of 2004, the Hellmann Group began marketing the Nostalgia Chocolate Fountain for personal use. This expansion into the retail market caused the demand to peak drastically. As a result, the catering industry saw more requests for chocolate fountains at events. Flavoring oils such as mint, orange, and cappuccino were developed to give the chocolate extra taste. Caterers began adding food coloring to white chocolate to make it coincide with special holidays or events. Caterers and home users created special recipes for a variety of fondues that would flow well in a fountain; some of the more popular recipes included caramel, cheese, maple syrup, ranch dressing, and BBQ sauce. Because of the growing practice of using chocolate fountains for other types of fondue, chocolate fountains became interchangeably referred to as \\"fondue fountains\\". Today, commercial chocolate fountains are a common fixture at well-to-do galas, weddings, and catered parties; while home chocolate fountains are more commonly seen at birthday parties and friendly gatherings. New models often incorporate more than one flavour of chocolate and a 'cup' design in place of the traditional tiered models. These models are designed to cater to new customer desires, to decrease the amount of chocolate needed and chocolate wastage. The Jean- Philippe Patisserie at the Bellagio Casino in Paradise, Nevada is home to the world's tallest chocolate fountain.

It was the successor to the Citro√´n Acadiane, which had replaced the Citro√´n 2CV vans that pioneered the box van format from the 1950s to the 1970s, although the Acadiane continued in production alongside the C15 initially. The name refers to the car's French gross vehicle weight rating and indicates its position beneath the C25 and C35 in Citro√´n's commercial vehicle range at the time. Design The C15 was based on the Citro√´n Visa (discontinued 1988), and mainly used a 1769 cc XUD or 1868 cc (DW8 on late models), naturally aspirated (non turbo) diesel engine. Until the early 1990s, it was also available with a petrol PSA TU engine. At the time of introduction, the engines were the XUD (C15D) or the 1124 cc petrol TU1 (C15E). The diesel engines also powered vehicles several classes larger. Both Bosch and Lucas/CAV/Roto diesel injection systems were used. The TU petrol-engined versions were sold until the beginning of the 1990s. The engines and drivetrains were taken from the Citro√´n Visa lineup. While the car was mostly the same as a regular Citro√´n Visa ahead of the B-pillar, the cargo area was unique. The C15 had a lengthened wheelbase, and a sturdier rear axle shared with the Peugeot 305 Break and Citro√´n BX since it had to carry heavier loads than the Visa. The very curved sides of the windscreen, enabled the use of a very large single wiper on the long narrow windscreen, without it catching the windscreen seal. The shape of the bumper and plastic trim on the front of the van, like those of the Visa car, were designed to aerodynamically reduce the deposition of dirt on the headlights, and to reduce the risk of stone chips to the headlights, bonnet and windscreen. The heating and ventilation system, (even though it used only a water control valve for temperature control and not air mixing), could provide cold air from fascia side vents, to the face while warming the car. The central directable fascia vents could be pointed directly at the windscreen in front of the driver, to blow hot air to keep it clear in extreme misting conditions. There was also an additional mid-level vent. The C15 also had height adjustable halogen headlights, and multi speed/intermittent front wipers, which was better than most commercial vehicles of the time. As well as standard van configuration, the vehicle later became available with rear side windows and a rear seat, (a layout which had been pioneered in the 2CV), which can be seen as a forerunner to today's compact utility vehicles such as the Ford Transit Connect, Opel/Vauxhall Combo, Citro√´n Berlingo and Peugeot Partner. The C15 was also available without the rear bodywork, as a chassis only model. This encouraged various conversions such as the campervan called the RomaHome built by British company Island Plastics. This small camper was suitable for two people. Rare pickup truck versions were also made.

During that time there were various minor changes and upgrades made. Models with 600 kg and 800 kg load capacities were introduced (the original was 500 kg). Trim details were changed to give it a facelift in September 1989, when a lower grille with three cross bars was introduced, with the turn signals now mounted in the bumper and with an offset Citro√´n logo. In 1992, side plastic trims were added, and the bonnet trim again changed somewhat. Variants and history The C15 was introduced in the United Kingdom in 1985, initially badged with the pun 'van blanc' or 'van rouge' according to body colour. Models for the United Kingdom were always shipped without rear side windows, as is usual for vans in Britain, due to tax regulations. European models had side windows, and a combi version called Weekend, with an easily removed rear bench seat. There was also, in France at least, a rather rare stretched version, which was about 0.5 meters longer than a normal C15. Early models had a single wide rear door, but this was awkward for loading in a tight space and prone to sagging or to snapping off in a high wind, so, after a year or two, only conventional two door versions were sold with fold back hinges. Numerous changes were made to the engine ancillaries over the years. Early diesel-engined models had an inline electrical fuel heater, which invariably stopped working after a couple of years. Later models instead had the fuel pass over the thermostat housing to warm it up instead. The fuel filter moved from the wing to the top of the thermostat housing. The oil filler moved from the crankcase cover to the dipstick housing. The front indicators were originally combined with the headlights, but later replaced by side lights (moved from the headlight reflector) and separate indicators were fitted in the bumper.

The bodies were produced by Heuliez from 1969 to 1971. The longitudinally mounted rotary engine had a nominal capacity of 995 cc delivering and of torque. According to factory figures the car had a performance roughly on a level with that of a Morris 1300. It could accelerate from 0-62 mph (100 km/h) in 19 seconds, 10 seconds faster than an Ami 8, and reach a top speed of about . The M35 also used a larger 11-gallon (43-liter) fuel tank to improve range, as the fuel tank in the standard Ami 8 was deemed too small. The engine was so smooth running that Citro√´n fitted an audible alarm that went off as the car approached its redline of 7,000 rpm. The engine was supplied by a company formed in 1967 by NSU and Citro√´n called Comotor. The M35 was an experimental vehicle and was not officially sold - rather it was supplied to loyal Citro√´n customers to get their comments on the usability of the design. Due to its experimental status, each car featured a banner at the bottom of the rear window which read in French ‚ÄúThis Citro√´n M35 prototype fitted with a rotary piston engine is undergoing long term testing at the hands of a Citro√´n customer.‚Äù. Many aspects of the M35 made it to regular production. The rotary engine was deemed satisfactory and a dual rotor version of it was used in the GS Birotor in 1974; the gearbox used in the M35 was the GS 1015's gearbox (albeit with a normal shift pattern); certain suspension parts found their way into the GS line when it was introduced in 1970 and the seats that reclined just above the waist were found in none other than the SM.

AccursiusLater sources attribute to him ‚Äì without a historical basis ‚Äì the first name of \\"Franciscus\\", as well as surnames such as \\"Bonus\\" or \\"Azoninus\\". (in Italian Accursio or Accorso di Bagnolo; c. 11821263) was a Roman jurist. He is notable for his organization of the glosses, the medieval comments on Justinian's codification of Roman law, the Corpus Juris Civilis. He was not proficient in the classics, but he was called \\"the Idol of the Jurisconsults\\". Accursius was born at Impruneta, near Florence. A pupil of Azo, he first practised law in his native city, and was afterwards appointed professor at Bologna, where he had great success as a teacher. He undertook to arrange into one body the tens of thousands of comments and remarks upon the Code, the Institutes and Digests. Accursius assembled from the various earlier glosses for each of these texts a coherent and consistent body of glosses. This compilation, soon given the title Glossa ordinaria or magistralis, and usually known as the Great Gloss, was essentially complete at about 1230. While Accursius was employed in this work, legend has it that, hearing of a similar one proposed and begun by Odofred, another lawyer of Bologna, he feigned indisposition, interrupted his public lectures, and shut himself up, till with the utmost expedition he had accomplished his design. After the middle of the 13th century, the Gloss had grown to be the starting point for every exegesis of the Corpus Iuris, and was even given force of law in some jurisdictions. The authority of the Gloss is probably due to Accursius' very exhaustive coverage of the civil law, in the course of which he not only pointed out its problems but unlike his predecessors also offered solutions for them.Weimar, op.cit. Indeed, modern research has shown that Accursius' work contains nearly 100,000 glosses. The best edition is that of Denis Godefroi, published at Lyon in 1589, in six folio volumes. For his magnum opus, Accursius was extolled by the lawyers of his own and the immediately succeeding age as the greatest glossator, and he was even called the idol of jurisconsults, but those of later times formed a lower estimate of his merits. Eventually, 16th century humanists, including Rabelais in his Gargantua and Pantagruel, polemically criticised Accursius' Gloss. Apart from his work as a glossator, Accursius was also engaged very profitably as a legal consultant. Three of his four sons were also jurists: Cervottus, Guilelmus and the noted Franciscus. The latter is buried with his father in one of the arcs lining the street near the Basilica of San Francesco, Bologna. Accursius' majestic residence on the Piazza Maggiore was later expanded into the Palazzo Comunale, or the town hall.

After the removal of the leukocytes, the blood product is said to be leukoreduced.  Benefits and costs  It is theorized that transfusions that contain white blood cells may cause adverse effects through multiple mechanisms. White blood cells may themselves harbor infectious disease and some pathogens will be more concentrated in white blood cells than the rest of the blood product. It is also theorized that the donor white blood cells may suppress the recipient's immune system by interacting with it. An April 2007 meta-analysis by Dr. Neil Blumberg and others and covering 3093 patients who received leukoreduced blood was published in the scientific journal Transfusion. According to the meta- analysis, use of leukoreduced blood reduced the frequency of post-transfusion infection by 50%. In a previous study, Blumberg and others reported that a change to universal use of leukoreduced blood at Strong Memorial Hospital at University of Rochester reduced post-transfusion infection by 33-45%. However, other scientific studies question the effectiveness of leukoreduction. A March 2007 study by researchers at University of South Alabama Medical Center found no reduction of mortality or length of hospital stay in 439 trauma patients who received leukoreduced transfusions compared to 240 patients who did not. University of Washington researchers reported in October 2006 that a study of 286 transfused injury patients showed no reduction in mortality or length of stay, although a 16% reduction in rate of infection was shown with marginal statistical significance. Leukoreduction has the inadvertent effect of removing approximately 10% of red blood cells from a processed unit of Red Blood Cells. Because blood from persons who possess the sickle cell mutation is difficult to filter, leukoreduction is often not performed on donors who may have the sickle cell gene, which is most common in people of African descent. Dr. Blumberg, the lead author of the meta-analysis covering 3093 patients, stated in the press that the cost savings due to universal leukoreduction exceeds the cost of performing the leukoreduction. The cost of leukoreduction is an increase of approximately US$30 per unit of blood product.  History of availability  Universal leukoreduction is currently not practiced in all countries. As of 2008, most developed nations have adopted universal leukoreduction of transfusions (defined as the routine application of this blood-processing step to all units of whole blood, red blood cells, and platelets prior to storage) with the notable exception of the United States.Bassuni et al. Why implement universal leukoreduction? Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther 2008;1:106-123 \\"Hematology/Oncology and Stem Cell Therapy\\" Canada, Britain and France adopted universal leukoreduction in the late 1990s. Germany adopted it in 2001. Leukoreduced products are commonly available in the United States and some hospitals use only leukoreduced blood while others only use leukoreduced products in certain patient populations. For example, Strong Memorial Hospital began universal use of leukoreduced blood in July 2000; University of South Alabama Medical Center began use in January 2002. Woodlands Medical Centre is beginning a randomised controlled trial to look into the benefits of transfusing leukoreduced whole blood for the ICCU patients.

Life Ackermann was born in Paris, but spent her younger days in more rural surroundings near Montdidier, south-east of Amiens. In 1829, her father, having undertaken her early education, in the philosophy of the Encyclopaedists, sent her to school in Paris. In 1838, Victorine Choquet went to Berlin to study German, and there married Paul Ackermann, an Alsatian philologist, in 1843. After little more than two years of happy married life her husband died, and Madame Ackermann went to live in Nice with a favorite sister. In 1855, she published Contes en vers, and in 1862, Contes et po√©sies. Very different from these simple and charming contes is the work on which Madame Ackermann's real reputation rests. She published in 1874 Po√©sies, premi√®res po√©sies, po√©sies philosophiques, a volume of sombre and powerful verse, expressing her revolt against human suffering. The volume was enthusiastically reviewed in the Revue des deux mondes for May 1871 by Elme Marie Caro, who, though he deprecated the impi√©t√© d√©sesp√©r√©e of the verses, did full justice to their vigour and the excellence of their form. Soon after the publication of this volume Madame Ackermann moved back to Paris, where she gathered round her a circle of friends, but published nothing further except a prose volume, the Pens√©es d'un solitaire (\\"Thoughts of a Recluse\\", 1883), to which she prefixed a short autobiography.

The roads do, however, pass by a number of Yarraside parks, including Pound Bend, Westerfolds Park, Finns Reserve, Birrarung Park and Banksia Park, which are all well-liked serene picnic locations with a view of the outer-suburban Yarra River, where it is still safe to swim and canoe. Heidelberg to Alphington There is little in the way of a Yarra view along this section of the drive. The best Yarra vantage point is found alongside the Boulevarde, but there are many stores and some industry through these middle-northern suburbs. Yarra Boulevard, Kew A winding but road on the edge of a hill which provides a marvellous view of both the Yarra and the inner suburbs. It also runs alongside several golf courses. Burnley to Southbank For most of this section, the road runs directly alongside the Yarra River after it widens past Dights Falls, with a clean view of the bridges and surroundings. Alexandra Avenue also provides access to the Royal Botanic Gardens and Birrarung Marr. Alexandra Avenue, however, is an important thoroughfare in inner-eastern Melbourne, and so traffic can often be unpleasant.

Simplot Company (commonly referred to as Simplot) was founded in 1929 by 20-year-old John Richard Simplot near the small agricultural community of Declo in south central Idaho, United States. During the early 1940s the business expanded, serving the military dehydrated onions and potatoes during World War II. The firm was legally incorporated as the J. R. Simplot Company in 1955. Company founder J. R. Simplot (1909-2008) Simplot made billions from the commercialization of frozen french fries by one of its scientists, chemist Ray L. Dunlap. By the early 1970s it was the primary supplier of french fries to McDonald's; by 2005 it supplied more than half of all french fries for the fast food chain. Simplot also produces fertilizers for agriculture the mining of which has been a cause of recent environmental concerns. Simplot is now one of the largest privately owned companies in the world (ranked 59th in Private Companies by Forbes magazine in 2004) and has branches in Australia, Canada, Mexico, China, and several other regions. One of the major plants is in Caldwell, Idaho. A view of the Simplot plant in Caldwell, Idaho, circa 1930-1945. The caption in the image states \\"World's Largest Dehydrating Plant.\\" J. R. Simplot retired as president of his company in 1973, but remained involved for many years. He stepped down as chairman of the board in 1994, and held the title of Chairman Emeritus until his death in 2008.  Philanthropy  Since its founding, J. R. Simplot Company has contributed to numerous local organizations and causes, including Ronald McDonald House, Boys and Girls Clubs, Future Farmers of America, St. Luke‚Äôs Children‚Äôs Hospital, and the Special Olympics. Much of the company‚Äôs philanthropic efforts are directed by employees serving on the company‚Äôs volunteer service committee. Additionally, the Simplot Company has donated thousands of pounds of potatoes to the Idaho Foodbank and the Boise Rescue Mission. They have also provided monetary support for the arts throughout Idaho including Ballet Idaho, Opera Idaho, and the Boise Philharmonic. In 2009, Simplot Company was awarded the Spirit of Treasure Valley award by the United Way of Treasure Valley.  Environmental record  In February 2002, Simplot agreed to buy equipment and pay penalties related to an unreported release of 80,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide from a facility in Pocatello, Idaho. The company violated the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act by failing to immediately notify the Power and Bannock Counties' Local Emergency Planning Committees or the State Emergency Response Commission of the release. In February 2004, J.R. Simplot Company agreed to pay the United States Environmental Protection Agency $525,000 and install $2 million in air pollution control equipment to resolve violations of the federal Clean Air Act at its silica sand mining facility in Overton, Nevada. The violation occurred in 1988 when the company removed equipment required by the federal Clean Air Act to control emissions of air pollutants. In early 2012, Simplot submitted a report to the Environmental Protection Agency to explain its view regarding how and why pollution limits could be eased in phosphate mine areas, and linking to livestock die-offs of sheep and cattle in other areas. Simplot is one of six major companies to join the Obama Administration in an effort to significantly reduce energy use over the next 10 years. The company has received a number of awards, including the Utah Board of Oil, Gas and Mining's Earth Day award for the environmental work completed in Nevada. In June 2012, Simplot partnered with two conservation groups and three phosphate mining companies in an effort to improve the water quality of the Blackfoot River in Eastern Idaho. The parties are: J.R. Simplot Company, Monsanto and Agrium/Nu-West Industries, the Idaho Conservation League and Trout Unlimited. Genetically modified potatoes Simplot developed the genetically modified Innate potato which was approved by the USDA in 2014 and the FDA in 2015. It is designed to resist blackspot bruising, browning and to contain less of the amino acid asparagine. Asparagine can become acrylamide during the frying of potatoes and is a probable human carcinogen, so reduced levels of it are desirable. The 'Innate' name comes from the fact that this variety does not contain any genetic material from other species (the genes used are \\"innate\\" to potatoes). RNA interference is used to \\"switch off\\" genes in this case. Simplot hopes that not including genes from other species will assuage consumer fears about biotechnology. The \\"Innate\\" potato is not a single cultivar, rather, it is a group of potato varieties that have had the same genetic alterations applied using the same process. Five different potato varieties have been transformed, thus creating \\"innate\\" versions with all of the original traits plus the engineered ones. Ranger Russet, Russet Burbank, and Atlantic potatoes have all been transformed by Simplot, as well as two proprietary varieties. Modifications of each variety involved two transformations, one for each of the two new traits. Food and Water Watch successfully petitioned McDonald's to reject Innate potatoes.

It is used extensively in fluorescence microscopy. As DAPI can pass through an intact cell membrane, it can be used to stain both live and fixed cells, though it passes through the membrane less efficiently in live cells and therefore provides a marker for membrane viability. History DAPI was first synthesised in 1971 in the laboratory of Otto Dann as part of a search for drugs to treat trypanosomiasis. Although, it was unsuccessful as a drug, further investigation indicated it bound strongly to DNA and became more fluorescent when bound. This led to its use in identifying mitochondrial DNA in ultracentrifugation in 1975, the first recorded use of DAPI as a fluorescent DNA stain. Strong fluorescence when bound to DNA led to the rapid adoption of DAPI for fluorescent staining of DNA for fluorescence microscopy. Its use for detecting DNA in plant, metazoa and bacteria cells and virus particles was demonstrated in the late 1970s, and quantitative staining of DNA inside cells was demonstrated in 1977. Use of DAPI as a DNA stain for flow cytometry was also demonstrated around this time. Fluorescence properties When bound to double-stranded DNA, DAPI has an absorption maximum at a wavelength of 358 nm (ultraviolet) and its emission maximum is at 461 nm (blue). Therefore, for fluorescence microscopy, DAPI is excited with ultraviolet light and is detected through a blue/cyan filter. The emission peak is fairly broad.Invitrogen, DAPI Nucleic Acid Stain . accessed 2009-12-08. DAPI will also bind to RNA, though it is not as strongly fluorescent. Its emission shifts to around 500 nm when bound to RNA.Scott Prahl, DAPI. accessed 2009-12-08.Kapuscinski J., . accessed 2013-02-25. DAPI (magenta) bound to the minor groove of DNA (green and blue). From . DAPI's blue emission is convenient for microscopists who wish to use multiple fluorescent stains in a single sample. There is some fluorescence overlap between DAPI and green-fluorescent molecules like fluorescein and green fluorescent protein (GFP) but the effect of this is small. Use of spectral unmixing can account for this effect if extremely precise image analysis is required. Outside of analytical fluorescence light microscopy DAPI is also popular for labeling of cell cultures to detect the DNA of contaminating Mycoplasma or virus. The labelled Mycoplasma or virus particles in the growth medium fluoresce once stained by DAPI making them easy to detect. Modelling of absorption and fluorescence properties This DNA fluorescent probe has been effectively modeled using the time-dependent density functional theory, coupled with the IEF version of the polarizable continuum model. This quantum- mechanical modeling has rationalized the absorption and fluorescence behavior given by minor groove binding and intercalation in the DNA pocket, in term of a reduced structural flexibility and polarization. Live cells and toxicity DAPI can be used for fixed cell staining. The concentration of DAPI needed for live cell staining is generally very high; it is rarely used for live cells. It is labeled non-toxic in its MSDShttp://www.kpl.com/docs/msds/710301.pdf and though it was not shown to have mutagenicity to E. coli, it is labelled as a known mutagen in manufacturer information. As it is a DNA binding compound, it is likely to have some low level mutagenic properties and care should be taken in its handling and disposal. Alternatives Endothelial cells stained with DAPI (blue), phalloidin (red) and through immunofluorescence via an antibody bound to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (green). The Hoechst stains are similar to DAPI in that they are also blue-fluorescent DNA stains which are compatible with both live- and fixed-cell applications, as well as visible using the same equipment filter settings as for DAPI.

While it is a cultural concept restricted among the Filipinos, analogous cultural phenomena of pregnancy food cravings have been observed in various cultures. It is still debatable as to whether lih√≠ can be classified and established as either a biological or psychological condition or a purely social and cultural one. Superstitions Lih√≠ also broadly encompasses a folk belief that whatever a woman had craved during pregnancy will imprint characteristics on the child. When a child resembles a manatee, for example, it is said that the mother enjoyed looking at that particular animal during the gestational period. In other regions, lih√≠ refers to the belief that any sensory stimuli imbibed by a pregnant woman influences the development of her child. Among some ethnic groups in the northern Philippines, it is taboo to mention anything about animals such as rats or pigs near a pregnant woman for fear that her child may acquire the features of the mentioned animals.

The brand was introduced in 1900 by the American Chicle Company, a company founded by Thomas Adams. History The Chiclets name is derived from the Mexican Spanish word \\"chicle\\", derived from the Aztec Nahuatl word \\"chictli/tzictli\\", meaning \\"sticky stuff\\", and referring to a pre-Columbian chewing gum found throughout Mesoamerica. This pre-Columbian chewing gum was tapped as a sap from various trees, but especially from the sapodilla tree. Chiclets are essentially the same as the indigenous chicle, with the innovation of a hard sugar coating offered in various flavors and colors. The original flavor was peppermint, and assorted fruit flavors were available in Algeria, Colombia, Argentina, Egypt, Canada, India, Iraq, Lebanon, Mexico, Syria, Dominican Republic, United Kingdom, Portugal, and parts of the Americas. Various people have been credited with inventing Chiclets including the brothers Robert and Frank Fleer, and Louis Mahle. As of 2016, the Chiclets gum brand was discontinued by Mondelez in the United States.

It stars Ryan Phillippe and Benicio del Toro, with Juliette Lewis, Taye Diggs, Nicky Katt, Scott Wilson, and James Caan in supporting roles. The film was released on September 8, 2000, and was a commercial disappointment, grossing $13 million against a production budget of $8.5 million. The critical reception was mixed, with some critics praising the acting, direction and action sequences, but criticizing the limits of the script and character development. The film is now considered a cult film. Plot Parker and Longbaugh are a pair of low-level petty criminals who fund their existence through unconventional and often illegal means. Wanting to move past petty crime, they vow to get the proverbial \\"big score.\\" While at a sperm donation clinic, the pair overhear a telephone conversation detailing a $1,000,000 payment to a surrogate mother for bearing the child of money launderer Hale Chidduck. Parker and Longbaugh resolve to kidnap the surrogate, Robin, but their attempt escalates into a shootout with her bodyguards, Jeffers and Obecks. The kidnappers are able to elude the bodyguards, who are arrested. Jeffers and Obecks are bailed out and returned to Chidduck by his right-hand man Joe Sarno. As Sarno begins coordinating Robin's rescue, Longbaugh contacts her gynecologist, Dr. Allen Painter, and orders him to a truck stop to examine Robin. After the examination, Painter returns to Chidduck, and it is revealed that the doctor is Chidduck's son. It is also revealed that Jeffers and Chidduck's wife are romantically involved. Longbaugh calls from a motel south of the Mexican border and demands a $15 million ransom. Jeffers and Obecks, tempted by the money, begin forming a plan to save the child and keep the money. As Longbaugh hangs up the telephone outside the motel, he is approached by Sarno, who identifies himself as the ‚Äúbag-man‚Äù and offers to pay $1 million if they surrender Robin and simply walk away. Longbaugh, who is clearly skeptical of the offer from a ‚Äúbag-man‚Äù declines the cash offer, but accepts Sarnos subsequent offer to buy him a cup of coffee. While having coffee the two discuss the current state of their chosen profession. Including the character of criminals and how no one takes ‚Äúbeing a criminal‚Äù serious anymore. Longbaugh jokingly mentions ‚Äúthey want to be criminals more than they want to commit crimes‚Äù, to which Sarno agrees. After the two leave the coffee shop Sarno tells Longbaugh that he ‚Äúseems like a good guy‚Äù and ought to get out of this business. To which Longbaugh replies ‚Äúwhat would I do then?‚Äù, indicating he is a true criminal. Sarno again offers to pay them $1 million dollars cash to turn Robin over to which Longaugh replies that he wishes he could accept the money but because Sarno is a bag- man he knows it would be a double cross eluding to that fact he was also a bag-man in the past. The two shake hands and guardedly go their separate ways. Longbaugh returns to his room, where Parker and Robin are playing cards. Sarno then returns to Chidduck's home to plan the next step. Jeffers comes to realize that Robin is Sarno's daughter. Jeffers, Obecks, and Painter leave to meet with the kidnappers, while Sarno departs separately with the ransom. At the motel, Parker is having second thoughts. As he confers with Longbaugh outside the motel room, Robin takes the opportunity to seize a shotgun and barricade herself inside. As sirens are heard in the distance, Parker and Longbaugh hastily escape, and Robin emerges just as Mexican police arrive, followed by Jeffers, Obecks, and Painter. As Painter and the bodyguards try to persuade Robin to leave with them, the officers pull their guns and order everybody onto the ground. Parker and Longbaugh open fire from a nearby hilltop, and the shootout leaves the two officers dead and Obecks wounded. Jeffers shoves Painter and Robin into his car and drives off. Parker and Longbaugh torture Obecks to learn Robin's location, while Jeffers confines Robin in a room in a Mexican brothel. Jeffers forces Painter to perform a Caesarean section to retrieve the baby, despite Robin's confession that the child is hers and Painter's and is not Chidduck's. Meanwhile, the heavily armed Parker and Longbaugh infiltrate the brothel. The ensuing gunfight, which leaves Parker wounded, turns into another standoff, until Painter shoots Jeffers. Outside, Sarno arrives with a group of men and the ransom, which they stack in the courtyard. Parker wants to kidnap Robin and Painter again, but Longbaugh, guilt-ridden after seeing her condition, responds: \\"She's had enough.\\" Despite realizing that the money is bait, Parker and Longbaugh charge headlong into an ambush. All of Sarno's men are killed in the ensuing firefight. However, Sarno manages to shoot and cripple the already wounded Parker and Longbaugh, and then calls for an ambulance. Painter emerges with Robin and the baby. Lying in a pool of blood, Parker and Longbaugh call out to Sarno, informing him that the baby is in fact Robin and Painter's, and thus Sarno's grandson. Parker wonders aloud if this fact will influence Sarno to let them keep the child. Robin and the baby are then taken away in the ambulance with Painter, Sarno and the money, leaving Parker and Longbaugh to die. Days later, Chidduck's wife reveals that she is pregnant.

No money. No control. No nothing. They didn't want my input, they just wanted me. For nothing.\\" Over coffee, Benicio del Toro asked McQuarrie why he had not made another crime film. McQuarrie replied that he did not want to be typecast as \\"a crime guy\\" but realized that he had nothing to lose, \\"unemployed and ready to make trouble.\\" Del Toro convinced him to write a crime film on his own terms because he would get the least amount of interference from a studio. McQuarrie was interested in making a movie \\"that you can follow characters who don't go out of their way to ingratiate themselves to you, who aren't traditionally sympathetic.\\" McQuarrie started to write the script and \\"the first thing I did was to write a list of every taboo, everything I knew a cowardly executive would refuse to accept from a 'sympathetic' leading man.\\" The first ten pages were a prologue, a trailer to another movie with Parker and Longbaugh (the real last names of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) and was \\"to be shot as slick and hip as possible. Guy Ritchie and Michael Bay but with horrible, unspeakable acts of violence and degradation.\\" During pre-production, McQuarrie realized that this was too extreme and cut it out. He and del Toro gave the script to several high-profile actors at the time all of whom turned them down. Ryan Phillippe wanted to change the direction of his career and \\"was besieged with choice offers, and we didn't want him, but he would not take no for an answer.\\" Reception=Box office The film opened at #9 at the North American box office making $2,150,979 in its opening weekend. Critical response On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 45% based on 132 reviews, with an average rating of 5.50/10. The site's consensus read: \\"Christopher McQuarrie may exhibit a way behind the camera in the stylish The Way of the Gun, but his script falters with dull characterization and a plot so needlessly twisty that most viewers will be ready to tune out before the final reveal.\\" On Metacritic, the film had a score of 49 out of 100, sampled from 30 critic reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews.\\" Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B- on scale of A to F. In his review for The New York Times, Elvis Mitchell wrote, \\"It's a song you've heard before, but each chord is hit with extraordinary concentration.\\" Andy Seiler praised James Caan's performance in his review for USA Today, \\"To hear Caan menacingly intone 'I can promise you a day of reckoning you will not live long enough to never forget' is to remember why this man is a star.\\" In his review for the Village Voice, J. Hoberman wrote, \\"Phillippe talks like Brando; Del Toro apes the body language. Nevertheless, James Caan steals the movie as a veteran tough guy, rotating his torso around some unseen truss.\\" Entertainment Weekly gave the film a \\"B\\" rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote, \\"The Way of the Gun plays like an unusually ritzy festival circuit audition film, though McQuarrie, it must be said, aces the audition.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, \\"McQuarrie pulls, pummels and pushes us, makes his characters jump through hoops, and at the end produces carloads of 'bag men' who have no other function than to pop up and be shot at ... Enough, already.\\" In his review for Time, Richard Corliss criticized McQuarrie for devising, \\"a two-hour gunfight interrupted by questions of paternity. But he's not so hot as a director, so what aims at being terrifying is just loud and goofy.\\" Peter Stack, in his review for San Francisco Chronicle, wrote, \\"The Way of the Gun attempts to be poetical Peckinpah, but it's a pointless exercise in gun violence with characterizations so thin they vaporize.\\" About the movie's reception, Christopher McQuarrie said: \\"I'm very proud of the film. Is the film flawed, it is uneven? Certainly. But it's sincere.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Category:2000 films Category:2000 action thriller films Category:2000 crime thriller films Category:2000s crime action films Category:2000s heist films Category:American films Category:American action thriller films Category:American crime thriller films Category:American heist films Category:American crime action films Category:American pregnancy films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Christopher McQuarrie Category:Films with screenplays by Christopher McQuarrie Category:Artisan Entertainment films Category:Lionsgate films Category:Neo- Western films Category:Films shot in Salt Lake City Category:Films scored by Joe Kraemer Category:2000 directorial debut films ","title":"The Way of the Gun"},{"id":"1503913","text":"Southwestern Ontario is a secondary region of Southern Ontario in the Canadian province of Ontario. It occupies most of the Ontario Peninsula bounded by Lake Huron, including Georgian Bay, to the north and northwest; the St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair, and Detroit River, to the west; and Lake Erie to the south. To the east, on land, Southwestern Ontario is bounded by Central Ontario and the Golden Horseshoe. The region had a population of 2,583,544 in 2016. It is sometimes further divided into \\"Midwestern Ontario\\" covering the eastern half of the area and the heart of Southwestern Ontario encompassing the western half of the region.

History Southwestern Ontario was first settled by Europeans in the early 18th century, when it was part of the Royal Province of New France. One of the oldest continuous settlements in the region is Windsor, which originated as a southerly extension of the settlement of Fort Detroit in 1701. With the transfer of New France to British control in 1763, the region was part of the British Province of Quebec, 1774 to 1791; the Province of Upper Canada, 1791 to 1841; and the Canada West division of the Province of United Canada, 1841 to Confederation in 1867, when United Canada was formally partitioned into the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. During the 19th century and early 20th century, the largest city in Southwestern Ontario was Windsor; however, as both cities grew, Windsor was outpaced by the faster growth of London, and passed the mantle of regional anchor to that city in the 1960s. Late in the 20th century the Kitchener‚ÄìCambridge‚ÄìWaterloo metropolitan area became the most populous metropolitan area in southwestern Ontario surpassing the London-St. Thomas metropolitan area, and serves as the anchor of Midwestern Ontario. Southwestern Ontario is a prosperous agricultural region whose chief crops are tobacco, sweet corn, soybean, winter wheat, canola, and tomatoes. Dairy and beef farming, breeding and training of standardbred horses and wine growing and production are also important industries. Its climate is among the mildest in Canada. Although brief periods of winter can be severe, summers are hot and humid with a longer growing season than in most of the country. More recently, the cannabis industry has become a major economic powerhouse in the region. Greenhouses, mostly concentrated in Essex County, have seen massive growth due to the region's warm climate. this has been especially prevalent since the legalization of recreational cannabis in Canada on 17 October 2018. Major global cannabis companies have risen throughout the 2010s. Aphria, in Leamington, has emerged to become one of the largest cannabis companies in Canada, even trading on the NASDAQ. A large section of Southwestern Ontario was part of the Talbot Settlement, and the region has benefited from the settlement‚Äôs facilitation of agriculture and of trade in general. Its economy is heavily tied in with that of the midwestern United States, in particular the border state of Michigan. Auto manufacturing and parts, agriculture and hi-tech industries are key components of the region‚Äôs economy. The region also provides important transportation routes for commercial trucking, railway and tanker shipping from Detroit-Windsor and Port Huron, Michigan-Sarnia linking Canada with major markets in the eastern and midwestern United States. Today the largest cities in Southwestern Ontario, in order of population (2016), are: London, Kitchener, Windsor, Guelph, Cambridge, Waterloo, Brantford, Sarnia, Stratford, Woodstock, St. Thomas and Leamington. Chatham is also a major population centre, but is not an independent municipality and is part of Chatham-Kent. Weather and climate Like other parts of southern Canada, the region brings warm or hot summers with normal thunderstorm occurrences. Some of these storms are severe, with damaging winds, hail and tornadoes all possible during peak season, May through September. The most likely areas for these kinds of weather events is within the Windsor - London corridor and north up to about Huron County. Winters are cold with less snowfall in the south towards Essex County and higher amounts north towards Bruce County. London receives approximately 30% more snowfall than Windsor, owing to its relative position to Lake Huron and the resulting snowbelt in Bruce and Middlesex counties. Under the K√∂ppen climate classification, much of this area has a humid continental climate (K√∂ppen Dfa/Dfb borderline). Infrastructure The southern portion of Southewestern Ontario is the most populated and industrialized section of the region. The southern portion is bisected by Highway 401 which runs through Windsor and past London to Woodstock and Waterloo-Wellington region. Highway 402 runs from London to Sarnia. The region is also serviced by major ports in Goderich on Lake Huron, Windsor on Lake Erie and just to the east Hamilton on Lake Ontario which is major destination for regionally produced grain. Windsor, London and Kitchener-Waterloo also have significant regional airports with some international flights. Dialect The accent in the region, Southwestern Ontario English is distinct, bearing similarity to the Midwestern USA accent for the areas adjacent to the Great Lakes.

In some cases, the piece of music may simply have been left off the track listing, while in other cases more elaborate methods are used. In rare cases a 'hidden track' is actually the result of an error that occurred during the mastering stage production of the recorded media. Techniques A vinyl record may be double-grooved, with the second groove containing the hidden tracks. Examples of double-grooving include Monty Python's 'three-sided' Matching Tie and Handkerchief, Tool's Opiate EP, and Mr. Bungle's Disco Volante. On indexed media such as compact discs, double-grooving cannot be used, but there are additional methods of hiding tracks, such as: *Similar to the above example, having the song as a separate unlisted track with its own index point. *Placing the song after another track (usually, but not necessarily, the last track on the album), following a period of silence. For example, Nirvana's song Endless, Nameless was included as a hidden track in this way on their 1991 CD Nevermind, after 10 minutes of complete silence. Although it was not the first hidden track to use this technique, this hidden song gained significant attention. *Placing the song in the pregap of the first track, so that the CD must first be cued to the track, and then manually back-scanned; these are often referred to as Track 0 or Hidden Track One Audio (HTOA). A CD player will not play these tracks without manual intervention, and some models (including computers) are unable to read such content. On Super Furry Animals third album, Guerrilla, The Citizens Band is found in the pre-gap approximately 5 minutes before the beginning of track 1\\\\. The song's lyrics are printed on the interior of the cardboard outer sleeve of the CD, essentially rendering them inaccessible without taking the sleeve apart. See List of albums with tracks hidden in the pregap. *Placing the song in pregaps on other tracks on the album. *Using many short tracks of silence before the hidden track. On Lazlo Bane's debut album 11 Transistor, the eleventh song, Midday Train, is followed by 57 silent tracks 4 seconds each, with Prada Wallet (sometimes referred to as The Birthday Song) being the 69th track on the album. The total length of silence between the two songs is 3:48. *Making the track playable only through a computer, such as the '15th' track on Marilyn Manson's Mechanical Animals album, which can only be accessed through an Enhanced CD executable. *Hide the song in a mixed or distorted way which must be undone to play it. For example, on a DVD included with the deluxe and 'ultra-deluxe' editions of Nine Inch Nails's Ghosts I‚ÄìIV, two hidden bonus tracks (37 Ghosts and 38 Ghosts) are included as digital multitrack files, from which the songs may be reconstructed. It is occasionally unclear whether a piece of music is 'hidden'. For example, Her Majesty, which is preceded by fourteen seconds of silence, was originally unlisted on The Beatles' Abbey Road, but is listed on current versions of the album. This is one of the first instances of a hidden track. The song snippet at the end of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is considered by some to be a hidden track, by others to be noise not worthy of such a designation, and by others to be part of A Day in the Life. Reasoning *Aaliyah's self-titled album Aaliyah features the hidden song Messed Up on track 15\\\\. During the stages of the album creation, Aaliyah had no desire to put this song on the album, but after numerous inquiries from different labels and colleagues, she decided on making it a hidden track. *In some rare cases, it is used to avoid legal issues. An example is Ramones' Loco Live American version, which has the song Carbona Not Glue hidden after Pet Sematary on track 17\\\\. It was originally recorded on their album Leave Home, but the makers of the spot remover Carbona, a registered trademark, objected. Therefore, reference to the song was removed from the album and cover. *Freedom by Paul McCartney was a hidden track on the original release of Driving Rain. It was later added as a track on the re- release. The track was not meant to be hidden; it was a tribute to 9/11 victims, and McCartney wanted it on the album. The artwork was already done, so it was a hidden track. *Train in Vain by The Clash, which appears at the end of London Calling, was left out of the vinyl's track listing simply because it was a last-minute addition to the album, when the sleeves were already printed. It is thus not a real hidden track. It was originally intended as a promotional giveaway for NME. The later CD versions list the track on the sleeve. *Green Day's All By Myself (by drummer Tr√© Cool) was added as a secret song to Dookie due to the low sound quality of the original live recording. *\\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic's Bite Me from the album Off the Deep End was put on after ten minutes of silence to scare listeners who had forgotten to turn off the CD player. In fact if you play the song backwards and slow it down by 800 percent, a distorted clip of the song Tears of the Earth by David Hallyday can be heard.Midnight Star \\"Ask Al\\" Q&As; for January/February 1998 It was also a loose parody of Endless, Nameless by Nirvana. The cover of Off the Deep End is also a parody of the album containing that track, Nevermind, and its first track is a parody of that album's first track, Smells Like Teen Spirit. *The X-Files: The Album, features a hidden track at 10 minutes and 13 seconds into the final track. The track consists of series creator Chris Carter explaining the series mythology and meaning behind the alien conspiracy. The hidden track even includes spoilers and minute details in the show's overall plot that had not yet been resolved on the show itself when the album was released. This track was included as both a surprise to devoted fans who would seek out answers in cross-promotional merchandise, and as a mystery to new fans who would need to watch the show more closely to better understand the track. *Eugene Mirman's album The Absurd Night Club Comedy of Eugene Mirman includes a hidden track making fun of hidden tracks, and telling the listener that he or she has a very bizarre mission. *The Jam's All Mod Cons does not list the song English Rose and its lyrics on original vinyl copies because Paul Weller believed the title and song lose meaning without accompanying music. They have been added to re-releases of the album. *Skip Spence's Land of the Sun was included as a hidden track by producer Bill Bentley to specifically close a tribute album to Spence, More Oar: A Tribute to the Skip Spence Album.Margaret Moser, \\"Back Door Man: The Man Behind More Oar, Bill Bentley\\" . The Austin Chronicle, December 17, 1999; www.austinchronicle.com. *Oasis' compilation album, Time Flies, features the single Sunday Morning Call as a hidden track. The album was an anthology of all of the band's singles, but principal songwriter Noel Gallagher openly detests the song, so chose to have it hidden. Notable hidden tracks Sometimes hidden tracks have become well known and received radio airplay, and occasionally climbed the charts. *The Beatles' track Her Majesty from their 1969 album Abbey Road is considered a hidden track, though it was originally a part of the album itself, before Paul McCartney requested that it be removed; the song was later inserted at the end of the master recording after 20 seconds of silence, because the producers were not willing to remove it entirely from the album. The original pressings of Abbey Road did not list Her Majesty on the back cover song title listing, nor the record label; subsequent LP pressings and then CD issues were issued revealing the track. However, two years prior, in 1967, on the UK version of the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album, there was the inner groove that appeared after A Day in the Life at the end of side 2\\\\. It was an unexpected, untitled, and un-credited Beatles recording; so this might be deemed a precursor to the hidden track. A potential hidden track on yet another Beatles album is on The Beatles (also known popularly as The White Album) 1968 double album. The hidden track is an unlisted, untitled and un-credited 'outro' to Cry Baby Cry, more popularly known as Can You Take Me Back, the primary lyrics of the song. *Janet Jackson's track Whoops Now, a hidden track from her album janet., was released as a single, and reached number 9 in UK Singles Charts, and number 1 in New Zealand Singles Chart. *The Rembrandts had a sudden radio hit in 1995 with I'll Be There For You, the theme song to Friends, so it was added at the last minute to their third album LP. As a result, the song was a hidden track on the early printing, since the CD packaging had already been completed by the time the song was added. A sticker was however added to the outer shrink wrap advising the song's inclusion. *Eels' album Daisies of the Galaxy contains a hidden track, Mr. E's Beautiful Blues, which was released as a single, and received radio airplay, although it was not featured on the sleeve notes. The song was, in fact, released as the first single from the album, and peaked at number 11 on the UK Singles Chart. *Cracker's Euro-Trash Girl, an original, was one of their biggest radio hits, despite being a hidden track on Kerosene Hat. *Skin (Sarabeth) by Rascal Flatts, a hidden track from their 2004 album Feels Like Today, received enough airplay to chart in the Top 40 on the country charts, peaking at number 2 in late 2005.

He is best known as the father of Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, the second wife of Charles, Prince of Wales. Early life Shand was born in London into an upper class family whose ancestors had moved to England from Scotland.Brandreth, Giles, 2005, Charles & Camilla: Portrait of a Love Affair, Century Publishing, London, , pp 75-79 He was the son of Philip Morton Shand (1888‚Äì1960), an architectural writer and critic who was a close friend of Walter Gropius and Le Corbusier and whose company, Finmar, imported furniture by Alvar Aalto into Great Britain. His mother was Edith Marguerite Harrington (1893‚Äì1981), later Mrs. Herbert Charles Tippet. Bruce Shand's parents divorced when he was three years old. His father went on to remarry three times. Shand did not see his father again until he was 18. One of his two half-sisters is Baroness Howe of Idlicote, wife of Lord Howe.Major Bruce Shand, The Guardian: Bruce Shand Shand's mother remarried Herbert Charles Tippet, a golf course designer. Contrary to some newspaper reports, young Shand was not abandoned by his mother and stepfather but was taken to live with them in Westbury, Long Island, New York, in 1921, a passage of his life that he omitted from his autobiography, giving the erroneous impression of having been abandoned. After visiting England in June 1923, Bruce and his mother returned to the US in September 1923 with the stated intent (according to US immigration records) of residing permanently in the United States and taking US citizenship. When he next returned to Britain it was to begin his education, organised and paid for by his grandparents. His mother and stepfather returned to Britain in 1927, then moved to Ireland in the 1930s. His stepfather died at Rye in 1947 and his mother died in Cooden Beach, Sussex, in 1981. Shand was sent to France to learn French. He was educated at Rugby and Sandhurst and was commissioned into the 12th Lancers as a second lieutenant on 28 January 1937. He became a troop leader in \\"A\\" Squadron. His interests included fox hunting, polo and reading.Obituary: Bruce Shand, BBC News : Bruce Shand Second World War Shand was promoted to lieutenant on 28 January 1940. He served in France as part of the British Expeditionary Force. The 12th Lancers were equipped with lightly armed Morris armoured cars in a reconnaissance role. The regiment spent six months at Foncquevillers during the Phoney War, then advanced to the River Dyle and retreated in the face of the German blitzkrieg. He aided in covering the withdrawal to Dunkirk, from where he was evacuated back to England, arriving back in Margate on 31 May 1940. For his actions, he was awarded an MC on 5 July 1940. After a period with the regiment in Poole and in Reigate, and an interlude training the North Irish Horse in Northern Ireland, Shand was sent with the regiment to North Africa in September 1941 as part of the 7th Armoured Division, where he was promoted to the temporary rank of captain. He won his second MC in January 1942, covering the withdrawal of armoured cars of the 6th Rajputana Rifles in the face of a strong counterattack by the Afrika Corps. The award was gazetted on 9 July of that year. He met Winston Churchill shortly before the Second Battle of El Alamein. On 6 November 1942, on a probe towards Marsa Matruh, his vehicle was surrounded and destroyed. Shand's two crewmen were killed, and he was wounded. He was captured and taken to Germany as a prisoner of war.PrinceofWales.gov.uk:Bruce Shand After treatment in Athens, he was held at Oflag IX A in Spangenberg Castle, near Spangenberg, for the duration of the war.Obituaries: Major Bruce Middleton Shand, The Telegraph: Bruce Shand While a prisoner of war, he was promoted to the rank of war-substantive captain and to the substantive rank of captain on 28 January 1945. Later life and death After his liberation, Shand returned to England in 1945. Due to his wounds, which made him unfit for active service, he was retired from the army on 25 April 1947, leaving with the honorary rank of major. On 2 January 1946, he married the Hon Rosalind Maud Cubitt, daughter of the 3rd Baron Ashcombe and the former Sonia Rosemary Keppel. They had two daughters, Camilla (b. 1947), Annabel (b. 1949) and a son, Mark (1951‚Äì2014). He kept a house in Plumpton in Sussex and a second in South Kensington, but later moved to Dorset. He had various business interests, most notably was a partner in Block, Grey and Block, a firm of wine merchants in South Audley Street, Mayfair, later joining Ellis, Son and Vidler of Hastings and London. Shand was a reviewer of military books for Country Life magazine. In 1990, he wrote a war memoir entitled Previous Engagements and was the editor of a fellow army officer Tom Bishop's memoirs titled One Young Soldier: The Memoirs of a Cavalryman, which was published in 1993. Shand compiled Bishops diaries to a book after his death in 1986. Shand was a Deputy Lieutenant of Sussex, and Vice-Lieutenant of East Sussex from 1974 until 1992. He remained passionate about fox hunting, and was Master of Southdown Fox Hounds from 1956 to 1975. He was Exon and later Adjutant and Clerk of the Cheque of the Queen's Body Guard of the Yeomen of the Guard. Shand supported the Conservative Party in the UK. In 1993, Shand reportedly reproached the Prince of Wales at a private event for ruining his daughter's life after the relationship became public. After a period of a strained relationship, both men eventually grew to like each other. His wife Rosalind died on 14 July 1994, aged 72, having long suffered from osteoporosis. He died from cancer in 2006, aged 89 at his home in Stourpaine, Dorset, with his family at his bedside. After a funeral service at the Holy Trinity Church in Stourpaine on 16 June, Shand's body was cremated. Memoirs *Author. (1990). Previous Engagements. Michael Russell Publishing Ltd *Editor. (1993).

A right-handed batsman, Gregory was the first Australian national cricket captain, leading the side for the first three recognised Test matches between England and Australia in March and April 1877 and January 1879. Gregory was also the captain of the New South Wales team, notably during the Sydney Riot of 1879 when he rebelled against an unpopular decision by Victorian umpire George Coulthard during a game against the touring English team. Gregory was part of a large cricketing family: his father, Edward William Gregory, was a \\"capable cricketer\\" with eight sons, five of whom played for New South Wales in international or intercolonial matches between 1861 and 84; in all, twenty of Edward William Gregory's descendants represented New South Wales in cricket and other sports.Rae Else-Mitchell, 'Gregory, David William (1845‚Äì1919)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, accessed 21 August 2011. David William Gregory was a man of striking appearance, he \\"looked like an Old Testament prophet not long out of training college.\\" Early life, education and career David William Gregory was born on 15 April 1845 at Fairy Meadow, near Wollongong, the son of Edward William Gregory, a bootmaker, and his wife Mary Anne n√©e Smith, who were married on 25 May 1835 at Sydney. He was educated at the St James Model School, Sydney. In 1861, he joined the New South Wales public service, assigned to the Auditor- General's Department. In 1883 he became inspector of public accounts and later paymaster of the Treasury for nine years until he retired. Cricket career His family came to include six other first-class cricketers: his brothers Ned, Charles and Arthur, and his nephews Syd, Charles William and Jack who lived nearby during his early life. (Ned would additionally become a curator of the Sydney Cricket Ground.)Clowes, p. 106. He first appeared for New South Wales in 1866, for whom he would play 38 matches until his retirement in early 1883. Averaging a low 14.57 with the bat, including a debut first-ball duck,Clowes, p. 15. he managed five half centuries including strong knocks of 85 and 74 at Melbourne and Sydney. Of the former, it was noted that he was a \\"marvel of patience at first, and then followed a grand display of good, punishing power, combined with a splendid defence\\". His score was a record at the time for New South Wales, and the match also saw the debut of his brother, Arthur.Clowes, p. 29. Despite his low average, however, it is illustrative of the conditions of the pitches on which he played that he would reach double figures on several occasions when other members of his team failed.Clowes, pp. 15-17, 21, 29. He would find success with the ball also, in his first match, he took 3/36 off 24.1 overs. and he would go on to take 29 wickets at 19.24, including a five-wicket-haul of 5/55. Test career Gregory had a less than successful international career with bat or ball, even by contemporary standards although he led his team to victory in 2 of the 3 Test matches he led Australia. In the 1st ever test match played at Melbourne he won the toss and elected to bat. His team won but he only managed 4 runs in 2 Innings. He enjoyed more success on his home grounds, scoring a career best 43 in the second Test against England in March 1877, having made only one earlier in the second. 1st Test 1876‚Äì1877 Dave Gregory made his Test debut batting at No: 4 for Australia. Australia was 40 for 2. He joined Charles Bannerman (Australia No: 1) on 26 not out. They were the world's 1st ever Test 3rd wicket partnership. Dave Gregory was 31 years 334 days old, the youngest test captain at that time. While touring England as captain in 1878 during Australia's first tour of England, however, he suffered on the host nations' wet cricket pitches, averaging only 11 with the bat in several matches often against teams of 18 or 22. At Lord's he made one of only two substantial scores of the tour, 42 in each innings against Middlesex. The other, 57, came against the Players at the end of the tour. He did, however, captain his team during their victory over the MCC, a match which, over in less than a day, \\"meant that never again would an Australian team be taken lightly in England.\\" Off the field, he was also involved, along with several other Australian players and a number of English team members, in an affair involving Billy Midwinter, an Australian all- rounder, attempted to play for both Australia and his domestic team, Gloucestershire, on the same day. Gregory led Australia at Melbourne against England in January 1879, scoring 12 in his only innings. His Test career statistics remained below par, with an average of 20.00 across his three Test career, passing into double figures only twice, and with no wickets under his belt from five overs of his bowling. He was succeeded in the captaincy by Billy Murdoch, having been the captain for all three of his Test appearances, with two victories and one defeat. He is the only Australian player to have made every international appearance as captain. Following what would be his last Test, Gregory captained New South Wales against the touring England team at the SCG in February. On the second day, 10,000 spectators witnessed England collapse. When the New South Wales team batted and Billy Murdoch was adjudged run out, no new batsman emerged. England players were sent to the pavilion, at which point it became clear that Gregory was insisting the match be halted while a new umpire was found. The ensuing disturbance became known as the Sydney Riot of 1879. While allegations of collusion with match fixers began, a number of spectators began to cross the pitch and had to be fended off by players armed with cricket stumps for over thirty minutes. The England team and Gregory's Australian side reached an impasse until Edmund Barton, then the other umpire, was able to calm Gregory down. While play was poised to resume, a further pitch invasion prevented this. Playing style Gregory had a stubborn, \\"indignant\\", gritty batting approach. In his obituary Wisden described Gregory's batting style thus: \\"Like many Australian batsmen in those early days, he had no grace of style to recommend him, but his defence was stubborn and he lacked neither pluck nor patience\\", and attributed his lack of successful scores to the pitches rather than his talent. Later cricket career After retirement, Gregory was made honorary secretary of the New South Wales Cricket Association, and also stood as an umpire for a first-class match on 27 January 1892.Clowes, p. 48. He died in Turramurra, Sydney in 1919. and was buried in the Gore Hill Cemetery. Dave Gregory's Test career batting graph.

It is named after Pafnuty Chebyshev. It is also known as chessboard distance, since in the game of chess the minimum number of moves needed by a king to go from one square on a chessboard to another equals the Chebyshev distance between the centers of the squares, if the squares have side length one, as represented in 2-D spatial coordinates with axes aligned to the edges of the board. For example, the Chebyshev distance between f6 and e2 equals 4.  Definition  The Chebyshev distance between two vectors or points x and y, with standard coordinates x_i and y_i, respectively, is :D_{\\\\rm Chebyshev}(x,y) := \\\\max_i(x_i -y_i).\\\\ This equals the limit of the Lp metrics: :\\\\lim_{p \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\bigg( \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\left x_i - y_i \\\\right^p \\\\bigg)^{1/p}, hence it is also known as the L‚àû metric. Mathematically, the Chebyshev distance is a metric induced by the supremum norm or uniform norm. It is an example of an injective metric. In two dimensions, i.e. plane geometry, if the points p and q have Cartesian coordinates (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2), their Chebyshev distance is :D_{\\\\rm Chebyshev} = \\\\max \\\\left ( \\\\left  x_2 - x_1 \\\\right  , \\\\left  y_2 - y_1 \\\\right  \\\\right ) . Under this metric, a circle of radius r, which is the set of points with Chebyshev distance r from a center point, is a square whose sides have the length 2r and are parallel to the coordinate axes. On a chess board, where one is using a discrete Chebyshev distance, rather than a continuous one, the circle of radius r is a square of side lengths 2r, measuring from the centers of squares, and thus each side contains 2r+1 squares; for example, the circle of radius 1 on a chess board is a 3√ó3 square.  Properties  In one dimension, all Lp metrics are equal ‚Äì they are just the absolute value of the difference. The two dimensional Manhattan distance has \\"circles\\" i.e. level sets in the form of squares, with sides of length r, oriented at an angle of œÄ/4 (45¬∞) to the coordinate axes, so the planar Chebyshev distance can be viewed as equivalent by rotation and scaling to (i.e. a linear transformation of) the planar Manhattan distance. However, this geometric equivalence between L1 and L‚àû metrics does not generalize to higher dimensions. A sphere formed using the Chebyshev distance as a metric is a cube with each face perpendicular to one of the coordinate axes, but a sphere formed using Manhattan distance is an octahedron: these are dual polyhedra, but among cubes, only the square (and 1-dimensional line segment) are self-dual polytopes. Nevertheless, it is true that in all finite-dimensional spaces the L1 and L‚àû metrics are mathematically dual to each other. On a grid (such as a chessboard), the points at a Chebyshev distance of 1 of a point are the Moore neighborhood of that point. The Chebyshev distance is the limiting case of the order-p Minkowski distance, when p reaches infinity.  Applications  The Chebyshev distance is sometimes used in warehouse logistics, as it effectively measures the time an overhead crane takes to move an object (as the crane can move on the x and y axes at the same time but at the same speed along each axis). It is also widely used in electronic CAM applications, in particular, in optimization algorithms for these. Many tools, such as plotting or drilling machines, photoplotter, etc. operating in the plane, are usually controlled by two motors in x and y directions, similar to the overhead cranes.

A general concept of expanded molecules Remi Chauvin Tetrahedron Letters Volume 36, Issue 3, 16 January 1995, Pages 397-400 Carbo-mers differ from their templates in size but not in symmetry when each C‚ÄìC single bond is replaced by an alkyne bond C-C‚â°C-C, each C=C double bond is replaced by an allene bond C=C=C=C, and each C‚â°C triple bond is replaced by C‚â°C-C‚â°C. The size of the carbo-mer continues to increase when more C2 units are inserted, so carbo-mers are also called carbon-molecules, where \\"n\\" is the number of acetylene or allene groups in an n-expansion unit. This concept, devised by R√©mi Chauvin in 1995, is aimed at introducing new chemical properties for existing chemical motifs. Two distinct expansions of benzene can be called carbo-benzene (C18H6): :carbo-benzene One (above right) expands each C-H bond to C-C‚â°C-H, making hexaethynylbenzene, a substituted benzene derivative.Hexaethynylbenzene Rainer Diercks, James C.

The Lapinj√§rvi Educational Center is a schooling facility located in Lapinj√§rvi in southern Finland. The main purpose of the Educational Center is training for civilian service (). Finnish civilian service law requires a compulsory general training period at the start of the service. Civilian service training periods are held 11 times per year and are four weeks long. As well as civilian service, the Educational Center can be used for other schooling. Institutions wishing to hold schooling periods can rent parts of the Educational Center for the duration of the period. The center is sometimes called \\"Lapinj√§rvi legion\\" () in Finnish slang. Location Lapinj√§rvi is located in the eastern part of southern Finland, near the cities of Loviisa and Kotka. It is roughly 90 km away from Helsinki and 107 km away from the Russian border. The Educational Center is not actually located in the main Lapinj√§rvi residential area but instead roughly 5 km west from it. History The oldest part of the Educational Center area is the Sj√∂kulla mansion, built in 1886 although its history dates back to the 14th century under Swedish rule. The mansion itself is not used for schooling but is preserved as a historical monument. Between the 14th and 20th centuries, the mansion has frequently switched owners. In 1896, the mansion and its auxiliary buildings served as a schooling facility for farmers. The farming school was closed down in 1911. The current schooling facility buildings were originally built in 1936‚Äì1938. From 1934 to 1937 the facility served as a temporary workplace for young unemployed men who wanted to try their hand at getting employed or re-employed. In 1937, the facility became a rehabilitation center for alcoholics. This continued until 1939, when the Winter War forced it to become a base for a military mobile infantry group. After the war ended in 1940, the facility was restored as an alcoholism rehabilitation center, which continued until 1986. In 1990, the facility became a reception and temporary habitation center for foreign immigrants. The center was closed in 1995. The facility finally became a civilian service training and general-purpose schooling facility in 1997, when the civilian service training was moved from Vaasa to Lapinj√§rvi.

Rumwold is said to have lived for only three days but professed his faith continuously during his life. The English Civil War The English Civil War helped develop Banbury‚Äôs then arms industry. The Royalist garrison was constantly at work early in 1645 digging saltpetre in King's Sutton and making gunpowder out of it in a house specially built near Banbury. Just over 10 years earlier a government saltpetreman had operated at Banbury for a year, having moved there from the then small market town of Coventry, before moving on to Hook Norton a short while afterwards. King's Sutton was a local centre for saltpetre excavation and digging at the time.Crossley, 1972, pages 49-71 Parish church The oldest parts of the Church of England parish church of Saints Peter and Paul are the Norman font and largely Norman chancel. The north aisle was added in the 13th century and the south aisle early in the 14th century. The bell tower and most of the windows are Decorated Gothic. The spire was added to the tower probably late in the 14th century, raising the steeple to a height of .Pevsner & Cherry, 1973, page 278 Sir Nikolaus Pevsner considered it \\"one of the finest, if not the finest, spire in this county of spires\\".

She was the second Navy ship to be named for Ashland, the home of Henry Clay, in Lexington, Kentucky. Ashland was laid down on 4 April 1988, by the Avondale Shipyards, New Orleans, La.; launched and christened on 11 November 1989, sponsored by Mrs. Kathleen Foley, wife of Admiral Sylvester R. Foley, Jr. (Ret.); and commissioned on 9 May 1992, at New Orleans. As of 2013, Ashland is homeported at Sasebo, Japan, and assigned to Amphibious Squadron 11. 2005 rocket attack On 19 August 2005, the Ashland and the USS Kearsarge were targeted by three Katyusha rockets while in port in Aqaba, Jordan. The vessels were not hit, but one Jordanian soldier was killed and another was wounded after two rockets hit nearby docks. The third rocket landed on a taxi near the Eilat airport in Israel but did not explode. Responsibility was claimed by the Abdullah Azzam Shaheed Brigade, which states that it is associated with the al-Qaeda terrorist group.  Later service  In January 2007, the warship was sent to the coast of Somalia to conduct antiterrorist operations as part of the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower task force. On 31 May 2008 The Guardian reported that the human rights group Reprieve said up to seventeen US Naval vessels may have been used to covertly hold captives. Reprieve expressed the concern the Ashland had been used as a receiving ship for up to 100 captives taken in East Africa. In April 2008, Ashland visited Antsiranana, Madagascar. On 10 April 2010, seven suspected pirates on a skiff shot at the Ashland approximately off the coast of Djibouti. Ashland fired two rounds at the skiff from her MK-38 Mod 2, 25mm gun. The people on board the skiff abandoned ship as it became engulfed in flames. Rigid-hulled inflatable boats from the Ashland rescued the six surviving individuals and brought them aboard the ship for medical treatment. The Ashland was not damaged and there were no injuries to the crew.Hulette, Elisabeth, \\"Ashland Returns with a Story To Tell: Pirates\\", Norfolk Virginian-Pilot, 16 August 2010. On 29 November 2010 Jama Idle Ibrahim was sentenced at a federal courthouse in Norfolk, Virginia to 30 years in prison for his involvement in the April piracy attacks against the Ashland. \\"Today marks the first sentencing in Norfolk for acts of piracy in more than 150 years,\\" said U.S. Attorney Neil H. MacBride.http://www.rttnews.com/Content/GeneralNews.aspx?Id=1492481&SM;=1 On 26 April 2017 The US Justice Department released a statement saying that Mohamed Farah, 31, of Somalia was sentenced to life in prison for his role in the attack. Mid-life extension work on the Ashland, completed in 2012, included normal repair and refurbishment, as well as major alterations to several ship systems. Improvements to the ship's diesel engines, onboard networks, engineering control systems, and power management, and improved capacity for air conditioning and chilled water distribution were made. The biggest long-term change, however, involved the replacement of high- maintenance steam systems with all-electric functionality. In November 2013, Ashland and USS Germantown (LSD-42) supported relief operations in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan. In August 2015, Ashland with portions of the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit embarked conducted Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA) in Saipan after Typhoon Soudelor passed through the Commonwealth of Northern Marianas Islands.

It was launched in 1991 to compete with Ampex's D-2. D-3 uses half-inch metal particle tape at 83.88 mm/s (compare to D-2's 19 mm and 131.7 mm/s). Like D-2, the composite video signal is sampled at four times the color subcarrier frequency, with eight bits per sample. Four channels of 48 kHz 16‚Äì20 bit PCM audio, and other ancillary data, are inserted during the vertical blanking interval. The aggregate net (error corrected) bitrate of the format is 143 Mbit/s, and because the codec is lossless, it has been used in data applications. Camcorders were available which used this format, and are to date the only digital tape camcorders to use a lossless encoding scheme. The D-5 format, introduced in 1993 by Panasonic and marketed as D-5 HD, uses the D-3 transport and tape running at roughly double D-3 speed. The D-3 transport in turn is derived from the MII transport. D-3/D-5 tapes come in small (161 mm √ó 96 mm √ó 25 mm), medium (212 mm √ó 124 mm √ó 25 mm), and large (296 mm √ó 167 mm √ó 25 mm) cassettes, with format-specific recognition holes. Maximum D-3 runtimes (in the Fujifilm lineup) are 50, 126, and 248 minutes. The D-3 format is now regarded as obsolete. In the early 1990s the BBC embarked on a massive project to copy its older video tapes onto D-3 for archival, but the D-3 cassettes themselves have become obsolete and are being transferred to modern digital video standards. There is doubt over whether the surviving D-3 machines will last long enough to play the 340,000 tapes which the corporation holds.

LLU also offers distance education. It is a part of the Seventh- day Adventist education system. The university is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). Its on-campus church has around 7,000 members. Loma Linda Academy, a Seventh-day Adventist K-12 school, is located nearby. History Early Postcard of Loma Linda Sanitarium Beginnings Loma Linda University had its beginning in 1905 when Seventh- day Adventists John Burden and Ellen G. White worked together to purchase the property and develop what became known as the Loma Linda Sanitarium.Review and Herald, September 20, 1906, p. 24. Online access may be found at the SDA General Conference Online Document Archives linked here. In 1906, Ellen White recalled: > \\"While attending the General Conference of 1905, at Washington, D. C, I > received a letter from Elder J. A. Burden, describing a property he had > found four miles west of Redlands, five and one-half miles southeast of San > Bernardino, and eight miles northeast of Riverside. As I read his letter, I > was impressed that this was one of the places I had seen in vision, and I > immediately telegraphed him to secure the property without delay. He did so, > and as the result, Loma Linda is in our possession.\\"Review and Herald, June > 21, 1906, p. 8 In February 1906, a council of church workers met at Loma Linda. It consisted of the faculty of Fernando Academy, the faculty of the Loma Linda school, and the executive committee of the Southern California Conference. John Burden reported their ideas to Ellen White in a letter dated February 14 that there was agreement on the siting of the school. In 1906, The Loma Linda College of Evangelists was established. Courses included: * Religion: Bible Evangelism, Acts and Epistles, Missionary Methods, and Doctrines and Prophecies. * General: History, Languages, Mathematics, English, Music, Piano and Organ. * Industrial: Science of Gardening, Practical Gardening, Electrical Mechanics, Carpentry, Cookery, Accounting, Sewing. * Nursing/Medical: Chemistry and Anatomy, Children's Diseases, Physiology, Obstetrics, Gynecology, Hydrotherapy, Practical Nursing and Hydrotherapy. The 1910 Seventh-day Adventist Yearbook enters the school as 'Loma Linda College'. It adds the legal title, 'College of Medical Evangelists of Loma Linda' (CME) and notes that the school was chartered as a Medical College in 1909. At the General Conference Committee Council held at Takoma Park, April 5‚Äì15, 1910. Later that same year, the minutes for the 187th Meeting of the General Conference Committee, December 2, recorded that the medical school and other facilities were to be furnished in 1910. 1910 to 1919 Early Clinical Developments = From 1913 to 1962, the university taught basic sciences in Loma Linda, but sent its students to Los Angeles for clinical experience. Ellen White promoted rural settings for Adventist schools, but to train medical students, the school needed clinical experience. Loma Linda Sanitarium did not have such a clinic.In the early 1900s these walk-in clinics were called dispensaries or treatment rooms. The American Medical Association would not recognize the medical college if it did not provide adequate clinical experience for its students. In 1905, the American Medical Association formed a national Council on Medical Education. Dr. Nathan Porter Colwell (1870‚Äì1936) became its first secretary the next year. In reaction, Adventists leaders interested in developing the medical school met with Dr. Colwell. He visited the campus and gave counsel on how to proceed. E. E. Andross, president of the Pacific Union Conference of Seventh-day Adventists and chairman of the board for the College of Medical Evangelists, reported on a special meeting of the constituency of the college convened at Loma Linda, January 27, 1913. A large number of General Conference men were in California at time. Andross called this meeting in order to benefit from their counsel. In his report, he wrote that a medical hospital and dispensary was needed to address accreditation requirements for the future medical education at the institution. On September 29, 1913, the College of Medical Evangelists opened the First Street Dispensary in the heart of Los Angeles. =Los Angeles Hospital= The December 16, 1915 Review and Herald reported on the General Conference Committee's Biennial Council which met in November at Loma Linda: > \\"In order to equip and properly complete the medical college at Loma Linda, > Cal., it will be necessary to build in Los Angeles a hospital requiring an > outlay of approximately $60,000. The constituency of the medical college > voted to erect this building when the funds have been provided, so that > there will be no further increase of indebtedness. A memorial presented, > suggesting that the necessary funds to this end be raised by the women of > the denomination, and that a committee of sisters be appointed to promote > this work...\\" =World War I and a 'B' Rating= The United States federal government exempted medical students from the military draft. But they would only recognize 'A' and 'B' rated medical schools. The College of Medical Evangelists only had a 'C' rating. The California state authorities supported a higher rating. After a nationwide effort, Percy T. Magan and colleagues persuaded Dr. Colwell to visit the school and determine whether a 'B' rating could be given. After the AMA's visit, the rating was upgraded to 'B'. Medical students who had already left for their military duties returned to finish their medical training. Margaret Rossiter White, Historical Records Librarian at Loma Linda wrote at the time it was a tremendous victory for Loma Linda. 1919-1960 LLU's 47 General Hospital, Milne Bay On November 16, 1922, Dr. Colwell reported that the Council on Medical Education had granted an 'A' rating to the College of Medical Evangelists. The medical world, under the leadership of the American Medical Association was quickly developing standards for medical education and for the quality of hospitals. The requirements for accreditation developed as well. The July 12, 1923 Review and Herald presented the addresses given at the Educational Convention held at Colorado Springs, Colo., June 5‚Äì19, 1923. In an article entitled 'Separation from the World in Education', W.E. Howell, former President of the Loma Linda College of Evangelists (1906) and at the time of the article, the Secretary, or director, of the SDA General Conference Education Department expressed concern for where dependence on accreditation would lead Adventist schools. During World War II, the CME sponsored the 47th General Hospital.The Alumni Journal, Volume 17, Issue 1, August 1946 as quoted in Loma Linda University History website linked here. A picture of the CME's 47th General Hospital stationed at Milne Bay is available at the U.S. Army Medical Department Office of Medical History linked here. 1960-1980 Nichol Hall = University status and name change = In 1961 college leaders voted to convert the institution to a university and renamed the institution after the city. All its science and clinical faculties were consolidated within the city of Loma Linda by 1962. On July 9, 1967, the university opened the Loma Linda University Medical Center with more than 125 patients from the old community hospital. The university also operated the Seventh-day Adventist liberal arts college in Riverside from 1967 to 1990, which is now known as La Sierra University. In 1980, the state designated LLU the only Level I trauma center in San Bernardino, Riverside, Inyo and Mono counties, which comprise more than a fourth of the state's land mass. About 1,600 emergency helicopters land there each year. 1980-2011 In October 1984, at Loma Linda University Medical Center, Baby Fae became the first human to receive a heart of a baboon. The transplant appeared to be successful, but Baby Fae died 21 days later of heart failure due to rejection of the transplant. In 1991, B. Lyn Behrens became the first female president of LLU. Serving until March 2008, she was succeeded by Richard Hart, who had previously served as LLU's chancellor. Loma Linda University celebrated the Grand Opening of its new Centennial Complex on October 28, 2009. The complex includes new classrooms, two large 200-400 seat amphitheaters and more than 100 workstations with labs for dental, medical, physical therapy and graduate students. Updated technology allows the university to link to areas around the globe. Additionally, the complex houses simulation labs where students can practice medical skills on live actors and sophisticated robotic mannequins. The complex was expected to bump up the university's growth by 25 percent from its current enrollment of 4,000 students to 5,000 students by 2010. Grants and funding The University applies for and receives grants from various organizations. Some of the research grants include: * California Walnut Commission for walnut research * Pfizer Public Health & Government Group for public health television and Internet programming * NSF Partnership for Innovation Grant in partnership with the Larta Institute Federal government support The special relationship between Loma Linda University and Representative Jerry Lewis, R ‚Äì San Bernardino, first came to light in a Pulitzer Award-winning expose written by Jerry Kammer. Lewis has lent significant help in funding important school operations. From 1998-2003, Loma Linda has received $167.2 million in federal funds, the number one academic recipient in the country receiving nearly $60 million more than the runner up, the University of South Florida. In 2000, it was the single largest recipient of higher education grants at $36 million. Several grants were from the Department of Defense, plus $5 million from NASA for space radiation research. Critics point out that the brother of Lewis is employed by Loma Linda University. In 2008, Loma Linda University received nearly $9.5 million of which $5 million came from the Department of Defense. Academic programs Loma Linda University offers more than 100 degrees and certificate programs in the following Schools: * School of Allied Health Professions * School of Behavioral Health * School of Dentistry * School of Medicine * School of Nursing * School of Pharmacy * School of Public Health * School of Religion * Faculty of Graduate Studies School of Public Health The Loma Linda University School of Public Health was founded in 1967.

However, political tension soon evolved between Yel√º Bei and his younger brother Yel√º Deguang, who took the imperial throne of Khitan after their father Yel√º Abaoji died, en route to his homeland from a relatively successful campaign against the Later Tang. The new emperor ordered his elder brother to move his capital from Huhan in Eastern Manchuria to Liaoyang in Western Manchuria.

To continue Balhae's friendly relations with Japan, Dongdan sent a diplomatic mission over the Sea of Japan in 929.

Its 2008 population was recorded to be 419,030. Built on the banks of the Gash River, it is a market town and is famous for its fruit gardens. Many of its inhabitants are from the Beni-Amer group, with others being of Hadendawa, Tigre, and Bilen origin in addition to a small group of Rashaida nomads who migrated from Eritrea in the last three decades. The town was formerly a railroad hub, however, as of 2006 there was no operational railway station in Kassala and much of the track leading to and from the town has been salvaged or fallen into disrepair. Kassala's location along the main Khartoum-Port Sudan highway makes it an important trade center.  History  In the 18th and 19th centuries, the town was a key node in the west‚Äìeast trade route, linking the coastal ports of Massawa and Suakin with the Sudan and farther west.Miran, Jonathan. \\"Red Sea Citizens.\\" Indiana University Press, 2009. Page, 87 The town was conquered by Ottoman soldiers of Egyptian viceroy Muhammad Ali in 1840 during his military offensive into Sudan. In 1885, Kassala was subsequently captured by the Mahdists. In 1894, after the Battle of Kassala the Italians captured the city from the Mahdists. In 1897, the Kingdom of Italy returned Kassala to the Kingdom of Egypt under British leadership,Winston Churchill, The River War, Longman 1899 vol.1 pp.354-6 in order to get international recognition of the Italian colony of Eritrea. In 1899, Kassala fell under the purview of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan until Sudanese independence in 1956. Local people at Kassala photographed during a visit by Walter Mittelholzer in February 1934.

In July 1940, during the East African Campaign, Italian forces advancing from Italian East Africa forced the local British garrison to withdraw from Kassala. The Italians then occupied the city with brigade-sized units:Map showing in detail the Kassala occupation by Italians (within a green line) indeed on July 4, 1940 the Italians started their offensive with 2,500 men (and one brigade of cavalry) supported by 24 tanks, while to defend Kassala for Britain there were 1,300 colonial soldiers with their British officers who -after some initial heavy fighting- were easily defeated. The Italians later appointed as mayor of Kassala the future hero of Eritrean independence, Hamid Idris Awate. In mid-January 1941, the Italians withdrew from the city and a British garrison returned.

XXXIX, no. 2, 1998.NOVA, 2003, \\"Who Killed the Red Baron? Explore Competing Theories\\" (Public Broadcasting Service) Popkin was an anti-aircraft (AA) machine gunner with the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF) during the First World War. Early life Popkin was born in Sydney on 20 June 1890 and was a carpenter by trade. When he enlisted in the AIF, in Brisbane on 6 May 1916, he was living in Palmwoods, Queensland. Military career Popkin left Australia on 20 October with the 6th Reinforcements, 7th Machine Gun Company on HMAT Port Lincoln. By April 1918, Popkin ‚Äì who had achieved the rank of Sergeant ‚Äì was a gunner in the 24th Machine Gun Company, part of the Australian 4th Division, which was stationed in the Somme Valley, France. Death of the Red Baron At about 10:35 a.m. on 21 April, Richthofen, flying his red Fokker Dr.I, engaged Sopwith Camels from 209 Squadron, Royal Air Force (RAF). He pursued a Camel piloted by a Canadian, Lieutenant Wilfrid May. In turn the Baron was chased by another Canadian pilot, Captain Roy Brown. The three planes flew over Morlancourt Ridge, in the 4th Division's sector, and Popkin ‚Äì using a Vickers machine gun ‚Äì and other Australian machine gunners and riflemen also fired at Richthofen. The Baron was hit by a 0.303 calibre bullet which passed diagonally from right to left through his chest. He then made a hasty but controlled landing, in a field on a hill near the Bray-Corbie road, just north of Vaux-sur-Somme. One witness, Gunner George Ridgway, stated that when he and other Australian soldiers reached the plane, Richthofen was still alive but died moments later.Miller 1988 Another eyewitness, Sergeant Ted Smout, reported that Richthofen's last word was \\"kaputt\\" (\\"finished\\") immediately before he died.Discovery Channel, 2002, Unsolved History: Death of the Red Baron (television documentary) The RAF credited the \\"kill\\" to Brown, although it is now considered all but certain by historians, doctors, and ballistics experts that Richthofen was actually killed by an AA machine gunner firing from the ground. The identity of the person who shot the Baron remains uncertain; 0.303 ammunition was the standard ammunition for all machine guns and rifles used by British Empire forces during World War I. Many experts believe that the shot probably came from Popkin, though some believe that William John \\"Snowy\\" Evans may have been responsible.Unsolved History: Death of the Red Baron, 2002, Discovery Channel Autopsies revealed that the wound which killed the Baron was caused by a bullet moving in an upward motion. It was reported that a spent .303 bullet was found inside Richthofen's clothing. These facts, and the angle at which the bullet passed through Richthofen's body, suggest that he was killed by a long distance, low velocity shot from a ground-based weapon. Many Australian riflemen were also shooting at the Baron at the time, so one of them may have fired the fatal shot. However, Popkin was an experienced AA gunner, the volume of fire from the Vickers was far greater (at least 450 rounds per minute) than the bolt-action Lee‚ÄìEnfield rifles (up to 30 rounds per minute) used by the infantry, and Popkin was the only machine gunner known to have fired at Richthofen from the right, and from a long distance, immediately before he landed. Wounding and later life On 19 June 1918, Popkin received a shrapnel wound to his right leg, which was later amputated. He was invalided back to Australia on 5 January 1919, arriving on 7 March.See Popkin, C. B. service records. Accessed at After being discharged from the army, he worked once more as a carpenter. He spent most of the remainder of his life in Tweed Heads and the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales. He died in Tweed Heads on 26 January 1968 at the age of 77. He is buried in Brisbane. In 1964, Popkin told the Brisbane Courier-Mail: \\"I am fairly certain it was my fire which caused the Baron to crash, but it would be impossible to say definitely that I was responsible ... As to pinpointing without doubt the man who fired the fatal shot, the controversy will never actually be resolved.\\"NOVA 2003 Planned memorial A memorial to Popkin is being planned for the hinterland town of Palmwoods by the local RSL sub- branch.http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/cedric-popkin-the-aussie- credited-with-bringing-down-ace-wartime-pilot-the-red-baron-to-be-honoured-at- palmwoods/story-fnn8dlfs-1227220030270 A memorial to Popkin is planned for the village of Tyalgum, NSW, where he was postmaster, by local residents in November 2018.

The GS&WR; grew by building lines and making a series of takeovers, until in the late 19th and early 20th centuries it was the largest of Ireland's \\"Big Four\\" railway networks. At its peak the GS&WR; had an network, of which were double track. GSWR Ireland route map, circa 1902 GSWR British Isles connections map, circa 1902 The core of the GS&WR; was the Dublin Kingsbridge ‚Äì main line; Ireland's \\"Premier Line\\", and still one of her most important main line railways. The company's headquarters were at Kingsbridge station. At its greatest extent the GS&WR; included, in addition to the Dublin ‚Äì Cork main line, the Dublin ‚Äì and ‚Äì Waterford lines and numerous branch lines. Origins There had been earlier attempts to set up min line railways to the south of Ireland but the 1840s efforts of Peter Purcell, a wealthy landowner and mail coach operator, and his associates were ultimately to prove successful with the implementation of a bill passed on 6 August 1844 for the GS&WR.; Purcell was actively assisted by engineer John Benjamin MacNeill who had done surveys for the London and Birmingham Railway and had connections in London. The GS&WR;'s vision to provide a single railway for most of the south of Ireland found favour with United Kingdom Prime Minister Robert Peel as having likely more profitably for wealthy investors and because a single company would be easier to control; these factors likely easing the passing of relevant legislation. Network=Dublin ‚Äì Cork Main Line William Dargan, Ireland's foremost railway contractor, built much of the GS&WR;'s main line and a number of its other routes. The directors chose to begin by construction of the stretch of the Dublin ‚Äì Cork main line as far as Cherryville Junction just west of and the branch to with contracts shared between McCormack and Dargan. Work began in January 1845 with services commencing on 4 August 1846. Trains were scheduled to take about 2hr 35min for the stretch to Carlow and coach connections were arranged to Kilkenny, Clonmel, Waterford and the evening mail coach for Cork. In July 1848 the main line reached , where it met the Waterford and Limerick Railway and thus linked Dublin and by rail. In October 1849 the main line reached the outskirts of Cork, where the GS&WR; opened a temporary terminus at Blackpool. The final of line from Blackpool to the centre of Cork includes a tunnel and was not completed for another six years. Services through the tunnel began in December 1855, running to and from a second temporary terminus beside the River Lee. Finally the present terminus in Glanmire Road opened in July 1856. Expansion and competition Corridor Train of the GS & WR. The Irish South Eastern Railway opened between the GS&WR; station at Carlow and in 1848 and reached Lavistown in 1850. From the outset the ISE was worked by the GS&WR.; The Waterford and Kilkenny Railway had already reached Lavistown, and thus completion of the ISE enabled GS&WR; services to reach . The W&KR; reached in September 1854 but its relations with the GS&WR; were poor, which impeded traffic between Dublin and Waterford by this route. In 1877 the W&KR; took over the Central Ireland Railway and became the Waterford and Central Ireland Railway. The GS&WR; took over the W&CIR; in 1900, thus belatedly bringing the rail route between Dublin and Waterford under the control and operation of a single company. The Great Southern Railway Terminus in Killarney, Co. Kerry. Circa 1890 The GS&WR; competed with the Midland Great Western Railway for many years. Both ran services between Dublin and the west of Ireland: the GS&WR; running southwest to Limerick, Cork and Waterford, and the MGWR running west to , Westport, , and . The GS&WR; also had designs on rail traffic to the west of Ireland. In 1859 the GS&WR; opened a branch line from the Dublin ‚Äì Cork main line to where it connected with the MGWR's Dublin ‚Äì Galway main line. In the latter half of the 20th century C√≥ras Iompair √âireann made this GS&WR; branch part of its Dublin ‚Äì Galway main line. Waterford, Limerick and Western Railway In 1901 the GS&WR; bought the Waterford, Limerick and Western Railway, which gave it both the Waterford ‚Äì Limerick ‚Äì Athenry ‚Äì Claremorris ‚Äì Collooney cross-country route and the North Kerry Line and branches. The WLWR, recently dubbed the Western Rail Corridor, crossed MGWR territory. It complemented the radial MGWR lines from Dublin, enabling Limerick ‚Äì Galway and Galway ‚Äì Sligo traffic, and linked intermediate destinations in the west of Ireland. For a very short time the MGWR exercised running powers over the Athenry ‚Äì Limerick section of this route. North Wall extension GS&WR; North Wall extension depicted on 1912 map The line was opened in 1877 to resolve limitations with the GS&WR; neither having rail access convenient to the cattle market at Cabra nor to the docks at North Wall where there was a requirement for goods, cattle and passenger services. The London and North Western Railway (LNWR) was supportive of the venture as was the rival Midland Great Western Railway (MGWR) who were to receive tolls for part of the route. The branch opened on 2 September 1877 diverging from the main GS&WR; line at Islandbridge Junction before tunneling under Phoenix Park to Cabra where cattle sidings and pens were constructed. After passing under the MGWR line to and the MGWR's Liffey Branch to North Wall the route curved back to join the MGWR at Glasnevin Junction. Joint running rights were obtained over the MGWR route until Church Road junction in the North Wall complex after which the route diverged to the GS&WR;'s new cattle pens and sidings. Link spurs were available at Newcomen Bridge to Amiens Street station and to the LNWR station at North Wall for passenger ships to Great Britain. =Drumcondra link line= 1891 had seen the connection to the Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Railway (DW&WR;) following the opening of the Dublin loop line from Westland Row with additional traffic to the Liffey branch line. The GS&WR; eventually moved on an opportunity to open an alternative route line from at what was to be known as Drumcondra junction which diverged just before the junction to the MGWR at Glasnevin. The route ran to the north of Croke Park then rejoined the MGWR just before Church Road junction in the North wall complex allowing the same access at North Wall for GS&WR; services. Opening on 1 April 1901 it avoided the MGWR's Liffey branch tolls. A spur from the Drumcondra link line to the DW&WR; at Amiens Street was finally realised on 1 December 1906. GS&WR; hotels In an effort to encourage tourism the Killarney Junction Railway, which was operated by the GS&WR;, opened a hotel next to station. This was in 1854, which made it the first railway-owned hotel in Ireland and one of the first of its kind in the World. In the following years the GS&WR; established further hotels in County Kerry at Caragh Lake, Kenmare, Parknasilla and Waterville. The company also owned small commercial hotels at and near its stations in Dublin and Cork. In 1925 the hotels became part of Great Southern Hotels, a subsidiary of Great Southern Railways. The Great Southern Hotels Group was dissolved in 2006, when its hotels were sold off separately to private investors. GS&WR; strike In September 1911 the workers of the Great Southern and Western Railway went on strike nationally after two checkers at Kingsbridge goods station in Dublin were suspended for refusing to handle timber that had been delivered by \\"blackleg\\" lorry drivers during a strike by the timber merchant's workers. The British Army was brought in to guard tracks and trains, and Protestant strike-breakers from elsewhere in Ireland to do the work of the strikers. The strike was savagely broken in two months, with the railway's proprietor, William Goulding, sacking 10% of the workers for their participation in the strike. Goulding told his associates, \\"Now that we have the men defeated, we'll never have any more trouble.\\" People ;Chairmen Peter Purcell, a wealthy landowner and mail coach operator, was the main mover of the GS&WR; railway and became its first chairman: *1844 ‚Äî Peter Purcell *1846 ‚Äî George Carr *1849 ‚Äî Sir Edward McDonnel *1860 ‚Äî William Haughton *1878 ‚Äî James C.

The driver had been on duty from 3.50am. Of the 200 passengers on board, 96 were seriously injured, one of whome later died as a result. Aftermath=Great Southern Railways An Act passed by the D√°il √âireann in 1924 merged the GS&WR; with the Midland Great Western Railway, the Cork, Bandon and South Coast Railway and most other railways wholly within the Irish Free State to form the Great Southern Railway. In January 1925 the GSR merged with the Dublin and South Eastern Railway to form the Great Southern Railways. Cross-border railways were excluded from the mergers. C√≥ras Iompair √âireann In 1945 further amalgamation with the Grand Canal Company and the Dublin United Tramway Company created C√≥ras Iompair √âireann (\\"Irish State Transport Company\\"). CI√â was nationalised in 1950, but was divided into separate rail and road companies in 1987. Since then, the railways have been operated by Iarnr√≥d √âireann (\\"Irish Rail\\").

They are Dakotan-speaking\\"Dakota branch of the Siouan language family\\", Ethnologue; cf. Western Siouan languages/Family division tribes that broke away from the main branches of the Sioux nation in earlier times. They moved farther from the original territory of the woodlands of present-day Minnesota into the northern and northwestern regions: Montana and North Dakota of the present-day United States and Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta of present- day Canada. Later they became competitors for resources and enemies of their former language-family \\"allies\\". (In each of the dialects, nakota, dakota and lakota means \\"friend\\" or \\"ally\\".) History of misnomer Historically, scholars classified the tribes belonging to the Sioux nation (or Dakota in a broad sense) into three large language groups:See, as examples, Frederick W. Hodge (ed.), Handbook of American Indians North of Mexico, 2 Pts./vols., Bureau of American Ethnology Bulletin 30, Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution, U.S. GPO, 1907/1910 (1:376), and Robert H. Lowie, Indians of the plains, American Museum of Natural History. Anthropological Handbook 1, New York: McGraw Hill, 1954 (8) * Dakota (proper), who were the easternmost group (the original one) and were called Is√°≈ãyathi or Is√°≈ãathi (whence the Europeanized name of Santee); * Nakota, who were said to comprise the two central tribes of the Yankton and the Yanktonai, and * Lakota, who formed the westernmost group and were called Th√≠t»üu≈ãwa≈ã (term Europeanized into Teton). The Assiniboine had separated from the Yankton-Yanktonai grouping at an early time. Their language, called Nakota as well, became more distinct and unintelligible to Lakota and Dakota speakers. For a long time, very few scholars criticized this classification.Among the first was the Yankton/Lakota scholar Ella Deloria [cf. below] (Ullrich, p. 2). The inaccuracy of the scheme was also discussed, in 1976, in Patricia A. Shaw's PhD Dissertation, Dakota Phonology and Morphology, University of Toronto (cited by Parks & Rankin, p. 97). For a non-linguist point of view, cf. also E. S. Curtis (The North ... , vol. 3, The Teton Sioux. The Yanktonai. The Assiniboin, p. 142 ): \\"All tribes of Sioux use the term Dak√≥ta, or Lak√≥ta, to designate those who speak one of the Dakota dialects, excepting the Assiniboin. The latter, however, include themselves under the term (Nak√≥ta)\\". In 1978, Douglas R. Parks, David S. Rood, and Raymond J. DeMallie engaged in systematic linguistic research at the Sioux and Assiniboine reservations to establish the precise dialectology of the Sioux language.A summary of the research can be found in Parks/DeMallie, 1992. They ascertained that both the Santee and the Yankton/Yanktonai referred (and refer) to themselves by the autonym \\"Dakota.\\" The name of Nakota (or Nakoda) was (and is) exclusive usage of the Assiniboine and of their Canadian relatives, the Stoney. The subsequent academic literature, however, especially if it is not produced by linguistic specialists, has seldom reflected Parks and DeMallie's work.See the works by G. E. Gibbon and J. D. Palmer cited among the sources of the present article or Paul B. Neck's book about Dakota chief Inkpaduta (Inkpaduta. Dakota Leader, Norman, University of Oklahoma Press, 2008, ) Their conclusions have been fully confirmed by the 23-year-long research carried out in the field by Jan Ullrich. From it, he compiled his 2008 Lakota dictionary. According to Ullrich, the misnomer of the Yankton- Yanktonai > \\"began with the mid-nineteenth century missionaries among the Santee who > over-applied a rule of phonetic distribution. Because the Yankton-Yanktonai > dialect uses the suffix -na where Santee uses -da and Lakota -la, the > missionaries thought that the l-d-n distribution applied to all word > positions.The missionaries' error was facilitated by the fact that in > Lakota, the letter \\"d\\" was replaced by the letter \\"l\\", . in so systematic a way that it disappeared from the alphabet (cf. Ullrich, p. 693). Thus, they believed the Yankton-Yanktonai people called themselves Nakota instead of Dakota. Unfortunately, the inaccurate assumption of a Lakota-Dakota-Nakota division has been perpetuated in almost every publication since then\\",Ullrich, p. 2. gaining such influence that even some Lakota and Dakota people have been influenced by it.Raymond DeMallie reports that the word 'nakota' has \\"become a symbol of self-identification for Yankton and Yanktonai young people that distinguished them from the Santee-Sisseton and Teton ...\\" (\\"Sioux ...\\", p. 750). The change cannot be regarded as a subsequent terminological regression caused by the fact that Yankton-Yanktonai people lived together with the Santee in the same reserves.A like thesis is held by James H. Howard. While admitting that, in modern times, all the oriental and central Sioux groups use the term Dakh√≥ta to designate themselves (and the whole nation), he suggests that the form Nakh√≥ta has just \\"fallen into disuse'\\" among the Yankton and the Yanktonai (The Canadian ... , p. 4) The oldest texts that document the Sioux dialects are devoid of historic references to Nakota. Ullrich notes particularly that John P. Williamson's English-Dakota Dictionary (1902) lists Dakota as the proper name for the Dakota people, but does not mention Nakota. Still, Williamson had worked extensively with the Yankton and frequently included in his dictionary Yankton variants for Santee entries. Moreover, Ullrich notes that the Yankton scholar Ella Cara Deloria (born in 1888) was among the first to point out \\"the fallacy of designating the Yankton-Yanktonai groups as Nakota.\\". Currently, the groups concerned refer to themselves as follows in their mother tongues: *Dakh√≥ta (or Dakh√≥d) ‚Äì the Santee *Dak»ü√≥ta (or Dak»ü√≥d) ‚Äì the Yankton and the Yanktonai *Lak»ü√≥ta (or Lak»ü√≥l) ‚Äì the Teton (this reference has fallen into disuse and now, they simply call themselves the Lak»ü√≥ta) *Nakh√≥ta (Nakh√≥da or Nakh√≥naCf. above) ‚Äì the AssiniboineThe endonym includes both the Assiniboine/Stoney and the Lakota/Dakota. *Nakh√≥da (or Nakh√≥ta) ‚Äì the Stoney Present trends Recently the Assiniboine and, especially, the Stoney have begun to minimize the historic separation from the Dakota. They have claimed some identity with the Sioux nation, although such a centralized unit no longer exists. Historically, the Siouan tribes were quite decentralized as well and operated independently in bands. The tendency can be seen on Alberta's Stoney official Internet sites, for example, in the self- designation of the Alexis Nakota Sioux First Nation,Cf. http://www.alexisnakotasioux.com/ or in the claim of the Nakoda First Nation to their Sioux ancestry and the value of their native language: \\"As descendants of the great Sioux nations, the Stoney tribal members of today prefer to conduct their conversation and tribal business in the Siouan mother tongue\\".Cf. Saskatchewan's Assiniboine and Stoney tribes also claim identification with the Sioux tradition.Cf. . According to the Saskatchewan Indian Cultural Centre (SICC), some elder Stoney say they can understand Lakota better than Assiniboine. They believe they may be \\"Rocky Mountains Sioux\\" rather than descendants of the Hohe (\\"Rebels,\\" as the Assiniboine used to be called). The Assiniboine-Stoney tribes have supported recent \\"pan-Sioux\\" attempts to revive the native languages. Their representatives attend the annual \\"Lakota, Dakota, Nakota Language Summits.\\" Since 2008, these have been sponsored by Tusweca Tiospaye (Dragonfly Community), the Lakota non-profit organization for the promotion and strengthening of the language.Thusw√©ƒçha Thi√≥≈°paye They promote a mission of \\"Uniting the Seven Council Fires to Save the Language\\".Cf. . The Lakota promoters acknowledge a common origin with the Nakota peoples: 2008's Language Summit was an effort to unite the Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota (\\"Sioux\\") oyate (peoples) in both the United States and Canada to revive the Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota languages. In the program of the 2009 summit, the list of the tribes forming the \\"Seven Council Fires\\" included the Assiniboine and Stoney in the \\"Fire\\" of the Yanktonai. (This was the group from which they are said to have separated historically.) Later, the two Nakota tribes were shifted to the end of the list. The wording, \\"Also includes the Stoney and Assiniboine People,\\" was retained.2009 Summit The long separation of the peoples has resulted in their languages developing independently and becoming more differentiated; they are no longer mutually intelligible. Lakota and Dakota speakers cannot understand Assiniboine readily. Neither they nor Assiniboine speakers can understand Stoney. The tribes' goal to revive (or create) a unitary Sioux language may be extremely difficult to achieve.

During the 19th century, inspired by the establishment of the Indo-European family, scholars looked for similarly widespread families elsewhere. Building on the work of predecessors such as Rasmus Rask and Matthias Castr√©n, Max M√ºller proposed the Turanian grouping primarily on the basis of the incidence of agglutinative morphology, naming it after Turan, an ancient Iranian term for the Turkish lands of central Asia. The languages he included are now generally assigned to nine separate language families. Classification M√ºller viewed the structure of the family as follows: * Northern Division (Ural-Altaic) ** Tungusic ** Mongolic ** Turkic ** Samoyedic ** Finnic * Southern Division ** Taic ** Malaic (Malayo-Polynesian) ** Bhot√Æya (Tibeto- Burman) *** Gangetic *** Lohitic ** Munda ** Tamulic (Dravidian) He left Japonic, Koreanic, Koryak, Itelmen and various languages of the Caucasus unclassified, but suggested that they might have a common origin with Turanian. Linguists no longer consider typological features a sufficient criterion for the identification of language families. M√ºller's northern division, Ural-Altaic, was widely accepted for some time, but largely abandoned early in the 20th century. The combination of the Samoyedic and Finnic (Finno-Ugric) classes form the modern Uralic family. The Altaic theory linking Tungusic, Mongolic and Turkic is also rejected by most scholars. Each of the five classes of his southern division are now considered to belong to separate language families, Tai‚ÄìKadai, Austronesian, Sino-Tibetan, Austroasiatic and Dravidian respectively.

Examples of common classes of biological targets are proteins and nucleic acids. The definition is context-dependent, and can refer to the biological target of a pharmacologically active drug compound, the receptor target of a hormone (like insulin), or some other target of an external stimulus. Biological targets are most commonly proteins such as enzymes, ion channels, and receptors.  Mechanism  The external stimulus (i.e., the drug or ligand) physically binds to (\\"hits\\") the biological target. The interaction between the substance and the target may be: * noncovalent ‚Äì A relatively weak interaction between the stimulus and the target where no chemical bond is formed between the two interacting partners and hence the interaction is completely reversible. * reversible covalent ‚Äì A chemical reaction occurs between the stimulus and target in which the stimulus becomes chemically bonded to the target, but the reverse reaction also readily occurs in which the bond can be broken. * irreversible covalent ‚Äì The stimulus is permanently bound to the target through irreversible chemical bond formation. Depending on the nature of the stimulus, the following can occur: * There is no direct change in the biological target, but the binding of the substance prevents other endogenous substances (such as activating hormones) from binding to the target. Depending on the nature of the target, this effect is referred as receptor antagonism, enzyme inhibition, or ion channel blockade. * A conformational change in the target is induced by the stimulus which results in a change in target function. This change in function can mimic the effect of the endogenous substance in which case the effect is referred to as receptor agonism (or channel or enzyme activation) or be the opposite of the endogenous substance which in the case of receptors is referred to as inverse agonism.  Drug targets  The term \\"biological target\\" is frequently used in pharmaceutical research to describe the native protein in the body whose activity is modified by a drug resulting in a specific effect, which may be a desirable therapeutic effect or an unwanted adverse effect. In this context, the biological target is often referred to as a drug target. The most common drug targets of currently marketed drugs include: * proteins ** G protein-coupled receptors (target of 50% of drugs) ** enzymes (especially protein kinases, proteases, esterases, and phosphatases) ** ion channels *** ligand-gated ion channels *** voltage-gated ion channels ** nuclear hormone receptors ** structural proteins such as tubulin ** membrane transport proteins * nucleic acids  Drug target identification  Identifying the biological origin of a disease, and the potential targets for intervention, is the first step in the discovery of a medicine using the reverse pharmacology approach. Potential drug targets are not necessarily disease causing but must by definition be disease modifying. An alternative means of identifying new drug targets is forward pharmacology based on phenotypic screening to identify \\"orphan\\" ligands whose targets are subsequently identified through target deconvolution.  Databases  Databases containing biological targets information: * Therapeutic Targets Database (TTD) * DrugBank * Binding DB  Conservation ecology  These biological targets are conserved across species, making pharmaceutical pollution of the environment a danger to species who possess the same targets. For example, the synthetic estrogen in human contraceptives, 17-R-ethinylestradiol, has been shown to increase the feminization of fish downstream from sewage treatment plants, thereby unbalancing reproduction and creating an additional selective pressure on fish survival. Pharmaceuticals are usually found at ng/L to low-Œºg/L concentrations in the aquatic environment. Adverse effects may occur in non-target species as a consequence of specific drug target interactions. Therefore, evolutionarily well-conserved drug targets are likely to be associated with an increased risk for non- targeted pharmacological effects.

Wad Madani lies on the west bank of the Blue Nile, nearly 85 miles (136 km) southeast of Khartoum. \\"Wad Madani\\" (description), Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2007, webpage: EB-WM. It is linked by rail to Khartoum and is the center of a cotton-growing region. The city is also the center of local trade in wheat, peanuts, barley, and livestock. It is also headquarters of the Irrigation Service. In 2008, its population was 345,290. It is the home of the Wad Medani Ahlia College, a private university.  History  In the early 19th century, Wad Madani (Madani) was a small Turko- Egyptian outpost, which grew rapidly following the 1925 Gezira Scheme of irrigation to stimulate local economic development. Wad Madani is a commercial centre of the Gezira agricultural district and is mostly residential. Wad Madani has lively commercial activities with good souqs. The beaches of Wad Madani are on the eastern river bank of the Blue Nile, which flows into Sudan from Ethiopia. The city's facilities are more modernized than most places in the Sudan (except the Khartoum area). The University of al-Gezira is also in the area. Many famous figures are from Wad Madani, including, the popular Sudanese singers Insaf Madani, Abdel Aziz El Mubarak, Mohammed Al Ameen and Ibrahim Al Kashif, the renowned human rights lawyer and President of the Sudan Human Rights Monitor, Dr. Amin Mekki Medani, and the Chairman of the National Consensus Forces, Farouk Abu Issa. The center of the town's areas are the souq, Al Daraga, Al Gism Al Awal, Wad Azrag and the Sudanese District (formerly known as the British District). Geography=Climate Wad Madani has a hot desert climate (K√∂ppen climate classification BWh).  Education  Wad Madani is one of the main locations for most of Sudan's top educational institutes.

In 1853 surveyor James Blackburn saw the site as a location for a water catchment though the Yan Yean Reservoir was eventually built instead. The local council proposed a 65-hectare park in 1969 with several more proposals made but due to lack of funds none eventuated. Following floods in September 1984, construction of the lake was proposed to prevent future flooding and provide recreational facilities. Construction began in 1988 and was completed in June 1990. It was officially opened to the public on 7 July 1990. Local residents often walk, run or cycle around the lake for fitness reasons.

Early days He moved to Western Canada, after leaving Bawating High School from Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, with the band Shama. Shama toured Western Canada and was managed by Bruce Allen (Bryan Adams, Martina McBride) before disbanding.The Story of Shama 1976-1980 From that point he became the lead guitarist of Trama, managed by Sam Feldman (Joni Mitchell, Diana Krall), then on to playing bass for the band Paradox which evolved into his current band Cease & Desist. Cease & Desist has been described as \\"one of Vancouver's most popular club bands\\" by the rock music critic of The Province. He also played the part of John in a Beatles cover band, Revolver, that was put together for Expo 86, and played occasionally throughout the subsequent decade. Songwriting Mick has written or co- written many songs on albums for artists as diverse as country music's Brent Howard and Canada's Singing Cowgirl: Marilyn Faye Parney, the heavy rock sounds of Blackstone (released on the Delinquent label in Canada), the soul/R&B; sounds of 'j.c. neill', Belinda Metz and new singing sensation 'Emily Jordan' to the 'smooth jazz' sounds of internationally acclaimed Lori Paul. He co-wrote ten of the eleven songs on Paul's album Vanity Press. His first country song 'The Wrangler' reached the country top 30 charts right across Canada. It also achieved 'Heavy Rotation' on C.M.T., Canada's country music video channel. One of the songs from Mick's 'A Whistler Christmas' album entitled, 'All I Want is You at Christmastime' has been recorded and released by Canadian country star, Brent Howard and has also been sent to be recorded by 'Art Garfunkel' for a compilation Christmas album due in the not too distant future. He has also written music for movies, television, videos, video games and promotional spots. His writing styles run the gamut from 'Smooth Jazz' to 'Heavy Thrash'. (A Whistler Christmas and Dalla-Vee's original Christmas songs are often heard on Canadian radio during their Christmas music programming.) Producing Aside from producing himself in an array of projects such as 1994's A Whistler Christmas album,A Whistler's Christmas album he runs his own studio 'Millennia Sound Design', producing and engineering for artists like: Randy Bachman, Emily Jordan, jcneill, Lori Paul, Hello Beautiful amongst others. He has ongoing contracts with The National Braille Factory, and has provided theme music and soundscapes for two network television series and Simon Fraser University. Randy Bachman's new CD \\"Jazzthing\\" had some work done on it at \\"Millennia Sound Design\\". Vocals Dalla-Vee has contributed to projects as diverse as, the multi platinum heavy rock of the \\"M√∂tley Cr√ºe\\" album \\"A Decade of Decadence\\" to the country/rockabilly sounds of Brent Howard and Southern Cherry to Colin Arthur Wiebe. Canadian legends, Trooper and The Powder Blues Band have also used Mick's voice for recordings. He has worked extensively as a studio session singer/musician, with his talent of many voices being used on a worldwide 'Karaoke' album package marketed over the dreaded U.S. infomercial. He has sung a number of commercial jingles for radio and television. Awards Having recorded with a host of other Canadian and international recording acts such as Randy Bachman (of the band The Guess Who and Bachman Turner Overdrive), Mick was awarded a 'Gold Record' for his work on the 'Trooper' album 'Last of the Gypsies' in 1991. In 2011-2012 Mick received first a Gold Status award then a Platinum status award for The Live DVD: Bachman & Turner Live at The Roseland Ballroom in New York City. The guest performer with the band for that show and DVD was Paul Shaffer of The Late Show with David Letterman. Mick also earned a Platinum status for the DVD ‚ÄòRandy Bachman‚Äôs Vinyl Tap‚Äô which was filmed during the cross Canada tour of the show by the same name. Mick is the featured vocalist as well as bass player in Randy's live band. In 1997, he received the Saskatchewan Album of the Year Award for his song writing/musician contributions to an album with proceeds going to people affected with multiple sclerosis.

From the top of the Headland, with a covering of gorse and heather, there are fine views towards Abersoch and Pwllheli as well as over Cardigan Bay. The whole area is privately owned common land and is zigzagged by many paths. Great care must be taken on the slope where numerous accidents have occurred. Along the cliff coast are situated three disused granite quarries, relics of pre-war activity. At the sea end of the headland from the beach when the tide is out are the remains of the jetty that was used by ships to transport the stones from the quarries. The remains of the old quarry buildings can also be seen; one is a large hopper building, where stone setts that were cut at the quarry were stored before being transported by ship. A \\"Tin Man\\" sculpture can be found on Llanbedrog headland from the beach, designed by local sculptors and installed in 2002.

It is normally represented as a cormorant, and appears as such on the city's arms, in which it bears a branch of laver seaweed in its beak as a further pun on the name \\"Liverpool\\". History 13th century seal of Liverpool (lost in the English Civil War) King John founded the borough of Liverpool by royal charter in 1207. The borough's second charter, granted by Henry III in 1229, gave the townspeople the right to form a guild with the privileges this came with, including the right to use a common seal. Liverpool's ancient seal probably dated from this time, though the earliest surviving impression (kept in the British Museum) is from 1352. The seal depicted a generic bird with a plant sprig in its beak, together with a scroll inscribed (in shaky letters) \\"JOHIS\\" - an abbreviation for Johannis, Latin for \\"of John\\". The bird was almost certainly intended to be an eagle, the symbol of John the Evangelist, who was both the namesake and the patron saint of King John. The plant sprig is interpreted as broom (planta genista in Latin), a badge of the Plantagenet dynasty. Also visible on the seal is a star and crescent, one of King John's personal badges. The shoddy draughtsmanship of the seal has given rise to other theories. Richard Brooke, a 19th-century Liverpudlian antiquary, surmised that the bird was a dove with an olive branch, and that the scroll read \\"NOBIS\\" or \\"VOBIS\\". By the 17th century the bird's real identity had been forgotten: it began to be interpreted either as a cormorant, a common bird in the area, or as a \\"lever\\". In 1611 the municipal records describe the mayor receiving a plate \\"marked with the Cormorant, the Townes Armes\\", while in 1668 the Earl of Derby gifted the town a silver-gilt mace engraved with a \\"leaver\\". In his 1688 work The Academie of Armorie, Randle Holme records the arms of Liverpool as a blue \\"lever\\" upon a silver field. Holme takes this word to be an adaptation of the German loffler or Dutch lepler/lefler, both referring to the spoonbill. It is possible that these continental words were adopted for the bird in Liverpool's arms as they made a fitting allusion to the name \\"Liverpool\\". Around the same time the broom sprig in the bird's beak was reinterpreted as a branch of laver, also on account of the similarity of the word to the city's name. In August 1796 Mayor Clayton Tarleton wrote to the College of Arms to request an official grant of arms to the city. His letter called the bird \\"a lever or sea cormorant\\". Arms were duly granted on 22 March 1797 by Sir Isaac Heard, Garter King of Arms, and George Harrison, Norroy King of Arms; however the grant described the bird only as a \\"cormorant\\". In addition to the arms and crest, Garter granted supporters on 23 March. These consist of Neptune, the god of the sea, and his son and herald Triton. The motto is Deus Nobis Haec Otia Fecit‚Äîa quotation from Virgil's Eclogues translating to \\"God hath granted us this ease\\" or \\"God has bestowed these blessings upon us\\". Representations in the city Representations of the bird can be found throughout Liverpool, most numerously on the heritage lamp standards in the town centre on which small versions sit as a top piece. The two most famous stand atop the clock towers of the Royal Liver Building at Liverpool's Pier Head, overlooking the Mersey. Their names are Bertie and Bella. The male, Bertie looks over the city and the female, Bella looks to the sea. \\"A tale of the Liver Birds & the Hidden Birds of the City\\", Explore Liverpool, 19 August 2019. Retrieved 25 May 2020 The building, headquarters to the Royal Liver Assurance, was opened in 1911. The metal cormorant-like birds were designed by Carl Bernard Bartels and constructed by the Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts. There are two less well- known liver birds in the city. A third metal bird is on the nearby Mersey Chambers office building, adjacent to the Church of Our Lady and St Nicholas, the parish church of the city of Liverpool. The fourth, a bird carved in stone, topped the original St John's Market building until its demolition in 1964. The stone liver bird is now displayed at the Museum of Liverpool. Though nowadays the bird is inseparable in the public mind with Liverpool Football Club, the first club to use it as a symbol was in fact Everton. It was replaced in the 1930s with the Everton Lock-Up, another Liverpudlian icon. Some fans believe it should be reinstated, arguing that as a symbol of the whole city it rightfully belongs to both clubs. Modern myths and popular culture Liver bird from the old Sailors' Home, now in Liverpool Museum The modern popularity of the symbol largely dates to 1911, when the Liver Building was built. This prominent display of two liver birds rekindled the idea that the liver was a mythical bird that once haunted the local shoreline. According to popular legend, they are a male and female pair: the female looking out to sea, watching for the seamen to return safely home, and the male looking in to the city, watching over the seamen's families (or \\"making sure the pubs are open\\", as a jocular version has it). Local legend also holds that the birds face away from each other, for if they were to mate and fly away, the city would cease to exist. In fact, they were indeed designed to watch the city (our people) and the sea (our prosperity). Another popular story told about them is that they are chained down, for if they were to fly away the River Mersey would burst its banks and flood the city of Liverpool. This is somewhat similar to the mating story. An all female rock group from Liverpool called The Liverbirds was active in the 60s. They moved to Hamburg in 1964, where they were billed as die weiblichen Beatles (the female Beatles). During the 1970s, The Liver Birds was the name of a popular British sitcom dealing with two young women in Liverpool, a play on the British slang term \\"bird\\" meaning a young woman. The crest of Sir Paul McCartney is a calling liver bird holding a guitar, in reference to his profession and native city. Trademark In November 2008, Liverpool Football Club filed an application with the UK Intellectual Property Office to register the version of the liver bird shown on the club badge as its trademark. The deputy council leader, Flo Clucas, responded that \\"The Liver bird belongs to all the people of Liverpool and not one company or organisation.\\" Liverpool FC finally acquired a registration covering a trademark incorporating a liver bird in September 2010, after coming to an agreement with the city council. Liverpool FC obtained a trademark registration from the European trademark office and the council obtained its own registration from the UK IPO covering a trademark incorporating a liver bird. This was done to protect its use by companies in Liverpool, but also for the football club to protect itself against counterfeit products.

Early life, education and military service  Smathers was born in Atlantic City, New Jersey, the son of Lura Frances (Jones) and Benjamin Franklin Smathers. The Smathers Family moved to New Jersey from western North Carolina. Frank Smathers served as a state judge in New Jersey and his brother, William H. Smathers, represented New Jersey in the United States Senate. Frank Smathers moved his family to Miami, Florida, when George Smathers was six. Smathers attended Miami High School before earning his bachelor‚Äôs and law degree at the University of Florida. At Florida, Smathers was captain of the basketball team, a member of the track team, a member of the theatre group, and captain of the debate team. He joined the Sigma Alpha Epsilon social fraternity and was tapped for Florida Blue Key, a campus leadership and service organization.

Political career Smathers with John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, and other congressional freshmen in 1947 After the war, Smathers was elected to serve two terms in the United States House of Representatives, representing Florida's Fourth Congressional District from 1947 to 1951. He established a reputation for being a moderate except for his anti-communism.  House of Representatives  In 1946, Smathers defeated four-term incumbent Congressman Pat Cannon by a margin of over two-to-one. Smathers served two terms in the United States House of Representatives, representing Florida‚Äôs Fourth Congressional District from 1947 to 1951. He established a reputation as a southern liberal and a rising Democratic leader. He was best known for his strong support for President Truman and the Truman Doctrine to contain Soviet and Communist aggression. He fought to make Miami a gateway to Latin American commerce and cultural exchange. Congressman Smathers sponsored legislation to create the Florida Everglades National Park and supported the 24th Constitutional Amendment outlawing the poll tax in federal elections.Crispell, pp. 13-37. 1950 Senate Democratic Primary Congressman Smathers' district included the \\"Winter White House\\" of President Harry Truman in Key West, Florida. Smathers was invited by Truman to fly with him from Washington to Key West, establishing a key relationship with President Truman and members of his Cabinet.Clark, James C., Red Pepper and Gorgeous George: Claude Pepper's Epic Defeat in the 1950 Democratic Primary, University Press of Florida (2011), p. 65. In 1949, President Truman called Smathers into a meeting at the White House and said, \\"I want you to do me a favor. I want you to beat that son-of-a-bitch Claude Pepper.\\"Fund, John, Political Journal \\"George Smathers, RIP\\", January 24, 2007. Crispell, Brian Lewis, Testing the Limits: George Armistead Smathers and Cold War America, University of Georgia Press, pp. 46-47, Clark, p. 108. Senator Pepper had been a strong critic of President Truman and the Truman Doctrine and had taken a prominent and visible role in the unsuccessful effort to \\"dump Truman\\" in the weeks leading up to the 1948 Democratic Party Convention.Clark., pp. 80-95. Senator Pepper was a strong supporter of Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal and recognized as a leading southern liberal. As one of the most effective orators of his era, Pepper was considered unbeatable by most Florida observers. In attempting to become a national figure, though, Senator Pepper promoted an internationalist platform of post-war, peaceful cooperation with the Soviet Union. In his praise for Joseph Stalin, the Red Army, and the Soviet Union, Pepper developed one the most vulnerable records in Congress. Those positions, as well as his advocacy for sharing nuclear weapons technology with the Soviets, lost him the support of Florida's and the nation's press.Clark, pp. 41-47 Smathers' campaign attacked Pepper on his vulnerable international record, his support for universal health care and his changing stands on the Federal Employment Practices Commission. He charged that Pepper was out-of-touch with his Florida constituency and his positions contrary to national interests. Smathers defeated Pepper in the Democratic primary by over 63,000 votes and won handily in the November general election.Clark, pp.110-135.

Historians also contrasted the two candidates' campaign styles as a factor in the outcome. Finally, Smathers was the first candidate from south Florida to be popularly elected as United States Senator breaking the political monopoly of north and central Florida on the highest statewide offices. His victory marked the emergence of southeast Florida's significant economic and political power.Crispell, Testing the Limits. Clark, Red Pepper and Gorgeous George For the first time in Florida history an incumbent United States Senator went down to defeat. Pepper's loss also broke the Florida tradition dating to 1845 of always electing one United States Senator from north Florida. Stand on civil rights The Civil Rights movement dominated southern politics during Smathers‚Äô time in Congress. Smathers publicly opposed federal intervention in racial matters except to support voting rights. He also stressed the rule of law and the need for southern states to comply with any federal legislation. Privately, Smathers rejected many of the doctrines and tenets of white supremacy and believed that, over time, whites would change their views on race relations. Smathers, though, fell into line with other southern senators by signing the 1956 Southern Manifesto, an attack on the Supreme Court‚Äôs 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision. The signatories accused the Supreme Court of a \\"clear abuse of judicial power\\" and promised to use \\"all lawful means to bring about a reversal of this decision which is contrary to the Constitution and to prevent the use of force in its implementation.\\" As Johnson‚Äôs lieutenant in the Senate, he helped craft the Senate version of the Civil Rights Act of 1957. He publicly predicted the defeat of the southern filibuster of the bill and voted for its passage in the Senate. The bill was then referred to a conference committee and Smathers voted against the final version. After the chaos surrounding James Meredith‚Äôs entry into the University of Mississippi in 1962, Smathers wrote ‚ÄúFederal law must be obeyed ‚Ä¶ so that force does not have to be used to bring compliance.‚Äù Smather‚Äôs contradictory positions on racial matters as a private individual and a Florida senator responsive to his conservative state were never more evident than after Johnson became president. Smathers urged Johnson to act quickly to pass national civil rights legislation, stating ‚Äú‚Ä¶Now that you‚Äôre the President, I should think they would agree that the sooner we get a civil rights bill over with ‚Ä¶ the better the South would be, the better the North would be, the better everybody would be.‚Äù Smathers privately strategized with Johnson on the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act telling Johnson, ‚ÄúI hope that he (Mansfield) has done his counting and that he has the votes.‚ÄùLBJ Presidential Library, Volume Seven, June 1, 1964 ‚Äì June 22, 1964, p. 13. Yet, as a Florida senator, when the bill came before the Senate, he voted against it. Likewise, Smathers supported federal involvement in upholding voting rights, believing that through the ballot African Americans would gain a seat at the table at all levels of local, state and federal government. In his words, ‚Äúfranchise and freedom are inseparable in America.‚Äù However, while publicly praising the objectives of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, he opposed the Senate version of the bill. Nonetheless, he supported the final, amended voting rights measures, which enforced the voting rights provisions of the 14th and 15th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, while outlawing all literacy tests.  Senate Leadership  Smathers‚Äô legislative abilities quickly attracted the attention of Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson who brought Smathers into his inner circle as Secretary of the Senate Caucus, the third most powerful position in the party caucus. When Johnson suffered a heart attack in 1956, Smathers became acting Senate Majority leader during Johnson‚Äôs hospitalization. Smathers rejected Johnson‚Äôs request to later become Whip and recommended Mike Mansfield, instead. Smathers‚Äô refusal to become Johnson‚Äôs Whip precluded Smathers from becoming Majority Leader when Johnson became Vice President in 1961. Smathers retained his position and influence as Secretary of the Democratic Caucus under Majority Leader Mike Mansfield in the sixties. No other Floridian has ever risen as high in either the Democratic or Republican Senate Caucuses. Smathers also served as chairman of the important Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee for six years. Smathers helped pass bills to create Medicare and Medicaid, the Clean Air Act, sponsored the creation of the Small Business Administration and the Senate Select Committee on Aging, and was the Senate sponsor of the Kerr-Smathers Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). He steered critical reforms of the Transportation and Immigration acts and legislation moving federal holidays to Mondays, essentially creating the modern three-day weekend.Crispell, 84-87, 128-133, 149-150, 178; PBS, Documentary.  ‚ÄúSenator From Latin America‚Äù  Senator Smathers was an early and longstanding advocate for aid to the countries of Latin America. Smathers continually urged vital improvements in sanitation and infrastructure as well as increased trade and economic aid to modernize Latin American economies. Smathers recommended a joint OAS (Organization of American States) military force that would replace individual national armies to maintain the peace and fight communism. For his leadership on Latin America, his Senate colleagues dubbed Smathers ‚ÄúThe Senator From Latin America.‚ÄùCrispell, 102-112, 149, 161, 174. PBS, Documentary. = Cuban Revolution = Smathers had a chance encounter with Fidel Castro in April 1948. Smathers was attending the Pan-American Conference in Bogota, Colombia, and Castro was participating in the opposition Pan-American Students Conference. Smathers would later claim that Castro admitted to Communist leanings at their encounter. As such, Smathers became an early opponent against Fidel Castro and an early advocate of an economic and arms embargo of Cuba. Smathers described the Bay of Pigs fiasco as ‚Äúan ill-conceived, ill- planned deal‚Äù that lacked the planning and firepower to succeed He was the only congressman with Kennedy the night the President announced the U.S. Naval embargo of Cuba during the Missile Crisis of October 1962 ‚Äì the historic moment when the global superpowers came closest to nuclear war. Senator Smathers amended the Immigration Act to provide permanent visas for Cubans fleeing Communist Cuba, as well as efforts to provide federal assistance in food, education, housing and work for Cuban refugees. He worked closely with the Catholic Welfare Bureau and State Department officials to support Operation Pedro Pan which brought over 14,000 Cuban children to America.Crispell, 151-178; PBS, Documentary.

President Kennedy lauded Smathers for being ‚Äúone of the first Americans to recognize the importance of Latin America‚Äù.Crispell, 102-112, 174-176.  Relationship with JFK  Both Smathers and Kennedy entered Congress the same year. They became fast friends which lasted until Kennedy‚Äôs assassination. At the wedding of Kennedy and Jacqueline Bouvier, Smathers was chosen by the Kennedys to speak on behalf of Jack Kennedy at his wedding rehearsal dinner. In 1960, Jack Kennedy asked Smathers to give him a nominating speech to the Democratic Convention and asked Smathers to manage the Kennedy-Johnson campaign in the South.Associated Press, \\"George A.

Presidential Politics:  In 1960, to keep the Florida Democratic Party united, Smathers agreed to run as a ‚ÄúFavorite Son‚Äù. Winning the Democratic Presidential Primary, Smathers became the first Floridian popularly elected to represent Florida as a presidential candidate at a national convention. In 1968, Floridians again nominated Smathers as their Favorite Son candidate for President.Crispell, 147, 191.  Retirement from politics  After leaving the Senate in 1969, Smathers was divorced from his first wife and married Carolyn Hyder. He achieved considerable success as a lobbyist and businessman. Smathers lived in Indian Creek Island and was father to two sons, John (born 1941) and Bruce Smathers (born 1943) (Florida State Senate 1973-75 and Secretary of State 1975‚Äì78) from his marriage to Rosemary Townley. In 1988 Smathers donated property appraised at $2 million dollars to renovate the University of Florida‚Äôs original library building, now Smathers Library. He also made a testamentary gift, valued at the time at $20 million, to the University of Florida and the university honored him by naming the George A. Smathers Libraries. He also donated property valued at $10 million to the University of Miami.Crispell, 194; PBS, Documentary.

It is within the civil parish of Olrig, where it is the main settlement, and within the historic county of Caithness. The A836 links the village with Thurso and Tongue in the west and with John o' Groats in the east. The B876-A99 links the village with Wick in the southeast. Contrary to the common misconception, the name Castletown is a misnomer as there is no castle within the village limits. Olrig Parish Church, Castletown Much of the village is built on the old townland (or fermland) of Stanergill. The Stanergill Burn was the eastern boundary of the townland. It flows now through the eastern end of the village and so into Dunnet Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. The name Stanergill can be read as meaning Stone Valley and much of Castletown was built during the 19th century boom years of Caithness as a source of flagstone. Much of the stone was processed in the harbour area of the village, known as Castlehill, and many of the streets of London, Sydney, Edinburgh and the financial district of New York City are paved with it. The harbour was built by James Bremner. Castletown's main building is the 'Drill Hall'. This is mainly used for parties, discos and small clubs such as the indoor bowls. The building that was used for these functions was the 'Traill Hall', a gift to the Village by the Traill family, owners of the flagstone quarry at Castlehill. Traill House, a large and imposing country home was the residence of the Traill family. It was located in the woods at Castlehill, in later years it was owned by the Crumb-Ewing family, it became derelict after WW2 and burned down in the late 1950s. The remains of the gatehouse can be seen on the side of the A836 at Castlehill plantation. Industry in the village included manufacture of domestic food storage freezers, under the Norfrost brand. However, the company closed in 2013; Ebac in County Durham now produce the freezers.  Local government  Castletown is in the Landward Caithness ward of the Highland Council. The ward elects four councillors by the single transferable vote system of election, which produces a form of proportional representation. It is one of seven wards within the council's Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross corporate management area and one of 22 wards within the council area.  Sport  Castletown has a football team, Castletown FC, who wear a strip almost identical to the strip worn by Celtic FC. The pitch is regarded as the best in Caithness and Sutherland, and many Highland finals are held at the venue. Castletown play in the Caithness Division 2 following relegation from Division 1 in the 2014 season. Castletown also have bowls and badminton teams who play in the local 'Drill Hall'.  Facilities  The harbour in the Castlehill area Castletown has a small hotel (The Castletown Hotel, was The St Clair Hotel), a large bed and breakfast on a large property (Olrig House Country B&B;), a large guest house (Greenland House), a licensed grocery, a butcher's, a fish and chip shop, a garden centre, a garage, hairdressers, a primary school with nursery and an after- school club, a drill hall, a youth club and an army cadets detachment hut. There are also two churches on Main Street: a Church of Scotland and Free Church of Scotland, where Reverend Howard Stone has led services for more than 25 years. Most businesses are located on the main street, the A836.

Life He was born 17 April 1797 in Marnoch, Banffshire (now in Aberdeenshire), the son of William Ogilvie, farmer, and Ann Leslie, daughter of a farmer in a neighbouring parish. After receiving some elementary education at home, and attending the parish school for two quarters, Ogilvie worked as a ploughman till he was twenty-one. In 1818, after an accident, one of his legs had to be amputated above the knee. Afterwards Ogilvie taught successively in two subscription schools, in the parishes of Fordyce and Gamrie, both in Banffshire. With the help of a local schoolmaster, he prepared for university, and in October 1824 he entered Marischal College, Aberdeen. Adding to his income by private tuition, he graduated M.A. on 14 April 1828. He remained in Aberdeen as a tutor till 13 May 1831, when he was appointed mathematical master in Gordon's Hospital, an educational establishment in the city. Marischal College conferred on him the honorary degree of LL.D. on 15 January 1848. He retained his mastership till July 1859. Ogilvie died of typhoid fever at Aberdeen on 21 November 1867. Works To the Aberdeen Magazine 1831‚Äì2, Ogilvie contributed, under the signature ‚ÄòIota,‚Äô ten ‚ÄòImitations of Horace‚Äô in Scottish dialect. In 1836 he worked for Blackie & Son's annotated edition of Thomas Stackhouse's History of the Bible. Messrs. Blackie engaged him in 1838 to revise and enlarge Webster's; he compiled the Imperial Dictionary (published 1847-1850) using Noah Webster's American Dictionary as its basis, expanding it greatly. The result appeared as the Imperial Dictionary, English, Technical, and Scientific, issued in parts from 1847 onwards, and published complete in 1850, and supplement 1855. In 1863 Ogilvie issued an abridgment of the ‚ÄòDictionary,‚Äô under the title ‚ÄòComprehensive English Dictionary, Explanatory, Pronouncing, and Etymological,‚Äô the pronunciation being supervised by Richard Cull. In 1865 appeared the ‚ÄòStudents' English Dictionary, Etymological, Pronouncing, and Explanatory,‚Äô in which etymology and definitions received special attention. A feature of all three dictionaries was their engravings, the ‚ÄòImperial‚Äô claiming to be the first after Nathaniel Bailey's to use pictorial illustrations. Ogilvie's last work was a condensation of the ‚ÄòStudents' Dictionary,‚Äô entitled ‚ÄòEnglish Dictionary, Etymological, Pronouncing, and Explanatory, for the use of Schools,‚Äô 1867. At his death he was revising the ‚ÄòImperial Dictionary,‚Äô which was reissued in 1882‚Äì3, under the editorship of Charles Annandale. Family On 15 November 1842 Ogilvie married Susan Smart, daughter of a farmer near Stonehaven, Kincardineshire. She predeceased him on 20 May 1853, leaving two daughters and a son.

Formation The following is a January 9, 1951 telex to the Bah√° º√≠ world from Shoghi Effendi announcing the Council: :Proclaim National Assemblies of East and West weighty epoch-making decision of formation of first International Bah√° º√≠ Council, forerunner of supreme administrative institution destined to emerge in fullness of time within precincts beneath shadow of World Spiritual Center of Faith already established in twin cities of 'Akk√° and Haifa.... In this telex Shoghi Effendi described the significance of the International Bah√° º√≠ Council: :...Hail with thankful, joyous heart at long last the constitution of International Council which history will acclaim as the greatest event shedding luster upon second epoch of Formative Age of Bah√° º√≠ Dispensation potentially unsurpassed by any enterprise undertaken since inception of Administrative Order of Faith on morrow of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s Ascension, ranking second only to glorious immortal events associated with Ministries of the Three Central Figures of Faith in course of First Age of most glorious Dispensation of the five thousand century Bah√° º√≠ Cycle. Shoghi Effendi also laid out several steps for the IBC's evolvement into the Universal House of Justice: :To these will be added further functions in course of evolution of this first embryonic International Institution, marking its development into officially recognized Bah√° º√≠ Court, its transformation into duly elected body, its efflorescence into Universal House of Justice, and its final fruition through erection of manifold auxiliary institutions constituting the World Administrative Center destined to arise and function and remain permanently established in close neighborhood of Twin Holy Shrines. ::(Shoghi Effendi, Messages to the Bah√° º√≠ World ‚Äì 1950‚Äì1957, pp. 7,8) Evolvement=Appointed International Bah√° º√≠ Council  In March 1951 Shoghi Effendi began appointing the membership of the IBC . During its first year, eight men and women were appointed. In 1952 two members had left due to reasons of health. In 1955 Shoghi Effendi appointed a ninth member. The members of the International Bah√° º√≠ Council, the dates of their appointment, their offices on the IBC and those that were Hands of the Cause were: *R√∫h√≠yyih Khanum (1951‚Äì61) Liaison with Shoghi Effendi; Hand of the Cause of God *Charles Mason Remey (1951‚Äì61) President; Hand of the Cause *Amelia Collins (1951‚Äì61) Vice President; Hand of the Cause *Leroy Ioas (1952‚Äì61) Secretary General; Hand of the Cause *Jessie Revell (1951‚Äì61) Treasurer *Lu·π≠fu'll√°h ·∏§ak√≠m (1951‚Äì61) Eastern Assistant Secretary *Ethel Revell (1951‚Äì61) Western Assistant Secretary *Ugo Giachery (1952‚Äì61) Member- at-large; Hand of the Cause *Ben Weeden (1951‚Äì52) *Gladys Weeden (1951‚Äì52) *Sylvia Ioas (1955‚Äì61) Between 1951 and 1957 Shoghi Effendi directed the members and used the Council to create an image of an international body handling the Bah√° º√≠ affairs in Haifa. According to Shoghi Effendi, the Council's responsibilities were to: * establish links with the Israeli authorities, and * negotiate with them concerning an establishing of a Bah√° º√≠ court to deal with personal matters, * assist Shoghi Effendi to complete the superstructure of the Shrine of the B√°b * serve as an international Bah√° º√≠ secretariat. Bah√° º√≠ Court In Messages to the Bah√° º√≠ World ‚Äì 1950‚Äì1957, Shoghi Effendi described the Bah√° º√≠ Court as an ‚Äúessential prelude to the institution of the Universal House of Justice‚Äù (p. 13) and that the IBC ‚Äúmust pave the way for the formation of the Bah√° º√≠ Court.‚Äù (p. 149) It was also cited as one of Shoghi Effendi's goals for the Ten Year Crusade. The Court was to come about as a result of its recognition as a legal non-Jewish religious court inside of the state of Israel and was to be composed of the appointed members from the IBC.(p. 152) Despite his efforts, the Court had not yet come into existence at the time of Shoghi Effendi's death in 1957. From this point forward the IBC operated under the direction of the Custodial Hands of the Cause and they agreed to carry out Shoghi Effendi's plans for its evolvement.(Ministry of the Custodians, p. 37) In November 1959 the Hands announced to the Bah√° º√≠ world that the International Bah√° º√≠ Council would go from an appointed body to an elected body. They said: \\"We wish to assure the believers that every effort will be made to establish a Bah√° º√≠ Court in the Holy Land prior to the date set for this election. We should however bear in mind that the Guardian himself clearly indicated this goal, due to the strong trend towards the secularization of Religious Courts in this part of the world, might not be achieved.\\" (Ministry of the Custodians, p. 169) The IBC's recognition as a Bah√° º√≠ court was never achieved. In 1960 one of the members of the IBC, Charles Mason Remey, was declared as a Covenant-breaker by the Hands for claiming to be the Guardian and was expelled from the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. Duly Elected Body The election for the new International Bah√° º√≠ Council was scheduled for Ridvan 1961. The Hands of the Cause declared themselves ineligible for election and requested the Bah√° º√≠s not vote for them since the appointed institutions of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith were different in both nature and function from the elected administrative bodies. The election was concluded via postal ballot by all members of National Spiritual Assemblies and regional spiritual assemblies of 1960‚Äì61. All adult Bah√° º√≠s were eligible for election except for the Hands of the Cause. The members of the elected Council were: *Ali Nakhjavani (1961‚Äì63) President *Sylvia Ioas (1961‚Äì63) Vice President *Charles Wolcott (1961‚Äì63) Secretary General *Jessie Revell (1961‚Äì63) Treasurer *Ian Semple (1961‚Äì63) Assistant Secretary *Lu·π≠fu'll√°h ·∏§ak√≠m (1961‚Äì63) Eastern Assistant Secretary *Ethel Revell (1961‚Äì63) Western Assistant Secretary *Borrah Kavelin (1961‚Äì63) Member-at-large *Mildred Mottahedeh (1961‚Äì63) The elected IBC was under the direction and supervision of the Hands of the Cause of God. The Council's responsibilities included two of the original functions assigned by Shoghi Effendi: * to forge links with the Israeli authorities, and * to negotiate with them related to matters of personal status. In addition to these, the Hands instructed the Council to assist them with: * the care of the properties at the World Centre, * the establishment of the Universal House of Justice, * any other functions they assigned. Universal House of Justice The election of the Universal House of Justice took place on Ridvan 1963. With this election, the International Bah√° º√≠ Council ceased to exist although five male members of the Council were elected.

Hamilton Palace was a large country house located north-east of Hamilton in Lanarkshire, Scotland.Hamilton's royal past, South Lanarkshire Council The former seat of the Dukes of Hamilton, it was built in 1695 and subsequently much enlarged. Widely acknowledged as having been one of the grandest houses in Britain, the palace was demolished in 1921, owing to the prohibitive cost of upkeep and the subsidence caused by the nearby mine at Bothwellhaugh. The Palace Hamilton Palace, 1916. Built on the site of a 13th-century tower house, the south front of Hamilton Palace was erected in 1695 in the Palladian style, with a huge Corinthian pedimented frontispiece, by architect James Smith for William, 3rd Duke of Hamilton, and his wife Anne, Duchess of Hamilton. A new North Front had been planned by the fifth Duke in the 1730s, and extensive plans were prepared by William Adam. The external plans were never executed, but Adam did redesign several important staterooms, with stucco work by Clayton. However, the Duke's early death and the significant costs involved postponed further major work, although modifications and additions continued during the next century, including the purchase or exchange of land surrounding the palace, enabling extensive landscaping to take place. The tenth Duke, who succeeded in 1819, began a wave of total refurbishment, using the seemingly limitless wealth that the family derived from their ownership of the Lanarkshire coalfields. This refurbishment included heraldic carvings in the main pediment over the entrance, carved by John Greenshields in 1822.http://www.glasgowsculpture.com/pg_biography.php?sub=greenshields_j The north front itself was finally completed 1842 by architect David Hamilton using Adam's original plans as a structure. Carving was by the 16-year-old Patric Park.Dictionary of British Sculptors 1660-1881, Rupert Gunnis The north front was 265 feet (81 m) long and 60 feet (18 m) high, adorned with a Corinthian portico of monolithic columns 25 feet (7.6 m) high. The state rooms, which included extensive stucco-work, were by Smith and Adam. These held much fine furniture and by the mid-19th century housed one of the best private collections of paintings in Scotland, including works by Peter Paul Rubens (see below), Titian, Anthony van Dyck, and other masters - the largest portion coming from his wife Susan's inheritance of an existing huge collection from her father William Thomas Beckford. A sumptuous chimneypiece by William Morgan adorned the Dining Room's fireplace. According to Professor Tait in Burlington Magazine, July 1983, the Duke also sought alternative designs for the 1840s reconstruction by Charles Percier, Pierre Fran√ßois L√©onard Fontaine and Giacomo Quarenghi. Ch√¢telherault The Duke of Hamilton's 18th century hunting lodge Hamilton Palace stood at the centre of extensive parklands which, as the main axis, had a great north‚Äìsouth tree- lined avenue over three miles (5 km) in length. The layout was later developed, most notably by William Adam, who introduced Ch√¢telherault banqueting house/hunting lodge into the south avenue in the High Parks where it commanded a broad vista northwards across the Low Parks. Adam also added a very grand dog kennels at the same time to hold dogs for the hunts. Decline and demolition A Louis XIV armoire sold in 1882, and now in the Louvre The demise of Hamilton Palace was the result of various factors: large and ostentatious houses had fallen from fashion; the cost of upkeep was prohibitive; and nearby coal mines resulted in dangerous subsidence as the coal beneath was removed. The decline began in 1882 when William, the twelfth Duke, sold off art to raise funds. After the thirteenth Duke lent his home for use as a naval hospital during the First World War, the state of the palace was one of severe neglect necessitating vast sums for restoration. It was returned from hospital use in 1919, but by this time the Duke preferred the smaller and more homely Dungavel. At this time, the magazine Country Life featured a number of articles on the palace and a quantity of photographs were taken to accompany the series. As such they represent an invaluable record of the house before the massive sale of contents and fittings, and its demolition in 1921.Avray Tipping, H. (1919) \\"Hamilton Palace\\", Country Life The Rubens painting of \\"Daniel in the Lion's Den\\" is now in The National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C. The site today The site of the palace is now occupied by the Hamilton Palace Sports Grounds. Most of the palace grounds were incorporated into Strathclyde Country Park. When the park was being constructed in 1974, vaulted cellars were discovered which may have belonged to the original house. However, these were not excavated but instead infilled with rubble. Several metres of wrought iron railing from the palace grounds can be seen outside Hamilton College. There is a misconception that the railings were installed upside down but this is not actually the case. Some of the fittings, and photographs of the interior, can be viewed in the Low Parks Museum (the old Palace Coachhouse) in Hamilton. The dining room from Hamilton Palace is on view at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, in the European period rooms, where it remains the only extant, assembled room from the Palace. The sandstone bungalows on the south side of the A74, Carlisle Road, leaving Hamilton in the direction of Ferniegair and Larkhall are reputed to have been built from stone salvaged from the palace. The remains of the tree-lined avenue that linked the palace to Chatelherault hunting lodge can still be seen. These give the visitor a good indication, particularly from Chatelherault Country Park, of where the palace stood. A David Lloyd health club, municipal sports facilities and an Asda superstore now stand on the site of the original palace. Hamilton Mausoleum still stands and tours can be booked at the nearby Hamilton Museum. Tours are available on the first Sunday of each month between February and November. Some of the stonework was used to build other buildings throughout Scotland, such as the WW1 Memorial Kirk at Bangour Village Hospital https://www.westlothian.gov.uk/media/2592/Conservation-area-Bangour-Village- Hospital/pdf/BVH2014update.pdf ReferencesExternal links * Hamilton Palace: A Virtual Reconstruction - a website developed by the Virtual Hamilton Palace Trust, with maps, photographs, and virtual reconstructions of the palace. *Hamilton Palace entry from The DiCamillo Database of British & Irish Country Houses (archive of previous version from The DiCamillo Companion) *Hamilton Palace at Gazetteer for Scotland *The Rise and Fall of Hamilton Palace at National Museums Scotland Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1921 Category:Country houses in South Lanarkshire Category:Palaces in Scotland Category:Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Scotland Category:Scottish country houses destroyed in the 20th century Category:Hamilton, South Lanarkshire Category:History of South Lanarkshire ","title":"Hamilton Palace"},{"id":"1504190","text":"Brian Mills (25 October 1933 - 3 June 2006) was a British television director, mainly for Granada Television.

It began in 2004 and is held annually in July in the Monegros Desert, located in Aragon in north-eastern Spain. Nowhere, like any Burning Man event, differs drastically from a music festival. Participation is the key element of the event and every attendant is expected to be involved in some way. Every task ranging from setup over maintaining the gate and perimeter up to first aid are volunteer based. There is no hired workforce aside from transport and logistics. Further, there are no scheduled performers or stages. Participants pay everything they contribute out of their own pocket as there is a strict rule of non commerce. As an official regional event Nowhere embraces the Burning Man principles. In 2016 attendance was about 1000 people; and in 2017 was about 1000 or 1500 people. Similarities and differences to Burning Man Nowhere's size, cultural background and geographical location produces quite a different event from Burning Man. Given it is Europe's biggest burn event it attracts a very international crowd. Unlike Burning Man, Nowhere does not include fire as a key feature of the event. Due to the dry area, which is on wildfire alert during the summer, it is strictly forbidden to have any kind open fire, therefore no art is set on fire. Fire spinning is restricted to a controlled area with fire marshals on duty. The burning of an effigy happened only once in 2016 after coming to an agreement with the local authorities. Nowhere uses a Lighthouse as their effigy and a Compass as its logo. Layout Like Burning Man, Nowhere is created solely by the participants and driven by theme camps which are called Barrios. During the last incarnations Nowhere used a layout that reassembled a compass. This leads to an arrangement of the Barrios in a circle-like shape, in opposition to Burning Man's half round layout. Nowhere further divides the camps into four distinct sound zones reading from the blue zone which has a no sound policy to the red zone which hosts the dance camps. The same goes for the free camping areas. There is no open space or deep playa at Nowhere. Art Art is the core of any burn event and Nowhere do not differ from this. Despite this large, scale artworks in the dimension of Burning Man are rare at Nowhere. This is in part due to the strict non burning policy. The logistics of transport, setup, takedown and removal are more challenging to the participants because of this. Nowhere gives art grants for artists up to ‚Ç¨3000.Art Grant: Aims & Guidelines. Goingnowhere.org Artworks that are meant to be built on the playa require prior registration. Public infrastructure The event has a central shade structure known as Middle of Nowhere (MoN). It is a public space for relaxing, dancing, workshops and socializing. In comparison with Burning Man there is no coffee sold there and commerce is limited to ice only. Other public infrastructure includes: NoInfo which serves as the general point of information, La Cantina which offers volunteers a free meal and Werkhaus, which sets up and keeps the public infrastructure intact. Long drops Until 2017 Nowhere provided a special setup to avoid or limit the use of chemical toilets called Long Drops.General Info on the Long Drops from 2015. Goingnowhere.org These were deep drilled holes which were covered by an open air toilet seat. Participants covered their faeces in the hole with some loose soil after using the long drops. These units were serviced by volunteers. As the event has grown the use of the long drops declined. Nowhere has since experimented with other alternative ways of human waste management. The volunteers have taken over the servicing of the chemical toilets and provide a very clean toilet setup compared to most other events. Landscape The landscape in the region of Monegros near Zaragoza is very dry and has a desert-like feel. Some canyons around Nowhere resemble the desert in Nevada. There is a lot of agriculture nearby, but it depends heavily on a well-developed irrigation system with water from the Pyrenees. History Nowhere in 2009 The roots of Nowhere date back to 2002 when UK burners started to organize a decompression party in London. Nowhere began in 2004, in Bardenas Reales, and has roughly doubled in size each year, to the current size of around 4000 participants in 2018. Nowhere has been held in several different locations in the Navarra and Aragon regions of Spain. The current location is near Sari√±ena in the Province of Huesca. Principles Nowhere is built on the following key principles, inspired by Burning Man, however they have been adapted and re-edited in an inverted order: # Self- expression - The freedom to be yourself: Be the person you are. Be the person you want to be. We respect and value you, and expect the same from you. You have the freedom to be yourself. Become who you are. # Self-reliance - You are responsible for you, mentally and physically: From food and water to a hug or quiet, you need to take care of yourself in Nowhere‚Äôs challenging environment. Give yourself what you need ‚Äì and ask others for help when you need it. # No commerce - Forget about money ‚Äì there‚Äôs nothing to buy: By removing commerce from our community, we create co-operation and participation. We plan ahead and work together. We live without money to remind us of what‚Äôs really important. # Leave no trace - From dust to dust, we leave only footprints: We care for the environment, and we take care of our home. We clean up after ourselves; we leave nothing behind; we leave no trace we were there. From dust to dust, we leave only footprints. # Participation Get involved ‚Äì Nowhere is what we make it: The more you do, the more you get back. When you join others in play and in work, you are part of Nowhere. Your contribution is more valuable than you realise. # Inclusion - Everyone is welcome to be a Nobody: We welcome everyone for their unique contribution to our community. Include others as you want to be included, with respect, consideration and tolerance. # Gifting - We give our time, effort and gifts freely: We give to help others and because it makes us feel good. From a cold beer to digging out a tent pole to a small badge, our gifts are from our heart. # Co-operation - Together we are stronger: From how we work together to how we communicate, co-operation is at Nowhere‚Äôs core. If we can make life easier, we will. If we can make life better, we will. Together we are stronger. # Community - A family of individuals, we look after each other. A diverse group of separate self- reliant beings, we are united in our need to be part of something larger than ourselves. Community, others, self ‚Äì united by tolerance and joy. # Immediacy - Make now count: Be now here, be nowhere. Make now count. All this will soon be gone, so enjoy now. Experience, participate, be. This is all there is, so enjoy it!\\" Barrios A Barrio is a group of people who camp together, have a common infrastructure (kitchen, shade structure etc.) and typically provide a certain service or attraction for the other participants. Barrios have to register with the event and get a placement regarding their size and sound zone preferences. Barrios are a vital part of Nowhere and in 2018 the event hosted about 50 Barrios ranging from large sound camps to meditation camps. There are special Barrios like Werkhaus, which houses core event volunteers. They range widely in size from less than ten to over one hundred members. Due to the international nature of the event, Barrios can take on a national character, with a majority of members from a certain country. Other Barrios are very international in their demography. Some Barrios have a history of 10 or more years of contributing to the event. Each year, Norg‚ÄîNowhere board of organizers‚Äîawards the Prize of \\"Best Barrio of the Playa\\", based on various criteria as general look, respect of the principles, animations, communication with the other Barrios and installations provided. In 2017 and 2018, Ran'Dome, a Belgian-French camp with food, drinks and loud sound as main themes (as well as a certain fetishism around randomness and dices), received the prize.  Freecampers  Aside from the Barrios there are many zones for independent campers that are not affiliated with a Barrio, called free camps. Most participants stay there. They are often called Freecampers. Some Freecampers build their own shade structures and artworks in these zones. Others organize public spaces within the free camping areas. One of the most famous is Middle of Frickin Freecamp (MOFF). MOFF offers the possibility to hold gatherings and workshops and has become a staple at Nowhere.

He was said to be the son of a Spanish father and Apache mother. Chavez y Chavez became an outlaw at a relatively young age when he joined the Lincoln County Regulators. Biography=Lincoln County Wars Chavez y Chavez joined the Regulators in his twenties, having already committed a number of small robberies and other crimes, and would prove useful to Billy the Kid's gang. Together with Billy The Kid, Doc Scurlock, Charlie Bowdre and the rest of the Regulators, Chavez y Chavez engaged in the Lincoln County War that lasted from 1878 to 1879. Chavez y Chavez met Billy the Kid, Jim French, Fred Waite, Charlie Bowdre, John Middleton, and Tom O'Folliard after he decided to join the Tunstall-McSween group in their war against the Dolan group. Inside the Tunstall-McSween group, another group was formed, to try to give the Tunstall- McSween group an edge over the Dolans. The \\"Regulators\\", as they were known, were 45 gunfighters that included Jose Chavez y Chavez. At some point of his tenure as a member of the Regulators, he became good friends with Billy the Kid and Jim French. On February 18, 1878, John Tunstall was murdered. On April 1 of the same year, Lincoln sheriff Brady, a Dolan backer, was killed by Billy the Kid's gang, and Chavez y Chavez credited himself with this killing. Eventually, more killings from both sides followed, leading to the burning of the McSween home on July 19, 1878. Fourteen people lived at the house, including McSween and his wife, as well as twelve cowboys. Six people died in the fire, but every member of Billy the Kid's gang was able to escape. Post-war By March 1879, New Mexico Governor Lew Wallace began a fight against crime in that territory , and one of his priorities was to stop the ongoing war between the Dolans and the Tunstall-McSween backers. With this in mind, Wallace formed the Lincoln County Mounted Rifles, a group of which Chavez y Chavez became a member, as a private. The \\"Mounted Rifles\\" failed in their purpose, however, and the group lasted only about three months, a period during which Chavez y Chavez remained with Billy the Kid's gang. Chavez y Chavez allegedly testified, alongside Billy the Kid, in court to try to implicate the Army in connection to the burning of the McSween house and subsequent deaths that occurred during the fires. It is believed that in 1880, Chavez y Chavez murdered a dangerous convict in a New Mexico jail. Jose Chavez y Chavez became adrift after Billy the Kid's death in 1881, traveling across the American Southwest, sometimes without any particular destination in mind. He did arrive at Las Vegas, New Mexico, in time to meet Bob Ford, the killer of Jesse James. According to legend the two had agreed to a shooting game between them. So impressed was Ford with Chavez y Chavez' gun abilities, that he fled immediately after he was asked to have a duel against Chavez y Chavez. Chavez y Chavez eventually became a deputy sheriff, but he allegedly was not able to leave his life as a desperado, becoming friends with Vicente Silva and joining Silva's two gangs, including Las Gorras Blancas (\\"The White Caps\\"), a group that was considered by many Anglos to be a bandit group, and by most Native New Mexican Hispanos to be freedom fighters. Silvas' other group, the \\"Bandits Society,\\" was accused by Anglo immigrants to New Mexico Territory as operating much like a mafia, trying to make profits by forcing people out of their properties. 1890s Vicente Silva ordered the killing of Patricio Maes, which was carried out on October 22, 1892 by Chavez y Chavez, Eugenio Alarid and Julian Trujillo. In February 1893, the group killed Silva's brother in law, Gabriel Sandoval. However, Sandoval's death backfired on Silva, when his wife became concerned about the whereabouts of her brother. When Silva ordered Chavez y Chavez, Alarid and Trujillo to kill his wife, the three gunmen became worried about Silva's mental state; they decided to kill him as well when they were digging Silva's wife's grave. Silva and his wife were both murdered by Chavez y Chavez, Alarid and Trujillo as Silva carried his wife to them. In 1894, several men were arrested and brought to the courts of law in connection with the killing of Patricio Maes. Chavez y Chavez became a fugitive, but he was eventually arrested on May 26. A jury found him guilty, and he was given the death sentence. In a retrial, Chavez y Chavez was again given a death sentence. This decision was later overturned by a new Governor in New Mexico, who felt compelled to commute Chavez y Chavez's sentence to life in prison instead, given the publicity that this case garnered and the public's pressure towards the Government to spare Chavez y Chavez' life at the time. 20th century During a jail riot, Chavez y Chavez helped the police. Subsequently, on January 11, 1909, New Mexico's Governor George Curry granted him a pardon. For the remaining fifteen years of his life, Chavez y Chavez led a relatively quiet life, and he died of natural causes at his home in 1924, with a friend by his side. His resting place is at a small cemetery in Milagro, Guadalupe County, New Mexico. Popular culture *In the 1988 movie, Young Guns, and its 1990 sequel, Young Guns II, Chavez y Chavez was portrayed by Lou Diamond Phillips. In the sequel, and contrary to actual history, Chavez y Chavez is portrayed as mixed Mexican/Navajo. His last scene in the movie leads the viewer to believe that he dies as a result of a gunshot wound from an encounter with Pat Garrett and his hunting party. *Chavez y Chavez is also the name of a character in the video game GUN.

The present house was built in 1702 on the site of an earlier castle. The medieval castle and the collegiate church Dalkeith Castle was located to the north east of Dalkeith, and was originally in the hands of the Clan Graham in the 12th century and given to the Clan Douglas in the early 14th century. James Douglas of Dalkeith became the Earl of Morton in the mid 15th century. The castle was strategically located in an easily defensible position above a bend in the River North Esk. Nearer the centre of Dalkeith, James Douglas, 1st Lord Dalkeith, endowed the collegiate church in 1406, where Douglas earls, lords, and knights were buried. Margaret Tudor, the bride of King James IV of Scots, stayed here as the guest of the Earl of Morton before her formal entry to Edinburgh in 1503.Leland, John, De Rebus Britannicis Collectanea, .., ed., Hearne, Thomas, vol. 4, (1770), pp. 258-300. In 1543, David, Cardinal Beaton, the Archbishop of St Andrews, was imprisoned in Dalkeith Castle. The castle was captured during the war of the Rough Wooing by the English soldiers James Wilford and Thomas Wyndham on 3 June 1548.Calendar of State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), p. 115. From June 1574, Regent Morton, who had been captured at the siege of 1548, extended the castle and palace.Calendar of State Papers Scotland, vol.4 (1905), p.680, (building work noted June 1574) Sir John Forster, an English border warden captured by Sir John Carmichael was held in the Palace in July 1575.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1907), p. 167-173. When James VI of Scotland reached his majority in October 1579, following celebrations in Edinburgh, Morton entertained the young King at Dalkeith Palace.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol.5 (1907), p.358 no.434. James VI and Anne of Denmark frequently stayed at the castle. While they were in residence in August 1592, a prisoner John Wemyss of Logie escaped through their bedchamber, helped by the queen's servant, Margaret Winstar.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 752-5: Calendar of Border Papers, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1894), p. 405. In 1598 the royal master of work William Schaw prepared a nursery and Princess Margaret was born in the Palace on Christmas Eve.Calendar of State Papers Scotland, vol. 13 (Edinburgh, 1969), p. 362: Letters to King James the Sixth from the Queen, Prince Henry, Prince Charles etc (Edinburgh, 1835), p. lxxii-lxxiii. In August 1601 the infant Prince Charles was seriously ill while staying at the palace, but recovered.Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1597-1603, vol. 13 (Edinburgh, 1969), pp. 865-6. Some repairs to the building were carried out in 1599 by Michael Schaw, cousin of William Schaw, and chamberlain of the Earl of Morton in Dalkeith, who had the brewhouse, gates, and drawbridge repaired, and bought food for a Douglas family wedding.Margaret H. B. Sanderson, Mary Stewart's People (Edinburgh, 1987), p. 69-70. James VI visited the palace on 11 June 1617.John Nichols, Progresses, Processions, and Magnificent Festivities of King James the First, vol. 3 (London, 1828), p. 336. The building is called a palace in part because Dalkeith Castle was the 'caput', the 'head' or place where the courts of the Regality of Dalkeith were held.charter of novodamus of the Regality, 20/6/1589, Register of the Great Seal, RMS, vol.5, no.1674 According to the heraldic writer Alexander Nisbet, the caput of a regality was technically termed a 'palatium', as a seat of royal authority.Nisbet, Alexander, System of Heraldry, vol.2 (repr. 1984), Part IV, p. 46 Its appearance was recorded in an engraving c.1690 by John Slezer. The Dukes of Buccleuch and the 1702 house In 1642, Dalkeith Castle was sold by the Douglas family to Francis Scott, 2nd Earl of Buccleuch.Thomas Campbell,Dictionary of British Sculptors 1660-1881, Gunnis located at the base of the Great Staircase in Dalkeith Palace. The 2nd Earl of Buccleuch's daughter married the Duke of Monmouth, eldest illegitimate son of King Charles II. They became the Duke and Duchess of Monmouth & Buccleuch. After the Duke of Monmouth had been executed for treason, Anne Scott, his widow, who held the Scottish title in her own right, asked architect James Smith to use William of Orange's Palace of Het Loo in the Netherlands as a model for the new Dalkeith Palace. Smith and his cousins, Gilbert and James, signed the contract for mason work at Dalkeith Castle in March 1702. Construction of Dalkeith Palace began later that year, Smith deciding to incorporate a portion of the tower house of the old castle into the western side of the new structure. The outline of the old tower walls is still visible in the western facade of the palace today. Original 1743 builder's stamp in the lead roof of Dalkeith Palace, Spring 2004. In 1704, William Walker and Benjamin Robinson, the chamberlain of the Duchess, went to London with a small party to choose items of furniture for the palace. Construction was proceeding at a steady pace, and the main portion of the palace was roofed by the end of 1705. The London marble-cutter Richard Neale spent sixty-four weeks at the palace with nine assistants between 1709 and 1711, carving the main stairwell and screen of the Great Staircase. Several marble chimney pieces were installed, as well as an intricately carved marble bas-relief of Neptune and Galatea. This internally extensive use of marble was very much the taste of the Duchess. The majority of construction was complete by 1711.The south front of Dalkeith Palace in 2011, showing pilasters and pediment. Finishing touches on the Palace complex included adding a wrought iron screen with freestone piers (no longer existing) around the forecourt, a great deal of planting, and the laying out of a great avenue through the park. Dalkeith Park itself was a large area of manicured trees and gardens which in later years would include the Montagu Bridge over the North Esk River and the Dalkeith Conservatory and a grassed amphitheatre. When the final calculations were made, it was determined that the construction of Dalkeith Palace had cost the Duchess a total of Stg¬£17,727. The plumber John Scott of Edinburgh re-plated the roof in lead in 1743. Some minor additions were carried out in the following years. John Adam resurfaced the building in 1762 and James Playfair inserted a low window into the east facade in 1786. Overall, the Palace is built of sandstone and has the main entrance on the south front, flanked on each side by two Corinthian order pilasters. These are surmounted by a bracketed pediment unusual for its depth. The layout of Dalkeith Palace was unusual for the time in that the state apartment was located on the ground floor, which prevented the Great Dining Room from being placed in its customary position at the start of the state apartment. As such, the Great Dining Room was placed on the first floor, still suitable for important occasions and also serving as an anteroom to another apartment on the first floor. Subsequent history World War II-era graffiti on the third floor wallpaper of Dalkeith Palace, Spring 2004. The 5th Duke of Buccleuch considered extensive rebuilding in 1831 and William Burn produced unexecuted designs in Jacobean style. More minor alterations were carried out, together with improvements to the surrounding estate including a new house and offices for the Duke's Chamberlain, and the construction, for the 5th Duke, of St Mary's Church as a private chapel by William Burn and David Bryce. The church contains one of only two water-powered organs in Scotland. Dalkeith Palace in 1880 Several well-known figures from English and Scottish history have been guests at the Palace in the intervening centuries. Bonnie Prince Charlie stayed two nights at Dalkeith in 1745, King George IV slept here during his visit to Edinburgh in 1822, in preference to Holyroodhouse Palace which was in a poor state, as did Queen Victoria in 1842. During World War II, Polish troops of the 3rd Flanders Rifle Brigade, part of the 1st Polish Armoured Division, were quartered on the third floor of Dalkeith Palace from 1942 onwards. Graffiti drawn by these troops is still visible on the third floor wallpaper of the Palace as of 2008. Dalkeith Palace in 2008 Dalkeith Palace has not been lived in by the Buccleuch family since 1914. In the 1970s and early 1980s, Dalkeith Palace was used as a research and development office by the computer firm International Computers Ltd. (ICL), which leased the Palace until 1983. Since 1985 it has been leased to the University of Wisconsin system for a study abroad programme. Approximately 60-80 students a semester live in the palace, where they also take classes from UK and US faculty members.

Biography Solomon Cutner was born in the East End of London in 1902. He was a child prodigy whose talent was recognised at the age of seven when, having had no formal tuition, he performed his own arrangement of the 1812 Overture on the family piano. He gave his first concerts in 1912 at the age of ten, retired from public performance in his teens and then resumed his career as an adult performer.The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians (2001) He began making records in 1929. As a child he was sent to live with his teacher, Mathilde Verne, who had studied with Clara Schumann. He then studied in Paris with Lazare-L√©vy. After establishing a reputation, he toured abroad a good deal, particularly before, during and shortly after World War II, when he gave numerous much-cherished recitals in the United States and Australia. He premiered the Piano Concerto in B-flat by Arthur Bliss at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Renowned especially for his Beethoven, which had an almost legendary status (he broadcast the entire cycle of the 32 piano sonatas for the BBC), he was in the midst of recording the complete cycle of the sonatas for EMI Records when he suffered a devastating stroke in 1956, which paralysed his right arm. He never recorded or performed in public again, but lived on for another 32 years. Note that the New York Times obituary cited at the end of this article wrongly gives the date of the stroke as 1965. His recordings of Mozart, Schumann and Brahms are also highly regarded; his Debussy, Bach and Schubert recordings are likewise esteemed. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1946. He died in London in 1988, aged 85. A biography, Solo: The Biography of Solomon by Bryan Crimp, was published by APR in 1994, , and reissued in paperback by Travis and Emery in 2008, . Criticism \\"In the Path√©tique, Solomon's most familiar virtues are perfectly united with the proper sense of drama and intensity. Rarely can Beethoven's early romanticism have been more concentratedly yet more clearly expressed. The suspense at the end of the famous Grave introduction is created, as is often the case with Solomon, by a scrupulous adherence to the text and whilst others may be more storming and indeed rampant in the following Allegro di molto e con brio few could rival Solomon's overall command.\\"Bryce Morrison, 1976. Liner notes, Seraphim LP, 60286 The same drama and intensity are also heard in his powerful, assured and immaculate reading of Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 21, in C major, Op. 53 (\\"Waldstein\\"). Solomon's first recordings were made in 1929 for the English branch of Columbia Records. He later recorded for HMV. Most of his recordings have appeared on compact disc, either directly through EMI/Warner or under license to the Testament label. Before the onset of his stroke in 1956 he recorded a handful of works in stereo, but whether in stereo or mono his recordings are all worth hearing; the clarity, tonal beauty and imaginativeness of his playing overcoming any shortcomings of recording technique. Solomon's rendition of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata is notable for its poetic lyricism and natural, unforced passion; in opus 111 he was in his element.Bruce Eder, All Music Guide Discography A full discography of Solomon's recordings can be found in the biography by Bryan Crimp: Solo: The Biography of Solomon (APR 1994), and also in one of the ARSC's journals ‚Äì as here.

The lake is famed for the colour of its azure water, the surrounding peaks, the three glaciers visible from the lake, and Spirit Island, a frequently and very famously photographed islet. The lake is located south of Jasper town, and is accessible by motor vehicle, including shuttle buses from Jasper. Boat tours run to Spirit Island in the spring to autumn season. The 44 km Skyline Trail, Jasper's most popular, highest and above treeline, multi-day hike, begins at Maligne Lake and finishes near the town of Jasper. Other popular day hikes include the Opal Hills and Bald Hills loops. Winter activities include cross-country skiing and snowboarding. Maligne Lake is approximately long and is at its deepest point, in the south end of the lake. It averages in depth. It sits at approximately asl. Easily visible from the Maligne Lake Day Lodge are Leah and Samson Peaks and Mount Paul to the east, and Mounts Charlton, Unwin, Mary Vaux and Llysfran Peak to the south and west. The Charlton-Unwin, Maligne, and Coronet glaciers are visible from the lake, which boasts a self-sustaining population of introduced rainbow trout and brook trout. It is a popular spot for sport fishing, kayaking and canoeing. Parks Canada maintains three camping sites, accessible only by canoe, at Hidden Cove, Fisherman's Bay and Coronet Creek. Sunrise in Winter at Maligne Lake Maligne Lake is fed and drained by the Maligne River, which enters the lake on its south side, near Mount Unwin and drains the lake to the north. Maligne Lake, as well as Maligne River, Maligne Mountain, and Maligne Pass, takes its name from the French word for malignant or wicked. The name was used by Father Pierre-Jean De Smet (1801‚Äì1873) to describe the turbulent river that flows from the lake (in the spring), and soon spread to the lake, canyon, pass, mountain and range. It is also possible that early French traders applied the name to the river for its treacherous confluence with the Athabasca River.Karamitsanis, Aphrodite (1991). Place Names of Alberta, Volume 1. Calgary: University of Calgary Press, pg. 153 History Maligne Lake in Jasper National Park The lake was well known to First Nations of the area, including Samson Beaver, who knew it as Chaba Imne (Beaver Lake). He drew the first map of the lake and the route to it for Mary Sch√§ffer in 1907. Sch√§ffer was an explorer and artist of the Rocky Mountains area who, being the first non-native to visit Chabna Imne, was accredited with the discovery; which she attached the name Maligne Lake. The first European to actually see the lake was Henry McLeod, scouting routes for the CPR in 1875. When he sighted it, he was high in the mountain range and did not actually go into the lake area or identify the route to the lake. June 8, 1908, with the help of Samson Beaver's map, Sch√§ffer , her travelling companion Mary (Mollie) Adams and the guides Billy Warren and Sid Unwin, set out from Lake Louise to reach the lake. When they arrived at the lake, they explored it with the means of a raft, nicknamed HMS Chaba. At the request of the Canadian government, Sch√§ffer returned in 1911 to survey the lake in more detail. She also named several of the mountains and peaks. Mary Schaeffer's books of the area attracted tourists from all over the United States. Maligne Lake is the location of two Alberta registered historic buildings, the Maligne Lake Chalet and accompanying guest house, washhouse, and cache, all built in 1927 by Colonel Fred Brewster as a part of his \\"Rocky Mountain Camps\\". For a time, the Maligne Lake Chalet was the largest, most luxurious accommodation in Jasper National Park. The other historic building is the boathouse, built by Donald \\"Curly\\" Phillips in 1928 to accommodate his wilderness guiding and fishing business. In the same year, he finished construction of the first Maligne Lake tour boat, Leah (named for Leah Samson, wife of Samson Beaver). Philips resided in his boathouse until his death in an avalanche (1936, aged 52). The historic buildings are maintained by Maligne Lake Tours, a company that dates back to Brewster's and Philips' early entrepreneurial endeavours. Curly Philips is credited with stocking Maligne Lake with brook trout, packed overland in barrels. Then in the 1970 Parks Canada decided to introduce rainbow trout to make sport fishing in the lake more difficult. The largest rainbow trout in Alberta was subsequently caught in this lake () by the means of sport fishing. The record fish was mounted and is currently owned by Currie's Guiding and Tackle, Jasper.Currie's Guiding - record fish Jasper National Park staff later introduced brook trout. The third largest brook trout in the world was also sport fished from this lake and is owned by David Robson of Hinton, Alberta. Ecology Maligne Lake Panorama and Boathouse Wildlife is surprisingly abundant along this high altitude oligotrophic lake. Grizzly bear, black bear, mule deer, caribou, wolves, moose, and mountain sheep are some of the larger mammals that frequent the lake area during the summer season. Bald eagles, golden eagles and osprey also frequent the area and live off the fish populations. Geology within the lake Maligne Lake in Jasper National Park Spirit Island on Maligne Lake Maligne Lake is the largest lake in Jasper National Park. The valley in which the lake lies was carved and excavated by valley glaciers, and the lake has been dammed at its northern end by an end moraine deposited by the last glacier, which flowed down the valley towards the Athabasca River. The glacial deposits and landforms forming the end moraine are excellent examples of glacial deposition.www.ags.gov.ab.ca The highest peak in the area is Mount Brazeau (), which stands southeast of Maligne Lake at the head of the Brazeau Icefield. It is barely visible behind the towering massif of Monkhead (). In general, the highest mountains are at the south end of the lake and are composed of strata that were deposited between 4,000 and 5,000 years ago. Northward from the high peaks at the south end of the lake, the valley sides are different in form and composition. The east side of the valley is made of steeply dipping limestone beds of Devonian to Mississippian age that form the spectacular range of sawtooth mountains called the Colin Range, which is part of the Queen Elizabeth Ranges. On the west side of the valley, and in sharp contrast to the east side, is the Maligne Range composed of Cambrian and Precambrian quartzite and shales. These mountains owe their more subdued outline to the glaciers, which moved over them and rounded them to their present form. The Maligne River, arising at Maligne Pass (), flows into the northern part of Maligne Lake. At the northern end of the lake, the river flows out of the lake in a narrow channel to Medicine Lake. There is no visible northern outlet from Medicine Lake because the Maligne River flows underground (except during flood) for before reappearing in its remarkable canyon, which is about in depth. The water flowing in the riverbed between Medicine Lake and Maligne Canyon is derived from the adjacent mountainsides. Not only is the Maligne Valley a U-shaped valley, but it is also a hanging tributary valley as a result of deepening or widening of the Athabasca Valley by glacial erosion at a faster rate than the tributary Maligne Valley. This process leaves the tributary at its junction with the main valley hanging above the main valley.

It was merged into the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation (ITT) in 1928. History The company was founded by Frederick George Creed and Danish telegraph engineer Harald Bille, and was first incorporated in 1912 as \\"Creed, Bille & Company Limited\\". After Bille's death in a railway accident in 1916, his name was dropped from the company's title and it became simply Creed & Company. The Company spent most of World War I producing high-quality instruments, manufacturing facilities for which were very limited at that time in the UK. Among the items produced were amplifiers, spark-gap transmitters, aircraft compasses, high-voltage generators, bomb release apparatus, and fuses for artillery shells and bombs. In 1924 Creed entered the teleprinter field with their Model 1P, which was soon superseded by the improved Model 2P. In 1925 Creed acquired the patents for Donald Murray's Murray code, a rationalised Baudot code, and it was used for their new Model 3 Tape Teleprinter of 1927. This machine printed received messages directly onto gummed paper tape at a rate of 65 words per minute and was the first combined start-stop transmitter-receiver teleprinter from Creed to enter mass production. Some of the key models were: * Creed model 6S (punched paper tape reader) * Creed model 7 (page printing teleprinter introduced in 1931) * Creed model 7B (50 baud page printing teleprinter) * Creed model 7E (page printing teleprinter with overlap cam and range finder) * Creed model 7/TR (non-printing teleprinter reperforator) * Creed model 54 (page printing teleprinter introduced in 1954) * Creed model 75 (page printing teleprinter introduced in 1958) * Creed model 85 (printing reperforator introduced in 1948) * Creed model 86 (printing reperforator using 7/8\\" wide tape) * Creed model 444 (page printing teleprinter introduced in 1966 - GPO type 15) In July 1928, Creed & Company were merged into ITT.

The HCI was introduced in 1999 to improve the IT literacy of the British workforce. It was also aimed at bridging Britain's digital divide - the increasing gap between those who have access to, and the skills to use, information technology, and those who do not. The program gained traction after four years, in 2003 after it was re-branded. The Trade Union Congress and the Department of Trade and Industry also made the initiative more user-friendly by publishing standard guideline that employers could easily adopt. The HCI program was lease agreement between the employer and the employee. The agreement usually lasted for three years, costing a maximum of ¬£500 a year. At the end of the lease period, the employee was given the option to purchase the computer at its market value, which was typically ¬£10 at that time. Since its inception, the HCI schemes have proven to be very popular. More than 1250 firms, employing 4.5 million people, had adopted the scheme Discontinuation On 23 March 2006, in his UK Budget, Chancellor Gordon Brown announced the removal of HCI tax exemption for employer-loaned computers. the HCI program was discontinued. The move was made without any consultation with the employers or employees' bodies, a stark contrast to the extensive consultation that preceded its creation The Treasury of the United Kingdom made initial claims that the scheme's consumers were being dominated by higher-rate taxpayers. However, research by the HCI Alliance found that 75% of employees who purchased personal computers through the HCI were basic or starting rate taxpayers and 50% were \\"blue collar\\" workers. The HCI Alliance, created in 2003, was a group of industry leaders who worked together with the UK Government. Their aim was to increase access to personal computing in the UK. Another reason for the HCI being cancelled was that computers had become relatively more affordable. Most people in the workplace had access to computers and therefore, the purpose of the scheme had been achieved. In the days following the budget announcement, a significant lobbying campaign ensued, resulting in the treasury announcing that it would consider alternatives to HCI in its current format rather than disbanding it altogether. This led to the creation of the Educational Technology Allowance. Educational Technology Allowance  In 2008, the Gordon Brown administration announced the ¬£300 million Educational Technology Allowance incentive. The program grants up to ¬£700 to low-income households with schooling children who have no internet access at home. The policy was aimed towards helping approximately 1.4 million children who do not have access to a broadband connection at home. The program was piloted in two local authority areas in 2010 and was completely rolled out across England in 2011. The funding for the Educational Technology Allowance came from the Children's and Schools budget. The money can be used by families to pay for computer equipment, technical support and cabling in the street, if necessary. The Educational Technology Allowance is not offered in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

Located in the southeastern part of the county, it lies along the road between the cities of Ploie»ôti and BuzƒÉu, and to the northeast of the national capital, Bucharest. Its position led it to become a thriving market town beginning in the 18th century, before a long period of economic decline began in the early 20th century. Agriculture gave way to industry as the chief employment under the Communist regime, but the town has continued to face difficulties in the wake of a late-1990s deindustrialisation. Geography The town is situated in southeastern Prahova County, on the border with BuzƒÉu County; the four rural localities that surround it are Gura Vadului (north), Baba Ana (south), SƒÉhƒÉteni (east) and F√¢nt√¢nele (west).

Mizil is the only city or town in Romania to lie on the 45th parallel north. Located on a series of fields with altitudes of 80‚Äì95 m, it is on the Mizil Plain, a subdivision of the Bucure»ôtilor Plain, in turn part of the Wallachian Plain, and has been called the \\"gate to the BƒÉrƒÉgan\\", a reference to the plain extending to its east. It is also on the edge of the plain region and the southern reaches of foothills leading up to the Southern Carpathians, being bounded by the SƒÉrata Plain to the south and by Istri»õa Hill to the northeast. The area's rocks are Neogene molasse; there is also gravel and sand. Near the surface, there are loess layers of different thickness.Development Strategy, p.42 Mizil covers 1931 ha, of which 77.7% are agricultural land, water, forests and green spaces, and 22.3% are developed. The IstƒÉu stream runs through it. The town administers one village, Fefelei, although this is essentially a neighbourhood today.Development Strategy, p.12 Demographics Of Mizil's 14,312 residents at the 2011 census, 83.7% were ethnic Romanians and 16.3% were Roma.

Between 1992 and 2011, Mizil's population fell from 17,090 to 14,312, a drop of 16.3%. Reasons for this trend include lower birth rate, emigration and poor economic conditions.Development Strategy, p.16National Statistics Institute, Popula»õia stabilƒÉ la recensƒÉmintele din anii 1912, 1930, 1948, 1956, 1966, 1977 »ôi 1992 History Mizil was mentioned in 1529, in an official document at Bra»ôov. It was first mentioned as E»ôteu in 1585, and as Istau in 1591, after its stream. Around the turn of the 18th century, Prince Constantin Br√¢ncoveanu owned the village, building houses at the nearby Corbeanca Dealul DumbƒÉvii vineyard and establishing an annual fair in Mizil that would become renowned. It was during the 18th century that a mail coach station for changing horses opened in the village. Merchants began to set up shop, their business augmented by the location between two larger towns; coachmen, wheelwrights, woodcutters and watchmen also found work. In the Ottoman Turkish language of Wallachia's rulers, the station was known as a menzil. The n dropped out through syncope and the i became an e; given that activity and transactions that took place around it, the resulting name came to be used for the village as a whole and to replace its old name. The first church was built in 1790, and Mizil was declared a town in 1830. Mizil reached its peak of activity during the 19th century, rapidly outpacing Urla»õi, which had possessed the advantage of having the closest market to most of the towns in that part of Wallachia. Moreover, in 1847 the Ploie»ôti-BuzƒÉu road began to be built along the foothills, shortening and modernising the link between the capitals of the Danubian Principalities, Bucharest and Ia»ôi. It was from the latter to the former city that Alexandru Ioan Cuza passed through Mizil in 1859, on his way to become head of the United Principalities. In this period, inhabitants worked in agriculture, viniculture, animal husbandry and various trades. The first school was built in 1857, by the boyar Ion CƒÉciunescu, although teaching had begun around 1838. Following the efforts of mayor Leonida Condeescu, an elementary trade school was established about 1902, with a high school opening later. The town's rapid growth slowed down in the first half of the 20th century, eventually stagnating. In the 1950s and '60s, under the Communist regime, it was the centre of Mizil raion in Regiunea Ploie»ôti. During this time, industry--textiles, wood and mechanics--came to be a chief source of employment for inhabitants. Government, economy and infrastructure Mizil train station Mizil is governed by a mayor and 17-member local council. Since the 2016 local election, six councillors belong to the Social Democratic Party, five each to the National Liberal Party and the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats, and one to the Christian Democratic National Peasants' Party.

Mizil has 35 km of roads, 36% of which are asphalted. The most significant of these is the Ploie»ôti-BuzƒÉu European route E577 that links Bucharest with Moldavia. There is no public transportation, but there are private buses running to Ploie»ôti, BuzƒÉu and surrounding communes, as well as taxis. There is also a CƒÉile Ferate Rom√¢ne train station, lying between Ploie»ôti and BuzƒÉu.Development Strategy, p.38-40 Companies active in Mizil offer fixed and mobile telephone services, cable television, Internet, postal services, banking and gasoline.Development Strategy, p.40 As of 2002, Mizil had 8 ha of green space, including roadsides and parks. Agriculture was a primary occupation for the town's inhabitants in the 19th and early 20th centuries, but is much reduced in importance as of the early 21st. Still, as of 2005, 1448 of the total 1931 ha are agricultural land, of which 89% is cultivated arable land, 7% pastures and 6% vineyards. Since 1990, the small tracts of land used for producing hay and growing fruit trees have been converted to other uses.Development Strategy, p.41-42 During the Communist era, Mizil depended for employment on three large factories employing almost the entire workforce. The largest, established in 1951, produced armaments; the next turned out spun textiles and the smallest made mattresses. Dana Mihai, \\"'Tancul' tranzi»õiei a trecut nemilos peste Mizil\\", AdevƒÉrul, June 21, 2013; accessed February 14, 2014 The town reached an economic nadir in 1998-1999, when these laid off thousands of workers. One factory, formerly employing 8,500, fired all but around 400, while another dismissed almost all its 2,000 employees. Unemployment rose to 17.5% (against a national average of 8.7%); including those who had stopped looking for work, unemployment reached 80% of the working-age population (18 to 62). Poverty had reached alarming levels, with tension and crime also rising, particularly among the generally jobless, under-educated Roma.Development Strategy, p.52 As of 2005, 39% of Mizil firms are involved in commerce, 15% in services, 12% in industry, 11% in construction, 5% in agriculture, 3% in transport, and 15% in other domains.Development Strategy, p.55-56 That year, the working-age population was 65% of the total, of whom 30% had jobs. Roma represented a significant portion of the 70% who did not.Development Strategy, p.60 Due to the factory closings, there was a dramatic fall in employment between 1994 and 2001; even with a slight rise in subsequent years, the workforce only reached half the 1994 level.Development Strategy, p.61 There is one hospital in Mizil, serving the town and surrounding communes.Development Strategy, p.27 Culture Maramure»ô style (completed 2007) The town houses two high schools, three primary schools and five kindergartens.Development Strategy, p.22 One high school is focused on physics, chemistry, biology and computer science, while the other prepares students to become technicians.Development Strategy, p.24-25 Mizil has three historic Orthodox churches. The oldest, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, dates to the late 18th century and is in Fefelei. Another one, dedicated to John the Baptist, is in the town centre and was built in 1857. The building is cross-in-square in form and Byzantine and Gothic in style, with Renaissance touches. Its original painting was lost; a restoration took place in 1916. The iconostasis is sculpted out of linden wood and covered with gold leaf in folk art fashion. A third church, consecrated to the Dormition of the Theotokos and located in the town square, is from 1865. Among its sacred objects is a wooden blessing cross featuring silver filigree work and twenty-four red gems; this is from the end of the 19th century and appears to be the work of an anonymous artist from the Russian school.Development Strategy, p.30 Additionally, there are four 19th-century roadside crosses, two of which are considered historic monuments by the Culture Ministry. A monument dedicated to the troops of the 72nd Mizil Infantry Regiment, who fought during the Romanian Campaign of World War I (1916-1917), stands in the town. Built in 1921, the pedestal is 1.8 m high and the sculptures reach 2.7 m. They depict a woman in folk costume embodying the Fatherland, with her right hand raised in salute and her left holding the standard; a soldier and a woman sitting before her, the latter with an open book on her knees and representing History. There is a bronze plaque showing a battle scene, another featuring an inscription, and others naming the 1190 officers and enlisted men who died in battle. There is a public library. There is also a cultural house, built in 1965-1966. This has 384 seats and a stage of around 50m2; the building was modernised in the mid-2000s. Social and cultural activities take place there, with well-known theatrical troupes occasionally performing. There is a children's chess club in the house, and chess can also be played seasonally in the town park. The town's festival days take place during October. The playwright Ion Luca Caragiale was a friend of mayor Condeescu, whom he parodied in his work; the latter's conversations with Caragiale and with Mihai Eminescu's brother Matei, a soldier assigned to Mizil and who became the mayor's brother-in-law, convinced him to build a theatre. It had 200 seats and opened in 1895; among the plays staged were Caragiale's. After falling into a state of degradation, it was demolished in 1968. A cinema used to operate in Mizil; this was sold to a company that promised to continue screening films but did not do so. Aside from Caragiale, the journalist Geo Bogza, writing after the town's economic decline had begun, helped impress on the public Mizil's image as a place where nothing important ever happens, in a 1938 reportage titled 175 de minute la Mizil (\\"175 Minutes in Mizil\\") and summarised as \\"the adventure of the banal\\". Paul Cernat, \\"Un mizilean care ¬´face diferen»õa¬ª\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 222, June 2004; accessed September 14, 2010 Other literary portrayals have been undertaken by local writers, including the poets Mihai Negulescu and Petre Strihan; the journalist and poet George Ranetti (Romeo »ôi Julieta la Mizil, \\"Romeo and Juliet in Mizil\\"); Joachim Botez (√énsemnƒÉrile unui Belfer, \\"Notes of an Idle Rich Man\\"; Minerva la Mizil, \\"Minerva at Mizil\\"; De la Piatra la Mizil, \\"From Piatra to Mizil\\"; √émpu»ôcat la Mizil, \\"Gunned Down in Mizil\\"); and the novels of Cosmin Manolache since 2000, including Ce fa»õƒÉ cumplitƒÉ am (\\"What a Cruel Face I Have\\").

McCann's wealth stemmed initially from a golf vacation company, based in Montreal and Phoenix. He is best known for his involvement in Celtic F.C., the football club based in Glasgow. In 1972, he obtained the satellite television rights to broadcast the Celtic v Internazionale 1971‚Äì72 European Cup semi- final in 1972 in Toronto. McCann acquired a 51% controlling stake in the Celtic Football and Athletic Company Ltd. in 1994 for ¬£9.5m, after it became clear that the club was facing bankruptcy. Acting as a guarantor for the club's ¬£7 million debt, he injected additional finance, floated the club on the London Stock Exchange as a public limited company, Celtic plc, in order to raise capital from a share issue, and oversaw an extensive redevelopment of Celtic Park. He raised ¬£14m in a share issue, and that contributed to funding the rebuilding work of the team and the stadium. By the end, Celtic had 53,000 season ticket holders. What some perceived as McCann's abrasive manner, coupled with his preoccupation with building a sustainable infrastructure for the club off the field rather than a title winning one on it, prompted sustained criticism during much of his tenure. Although credited with rescuing the club from imminent bankruptcy, McCann stated at the outset that he would stay for only five years, with the objectives of placing the club on a firmer business footing and returning the league championship to Celtic Park. The latter goal was met, halting Glasgow rivals Rangers in their quest for a record-breaking ten consecutive league titles. In 1999, McCann sold his shares, leaving Irish entrepreneur Dermot Desmond as the largest shareholder, with a 19.8% holding. As his successors McCann appointed Allan MacDonald as Chief Executive and Frank O'Callaghan as Chairman. McCann offered an interest- free payment plan to encourage individuals, rather than financial institutions, to purchase shares. The result was that small shareholders - principally supporters of the club - owned 63% of the stock at the time of McCann's departure. McCann personally profited in a significant way from the sale of the bulk of his shareholding. Since leaving Glasgow in 1999 he has maintained his routine of purchasing four season tickets every year. McCann's role in wrestling control of Celtic from its unpopular long-time owners and averting the apparent threat of bankruptcy, coupled with his subsequent record in developing the club, prompted a reappraisal of his tenure. Some years after leaving Celtic, he came to enjoy a popularity amongst many or most Celtic supporters that was often absent during his time as the club's chairman. McCann returned to North America where he founded LimoLiner, a company running luxury bus services between Boston and Manhattan.About LimoLiner He retired from his role in the company in 2014.

It changed its name to the American Federation of Labor (AFL) on December 8, 1886. Forces influencing the formation of FOTLU During the Long Depression of 1873-1878, the Knights of Labor emerged as a potent force for workers in the United States.Foner, 1947, p. 504. But as Marxists and Socialists joined the labor movement and fought for dominance within various labor unions, influential newspapers began to advocate for the suppression of trade unions. Many in the American labor movement, such as Samuel Gompers, sought to implement a 'New Unionism' program which would free unions from political affiliation and limit their goals to the day-to-day concerns of working people.Foner, 1947, p. 514-15. Following a failed 107-day cigar-makers' strike in 1877, Gompers assisted President Adolph Strasser in radically restructuring the Cigar Makers' International Union (CMIU) in 1879. Henceforth, the union would be run like a business. The international union would have the authority to take control of local affiliates. Dues would be raised to build financial reserves, and to pay sick and death benefits. A union bank would be established to provide short-term loans for workers who had been laid off and were seeking new jobs. The constitution of the union would be changed to permit the international to seize funds from locals with flush treasuries and transfer the money to locals in distress.Foner, 1947, p. 515. Other unions such as the Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners also quickly adopted the principles of the 'New Unionism.'Dubofsky and Dulles, p. 140. In April 1881, Gompers lost a re-election campaign for the presidency of Local 144 of the Cigar Makers' International Union to a coalition of socialists who advocated militancy as a way to improve working conditions of cigar makers. But Gompers and his allies refused to turn over the keys to the offices or the contents of the union's treasury, arguing that the socialists were not fit to hold office.Foner, 1947, p. 517-18. William H. Bailey and Thomas Barry, two executive board members of the Knights of Labor, supported the insurgents against Gompers and may have sabotaged a compromise which would have permitted Gompers to step down.Weir, Robert E. Knights Unhorsed: Internal Conflict in a Gilded Age Social Movement. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 2000. p. 51; Dubofsky and Dulles, p. 147. The experience embittered Gompers against the Knights. FOTLU's founding The same month of April 1881, the Paterson 'Home-Journal,' a socialist newspaper in Paterson, New Jersey, called for a conference of labor unions to form a new organization which would organize large numbers of workers. A group of disaffected Knights of LaborRayback, p. 157. in Indiana calling themselves the Knights of Industry and a shadowy group calling itself the Amalgamated Labor Union took up the charge and announced a conference to be held August 2, 1881 in Terre Haute. The International Typographical Union, eager to establish a national labor union, also widely publicized the conference. But more delegates from trade associations and the United States Greenback Party attended than unionists. A resolution against trade unionism was actually proposed, and labor union delegates had to work hard to secure adjournment in order to avoid passage of the motion. The trade unionists decided to call another conference for November 15, 1881 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where a larger number of trade union members could participate.Foner, 1947, p. 519. The Pittsburgh convention was attended by 107 delegates from eight national unions, 11 city labor federations, 42 local craft unions, and three district and 46 local assemblies of the Knights of Labor. The International Typographical Union had the largest trade union delegation, with 14 attendees. The Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers, International Molders and Foundry Workers Union of North America, the American Flint Glass Workers' Union of North America, the Cigar Makers' International Union, the Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners, the Coopers' International Union of North America, the International Granite Cutter's Union and the Lake Seamen's Union also attended.Foner, 1947, p. 519; Rayback, p. 157. Gompers participated as a delegate from the Cigar Makers'. John J. Jarrett, president of the Iron and Steel Workers, was elected chairman. Gompers was elected chairman of the Committee on Organization.Foner, 1947, p. 520. Gompers led his committee to propose that FOTLU restrict its membership to skilled craft unions, excluding unskilled workers and political labor organizations. The proposal was hotly debated. The Knights of Labor believed fervently in a concept of the labor movement that was inclusive of both skilled and unskilled labor. A mass movement of workers was the Knights' goal. But Gompers' Committee on Organization had proposed limiting FOTLU membership to skilled workers, and restricting the labor movement to a select few. Knights of Labor delegates were outraged. Nevertheless, the resolution was adopted. The name of the organization was also altered to adopt an international character by adding 'United States and Canada.'Foner, 1947, p. 520; Rayback, p. 157; Dubofsky and Dulles, p. 146. In large part, FOTLU's founding principles and constitutional structures mirrored those Gompers had helped institute in the cigar makers' union. The FOTLU constitution provided for a governing body of five executive council members, who would also act as a legislative committee. Annual conventions were established at which each national affiliate would receive one vote for 1,000 members, two votes for 4,000 members and three votes for 8,000 members. Local labor bodies were given one vote each, regardless of size. The voting rules effectively disenfranchised bodies belonging to the Knights of Labor, and Knights- dominated central labor bodies. The Committee on Platform subsequently proposed, and the delegates approved, a preamble to the FOTLU constitution which sharply delineated the new federation from the Knights of Labor. It rejected the Knights' assertion that the interests of capital and labor were one. FOTLU asserted that 'A struggle is going on in the nations of the civilized world between the oppressors and the oppressed...a struggle between capital and labor, which must grow in intensity from year to year and work disastrous results to the toiling millions of all nations...'Quoted in Foner, 1947, p. 520-21. The committee also proposed a number of resolutions, all of which were passed by the delegates. These included calls for: * The legal incorporation of unions; * Compulsory education of children; * Prohibition of child labor under the age of 14; * Apprenticeship laws; * Establishment of an eight-hour work day; * Repeal of state conspiracy laws which did not provide a safe harbor for labor unions; * Establishment of a federal agency to collect labor statistics; * Abolition of convict labor; * Prohibition of the importation of foreign workers; * Federal legislation requiring ventilation and inspection of mines; * Support for Irish liberation; * Legislation making employers responsible for industrial accidents; and * A high protective tariff. Two resolutions were rejected. One called for federal regulation of railroad and telegraph companies in the public interest, and another demanded that only homesteaders be eligible to receive public domain land.Foner, 1947, p. 521-23; Rayback, p. 157. Gompers was elected to the executive committee.Foner, 1947, p. 524. Struggle for survival FOTLU was not very successful. District and local assemblies of the Knights of Labor withdrew almost immediately, as did most national unions. Only 19 delegates attended the second convention, and 26 at the third. Gompers was elected chairman of FOTLU's executive committee (making him the de facto president) in 1883, but even he did not attend that meeting. The federation's membership hovered around 25,000,Dubofsky and Dulles, p. 146; Rayback, p. 158. and FOTLU organized almost no members and issued no charters to new unions.Foner, 1955, p. 94. The federation made some effort to win passage of favorable legislation, but no unified plan of action took place.Green, p. 98. FOTLU did help defeat a federal bill which would have declared seamen's unions to be mutinies. But the organization was far more successful on the state level, where it won passage of legislation outlawing cigar-making in tenement houses, prohibitions on child labor under those under the age of 12, compulsory education and prohibitions on prison labor. Meanwhile, the Knights of Labor were growing tremendously in the 1884-85 period. A series of successful strikes swept the country, affecting textile workers, plumbers, bricklayers, stove molders, stonecutters, carpet weavers, shoemakers, glass molders and coal miners. The Knights struck the Union Pacific Railway, forcing the company to rescind a 10 percent wage cut in 1884 and another 10 percent wage reduction the company tried to introduce the following year. In July 1885, the Knights had 104,000 members; by July 1886, they had 703,000 members.Rayback, p. 160-162. But FOTLU stagnated. Its membership was so low that it was forced change its policy and admit women and girls as members in 1882. Few joined. 1882 was also the year that FOTLU adopted a proposal to establish a national Labor Day holiday on the first Monday in September.Foner, 1955, p. 96-97. Peter J. McGuire, president of the Carpenters union, had proposed the first Monday in September as Labor Day in 1882, and the date had been observed by the Central Labor Union of New York City. It was one of its few successes. (A federal bill ordering observance of Labor Day was introduced in the U.S. Congress in 1894, and the bill was enacted into law and signed by President Grover Cleveland on June 28 of that year.) At its October 1884 convention, FOTLU attempted to reinvigorate itself by adopting a resolution again pushing for establishment of the eight-hour day. Peter J. McGuire, president of the Carpenters union, proposed a resolution‚Äîwhich FOTLU adopted‚Äîwhich required that, if national legislation adopting an eight-hour day was not forthcoming by May 1, 1886, the federation would call a general strike. The leadership of the Knights secretly issued a statement advising its members not to participate in the fight for the eight-hour day, but members of the Knights of Labor overwhelmingly supported the proposal and made plans to support the federation in its May Day strike. Preparations were most advanced in Chicago.Rayback, p. 164; Foner, 1995, p. 99, 101. In March 1886, the Knights of Labor struck the Union Pacific and Missouri Pacific railroads. The Great Southwest Railroad Strike of 1886 idled 200,000 rail workers. But by the beginning of the summer of 1886, the strike was beginning to collapse‚Äîand it was taking the Knights with it. FOTLU was also in crisis. The Knights of Labor had actively undermined FOTLU and raided its unions during the previous five years.Rayback, p. 175; Foner, 1955, p. 132. The Knights had provided scab workers to employers during strikes called by FOTLU unions. The Knights had publicly denounced FOTLU initiatives, legislative proposals and organizing efforts. Now the Knights began to support a breakaway group of radical cigar- makers known as the Progressive Cigar-makers' Union. With their base in Chicago, the Progressive Cigar-makers advocated open rebellion against the capitalist system. The local central labor body, the Amalgamated Trades and Labor Assembly, fought the Progressive Cigar-makers bitterly for the allegiances of the Chicago's unions. The Knights openly supported the Progressive Cigar-makers against CMIU, enraging Gompers.Foner, 1955, p. 132. In the midst of the battle among the Progressive Cigar-makers, CMIU and the Amalgamated Trades, the May 1, 1886 deadline came and with it the general strike. During a peaceful labor rally protesting police violence against strikers in Chicago on May 4, a bomb was set off‚Äîkilling one policeman immediately (seven others later died of their injuries. In what later became known as the Haymarket Riot, police opened fire on the crowd. Another 11 people were killed, and dozens more wounded. A large number of the unions participating in the strike on May 4 were FOTLU locals.Green, p. 164; Dubofsky and Dulles, p. 146. A political backlash against the American labor movement erupted nationwide. In the wake of the Haymarket Riot, FOTLU proposed on April 25, 1886, that a truce be established between the Knights and the federation. A letter signed by McGuire of the Carpenters; Adolph Strasser, president of CMIU; Josiah Dyer, general secretary of the Granite Cutters; P.J. Fitzpatrick, president of the Iron Molder's Union of North America; and W.H. Foster, secretary of FOTLU, called for a meeting to be held on May 18, 1886 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.Foner, 1955, p. 136. Labor peace was the public purpose of the Philadelphia meeting. But Gompers and the meeting convenors planned to use the meeting to swing union support toward an entirely new labor federation. Gompers believed that the Knights were threatening the very existence of craft unionism, and their radical attitudes were likely to bring the wrath of governmental authority down on the labor movement in the wake of the Haymarket Riot.Rayback, p. 175-76; Dubofsky and Dulles, p. 147-48. Twenty delegates representing more than 365,000 workers met in Philadelphia. The delegates proposed that the Knights 'agree that they would not initiate into the Order any trade union member without the permission of his union, or any other wage earner who worked for less than the prescribed wage scale of his craft, and they were also called upon to revoke the charter of any local assembly organized by workers in a trade where there was already a national union.'Dubofsky and Dulles, p. 147. At first blush, it seemed ridiculous that the Knights would agree to the proposal. The Knights were powerful, FOTLU was weak and the Knights were dismantling the federation seemingly at will. But the situation was more complex than that. A number of former FOTLU craft unions had affiliated with the Knights, and they formed a powerful and cohesive clique within the labor organization. Additionally, many of these unions had been raided by other labor organizations belonging to the Knights, or had their job actions broken by scab workers belonging to the Knights. These unions were now ready to undercut the Knights in the Philadelphia negotiations. At the same time, some important Knight leaders had quietly approached Grand Master Workman Terence V. Powderly, and convinced him of that many of FOTLU's grievances were justified.Rayback, p. 176-77; Foner, 1955, p. 138-39. Additionally, the collapse of the Southwest rail strike was putting pressure on Powderly to seek breathing room. Powderly not only agreed to the terms proposed by FOTLU, he left the Philadelphia meeting pledging to bring the proposal before a special convention of the Knights which would meet in Cleveland, Ohio on May 24, 1886. But delegates to the Cleveland convention, dominated by anti-craft union activists, never permitted the agreement to come up for discussion. Instead, delegates passed a resolution ordering Powderly to defend the organization at all costs and expel any member who did not support the Knights.Foner, 1955, p. 137, 139. Formation of the American Federation of Labor Negotiations between the two organizations continued for four months. Powderly pledged not to interfere in FOTLU affairs. But craft union members of the Knights were incensed at the treatment their fellow Knights had given them in Cleveland, and they continued to undermine the organization's leadership from within.Foner, 1955, p. 140. The regular General Assembly of the Knights of Labor met in Richmond, Virginia in October 1886. Once more, Powderly was unable to bring the Philadelphia agreement up for debate or a vote. Anti-craft union delegates passed a resolution ordering all members of the Cigar-Makers' International Union to leave that organization and join the Progressive Cigar-makers or forfeit their membership in the Knights. Another resolution set up new national assemblies of craft union members, a direct challenge to FOTLU's international unions.Rayback, p. 177; Foner, 1955, p. 140-41; Dubofsky and Dulles, p. 148. The action of the Knights spurred the craft unions into action. McGuire, Strasser, Dyer, Fitzpatrick and Foster issued a national to all craft trade unions to hold a national conference in Columbus, Ohio on December 8, 1886. Forty-two delegates from 25 labor organizations, 13 national unions and 12 local unions and city labor councils assembled in Columbus.Rayback, p. 177; Foner, 1955, p. 142. Gompers and the FOTLU executive board held their convention at the same time. Gompers and the executive committee congratulated the 20 FOTLU delegates on the organization's success in advocating for an eight-hour day. Then the organization dissolved itself. It turned over its treasury of $248.97 and all its property to the other delegates. The other delegates then declared themselves to be the American Federation of Labor. Although many at the time argued that FOTLU merged with the AFL, the AFL was in fact a continuation of the FOTLU.Dubofsky and Dulles, p. 148; Foner, 1955, p. 142.

A huaso () is a Chilean countryman and skilled horseman, similar to the American cowboy or Mexican charro, the gaucho of Argentina, Uruguay and Rio Grande Do Sul and the Australian stockman. A female huaso is called a huasa, although the term china is far more commonly used for his wife or sweetheart, whose dress can be seen in cueca dancing. Huasos are found all over Central and Southern Chile while the Ays√©n and Magallanes Region sheep raisers are gauchos. The major difference between the huaso and the gaucho is that huasos are involved in farming as well as cattle herding. Huasos (plural) are generally found in Chile's central valley. They ride horses and typically wear a straw hat called a chupalla. They also wear a poncho‚Äîcalled a manta or a chamanto (although this was originally reserved to land owners, as it is much more expensive)‚Äîover a short Andalusian waist jacket, as well as tooled leather legging over booties with raw hide leather spur holders that sustain a long-shanked spur with 4-inch rowels, and many other typical garments. Huasos are an important part of Chilean folkloric culture and are a vital part of parades, fiestas, holidays, and popular music.Mularski, Jedrek. Music, Politics, and Nationalism in Latin America: Chile During the Cold War Era. Amherst: Cambria Press. . The dancing of the cueca in which the coy china is courted by the persistent huaso, both traditionally attired, is de rigueur on such occasions. In Chile, the term huaso or ahuasado (in a huaso way) is also used disparagingly to refer to people without manners or lacking the sophistication of an urbanite, akin to US English redneck. Etymology Huaso on a hill. Various theories are commonly advanced: from the Quechua wakcha (hispanicized as huacho) meaning orphan, not belonging to a community, hence free and homeless, an important aspect of the huaso/gaucho myth, or alternatively from the Quechua wasu, meaning either the back of an animal, or rough and rustic. Moreover the word guaso/a is used in Andalusian and American Spanish with the last sense. It appears that a form of folk etymology has operated to conflate the contrasting identities of the huaso, viewed as both a free horseman (implying some wealth and nobility) and an unsophisticated country bumpkin. Both senses can be observed in Chilean usage.

Religious use Headscarves may specifically have a religious significance or function, or be expected as a matter of social custom, the two very often being confused. =Islam= Islam promotes modest dress among women. Many Muslim women wear a headscarf, often known as a hijab and in Quranic Arabic as the khimar. Many of these garments cover the hair, ears and throat, but do not cover the face. The Keffiyeh is commonly used by Muslim men, as for example Yasser Arafat who adopted a black and white fishnet- patterned keffiyeh as a hallmark. Headscarves and veils are commonly used by observant Muslim women and girls, and required by law for women and girls in certain Muslim countries (Iran for example). The Muslim religious dress varies, and various cultures include burqa, chador, niqab, dupatta, or other types of hijab. The religion prescribes modest behaviour or dress in general, and in particular the headscarf worn by Muslim women and girls.al-islam.org - Why Hijab? =Judaism= Religions such as Judaism under Halakhah (Jewish Law) promote modest dress among women and men. Many married Orthodox Jewish women wear a scarf (tichel, shmata ) to cover their hair. The Tallit is commonly worn by Jewish men especially for prayers, which they use to cover their head in order to recite the blessings, although not all men do this. It also may not apply to the entire prayer service, sometimes only specific sections such as the Amidah. The Kohanim (priests) also cover their heads and shoulders with the tallit during the priestly blessing so as to conform to Halakah which states that the hands of the priests should not be seen during this time as their mystical significance to the hand position. =Christianity= Hutterite Christian women wear headscarves. Until at least the 18th century, the wearing of a headcovering for the hair was regarded as customary for Christian women in Mediterranean, European, Middle Eastern, and African cultures, to agree with contemporary notions of modesty and as an indication of married status; the \\"matron's cap\\" is a general term for these. This practice was derived from the Christian Bible, specifically, , which has traditionally been interpreted to mandate the wearing of a headcovering by Christian women. To some extent, the covering of the head depended on where the woman was; indoors and at home it was less worn, but it was usual outside and on formal occasions, especially in church.Fran√ßoise Piponnier and Perrine Mane; Dress in the Middle Ages; pp. 40, 78-81, 95, 121, Yale UP, 1997; Women who did not wear headcoverings were interpreted to be \\"a prostitute or adulteress\\". In Europe, law stipulated that married women who uncovered their head in public was evidence of her infidelity. The Roman Catholic Church required all women to wear a Christian headcovering over their hair in church until the 1980s; in Spain, these take the form of the mantilla. Women meeting the Pope in formal audiences are still expected to wear them. Martin Luther, the German Reformer, as well as John Calvin, a major figure in the Reformed Churches, also expected women to cover their heads in church, as did John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist Churches. In many rural areas, women, especially widows, continue to observe the traditional Christian custom of headcovering, especially in the Mediterranean, as well as in eastern and southern Europe; in South Asia, it is common for Christian women to wear a headcovering called a dupatta. At times the styles of covering using simple cloth became very elaborate, with complicated layers and folding, held in place with hair pins. Among the many terms for head-coverings made of flexible cloth are wimple, hennin, kerchief, gable hood, as well as light hats, mob caps and bonnets. Many Anabaptist Christian women (Amish/Para-Amish, Brethren, Bruderhof, Hutterites and Mennonites) wear their headscarf at all times, except when sleeping. Svetlana Medvedeva, the spouse of Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev, is seen wearing a headscarf during Easter Divine Service in the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow on 5th of May 2013 Lyudmila Putina wearing a headscarf next to Vladimir Putin while attending a commemoration service for the victims of terrorist attacks, November 16, 2001 In countries with large Eastern Orthodox Christianity population such as Romania or Russia\\"Head Covering History\\" headscarves and veils are used by Christian women in the Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodox Church, Assyrian Church of the East, and Roman Catholic Church.\\"On Account of the Angels: Why I Cover My Head\\", orthodoxinfo.com\\"Head Covering Among Catholic Laity\\", a PDF-download page. academia.edu.\\"Veiling in Church: Mantilla Manifesto\\". altcatholicah.com A few years back, all women in Russia who attended Divine Liturgy wore head-coverings. A woman having her head covered means that she honors the Lord. Head-coverings also symbolizes that a woman is married and that her husband is the head of the family. Little girls also have their heads covered when they go to Mass at church, not because they are married, but in order to honor the Lord. Today, young Russian Orthodox women and little girls still cover their heads when going to church, although it differs in style from those worn by women of older age (grandmothers). Some English speakers use the word \\"babushka\\" (the word for \\"grandma\\" in ) to indicate a headscarf tied below the chin, as still commonly worn in rural parts of Europe. In many parts of Europe, headscarves are used mainly by elderly women and this led to the use of the term \\"babushka\\", an East Slavic word meaning 'grandmother'. Some types of head coverings that Russian women wear are: circlet, veil, and wimple. =Sikhism= Young Sikhs often wear a cloth wrapping to cover their hair, before moving on to the turban. Older Sikhs may wear them as an under-turban. Use while working 155x155px 150x150px A clerk working for 153x153px Practical reasons for headscarf use at work include protection from bad weather and protection against industrial contamination, for example in dusty and oily environments. A headscarf can ensure that the hair does not interfere with the work and get caught-up in machinery since long hair can get into rotating parts of machines, so this is avoided either by means of a suitable head covering like a cap, hairnet or kerchief; cutting the hair short; or by putting on a headscarf. Hygiene also requires wearing a head cover at some workplaces, for example in kitchens and hospitals. Such usage has gone on since about 1900, when women's use of mob caps and Dutch bonnets declined. Workers wore them at work to protect their hair from dirt. Farmers used them to see off the weather and dirt. Soviet labour units of the 1930s and 1940s wore them as part of their uniform (where uniforms were available). This habit was common until about the 1950s in the West for farmers and 1960s factory workers, and 1970s in the former USSR for farmers and factory workers. In popular culture Hilda Ogden, popular character from the UK soap opera Coronation Street portrayed by Jean Alexander, became famous throughout the nation for combining a headscarf with hair curlers. So famous was she that, in 1982, she came fourth behind the Queen Mother, Queen Elizabeth II, and Diana, Princess of Wales in a poll of the most recognisable women in Britain.Little, Daran (1995).

Bedlam Furnaces  Bedlam Furnaces today The Madeley Wood Furnaces or Bedlam Furnaces were owned by this company, which held mineral leases in Madeley Parish, enabling it to extract coal and iron ore. The works were taken over by Abraham Darby III of the Coalbrookdale Company in 1776. When the company was reorganised in 1797, the Madeley Wood Works became separate from Coalbrookdale, continuing (in conjunction with the Ketley Ironworks) in the hands of the Reynolds family who had been in partnership with the Darby family at Coalbrookdale since the 1760s. After Joseph Reynolds decided to concentrate on his bank, the Madeley Wood Company works passed to the Anstice family, one of whom had managed it, and their business became another Madeley Wood Company. The name Bedlam Furnaces may have originated with a painting by John Sell Cotman (1782‚Äì1842) who painted the furnace in 1803 and titled it Bedlam Furnace Near Irongate, Shropshire. He was on tour with a fellow less well known artist called Paul Sandby Munn (1773‚Äì1845) who also painted the same subject and titled it Bedlam Furnace, Madeley Dale, Shropshire. It was both a metaphor (the place appeared to the painters to resemble a lunatic asylum), and simultaneously a jest at the expense of Fletcher of Madeley (1729‚Äì1785) a then famous Methodist preacher in whose parish the ironworks were located. The furnaces were also painted, under the same name, by the painter Edward Dayes (d. 1804) at around the same time. This work is now part of the Tate Gallery. The site history through the 20th century is less well documented. Dense vegetation cover was allowed to establish itself amongst the ruins until the late 1950s when the site was subject to spoil dumping, which completely buried the furnace bases. In the 1970s what was to become the Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust began clearing and restoring the works.  Blists Hill  Blowing engine house and blast furnaces at Blists Hill Upon its opening in 1790, the ironworks had access to the Shropshire Canal, the Blists Hill section of which ran immediately to the east of the Blists Hill works site. Proximity of raw materials and the means of transporting the finished product persuaded the company to build a blast furnace at Blists Hill in 1832. The original blast furnaces at Blists Hill, Madeley Additional furnaces were added in 1840 and 1844, making a total of three, and the site remained active in the production of pig iron until 1912 when the ironworks ceased production, following the blowing in of two of the furnaces. The furnace settings and blowing houses are now preserved, but unrestored, as part of the Blists Hill Victorian Town, one of the Ironbridge Gorge Museums.

It is an omnivore and one of the most common indigenous species of rat on the continent, found in many heathland areas of Victoria and New South Wales.  Taxonomy  The description of the species by G. R. Waterhouse was published in the second part of the series Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle, edited by Charles Darwin. The species was assigned to the genus Mus, a once broader classification, and later placed with the genus Rattus. The collection of the type specimen was made when HMS Beagle was anchored at King George Sound, a port at the southwest of the continent. The capture was noted by Darwin as \\"caught in a trap baited with cheese, amongst the bushes ‚Ä¶\\". The type locality has been determined as Little Grove, Western Australia, south of Mount Melville in the city of Albany. The population is regarded as the fuscipes species group, as the species has received various treatments of subspecies. Four subspecies are recognised, each occurring in different regions or habitat, these are * Rattus fuscipes assimilis, common in the coastal region of the south and east of continent, Rockhampton, Queensland to Timboon in Victoria * Rattus fuscipes coracius, north-east Queensland, Cooktown and Townsville, in rainforest at low or high altitudes * Rattus fuscipes fuscipes, the nominate found in south-west Australia extends from Jurien Bay to Israelite Bay * Rattus fuscipes greyii, southern subspecies found from Eyre Peninsula to west of Portland in Victoria The subspecies R. fuscipes coracius was once supposed to share a closer ancestry with the Cape York species Rattus leucopus, which share a distribution range, although later evidence has not supported this morphological similarity.  Description  While there are not many characteristics that readily distinguish the bush rat from other Rattus species, it is characterised by having small tympanic bullae and a straight incisive foramen. Adult bush rats are smaller than the Australian swamp rat (Rattus lutreolus) and in addition, the bush rat's foot pads are a pink colour, whereas the swamp rat's foot pads are dark brown. The hair at the foot is short and pale in colour, subspecies Rattus fuscipes coracius is notably darker. The feet are pentadactyl and all digits are clawed. The tail is a pink shade of brown, almost free of hair, with scales that overlap and give an obvious ringed appearance. The bush rat exhibits sexual dimorphism: the males are larger than the females in the species. Their prominent eyes are large, and this distinguishes them from the narrower snouted Cape York species Rattus leucopus where their range overlaps. The species varies greatly in coloration and size. The length of the head and body combined is from , the tail is ; these measurements are approximately the same in the individuals. The ventral side of the pelage is a light grey or cream colour, which grades with the rufous flank and darker brown of the upper-side; the overall colour is a greyish or reddish brown. The length of the hind foot is and the ear . The average weight, for a range of , is . The number of teats is variable in the regional populations, the females bears one pair of pectoral teats and four at the inguinal region, except in the north of Queensland where the pectoral teats are absent. Distribution and habitat The bush rat is found primarily in the coastal regions of south and eastern Australia. While it is mainly found in the lowlands, the species is also found at higher altitudes in the Australian Alps. The coastal distribution extends to some offshore islands, including Kangaroo Island. The range of the southwestern subspecies R. fuscipes fuscipes is through sclerophyll forest of a high rainfall region. Along the southern coast the subspecies R. fuscipes greyii inhabits arid habitat, while subspecies assimilis is found from Victoria to Queensland. The habitat of R. fuscipes is terrestrial and favour wetter areas with dense undergrowth. The species constructs a shallow burrow that leads down into a nest chamber lined with grass and other vegetation. Threats Some of the biggest threats to the bush rat include red foxes and feral cats, both introduced species. Evidence suggests that the incidence of fire can increase predation of bush rats due to the removal of undergrowth in which they are usually able to hide. Diet The bush rat doesn't show much overlap in diet with other local rodent species. In the summer it consumes primarily fruit, arthropods, and seeds, but in the winter its main source of food is from a particular cyperaceous species. When found in the forest it consumes primarily fungi and various fibrous plant material. Bush rats have been observed feeding on nectar without damaging the blossoms, thus likely aiding in pollination. Behaviour Illustration accompanying the first description The bush rat is strictly nocturnal and is active year-round. Adults seem to be nomadic, but will rarely leave the forest floor. The species is primarily herbivorous, consuming fungi and plant tissue, but includes arthropods in their diet. It is also the host to more parasites than any other Australian rodent. They exhibit stereotypically normal behaviour when approaching an intruder; boxing, threat-posture, clash, approach. The bush rat is prey to some local predators, including dingoes, foxes, birds of prey and reptiles. Bush rats tend to avoid areas impacted by humans, and populations tend to decline when anthropogenic influences in a region increase. Breeding behavior The bush rat begins breeding around November and has litter sizes ranging usually between 4‚Äì5. The majority of individuals do not live to a second breeding cycle due to their short life span. The gestation period of the bush rat varies between 22 and 24 days. The \\"nursery\\" of the bush rat is its burrow. The nursing period lasts for about the first 20‚Äì25 days of life.

Although Vishtaspa is not epigraphically attested, he is ‚Äì like Zoroaster also ‚Äì traditionally assumed to have been a historical figure, and - again, like Zoroaster - that figure is obscured by accretions from legend and myth. In Zoroastrian tradition, which builds on allusions found in the Avesta, Vishtaspa is a righteous king who helped propagate and defend the faith. In the non- Zoroastrian Sistan cycle texts, Vishtaspa is a loathsome ruler of Kayanian dynasty who intentionally sends his eldest son to a certain death. In Greco- Roman literature, Zoroaster's patron was the pseudo-anonymous author of a set of prophecies written under his name.  In scripture  Vishtaspa is referred to in the Gathas, the oldest texts of Zoroastrianism which were considered to have been composed by Zoroaster himself. In these hymns, the poet speaks of Vishtaspa as his ally (Yasna 46. 14), follower of the path of Vohu Manah (Y. 51. 16), and committed to spreading the prophet's message (Y. 51. 16, 46. 15, 53. 2). In Yasna 28. 1‚Äì28. 7, Zoroaster appeals to Mazda for several boons, including the power to vanquish their foes for Vishtaspa and himself. Considered collectively, the Gathas celebrate Vishtaspa as the \\"patron of Zoroaster and the establisher of the first Zoroastrian community. \\". The Gathic allusions recur in the Yashts of the Younger Avesta. The appeal to Mazda for a boon reappears in Yasht 5. 98, where the boon is asked for the Haugvan and Naotara families, and in which Vishtaspa is said to be a member of the latter. Later in the same hymn, Zoroaster is described as appealing to Mazda to \\"bring Vishtaspa, son of Aurvataspa, to think according to Daena (Religion), to speak according to the Religion, to act according to the Religion.\\" (Yt. 5. 104‚Äì105). In Yasht 9. 25‚Äì26, the last part of which is an adaptation of the Gathic Yasna 49. 7, the prophet makes the same appeal with regard to Hutaosa, wife of Vishtaspa. In Yasht 9. 130, Vishtaspa himself appeals for the ability to drive off the attacks of the daeva-worshipping Arejat.aspa and other members of drujvant Hyaona family. Similarly in Yasht 5. 109, Vishtaspa pleads for strength that he may \\"crush Tathryavant of the bad religion, the daeva-worshipper Peshana, and the wicked Arejat.aspa.\\". Elsewhere (Yt. 5. 112‚Äì113), Vishtaspa also pleads for strength on behalf of Zairivairi (Pahl. Zarƒìr), who in later tradition is said to be Vishtaspa's younger brother. The allusions to conflicts (perhaps battles, see below) are again obliquely referred to in Yasht 13. 99‚Äì100, in which the fravashis of Zoroaster and Vishtaspa are described as victorious combatants for Asha, and the rescuers and furtherers of the religion. This description is repeated in Yasht 19. 84‚Äì87, where Zoroaster, Vishtaspa and Vishtaspa's ancestors are additionally said to possess khvarenah.. While the chief hero of the conflicts is said to be Vishtaspa's son, Spentodhata, (Yt. 13. 103) in Yasht 13. 100, Vishtaspa is proclaimed to have set his adopted faith \\"in the place of honor\\" amongst peoples... Passages in the Frawardin Yasht (Yt. 13. 99‚Äì103) and elsewhere have enabled commentators to infer family connections between Vishtaspa and several other figures named in the Avesta.cf. . The summaries of several lost Avestan texts (Wishtasp sast nask, Spand nask, Chihrdad nask, and Varshtmansar nask), as reported in the Denkard (respectively 8. 11, 8. 13, 8. 14, and 9. 33. 5), suggest that there once existed a detailed \\"history\\" of Vishtaspa and his ancestors in scripture.. The Yasht 13 mentions Zairiuuairi, Pi≈°√≠ ≈°iiaoŒ∏na (Vishtaspa's eschatological son Pi≈°i≈°≈çtan), Sp…ô·πát≈çŒ¥ƒÅta (SpandyƒÅd), Bastauuairi (Bastwar), Kauuarazman, Fra≈°ao≈°tra and JƒÅmƒÅspa (the Huu≈çguua brothers in the Gathas), all of whom are featured in the Pahlavi narrative about the war between Vishtaspa and ArzƒÅsp (ArjƒÅsp, king of the Xiiaonas). In Yasht 9.31, Vishtaspa prays to DruuƒÅspƒÅ that he may successfully fight and kill various opponents and, apparently, turn HumaiiƒÅ and Var…ôŒ¥akanƒÅ away from the lands of the Xiiaonas. In Yasna 12, the Zarathustra, Vishtaspa, Fra≈°ao≈°tra and JƒÅmƒÅspa, and the three Sao≈°iia·πáts, Zarathustra‚Äôs eschatological sons, and in Yasna 23.2 and 26.5, the fravashi of Gaiia Mar…ôtƒÅn, Zarathustra, Vishtaspa, and Isa·πØ.vƒÅstra (another of Zarathustra‚Äôs eschatological sons) are listed as the principal fighters for Asha. The meaning of Vishtaspa's name is uncertain. Interpretations include \\"'he whose horses have (or horse has) come in ready (for riding, etc.)'\\";. \\"'he who has trained horses'\\";. and \\"'whose horses are released (for the race)'\\"..For a review of older (early 20th century) interpretations, see . It agrees with the description from Yasht 5.132 in which was a prototypical winner of the chariot race.  In tradition and folklore = In Zoroastrian tradition  In the Gathas, Vishtaspa is repeatedly (Y. 46. 14, 51. 16, 53. 2) referred to as a kavi, which is etymologically a term for a mantic seer, or poet-priest, and in Yasna 28. 11 is also used of Zoroaster's enemies.. In the Younger Avesta the term is also applied to wise men generally, to include Vishtaspa and his ancestors. In tradition however, the kavis are kings, \\"evidently because Vƒ´≈°tƒÅspa and his forebears, the 'kavis' par excellence, were princely rulers. Presumably the gift of prophecy, of mantic poetry, was hereditary in their family. \\" Both scripture and tradition refer to Vishtaspa's ancestors but do not mention Vishtaspa's successors; Vishtaspa was apparently the last of his line, and the last of the kavis. In Zoroastrian apocalyptic chronology, the dynasties of the world are divided into seven ages, each named after a metal. According to this chronology (Zand-i Wahman yasn 2. 16, Dabistan 140), Vishtaspa (in Zoroastrian Middle Persian Wishtasp) ascent to the throne ended the reign of silver, and his reign was over the age of gold.. In tradition, the works of Zoroaster were said to have been kept in a royal library that was then destroyed by Alexander the Great. In Denkard 3. 420, it is Vishtaspa who is said to have been the king who had those texts made and placed in the royal library. The Yasht's allusions to conflicts are amplified in the 9th‚Äì11th century books of Zoroastrian tradition, where the conflicts are portrayed as outright battles of the faith. So for example the surviving fragments of a fragmentary text that celebrates the deeds of Zairivairi, Vishtaspa's brother and captain of his forces against Arejat.aspa, chief of the Hyonas. According to that text (Ayadgar i Zareran, 10‚Äì11), upon hearing of Vishtaspa's conversion, Arejat.aspa sent messengers to demand that Vishtaspa \\"abandon 'the pure Mazda- worshipping religion which he had received from Ohrmazd', and should become once more 'of the same religion'\\" as himself. The battle that following Vishtaspa's refusal left Vishtaspa victorious. The conversion of Vishtaspa is likewise a theme of the 9th‚Äì11th century books, and these legends remain the \\"best known and most current\\" among Zoroastrians today..cf. . According to this tradition, when Zoroaster arrived at Vishtaspa's court, the prophet was \\"met with hostility from the kayags and karabs (kavis and karapans), with whom he disputed at a great assembly‚Äìa tradition which may well be based on reality, for [Vishtaspa] must have had his own priests and seers, who would hardly have welcomed a new prophet claiming divine authority. \\". The tradition goes on to relate that Zoroaster triumphed after three days of debate, only to be maligned by his enemies to Vishtaspa, who then had the prophet imprisoned. But, from prison, Zoroaster cured one of Vishtaspa's favourite horses (which had suddenly become paralyzed), for which the prophet then gained Vishtaspa's support and admiration. The tale is obliquely referred to in the Anthology of Zadspram (24. 6), which seems to presume that the reader already knows it,. and it is summarized in the Denkard (7. 4. 64‚Äì86), and ‚Äì as \\"workings of popular fancy\\" ‚Äì described in detail in the later Book of Zoroaster (942‚Äì1094). In the myth, Zoroaster cures each of the horse's four legs in exchange for four concessions: first, that Vishtaspa himself accept Zoroaster's message; secondly, that Vishtaspa's son Spentodata (MP: Esfandiar) do the same; third, that Vishtaspa's wife Hutaosa (MP: Hutos) also convert; and finally that the men who maligned Zoroaster be put to death. When these four wishes are granted, the horse stands up rejuvenated. Vishtaspa, having accepted the faith from Zoroaster, then asks for four favours in return:. first, that he, Vishtaspa, should know his place in the next world; secondly, that he should become invulnerable; third, that he should know the future; and fourth that his body should not leave his soul until the resurrection. Zoroaster replies that these are too great to all be given to one man, and that he should choose one. Vishtaspa agrees, and chooses the first. Zoroaster then gives him consecrated wine to drink, which puts Vishtaspa in a trance in which he has an epiphany; he sees his spirit ascend to heaven where it beholds the glories of God. Vishtaspa's conversion is traditionally said to have taken place during Zoroaster's forty-second year, \\"a figure undoubtedly reached by later calculation\\". In medieval Zoroastrian chronology, Vishtaspa is identified as a grandfather of \\"Ardashir\\", i.e. the 5th century BCE Artaxerxes I (or II).cf. . This myth is tied to the Sassanid (early 3rd‚Äìearly 7th century) claim of descent from Artaxerxes, and the claim of relationship to the Kayanids, that is, with Vishtaspa and his ancestors. The full adoption of Kayanid names, titles and myths from the Avesta by the Sassanids was a \\"main component of [Sassanid] ideology. \\". The association of Artaxerxes with the Kayanids occurred through the identification of Artaxerxes II's title ('Mnemon' in Greek) with the name of Vishtaspa's legendary grandson and successor, Wahman: both are theophorics of Avestan Vohu Manah \\"Good Mind(ed)\\"; Middle Persian 'Wahman' is a contraction of the Avestan name, while Greek 'Mnemon' is a calque of it. The Sassanid association of their dynasty with Vishtaspa's is a development dated to the end of the 4th century, and which \\"arose to some extent because this was when the Sasanians conquered Balkh, the birthplace of Vishtasp and the 'holy land' of Zoroastrianism. \\". As was also the case for the fourth century Roman identification of Zoroaster's patron with the late-6th century BCE father of Darius I (see below) ‚Äì the identification of Vishtaspa as a grandfather of \\"Ardashir\\" (Artaxerxes I/II) was once perceived to substantiate the \\"traditional date\\" of Zoroaster, which places the prophet in the 6th century BCE. The traditional descriptions of Vishtaspa's ancestors as having chariots (a description that puts them fully in the Bronze Age) also contribute to the academic debate on the dating of Zoroaster; for a summary of the role of Vishtaspa's ancestors in this issue, see .Additionally, and within the framework of the arguments that Cyrus the Great was a Zoroastrian, speculates that the reason why \\"[Cyrus'] name is never mentioned in the Pahlavi books or in the later royal genealogies\\" was because tradition identified Cyrus with Vishtaspa, with the use of Vishtaspa's name instead of Cyrus', thus leading to \\"complete oblivion for Cyrus in Zoroastrian tradition\\".  In the Sistan heroic cycle  Shahnama of Shah Tahmasp. The illustration, dated ca. 1520 and now in the Aga Khan Museum, Toronto (accession # AKM 00163), is one of six miniatures in the Houghton manuscript that are attributed to Mirza Ali, the early 16th-century court artist of the Moghuls. Non-Zoroastrian literature in New Persian and Arabic uniformly reflects the regular development of Middle Persian wi- into gu-, with Middle Persian Wishtasp thus becoming Goshtasb in Sistan national history (Tarikh-e Sistan), Goshtasp in Firdausi's Book of Kings (Shahnameh), Goshtasf in the Mojmal al-tawarikh, Beshtashb by Al-Tabari. In several respects, for instance in Goshtasb's/Goshtasf's (etc) mythological genealogy, the Sistan cycle texts continue the Zoroastrian tradition. So, for example, Goshtasp is identified as a member of the Kayanian dynasty, is the son of Lohrasp/Lohrasb (etc), is the brother of Zareh/Zarer (etc), is the father of Esfandiar/Isfandiar (etc) and Bashutan/Beshotan (etc), and so on. However, in the Sistan legends, Goshtasb/Goshtasf (etc.) is an abominable figure, altogether unlike the hero of Zoroastrian tradition. The reason for this discrepancy is unknown. According to the Sistan tradition, Goshtasb demands the throne from his father Lohrasp, but storms off to India (\\"Hind\\") when the king declines. Goshtasb's brother Zareh (Zareh/Zarer etc., Avestan Zairivairi) is sent to fetch him, but Goshtasb flees to \\"Rome\\" where he marries Katayoun (Katayun/Katayoun etc), the daughter of the 'qaysar'. Goshtasb subsequently becomes a military commander for the Roman emperor, and encourages the emperor to demand tribute from Iran. Again Zareh is sent to fetch Goshtasb, who is then promised the throne, and is thus persuaded to return. Back in Sistan, Goshtasb imprisons his own son Esfandiar (Esfandiar/Isfandiar etc., Avestan Spentodata), but then has to seek Esfandiar's help in defeating Arjasp (Avestan Aurvataspa) who is threatening Balkh. Goshtasb promises Esfandiar the throne in return for his help, but when Esfandiar is successful, his father stalls and instead sends him off on another mission to suppress a rebellion in Turan. Esfandiar is again successful, and upon his return Goshtasb hedges once again and ‚Äì aware of a prediction that foretells the death of Esfandiar at the hand of Rostam ‚Äì sends him off on a mission in which Esfandiar is destined to die. In the Shahnameh, the nobles upbraid Goshtasb as a disgrace to the throne; his daughters denounce him as a heinous criminal; and his younger son Bashutan (Avestan Peshotanu) condemns him as a wanton destroyer of Iran. As in Zoroastrian tradition, in the Sistan cycle texts Goshtasp is succeeded by Esfandiar's son, Bahman (< MP Wahman). The identification of Bahman with 'Ardashir' (see above) reappears in the Sistan cycle texts as well.  In Greek and Roman thought  The name \\"Visthaspa\\" is \\"Hystaspes\\" in the Greek and Latin texts of the Hellenistic era. Besides referring to historically attested persons named Vishtaspa, it was also applied to Zoroaster's patron, who the Greeks and Romans imagined to be a sage of great antiquity, and the putative author of a set of prophecies written under his name.For the primary sources, see . Although the works attributed to Pseudo-Hystaspes draw on real Zoroastrian sources, the Greek and Roman portraits of his person are just as fanciful as those of the other two les Mages hell√©nis√©s, Pseudo-Zoroaster and Pseudo-Ostanes.. While Pseudo-Zoroaster was identified as the \\"inventor\\" of astrology, and Pseudo-Ostanes was imagined to be a master sorcerer, Pseudo- Hystaspes seems to have been stereotyped as an apocalyptic prophet. None of the works attributed to him are still extant, but quotations and references have survived in the works of others, especially in those of two early Christian writers ‚Äì Justin Martyr (ca. 100 CE) in Samaria and the mid-3rd century Lactantius in North Africa ‚Äì who drew on them by way of confirmation that what themselves held to be revealed truth had already been uttered.. Only one of these pseudepigraphic works ‚Äì referred to as the Book of Hystaspes or the Oracles of Hystaspes or just Hystaspes ‚Äì is known by name. This work (or set of works) of the first century BCE is referred to by Lactantius, Justin Martyr, Clement of Alexandria, Lydus, and Aristokritos, all of whom describe it as foretelling the downfall of the Roman empire, the return of rule to the east, and of the coming of the saviour.. Lactantius provides a detailed summary of the Oracles of Hystaspes in his Divinae Institutiones (Book VII, from the end of chapter 15 through chapter 19). It begins with Hystaspes awaking from a dream, and needing to have it interpreted for him. This is duly accomplished by a young boy, \\"here representing, according to convention, the openness of youth and innocent to divine visitations. \\". As interpreted by the boy, the dream \\"predicts\\" the iniquity of the last age, and the impending destruction of the wicked by fire. The divine fire will burn both the righteous and the wicked, but only the wicked will be hurt and neither will be destroyed. During the eschatological inferno, the \\"followers of truth\\" will separate themselves from the wicked and ascend a mountain. The evil king who dominates the world will be angered on hearing this, and he will resolve to encircle the mountain with his army. The righteous implore to \\"Jupiter\\", who sends them a saviour, who will descend from heaven accompanied by angels and before him a flaming sword. Hystaspes \\"prophesies\\" that the wicked king (i.e. the Roman emperor) will survive the destruction of his armies, but will lose power. It was \\"presumably\\". the prophecy of the destruction of a victorious power (i.e. the Roman empire) that caused the work to be proscribed by Rome; according to Justin Martyr (Apologia, I. 44. 12), reading the work was punishable by death..cf. . Unlike the works attributed to the other two les Mages hell√©nis√©s, the Oracles of Hystaspes was apparently based on the genuine Zoroastrian myths, and \\"the argument for ultimate magian composition is a strong one. [...] As prophecies they have a political context, a function, and a focus which radically distinguish them from the philosophical and encyclopedic wisdom of the other pseudepigrapha. \\". Although \\"[p]rophecies of woes and iniquities in the last age are alien to orthodox Zoroastrianism\\", there was probably a growth of Zoroastrian literature in the late fourth-early third centuries denouncing the evils of the Hellenistic age, and offering hope of the coming kingdom of Ahura Mazda.. The Greco-Roman obsession with Zoroaster as the \\"inventor\\" of astrology also influenced the image of Hystaspes. So for example in Lydus' On the months (de Mensibus II. 4), which credits \\"the Chaldeans in the circle of Zoroaster and Hystaspes and the Egyptians\\" for the creation of the seven-day week after the number of planets.cf. . The fourth century Ammianus Marcellinus (xxiii. 6. 32) identifies Zoroaster's patron with another Vishtaspa, better known as Hystaspes in English, the (late-6th century BCE) father of Darius I. The sixth century Agathias was more ambivalent, observing that it wasn't clear to him whether the name of Zoroaster's patron referred to the father of Darius or to another Hystaspes (ii. 24). As with the medieval Zoroastrian chronology that identifies Vishtaspa with \\"Ardashir\\" (see above), Ammianus' identification was once considered to substantiate the \\"traditional date\\" of Zoroaster.

It uses measures of possibility and necessity between 0 and 1, ranging from impossible to possible and unnecessary to necessary, respectively. Professor Lotfi Zadeh first introduced possibility theory in 1978 as an extension of his theory of fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic. Didier Dubois and Henri Prade further contributed to its development. Earlier in the 1950s, economist G. L. S. Shackle proposed the min/max algebra to describe degrees of potential surprise. Formalization of possibility For simplicity, assume that the universe of discourse Œ© is a finite set. A possibility measure is a function \\\\operatorname{pos} from 2^\\\\Omega to [0, 1] such that: :Axiom 1: \\\\operatorname{pos}(\\\\varnothing) = 0 :Axiom 2: \\\\operatorname{pos}(\\\\Omega) = 1 :Axiom 3: \\\\operatorname{pos}(U \\\\cup V) = \\\\max \\\\left( \\\\operatorname{pos}(U), \\\\operatorname{pos}(V) \\\\right) for any disjoint subsets U and V. It follows that, like probability, the possibility measure is determined by its behavior on singletons: :\\\\operatorname{pos}(U) = \\\\max_{\\\\omega \\\\in U} \\\\operatorname{pos}({\\\\omega}) provided that U is finite or countably infinite. Axiom 1 can be interpreted as the assumption that Œ© is an exhaustive description of future states of the world, because it means that no belief weight is given to elements outside Œ©. Axiom 2 could be interpreted as the assumption that the evidence from which \\\\operatorname{pos} was constructed is free of any contradiction. Technically, it implies that there is at least one element in Œ© with possibility 1. Axiom 3 corresponds to the additivity axiom in probabilities. However there is an important practical difference. Possibility theory is computationally more convenient because Axioms 1‚Äì3 imply that: :\\\\operatorname{pos}(U \\\\cup V) = \\\\max \\\\left( \\\\operatorname{pos}(U), \\\\operatorname{pos}(V) \\\\right) for any subsets U and V. Because one can know the possibility of the union from the possibility of each component, it can be said that possibility is compositional with respect to the union operator. Note however that it is not compositional with respect to the intersection operator. Generally: :\\\\operatorname{pos}(U \\\\cap V) \\\\leq \\\\min \\\\left( \\\\operatorname{pos}(U), \\\\operatorname{pos}(V) \\\\right) \\\\leq \\\\max \\\\left( \\\\operatorname{pos}(U), \\\\operatorname{pos}(V) \\\\right). When Œ© is not finite, Axiom 3 can be replaced by: :For all index sets I, if the subsets U_{i,\\\\, i \\\\in I} are pairwise disjoint, \\\\operatorname{pos}\\\\left(\\\\cup_{i \\\\in I} U_i\\\\right) = \\\\sup_{i \\\\in I}\\\\operatorname{pos}(U_i). Necessity Whereas probability theory uses a single number, the probability, to describe how likely an event is to occur, possibility theory uses two concepts, the possibility and the necessity of the event. For any set U, the necessity measure is defined by :\\\\operatorname{nec}(U) = 1 - \\\\operatorname{pos}(\\\\overline U) In the above formula, \\\\overline U denotes the complement of U, that is the elements of \\\\Omega that do not belong to U. It is straightforward to show that: :\\\\operatorname{nec}(U) \\\\leq \\\\operatorname{pos}(U) for any U and that: :\\\\operatorname{nec}(U \\\\cap V) = \\\\min ( \\\\operatorname{nec}(U), \\\\operatorname{nec}(V)) Note that contrary to probability theory, possibility is not self-dual. That is, for any event U, we only have the inequality: :\\\\operatorname{pos}(U) + \\\\operatorname{pos}(\\\\overline U) \\\\geq 1 However, the following duality rule holds: :For any event U, either \\\\operatorname{pos}(U) = 1, or \\\\operatorname{nec}(U) = 0 Accordingly, beliefs about an event can be represented by a number and a bit. Interpretation There are four cases that can be interpreted as follows: \\\\operatorname{nec}(U) = 1 means that U is necessary. U is certainly true. It implies that \\\\operatorname{pos}(U) = 1. \\\\operatorname{pos}(U) = 0 means that U is impossible. U is certainly false. It implies that \\\\operatorname{nec}(U) = 0. \\\\operatorname{pos}(U) = 1 means that U is possible. I would not be surprised at all if U occurs. It leaves \\\\operatorname{nec}(U) unconstrained. \\\\operatorname{nec}(U) = 0 means that U is unnecessary. I would not be surprised at all if U does not occur. It leaves \\\\operatorname{pos}(U) unconstrained. The intersection of the last two cases is \\\\operatorname{nec}(U) = 0 and \\\\operatorname{pos}(U) = 1 meaning that I believe nothing at all about U. Because it allows for indeterminacy like this, possibility theory relates to the graduation of a many-valued logic, such as intuitionistic logic, rather than the classical two-valued logic. Note that unlike possibility, fuzzy logic is compositional with respect to both the union and the intersection operator. The relationship with fuzzy theory can be explained with the following classical example. * Fuzzy logic: When a bottle is half full, it can be said that the level of truth of the proposition \\"The bottle is full\\" is 0.5. The word \\"full\\" is seen as a fuzzy predicate describing the amount of liquid in the bottle. * Possibility theory: There is one bottle, either completely full or totally empty. The proposition \\"the possibility level that the bottle is full is 0.5\\" describes a degree of belief. One way to interpret 0.5 in that proposition is to define its meaning as: I am ready to bet that it's empty as long as the odds are even (1:1) or better, and I would not bet at any rate that it's full. Possibility theory as an imprecise probability theory There is an extensive formal correspondence between probability and possibility theories, where the addition operator corresponds to the maximum operator. A possibility measure can be seen as a consonant plausibility measure in Dempster‚ÄìShafer theory of evidence. The operators of possibility theory can be seen as a hyper-cautious version of the operators of the transferable belief model, a modern development of the theory of evidence. Possibility can be seen as an upper probability: any possibility distribution defines a unique credal set set of admissible probability distributions by ::K = \\\\left{\\\\, p: \\\\forall S\\\\ p(S)\\\\leq \\\\operatorname{pos}(S)\\\\,\\\\right}. This allows one to study possibility theory using the tools of imprecise probabilities. Necessity logic We call generalized possibility every function satisfying Axiom 1 and Axiom 3. We call generalized necessity the dual of a generalized possibility. The generalized necessities are related with a very simple and interesting fuzzy logic we call necessity logic. In the deduction apparatus of necessity logic the logical axioms are the usual classical tautologies. Also, there is only a fuzzy inference rule extending the usual Modus Ponens. Such a rule says that if Œ± and Œ± ‚Üí Œ≤ are proved at degree Œª and Œº, respectively, then we can assert Œ≤ at degree min{Œª,Œº}. It is easy to see that the theories of such a logic are the generalized necessities and that the completely consistent theories coincide with the necessities (see for example Gerla 2001).

He had become famous years before by bringing to an end to the long Aceh War.  Early life and education  Joannes Benedictus van Heutsz was born on 3 February 1851 in Coevorden in the Netherlands. He was the second son of Joannes Franciscus van Heutsz and Maria Lucilla Kocken. Both his father and grandfather were artillery officers. F. G. P.

His family could not afford to send him to the Royal Military Academy in Breda, so he later went to the Instruction Battalion in Kampen from 1867 to 1872. Aceh War Lieutenant-General Van Heutsz in 1900 Following twenty-five years of protracted warfare, Van Heutsz was appointed as Military Governor of Aceh.Ibrahim (2001), p. 133 In consort with the Islamic scholar Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje, Van Heutsz succeeded in weakening the Acehnese resistance by exploiting tensions between the Acehnese aristocracy and the religious ulama. He also solicited the support of the Acehnese ruling classes while isolating the rebels from their rural bases. At the advice of an Acehnese noble, he also altered the tactics of the Royal Dutch East Indies Army by introducing small mobile forces which were successful against the guerrilla tactics of the Acehnese.Vickers (2005), p. 13 Van Heutsz commissioned Colonel Van Daalen with the challenge of breaking any remaining resistance. Van Daalen destroyed several villages, killing at least 2,900 Acehnese, among which were 1,150 women and children. Dutch losses numbered just 26, and Van Daalen was promoted. By today's standards, these actions would be considered war crimes. By 1903, Van Heutsz tactics had succeeded in convincing several secular Acehnese resistance leaders including Sultan Muhammad Daud, Tuanku Raja Keumala, Tuanku Mahmud and Teuku Panglima Polem Muda Perkasa to surrender to the colonial authorities. Having overcome the secular elements of the resistance, Aceh was declared by the Dutch to be officially pacified by 1903. Despite this, resistance from the ulama continued until 1913. Lieutenant General J.B. van Heutsz with his staff during the attack on Bat√®√´ Ili√´k, 12 March 1901 Attack on Bat√®√´ Ili√´k in 1901, by Jan Hoynck van Papendrecht Hendrikus Colijn, future Prime Minister of the Netherlands, was the adjutant of Van Heutsz. In the Netherlands at the time, Van Heutsz was considered a hero, named the 'Pacificator of Aceh' and was promoted to the position of Governor-General in 1904. His efforts boosted support for imperialism in Dutch society and government while weakening the position of anti-imperialists.  Return to Europe  Tomb of Joannes Benedictus van Heutsz at the Nieuwe Ooster Begraafplaats in Amsterdam Van Heutsz moved to Amsterdam in 1909. After his wife died in 1919, he moved to Bussum.

It is first attested in the book The Counting Out Rhymes of Children by Henry Carrington Bolton (1888), whose version was collected in West Chester, Pennsylvania. It is well known in various parts of the United States, Australia, Canada, United Kingdom and in New Zealand and has been called \\"the most common hand-clapping game in the English-speaking world\\". In the game, two children stand or sit opposite to each other, and clap hands in time to a rhyming song. The same song is also used as a jumprope rhyme,Gaunt, Games Black Girls Play, p. 68 although rarely so according to one source. Rhyme Various versions of the song exist; a common version goes; :Miss Mary Mack, Mack, Mack :All dressed in black, black, black :With silver buttons, buttons, buttons :All down her back, back, back. (or \\"Up and down her back back back\\") :She asked her mother, mother, mother :For 50 cents, cents, cents :To see the elephants, elephants, elephants :Who jumped the fence, fence, fence :They jumped so high, high, high :they reached the sky, sky, sky :And didn't (or never) come back, back, back :Till the 4th of July ly ly. :She asked her mother, mother, mother :For 50 cents more, more, more :To see the elephants, elephants, elephants They the floor floor floor :They jumped to the flow flow flow :they stubbed their toe toe toe :and that was the end end end :of the elephant show show show. An alternate version, sung in Canada, includes the words: :She could not read, read, read :She could not write, write, write :But she could smoke, smoke, smoke :Her father‚Äôs pipe, pipe, pipe. An alternate version, sung in the American South: :Mary Mack, :dressed in black, :silver buttons all down her back. :She combed her hair :and broke the comb :She's gonna get a whoopin' when her Momma comes home :Gonna get a whoopin' when her Momma comes home Clap A common version of the accompanying clap is as follows: *&: Arms across chest *4: Pat thighs *&: Clap hands *1: Clap right palms with partner *&: Clap left palms with partner *2: Clap both palms with partner Another version:Bernstein, Sara (1994). Hand Clap!, p.88-9. .

Early mentions of the part about the elephant do not include the part about Mary Mack. Merrimack The origin of the name Mary Mack is obscure, and various theories have been proposed. According to one theory, Mary Mack originally referred to the USS Merrimack, a United States warship of the mid-1800s named after the Merrimack River, that would have been black, with silvery rivets. This may suggest that the first verse refers to the Battle of Hampton Roads during the American Civil War.

It is viewed as an important part of the scientific method, especially in the physical sciences. Levels of formalism There are multiple levels of scientific formalism possible. At the lowest level, scientific formalism deals with the symbolic manner in which the information is presented. To achieve formalism in a scientific theory at this level, one starts with a well defined set of axioms, and from this follows a formal system. However, at a higher level, scientific formalism also involves consideration of the axioms themselves. These can be viewed as questions of ontology. For example, one can, at the lower level of formalism, define a property called 'existence'. However, at the higher level, the question of whether an electron exists in the same sense that a bacterium exists still needs to be resolved. Some actual formal theories on facts have been proposed. In modern physics The scientific climate of the twentieth century revived these questions. From about the time of Isaac Newton to that of James Clerk Maxwell they had been dormant, in the sense that the physical sciences could rely on the status of the real numbers as a description of the continuum, and an agnostic view of atoms and their structure. Quantum mechanics, the dominant physical theory after about 1925, was formulated in a way which raised questions of both types. In the Newtonian framework there was indeed a degree of comfort in the answers one could give. Consider for example the question of whether the Earth really goes round the Sun. In a frame of reference adapted to calculating the Earth's orbit, this is a mathematical but also tautological statement. Newtonian mechanics can answer the question, whether it is not equally the case that the Sun goes round the Earth, as it indeed appears to Earth-based astronomers. In Newton's theory there is a basic, fixed frame of reference that is inertial. The 'correct answer' is that the point of view of an observer in an inertial frame of reference is privileged: other observers see artifacts of their acceleration relative to an inertial frame (the inertial forces). Before Newton, Galileo would draw the consequences, from the Copernican heliocentric model. He was, however, constrained to call his work (in effect) scientific formalism, under the old 'description' saving the phenomena. To avoid going against authority, the elliptic orbits of the heliocentric model could be labelled as a more convenient device for calculations, rather than an actual description of reality. In general relativity, Newton's inertial frames are no longer privileged. In quantum mechanics, Paul Dirac argued that physical models were not there to provide semantic constructs allowing us to understand microscopic physics in language comparable to that we use on the familiar scale of everyday objects. His attitude, adopted by many theoretical physicists, is that a good model is judged by our capacity to use it to calculate physical quantities that can be tested experimentally. Dirac's view is close to what Bas van Fraassen calls constructive empiricism. Duhem A physicist who took the issues involved seriously was Pierre Duhem, writing at the beginning of the twentieth century. He wrote an extended analysis of the approach he saw as characteristically British, in requiring field theories of theoretical physics to have a mechanical-physical interpretation. That was an accurate characterisation of what Dirac (himself British) would later argue against. The national characteristics specified by Duhem do not need to be taken too seriously, since he also claimed that the use of abstract algebra, namely quaternions, was also characteristically British (as opposed to French or German); as if the use of classical analysis methods alone was important one way or the other. Duhem also wrote on saving the phenomena. In addition to the Copernican revolution debate of \\"saving the phenomena\\" (Greek: œÉ·ø¥Œ∂ŒµŒπŒΩ œÑ·Ω∞ œÜŒ±ŒπŒΩœåŒºŒµŒΩŒ±, sozein ta phainomenaAn ancient view (attributed to Plato by Simplicius of Cilicia) on hypotheses, theories and phaenomena, on what scientists, or more historically accurately (ancient) astronomers, are for, are supposed to do; see Wherein \\"The oldest extant text in which the expression \\"save the phenomena\\" is only of the first century A.D. namely Plutarch's On the Face in the Orb of the Moon\\", hence see also (in Greek) Plutarch, De faciae quae in orbe lunae apparet, 923a (or in English) at the Perseus Project)Cf. (excerpt).Cf. Andreas Osiander's Ad lectorem introduction to Copernicus's De revolutionibus orbium coelestium. versus offering explanationsPierre Duhem thinks \\"Kepler is, unquestionably, the strongest and most illustrious representative of that tradition,\\" i.e., the tradition of realism, that physical theories offer explanations in addition to just \\"saving the phenomena.\\" that inspired Duhem was Thomas Aquinas, who wrote, regarding eccentrics and epicycles, that > Reason may be employed in two ways to establish a point: firstly, for the > purpose of furnishing sufficient proof of some principle [...]. Reason is > employed in another way, not as furnishing a sufficient proof of a > principle, but as confirming an already established principle, by showing > the congruity of its results, as in astronomy the theory of eccentrics and > epicycles is considered as established, because thereby the sensible > appearances of the heavenly movements can be explained (possunt salvari > apparentia sensibilia); not, however, as if this proof were sufficient, > forasmuch as some other theory might explain them. [...]Summa Theologica, I > q. 32 a. 1 ad 2 The idea that a physical interpretation‚Äîin common language or classical ideas and physical entities, though of or examined in an ontological or quasi- ontological sense‚Äîof a phenomenon in physics is not an ultimate or necessary condition for its understanding or validity, also appears in modern structural realist views on science. Bellarmine Robert Bellarmine wrote to heliocentrist Paolo Antonio Foscarini:Bellarmine's 12 April 1615 letter to Galileo, translated in > Nor is it the same to demonstrate that by assuming the sun to be at the > center and the earth in heaven one can save the appearances, and to > demonstrate that in truth the sun is at the center and the earth in heaven; > for I believe the first demonstration may be available, but I have very > great doubts about the second‚Ä¶ Modern physicist Pierre Duhem \\"suggests that in one respect, at least, Bellarmine had shown himself a better scientist than Galileo by disallowing the possibility of a 'strict proof of the earth's motion,' on the grounds that an astronomical theory merely 'saves the appearances' without necessarily revealing what 'really happens.'\\"*  See also  *Andreas Osiander *Scientific community metaphor Notes Category:Formalism (deductive) Category:Metatheory of science Category:Scientific method ","title":"Scientific formalism"},{"id":"1504493","text":"John Miley (1813-1895) was an American Christian theologian in the Methodist tradition who was one of the major Methodist theological voices of the 19th century.

The town is spread over an area of 27.94 km . It lies on the banks of the river pamba and river manimala, and is a land-locked region surrounded by irrigating streams and rivers. Thiruvalla is regarded as the \\"Land of Non resident Indians \\". Due to the increasing migration of young people, it is now battling a decline in its population. The age group above 60 makes up almost 54% of the town's population. Also due to declining fertility levels in Thiruvalla (almost 0.7), many schools are being forced to shut down due to the lack of children. Thiruvalla is also famous for the dance of Kathakali, which is hosted in the Sreevallabha temple almost every day in a year. Demographics The town spans a geographic area of 27.94 km2 with a population of 52,883 as of 2011, a decline from the 57,800 recorded in the previous census. Males constitute 48% of the population and females 52%. In Thiruvalla, 5% of the population is under 6 years of age. Thiruvalla has a large Non-Resident Indian Community. The town is now battling an aging population above the age of 65. Its GDP per capita is $10,455.  Etymology  Old tradition tells that the name Thiruvalla comes from the word \\"Valla Vaay\\", named after the river Manimala which was known as VallayƒÅr in ancient times. Before roads were developed, Thiruvalla village developed at the mouth of river Vallayar, connected far and near places through waterways, hence known as Valla vƒÅi(vƒÅy in old Malayalam means mouth of river). Later the Thamizh Prefix 'Thiru (means holy /revered) attached to it and became Thiruvalla. At the time of intermigration to south India it became one of the 64 Brahmin settlements. They correlated the name to \\"Sree Vallabha\\" which means Husband of Lakshmi Devi. Sree Vallabha is the presiding deity of the Thiruvalla Temple and argues that shreevallabha Puram (Land of Vallabhan) became Thiruvalla. Thiruvalla as per the Sanskrit work \\"‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä‡§µ‡§≤‡•ç‡§≤‡§≠ ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡•á‡§§‡•ç‡§∞ ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§π‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§Æ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Æ‡•ç\\" (‡¥∂‡µç‡¥∞‡µÄ‡¥µ‡¥≤‡µç‡¥≤‡¥≠ ‡¥ï‡µç‡¥∑‡µá‡¥§‡µç‡¥∞ ‡¥Æ‡¥æ‡¥π‡¥æ‡¥§‡µç‡¥Æ‡µç‡¥Ø‡¥Ç) (≈õrƒ´vallabha k·π£ƒìtra mƒÅhƒÅtmya·πÅ) is \\"‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä‡§µ‡§≤‡•ç‡§≤‡§≠‡§™‡•Å‡§∞‡§Æ‡•ç\\" (‡¥∂‡µç‡¥∞‡µÄ‡¥µ‡¥≤‡µç‡¥≤‡¥≠‡¥™‡µÅ‡¥∞‡¥Ç)(≈õrƒ´vallabhapura·πÅ). The work is said to be of 10th-century CE.  Geography and Climate  Thiruvalla lies at an altitude of 9 m above sea level, on the basin of the rivers Pamba and Manimala. Thiruvalla is dotted with several natural canal streams (called \\"thodu\\" in Malayalam) like Chanthathodu, Manippuzha, Mullelithodu, and several others. The city area has riverine alluvial soil, and eastern parts have a laterite loam kind of soil classified under \\"Southern Midlands\\" agro-ecological zone, while the western suburbs like Niranam have a more sandy type of soil that resembles beaches. (Kuttanad agro-ecological zone) The reason for this is believed to be the older status of Niranam as a port, before reclamation of Kuttanad from sea occurred. The Upper Kuttanad region in Thiruvalla has the \\"Karappadam\\" type of soil, which is clay loam in texture, has high organic matter, and is situated in areas about 1‚Äì2 m above sea level. The climate of Thiruvalla is classified as tropical. There is significant rainfall in most months of the year. The short dry season has little effect on the overall climate. The K√∂ppen-Geiger climate classification is Am. The temperature here averages 27.3 ¬∞C. In a year, the average rainfall is 3298 mm. At an average temperature of 29.0 ¬∞C, April is the hottest month of the year. July has the lowest average temperature of the year. It is 26.4 ¬∞C. Between the driest and wettest months, the difference in precipitation is 574 mm. Precipitation is the lowest in January, with an average of 22 mm. With an average of 596 mm, the most precipitation falls in June. Due to proximity to the equator, Thiruvalla has very little variation in average temperature. During the year, the average temperatures vary by 2.6 ¬∞C. Thiruvalla is best known for its pleasant and welcoming weather. South West Monsoon winds bring heavy showers to Thiruvalla in the months of August for a couple of months. Thiruvalla has a distinctively tropical, yet pleasing climate. The best time to visit this historical town is after the rains as the healthy showers of monsoon leave this place lush green and pristine. History This article is primarily about the history of the settlements in areas of the present city around the temple, known historically as Thiruvalla. For the history of the places in Thiruvalla, also refer History of Niranam, History of Koipuram, History of Kumbanad, History of Kavumbhagom.  Ancient period  There is plenty of evidence to suggest that the area had been inhabited since 500 BCE, although an organized settlement was only founded around 800 CE. The present-day areas of Niranam, and Kadapra on the western part of Thiruvalla were submerged under the sea before then. It is one of the 64 ancient brahmana graamams. Stone axes have been reported from Thiruvalla, belonging to Neolithic Age.\\"Indus Civilisation and Tamil Language ‚Äì Part 03\\", page 34. http://210.212.62.26/pdf_files/books/Indus%20civilization%20and%20tamil%20language%20part%20003.pdf Thiruvalla has many Neolithic remains and got civilized earlier. The Aryan culture presented Thiruvalla as one of the 64 Brahmin settlements of Kerala, and one of the important too. Ptolemy mentions the Baris river, the present \\"Pamba\\" river. Thiruvalla was also an important commercial centre with the Niranam port in olden days, which is described by Pliny as \\"Nelcynda\\". At this light, the \\"Bacare\\" could have been modern \\"Purakkad\\". The fact that modern western Thiruvalla contains the coastal kind of sand, and several seashells in the soil despite being landlocked proves that prior to the reclamation of Kuttanad from sea, Niranam and the whole western Thiruvalla could have been a coastal area.  The Growth to Feudalism  Up to the beginning of the 10th century CE, Ays were the dominant powers in Kerala. The Ay kings ruled from Thiruvalla in the North to Nagercoil in the South. Ptolemy mentions this as from Baris (Pamba River) to Cape Comorin \\"Aioi\\" (Kanyakumari). By 12th century, we get the picture from the Thiruvalla copper plates, which are voluminous records that centre around the social life around the temple. The society The Thiruvalla temple had a large Vedic learning school (actually comparable to modern university) (\\"Thiruvalla salai\\"), which was one of the foremost learning centres in Kerala. The Thiruvalla salai was one of the richest among the Vedic schools of Kerala, and according to the copper plates, the pupils of the school were fed with 350 nazhis of paddy every day, which shows the vastness of its student population. Thiruvalla held a very eminent position among the spiritual and educational centres in ancient times. The Sri Vallabha Temple was one of the wealthiest temples of ancient Kerala, as is evident from the inscriptions in the plates. The part of the temple land required to 'feed the Brahmins' required 2.1 million litres of rice seeds, and for the \\"maintenance of the eternal lamps\\" required more than 340,000 litres of paddy seed capacity. Due to the length, the antiquity and the nature of the language, Thiruvalla copper plates form the \\"First book in Malayalam\\", according to Prof. Elamkulam.  Medieval period  Thiruvalla copper plates The rulers of Thiruvalla now belonged to the Thekkumkoor Dynasty, which had one of its headquarters at Idathil near Kaavil Temple. Idathil (Vempolinadu Edathil Karthavu)P. Shungoonny Menon, A history of Travancore (first edition: 1878, new edition: 1983), page 130 and 131, was the family name of the Thekkumkoor kings. Today's Paliakara Palace is a branch of Lakshmipuram Palace of Changanacherry, which is a branch of Alikottu Kovilakam of Pazhancherry in Malabar. Similarly, Nedumpuram Palace is a branch of Mavelikkara Palace is an heir to the Kolathiri tradition of Udayamangalam. The Thekkumkoor kings lost their control in the course of time and Vilakkili (‡¥µ‡¥ø‡¥≤‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ï‡¥ø‡¥≤‡¥ø) Nampoothiris were rulers in 1752‚Äì53 when Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma, the king of Travancore, seized it in a bloody battle in which the ruler was killed, though some dispute it, saying the surrender was peaceful as the Namboothiris were not naive to challenge the mighty army of Ramayyan, the shrewd and sadistic Dalava (‡¥¶‡¥≥‡¥µ)- head of administration and advisor ‚Äì of Travancore.Shree Vallabha Mahakshethra Charitham, P.

Current MP Pathanamthitta (Lok Sabha constituency) is Anto Antony. Religion The city inside the modern municipal limits has an almost equal number of Christians (48.03%) and Hindus (46.92%). Muslims form 4.80% of the population.Census of India ‚Äì Thiruvalla City population Religion data Majority of the Christians in Thiruvalla belongs to Malankara Marthoma Syrian Church, Indian Orthodox and India Pentecostal Church of God. The headquarters of the Malankara Marthoma Syrian Church, India Pentecostal Church of God and Sharon Fellowship Church are also in Thiruvalla. It also headquarters Christian Devotional Malayalam channels-Powervision TV and Athmeeya Yathra. Thiruvalla is home to the Sree Vallabha Temple which is the only one of its kind in the State to have Kathakali performed as a ritual offering every night.  Sports  The popular sports in Thiruvalla are football and cricket. The football history of Thiruvalla can be traced back to the legendary footballer from Thiruvalla, Thomas Varghese, called \\"Tiruvalla Pappan\\". He represented India in the London Olympics of 1948, and is described as one of the best defenders of 40's ‚Äì 50's from India. Today, Thiruvalla hosts many district and state-level football and cricket tournaments. There is a stadium in Thiruvalla maintained by the Thiruvalla Municipal Council. This is the venue for most of the tournaments. It is also called \\"Prithi stadium\\".  Indoor Cricket  The Kerala Cricket Association has set up the world- class indoor cricket stadium complex in Thiruvalla, with world-class facilities, with 24-7 practising facility. The facility is adjacent to the Thiruvalla Municipal stadium and is constructed on 8000 square feet, on 50 cents of land. The facility also houses a library, multi-gym, board room, KCA district office, and a conference hall. Specially made natural grass wicket is the speciality of the practicing nets in the courtyard. This indoor cricket facility is perhaps, the first of its kind in the state.

According to the 2001 UK census, Radford Semele parish had a population of 2,034, reducing to 2,012 at the 2011 Census. It lies to the east of Leamington, on the A425 road between Leamington and Southam. It has a 16th-century pub with a priest hole. The local school is the Radford Semele Church of England School. This is a primary school and most senior pupils go to school in either Southam, Leamington Spa or Warwick which are close by. As well as the parish church of St Nicholas the village also has a second church built in 1874, the Radford Semele Baptist Church.  History  A poorly preserved Roman villa was excavated in 1974 at NGR SP 342624 near Pounce Hill Farm, approximately south of the village.http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk The village is named after a family from Saint-Pierre-de-Semilly in Normandy - they were lords of the manor in around 1120. The old Weedon to Leamington Spa line used to run through the village but in the late 1960s the line was closed to passengers. The site of where the old line used to be is now a new cycleway as part of The National Cycle Network.  Pubs  The village has a 16th-century pub called The White Lion situated on the main road running through the village. On 2 February 2006 the pub caught alight, ruining the thatched roof and interior. As of January 2011 the pub is open again.  St Nicholas Church  St Nicholas Church in 2005 St Nicholas Church following fire of 2008 St Nicholas Church, a Grade II listed building, caught fire on 16 March 2008 and all that remained was the tower and shell of the building. The fire was initially not considered suspicious; however, since there is evidence that there was a break-in on the night of the fire, it is believed to have been arson, following failed attempts at several other churches nearby. The church has since been restored and was reopened on 15 May 2013.

One player extends their hands forward, roughly at arm's length, with the palms down. The other player's hands, also roughly at arm's length, are placed, palms up, under the first player's hands. The object of the game is for the second player to slap the back of the first player's hands before the first player can pull them away. If the slapping player misses, the players swap roles and play again. The slapper is on offense and must act with sufficient speed, because the slappee's goal is to pull their hands away, and out of the area where the hands overlap, to avoid the slap. The slapper can only slap the hand it is underneath. The slappee is on defense and attempts to avoid having his hands slapped, by pulling his hands away as the slapper brings his hands over to attempt a slap. However, the slappee cannot flinch too much in attempting to avoid a slap: in one variation of the game, if the slappee pulls his hands away when the slapper has not brought his hands around, then the slappee must submit to a \\"free slap\\" by the slapper. Variations Another variation is where the slappee has their hands held palms together, held out at mid-torso height; the slapper then does the same with the tips of the fingers of both players hands around a centimetre apart, and then (with just one of their hands) the slapper tries to slap the backs of the slappee's hands. You can slap the slappee's hands with just one of your hands as a strategical move. Another variation is play as above but with one (or both) player(s) blindfolded.

Arnow has been called an expert on the people of the Southern Appalachian Mountains, but she herself loved cities and spent crucial periods of her life in Cincinnati and Detroit. Early life and education Arnow was born as Harriette Louisa Simpson in Monticello, Wayne County, Kentucky, and grew up in neighboring Pulaski County. She was one of six siblings in a family that traced its heritage to the Revolutionary War; both parents were teachers and she was raised to be a teacher. She attended Berea College for two years before transferring to the University of Louisville, after which she worked for two years as a teacher in rural Pulaski County, then one of the more remote areas of Appalachia, before moving to Cincinnati. In 1935 she published her first works in Esquire, two short stories, \\"A Mess of Pork\\" and \\"Marigolds and Mules\\", under the pen name H. L. Simpson, sending a photo of her brother-in-law to disguise her gender. Career as writer In 1936, under the name Harriette Simpson, she published her first novel, Mountain Path, basing it on her experiences as a teacher. Under the instructions of her publisher, Simpson added sensational \\"Appalachian\\" stereotypical elements (moonshining, feuds) to her original work, a much more sedate series of sketches. From 1934 to 1939 she lived in Cincinnati and worked for the Federal Writer's Project of the WPA where she met her future husband, Harold B. Arnow, the son of Jewish immigrants, in 1939. They lived briefly in Pulaski County, Harriette again working as a teacher, before settling in a public housing complex in Detroit, Michigan in 1944. Now billing herself as Harriette Arnow, her 1949 novel, Hunter's Horn, was a best seller and received considerable critical acclaim, finishing close to William Faulkner's A Fable in that year's voting for the Pulitzer Prize. In 1950 the Arnows moved to 40 acres of land near Ann Arbor, Michigan. She published her most famous work The Dollmaker in 1954. This Great American Novel about a poor Kentucky family forced by economic necessity to move to Detroit reflected her own life, but also reflects the experiences of many Appalachians who migrated from their homes for the promise of better lives in the industrialized North. Told through the eyes of Gertie Nevels, a woman torn from the woods and farmland to move with her children to join her husband living in World War II factory workers' housing in Detroit, it can be seen as a work of feminist fiction. Arnow herself disputed this characterization however, preferring to see it as an individual woman's struggle to survive in a harsh and changing world \\"A southern woman's view on the disjoint between feminism and individualism \\" in Oral Histories of the American South. Of her writing she said, \\"I am afflicted with too many words ... Like the characters in my books, I talk too much and tell things I shouldn't tell.\\" Later works were published under the now-familiar byline Harriette Simpson Arnow, and most reissues of her earlier work use this form of her name. Her post-Dollmaker books included the historical studies Seedtime on the Cumberland and Flowering of the Cumberland. Her last books were the novels The Weedkiller's Daughter, 1970, The Kentucky Trace, 1974, and the memoir Old Burnside, 1977. She died in 1986, aged 77, at her home in Washtenaw County, Michigan. Michigan State University Press brought out her previously unpublished second novel, Between the Flowers, in 1999, and The Collected Short Stories of Harriette Simpson Arnow in 2005.

The Tupolev design was advanced but lacked refinement, much to the dismay of crews, maintenance personnel, and Stalin, who pointed out that \\"there are no trivialities in aviation\\". Numerically the most important bomber in the world in the late 1930s, the SB was the first modern stressed skin aircraft produced in quantity in the Soviet Union and probably the most formidable bomber of the mid-1930s. It was produced in the Soviet Union and was also built under license in Czechoslovakia. Many versions saw extensive action in Spain, the Republic of China, Mongolia, Finland and at the beginning of World War II against Germany in 1941. It was also used in various duties in civil variants, as trainers and in many secondary roles. Successful in the Spanish Civil War because it outpaced most fighters, the aircraft was obsolete by 1941. By June 1941, 94 percent of bombers in the Red Army air force (VVS RKKA) were SBs. Development Aeroflot Tupolev ANT-40. In 1933 the Soviet Air Force ministry (UVVS) issued an outline requirement for a high-speed bomber. Work on this proposal at TsAGI began in January 1934. The SB was designed and developed in the Tupolev KB (\\"Design Bureau\\") by a team led by A. A. Arkhangelski. Two versions were planned ‚Äì with Wright Cyclone radial engines (ANT-40 RTs), and with the Hispano-Suiza 12Y liquid-cooled V12 engines (ANT-40 IS). The skills gained in the design of the MI-3 and DI-8 aircraft were widely used. The first two prototypes were designed as ANT-40.1 and ANT-40.2. The Cyclone powered prototype flew first, on 7 October 1934, with the first Hispano-Suiza powered prototype (ANT-401Gunston 1995, p.405.Air International January 1989, p. 46.), which featured a larger wing, flew on 30 December 1934, demonstrating superior performance.Maslov 2007, p.64. The second Hispano-Suiza powered aircraft, the ANT-402 was considered a production prototype, and its performance was impressive. It was however plagued by teething problems, leading unhappy test personnel to cover the ANT-402 with placards listing the aircraft's defects prior to a visit by Sergo Ordzhonikidze, the Commissar for Heavy Industry. On seeing these placards, Ordzhonikidze summoned Tupolev to a meeting at the Kremlin to discuss these shortfalls. When Tupolev stated that most of the defects were trivial, Joseph Stalin said:Air International January 1989, pp. 46‚Äì47. The first production aircraft, designated SB, rolled off the production line before the end of 1935, and before ANT-402 had completed its flight test programme.Air International January 1989, pp. 47, 49. The aircraft entered full production in 1936, and was produced in two plants, State Aircraft Factory No 22 at Moscow and No 125 at Irkutsk until 1941.Duffy and Kandalov 1996, p.80. Despite the fact that the assembly lines were plagued with a constant string of modifications, some 400 SBs were delivered by the end of 1936‚Äîa number of these being diverted to Spain‚Äîand 24 VVS squadrons were in the process of working up with the new bomber.Air International January 1989, p. 51. Giving excellent performance in the Spanish Civil War, it acquired the popular name \\"Katyusha\\" (Catherine).Maslov 2007, p. 75. In 1937, negotiations were concluded between the Soviet and Czechoslovak governments, for the supply of SB bombers and a licence for local production, in exchange for the right to produce the Skoda 75 mm Model 1936 mountain gun. The version of the SB to be supplied to, and subsequently license-built as the Avia B-71 was the SB 2M-100A but fitted with the Avia-built Hispano-Suiza 12-Ydrs engine. A single 7.92 mm ZB-30 machine gun supplanted the twin ShKAS machine guns in the nose and similar weapons were provided for the dorsal and ventral stations.Air International February 1989, pp. 100‚Äì101.Maslov 2007, p.78. 60 aircraft were to be flown to Czechoslovakia by mid-1938. The planned licensed production program took a decidedly leisurely course, despite the increasingly dangerous political situation. By 15 March 1939, when the German Wehrmacht occupied Bohemia and Moravia, not one Czech-built aircraft had been delivered. Monino Air Force Museum Development of the SB continued, meanwhile, with revisions being made to reflect the lessons of early operations in Spain. As problems were encountered in converting pilots to fly the SB, a trainer version, the USB was built in September 1937, with a modified nose with an open cockpit for an instructor and dual controls.Air International February 1989, p. 81.Gunston 1995, p.406. Problems were also encountered with the armament, the nose guns having limited traverse and so being little use against head-on attacks and later aircraft were modified with a better field of fire. From 1940, the dorsal gun position was replaced by an enclosed turret, while the ventral gun position, which was difficult to use, was also modified.Air International February 1989, pp. 80‚Äì81.Maslov 2007, p.74. The aircraft was also progressively fitted with improved engines. At first it was equipped with the Klimov M-100, a license-built version of the Hispano-Suiza 12Ybrs engine, but this was soon replaced by the more powerful M-100A, and from 1938 by the yet more powerful M-103. While the engine installation of the SB 2-M103 initially retained the drag inducing frontal radiators of the M-100 powered aircraft, an improved engine installation was developed with the radiators slung under the engines.Maslov 2007, pp. 67‚Äì70. On 2 September 1937 M.Yu. Alexeev set an official altitude record of with load of in an M-103 powered SB. He had earlier set an unofficial record of .Duffy and Kandalov 1996, p. 82. In an attempt to further improve the performance of the SB, which by 1939 was becoming obsolete, the development of two second-generation versions were authorised, a direct replacement for the SB and a specialised dive bomber. The level bomber, known as the SN-MN or MMN, had a new wing of reduced wing area and was powered by more powerful Klimov M-105 engines. Performance was little better than the standard aircraft and it was abandoned. The dive-bomber, designated SB-RK (later redesignated Arkhangelsky Ar-2 after its designer, with Tupolev having been imprisoned and being in disgrace) was similar to the MMN but was fitted with dive brakes and it was ordered into production.Air International March 1989, pp. 148‚Äì149.Maslov 2007, p. 71. Even though the SB was no longer a state of the art aircraft, production continued to increase through 1939 and 1940, as the Soviet Union tried to build up the strength of their air forces to compete with the growing threat of Nazi Germany, with almost 4,000 being built in these two years. The SB was phased out of production in early 1941, being replaced by the Petlyakov Pe-2.Air International March 1989, p. 153. A total of 5,695 were built at Factory No 22 at Moscow before it was evacuated to Kazan, while Factory No 125 built a further 1,136 at Irkutsk.Duffy and Kandalov 1996, p. 222. Three prototypes were built at the Tupolev design bureau, while Aero Vodochody and Avia in Czechoslovakia built 45 and 66 respectively, giving a total of 6,945 built. Design The SB was an all-metal monoplane powered by two Klimov M-100 12-cylinder water-cooled engines (license production version of Hispano-Suiza 12-Yrds engine) which drove fixed-pitch two-bladed metal propellers. The engines were provided with honeycomb-type frontal radiators enclosed by vertical thermostat-controlled cooling shutters. At an early production stage, the M-100 engine gave place to an improved M-100A engine, driving ground- adjustable three-pitch propellers, with speed being boosted to at . Because of its broad, high aspect ratio wing, that gave it a good altitude performance ‚Äì Soviet crews nicknamed the SB the \\"Pterodactyl\\".Jackson 2003 p. 150. Operational history There were a number of foreign customers for the SB. They were mostly satisfied with the aircraft's performance. There were some complaints about the high noise level, cramped crew compartments, hard undercarriage suspension and in particular about the front gunner's position, which could be reached only through a hatch under the fuselage, preventing the gunner from escaping in the event of a ditching or belly landing. Czechoslovakia signed an agreement to produce the ANT-40 as Avia B-71. Jackson 2003 p. 151. Spanish Civil War While only 54 SBs had been delivered to the Soviet Air Forces by 1 July 1936,Maslov 2007, p. 67. this did not stop the new Tupolev bomber being amongst the first shipments of military equipment sent by the Soviet Union to support the Spanish Republicans when the Spanish Civil War broke out on 17 July 1936. An initial batch of 31 SBs arrived in Cartagena aboard the Soviet Freighter Komsomol in October 1936, flying their first mission, a bombing raid by four SBs against Tablada airfield, Seville on 28 October. The SBs were used to equip Grupo 12 of the Spanish Republican Air Force, which at first was mainly manned by Soviet volunteers and under Soviet control.Martinez 1986, pp. 45‚Äì47. The SB could outpace the Fiat CR.32 and Heinkel He 51 biplane fighters of the nationalist forces, and was therefore difficult to intercept, with dives from high altitude being the only way to intercept the SB.Maslov 2007, p.76. On 29 May 1937 two SBs attacked the German pocket battleship Deutschland, mistaking it for the Nationalist cruiser Canarias, killing 31 and injuring an additional 83 German sailors.Martinez 1986, p. 49. In June‚ÄìJuly, a second consignment of 31 SBs were received, allowing Grupo 12 to return to full strength, and a new unit, Grupo 24, to be established.Martinez 1986, p.51. The delivery of Messerschmitt Bf 109s to re- equip the German Condor Legion meant that the SB could no longer evade Nationalist fighters by sheer speed, and losses rose. A third and final batch of 31 SBs arrived in June 1938,Air International March 1989, p. 151. allowing operations to continue, although losses continued to be high. By the time the Civil War ended in April 1939, 73 SBs had been lost, 40 of them to enemy action. Nineteen SBs were taken over by the Nationalists, and used to form a bomber squadron. Although some were re-engined with French Hispano-Suiza 12Ybrs engines to aid maintenance, they were still subject to spares shortages, and in April 1943 only three were airworthy. When Junkers Ju 88s were received in December 1943, the remaining SBs were used for occasional training flights until withdrawn and scrapped in 1948. China Soviet aviators at Hankou airfield. In July 1937, the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out. The Soviet Union signed the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact on 21 August 1937, and as part of this agreement, supplied large amounts of military equipment to the Chinese Nationalists, as well as deploying complete air force units, nominally manned by Soviet volunteers. An initial delivery of 62 SBs was made in September‚ÄìOctober 1937, with combat operations by Soviet forces starting in December with attacks on Japanese ships on the Yangtze River. On 23 February 1938, to celebrate Soviet Army Day, Soviet SBs carried out a long range attack on Japanese airfields on Taiwan, claiming 40 Japanese aircraft destroyed on the ground.Air International February 1989, p. 101.Maslov 2007, pp. 77‚Äì78. A further 60 SBs were delivered to China in early 1938, these being heavily used to attack Japanese forces during the Battle of Wuhan. Losses were heavy, forcing the Chinese SB units to be temporarily withdrawn from combat. The Soviet units operating the SB over China re-equipped with the Ilyushin DB-3 in 1939, allowing their SBs to be transferred to Chinese units, but the Chinese made limited use of these reinforcements.Air International March 1989, pp. 150‚Äì151. The Soviet Union supplied a further 100 SBs in 1941, just before it signed the Soviet‚ÄìJapanese Neutrality Pact. The SB was gradually phased out of front-line operations against the Japanese with the delivery of more modern American bombers from 1942, being partly replaced by Lockheed Hudsons and B-25 Mitchells. Limited numbers of SBs continued in non-combat use, including operations against opium plantations, before being used against the Communists when the Chinese Civil War flared up in 1945, being finally withdrawn in 1946.Air International February 1989, pp. 153‚Äì154. SBAP, Summer 1939 Mongolia As well as the aircraft operated by volunteers against the Japanese over China, SBs were used in combat against the Japanese during the Fighting near Lake Khasan on the eastern sector of the China‚ÄìRussia border in July‚ÄìAugust 1938, one SB being lost.Maslov 2007, pp. 76‚Äì77. Fighting between Soviet and Japanese forces broke out again at Khalkhin Gol in Eastern Mongolia in May 1939. While SBs were not involved in the May air battles, where the Soviet forces received heavy losses, two Regiments of SBs were deployed to Mongolia in June, flying their first missions on 26 June.Walg 1997, pp. 2‚Äì3. SBs were used heavily against Japanese forces when they attacked in early July. The Soviet SB regiments consisted of a mixture of early and later SBs, whose differing speeds caused problems in maintaining formation, while Japanese Nakajima Ki-27 fighters proved adept in exploiting the poor defensive armament of the SB, with the radio operator operating both the dorsal and ventral guns. To minimise losses to Japanese fighters, the Soviets changed tactics, flying SB missions at over 6,100 m (20,000 ft) where it was difficult for the Japanese to intercept.Walg 1997, pp. 4‚Äì5. SBs continued to be used against the Japanese as the Soviets and Mongolian forces commanded by Georgy Zhukov carried out a successful offensive until a cease-fire was signed in September 1939. Winter War On 30 November 1939, the Soviet Union attacked Finland in the conflict that became known as the Winter War, with the forces deployed against Finland including several hundred SBs. Losses were heavy, with bomber formations often un-escorted, and forced to operate at low level, where they were vulnerable to Finnish anti-aircraft fire and fighters. While in 1936 in Spain, the SB could outpace enemy fighters, by now it was vulnerable and poorly armed. SBs were fitted with skis for operation from snow covered airfields, slowing the aircraft and making them more vulnerable, while the need to wear heavy winter clothing made the gunner's job even harder.Maslov 2007, pp. 78‚Äì79. By the end of the 15-week war, at least 100 SBs had been lost,Maslov 2007, p. 79. with the Finns claiming nearly 200 shot down, 92 of them to Finnish fighters.Stenman 1982, p. 10. Eastern Front SB shot down near the Berezina river, July 1941 When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, re-equipment with more modern aircraft such as the Pe-2 had begun. Still, 94% of the Soviet operational bomber force was equipped with SBs,Duffy and Kandalov 1996, p. 81. with 1,500‚Äì2,000 SBs deployed along the Western border districts of the Soviet Union.Maslov 2007, p. 80.Air International March 1989, p. 154. The Luftwaffe started Operation Barbarossa with co-ordinated strikes against 66 major Soviet airfields, destroying a large proportion of Soviet air strength on the ground or air on the first day of the invasion. The SBs that survived the carnage of the first day continued to be poorly used, many being frittered away in unescorted low-level attacks against German tanks, where the SB's relatively large size and lack of armour made it highly vulnerable to German light Flak, while German fighters continued to take a heavy toll. Within a few days, losses forced most of the remaining SBs to switch to night attacks. SBs continued to be used, in the defense of Leningrad and Moscow, mainly at night by attacking German artillery. By December 1941 almost all of the SBs had either been replaced or lost, although it remained in large-scale use until March 1942 in the North against Finland.Stenman 1985, p. 17. SBs continued in use for non-combat roles such as supply dropping, glider towing and training, and continued in use in the Far East until 1945. Finnish use Tupolev SBs of the Finnish Air Force lined up. Many Soviet SBs crashed or force-landed on Finnish soil during the Winter War, with the Finns salvaging as many aircraft as possible, with those in the best condition being sent to Valtion lentokonetehdas for possible repair for use by the Finnish air force. By the time of the Continuation War against the Soviet Union, when Finland moved to recover the territory lost in the Winter War, five SBs had been repaired (with a further three added later), being used to equip Lentolaivue 6, flying maritime patrol and attack missions. These aircraft were supplemented by a further 16 SBs purchased from Germany, which had captured them during the initial weeks of the invasion of the Soviet Union.Stenman 1985, pp. 12‚Äì13. These SBs employed the first air-dropped depth charges used in combat. Finland lost seven SBs to accidents during the Continuation War, with none being lost in combat, with Finnish SBs claiming three Soviet submarines and a 4,000 ton merchant ship sunk.Stenman 1985, pp. 10, 20.

In the late 1970s, however, Vozdushni Transport (A Soviet aviation newspaper) sent an expedition led by Evgeny Konoplev to survey an ANT-40 that was forced to land during a snow storm near the Yuzhne Muiski mountain range in the Baikal region. Konoplev considered what they found encouraging, with the aircraft being in fairly decent condition, in turn leading a team of VVS pilots to recover the airplane. It was returned to Moscow and restored by a group of volunteer Tupolev employees. The restored aircraft was unveiled in April 1982 at the Central Air Force Museum at Monino Airfield.

Playing doctor is distinguished from child-on-child sexual abuse because the latter is an overt and deliberate action directed at sexual stimulation, including orgasm, as compared to anatomical curiosity. Playing doctor is considered by most child psychologists to be a normal step in childhood development between the ages of approximately three and six years, so long as all parties are willing participants and relatively close in age. However, it can be a source of discomfort to some parents to discover their children are engaging in such an activity.

It was the first institute in Europe to train engineers at university level. It was founded in 1782. More than 110 departments and institutes operate within the structure of eight faculties. About 1100 lecturers, 400 researchers and other degree holders and numerous invited lecturers and practising expert specialists participate in education and research at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. Approximately 1381 of the university's 21,171 students are from 50 countries abroad. The Budapest University of Technology and Economics issues about 70% of Hungary's engineering degrees. 34 professors/researchers of the university are members of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. Training courses are provided in five languages: Hungarian, English, German, French and Russian. The ECTS credit system was introduced in 1995. This helps students to enroll in the student exchange program of the European Union, the Socrates (also known as Erasmus), and earn a double degree through the Top Industrial Managers for Europe network.

The organizational structure The \\"R\\" building is the seat of the Chancellery and the Central Student Office The Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME) is a public higher education institute operating as a central budgetary institution. Its founding regulation has been issued by the Minister of Human Resources. Its Organizational and operational conditions are summarized in its own regulation in accordance with laws. The steering body of the University is the Senate. BME is divided into faculties. The faculties in the order of their founding: *Faculty of Civil Engineering (√âMK) *Faculty of Mechanical Engineering (GPK) *Faculty of Architecture (√âPK) *Faculty of Chemical Technology and Biotechnology (VBK) *Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics (VIK) *Faculty of Transportation Engineering and Vehicle Engineering (KJK) *Faculty of Natural Sciences (TTK) *Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences (GTK) Education, research, innovation and direct additional services are proceeded by the faculties. Work-sharing between the faculties are subject oriented both in the fields of education and that of technology. The organogram of BME is available here. The faculties consist of departments, institutes, research centres that are supported by deans offices and other units. Governing is assisted by the Rectors Office and the Chancellors Office. There is a highly independent Group of integrated internal control. Faculties and Students organizations are supported by service units. The core and ancillary activities are supported *with system management and system support services **by the units of Chancellery *with specialized services, like **library and information management ***by the National Technical Information Centre and Library and within it the University Archives **student registration, study management and coordination ***by the Central Student Office **student support and advice management together with cultural services ***by the Student Service Directorate **secretariat of Senate, Rectors Council and Ethics Committee ***by the Rectors Office **assistance to the faculty councils, education committees and other committees of the faculties ***by deans offices **secretariat of the University Committee of Teaching Authorization and Doctoral Council and Scientific Students Association ***by the Central Student Office **assistance to the BME Organization of Union of Higher Education Employee, and the BME Unite of the Union of Employee in Public Culture and Collections, the Council of Public Employee and the BME Committee of Equal Opportunities ***by the Office of Representations **assistance to the governing body of University Student and Doctoral Student Representation (EHDK) ***by the Student Service Directorate **with coordination of independent organizational units and activities ***by other umbrella organizations There are other organizations like companies established or owned by the University, welfare institutions, student or teacher activity groups and other organizations associated to the University. The Rector is the top manager and representative of the University. The Chancellor ensures the technical conditions, the administration, the financial management in order to complete the functions of the University. The Rector and the Chancellor regularly calls Executive Board meetings to prepare strategic decisions. Employment relations between are regulated in the Annex of the Human Resource Policy. Admissions All Hungarians who pass the Hungarian secondary school matura with enough points are eligible for admission, as well as for anyone else in possession of an International Baccalaureate (again, with enough points). As with all Hungarian universities, a tuition fee of around $1000 has to be paid each semester for the Hungarian program. No extra fee is required for Hungarians for whom it is their first university, unless they spend more than 13 semesters there. The university offers extensive English language programs on all its faculties, at all levels of study (Preparatory Year, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Arts, Master of Science, Doctor of Philosophy). The Tuition fees vary from ‚Ç¨2000 - ‚Ç¨4500 per semester. 6% of all students come from different countries of the world representing over fifty different countries; the majority of the students in the English Program are from US, England and Germany. Location Panoramic view of the buildings of BME The university is located on the right side of the Danube between Szabads√°g Bridge and Pet≈ëfi Bridge and towards R√°k√≥czi Bridge. This makes the university campus especially long and narrow: walking from one side of the university to the other can take as much as 20 minutes. The Inner City of Budapest (Pest) is just across the river, about 10 minutes' walk by either of the bridges.

The University hosted the IFIUS 2008 World Interuniversity Games in October. National Technical Information Centre and Library The National Technical Information Centre and Library at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME OMIKK) is the successor of two major libraries in Hungary. The Central Library of BME BME OMIKK The library of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics (then Joseph Polytechnics) was formally founded in 1848 when Baron J√≥zsef E√∂tv√∂s, Minister of Religion and Public Education donated a book in five volumes that become the first item in the inventory of the library. Since its foundation it moved with the University from Pest to the Buda Castle in 1854 and back to Pest in 1872. In 1882 it moved again, to the campus near the National Museum, now the campus of Faculty of Humanities of E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University. In 1909 the Library was moved to a separated cathedral like building in the new Campus of BME. The building was designed by Samu P√©cz, professor of architecture at the University. The central Aula connects the spacious, 16.5 meter wide reading room to the north, the multi floor storage facility to the west and the workrooms of library procedures to the south. The eastern facade is connected to the central building of the University with the 'Bridge of Sighs'. The architectural concept has been proven timeless. Later on the storage capacity was enlarged with the introduction of compact storage technology, and adding a large capacity underground storage facility under the garden of the Campus. Today a remote storage building near Budapest is also used. In the beginning the library was directed by university professors. The first full-time director was appointed in 1936. In the early years the library served only professors. It was opened for students in 1869, and for the general public in 1884. In 1884 the first classification system of the library was elaborated and the first printed catalogue of the library was published by Vince Wartha, who was by the way professor of urban chemical technologies, dealing with construction materials, with gas production and water supply, and rector of university two times. In the following years extended editions of the printed catalogue were published and distributed to the departments and to other major libraries in the country. In 1936 the library introduced the index card system of catalogue. Transition to electronic cataloguing began in the 1980s, and the integrated library system was introduced in the 1990s. With the spreading of internet and widening the bandwidth the catalogue has become available from anywhere. The library collection was extended by acquisitions, and with donations of professors. There were two major additions by receiving the heritage of baron J√≥zsef E√∂tv√∂s in 1872, and of K√°roly Hieronymi engineer and politician in 1912. During the Second World War both the building and the collection were damaged. Nevertheless, it continued its work in 1945, and the main reading room was reopened during the academic year of 1949-1950. Since 1952, increasing amount of the collection has been placed on open shelves for direct access of the readers. In the beginning only fiction, later on handbooks, and nowadays textbooks and current literature can be found on the shelves in the reading rooms. In 1953 the library started publishing serials (Methodical papers of the Central Library of Budapest Technical University, publications on history of science and engineering, Scientific Technical Bibliographies) and some other serials in the 1960s. Since the mid sixties the library takes part in the instruction of first year students with training on using the library and in teaching literature search skills. In 1991 the library opened the Study of Natural Sciences with mostly chemistry-regarded literature open shelves. The library is the centre of the library network of the University, and the thematic library in mathematics and physics. The National Technical Information Centre and Library (OMIKK) In 1883 √Ågoston Trefort, minister of education opened the Technological Museum including a library consisting the ‚Äúbasic Hungarian and international literature dealing with industry‚Äù. In 1889 the library was moved and merged with the library of Public Polytechnics. In 1921 the Institute of Technological and Material Testing was established, merging two institutions. With the integration, the Library of Technological Institute was formed. From 1923 the library was intensively developed by the direction of G√©za K√°pl√°ny. In 1949 the Library of Technology was formally merged with the Technical Documentation Centre. Since then the library started establishing liaison libraries in the country. In 1952 the name changed to National Technical Library. In 1956 the Library was moved into a representative building near the National Museum. In 1982 with the introduction of electronic technologies and with the development of information exchange of cooperating libraries on multinational level the library took the name of National Technical Information Centre and Library. After several changes in the organization and supervision, in 2001, with the decision of the minister of education, most of the tasks, the staff and the whole collection of the National Technical Information Centre and Library were integrated into the Library of Budapest University of Technology and Economics. BME OMIKK, the integrated library After the integration of the two libraries the Main Reading Room were renovated and under it the Reading Room of Technical and Natural Sciences was created, three reading rooms in the central university building were formed, and a service tunnel connecting the library building with the underground storage facility and with the new reading rooms was constructed. In 2011, following the erection of new university buildings in the new southern (L√°gym√°nyos) campus, a new service point of BME OMIKK was opened in building ‚ÄúI‚Äù. University rank The Budapest University of Technology and Economics ranked 250th in mechanical engineering by QS 2017 world ranking. It takes the 322nd place among the world‚Äôs top 400 universities for engineering and technology, being the only university from Hungary that is listed in Quacquarelli Symonds ranking. Times Higher Education, THE ranked it as 1001+ world university ranking, 2020 behind prominent universities in Africa, including the University of lagos, Unilag.

When he felt he had gone as far as he could go in Milwaukee, Epstein decided to move to New York City, but before he could pack his gear, he was lured to the West Coast by a drummer friend to play bass in a new band that singer-songwriter John Hiatt was forming in Los Angeles. He stuck with Hiatt for two years and two albums (Slug Line and Two Bit Monsters) The Heartbreakers Epstein did not start playing the bass until a couple of years before joining the Heartbreakers. He took a gig backing Del Shannon. While playing on a Shannon album that Tom Petty was producing (Drop Down And Get Me), Epstein impressed Petty with his ability. Consequently, when Ron Blair, who had been bassist with Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers since their inception in 1976, announced that he was quitting due to burnout from the band's heavy touring schedule, Epstein was recruited to replace him. \\"We all kind of thought Howie would get the job,\\" says original Heartbreakers' drummer Stan Lynch. \\"He seemed to have a real good feeling for what we were doing. He's a good bass player, a real good singer, and he fit in real well.\\" Epstein agreed that the transition of playing in these obscure bands to becoming part of a very popular, very established band was almost seamless. \\"It's been easier than I thought it would be. I was already familiar with most of their music just because I'm a fan of the Heartbreakers, so it wasn't like I was coming in cold.\\" After joining the Heartbreakers, he started to take up the bass seriously. \\"I had a tendency to play real busy, from all the years of playing rhythm guitar\\". Epstein found a natural style, which he said emphasised \\"simplicity, playing in the pocket, getting into a steady groove. I've always considered myself a good team player and that's the way that the Heartbreakers operate. Everyone listens to what everyone else is doing musically.\\" On September 1, 1982, he made his live debut at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium in Santa Cruz, California, on the tour to promote the album, Long After Dark. Epstein was a member of the Heartbreakers until his departure due to his failing health caused by his heroin addiction. He made his final appearance with the band when they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in March 2002. Tom Petty commended Epstein on his collaborative efforts: Collaborations Epstein played bass on recordings by Eric Andersen, Bob Dylan, Carlene Carter, Johnny Cash, John Hiatt, Stevie Nicks, Roy Orbison, Carl Perkins, John Prine, Linda Ronstadt, Del Shannon, The Textones, The Village People and Warren Zevon. He earned acclaim as a songwriter and a producer. Epstein produced two albums for John Prine, 1991's The Missing Years, which won a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Recording, and Lost Dogs and Mixed Blessings. He also produced Eric Andersen's Memory Of The Future (1998). Personal life Epstein formed a creative and personal partnership with Carlene Carter following her divorce from the English singer-songwriter Nick Lowe and her return to the United States in 1988, helping Carter re-establish her career. Epstein produced her hit album I Fell in Love (1990), and co-authored the title track with his longtime collaborator, Milwaukee songwriter Perry M. Lamek. Carter's vocals on the title track \\"I Fell In Love\\" earned her a Grammy nomination for Best Female Country Vocal Performance in 1991. Three years later, Epstein produced Carter's follow-up CD, Little Love Letters. Epstein and Carter were engaged from the mid- to late-1990s, living together in Tesuque, New MexicoHeart Breaker - Milwaukee Magazine Retrieved 2018-08-30. but they never married. Prior to Carlene Carter, Howie was engaged to and lived with Laurie June, an actress, model, and legal secretary, in Laurel Canyon, California. They were together from approximately 1979 to 1987. Death On February 23, 2003, Epstein died from complications related to drug use. MTV News reported that Epstein's death was caused by a heroin overdose. He was 47. Investigators were told Epstein had been using heroin. On the day of his death, Howie was driven to St. Vincent Hospital in Santa Fe, New Mexico by his girlfriend, who described him as \\"under distress\\". Epstein was taking antibiotics for an illness and had recently suffered from influenza, stomach problems, and an abscess on his leg, friends said. Additionally, it was reported that he had been extremely distraught over the death of his 16-year-old dog a few days earlier. In later interviews, Tom Petty admitted that Epstein's behavior had become unpredictable: \\"He was just degenerating on us to the point where we thought keeping Howie in the band was actually doing him more harm than getting rid of him. His personal problems were vast and serious.\\" He was interred at Second Home Cemetery in Greenfield, Wisconsin. Petty wrote the following in an article for Rolling Stone in response to Epstein's death: \\"... there's a great sadness, because Howie was never not a Heartbreaker. He just got to where he couldn't do it anymore ... It's like you got a tree dying in the backyard. And you're kind of used to the idea that it's dying. But you look out there one day and they cut it down. And you just can't imagine that beautiful tree isn't there anymore.\\" At the time of his passing, Epstein was survived by his brothers, Craig and Bradley Epstein, and daughter, Jamie Leffler, now a member of indie rock band Dwntwn.

This problem is exactly solvable, and yields an approximate solution for particles moving in the gravitational fields of prolate and oblate spheroids. This problem is named after Leonhard Euler, who discussed it in memoirs published in 1760. Important extensions and analyses were contributed subsequently by Lagrange, Liouville, Laplace, Jacobi, Darboux, Le Verrier, Velde, Hamilton, Poincar√©, Birkhoff and E. T. Whittaker, among others. Euler's problem also covers the case when the particle is acted upon by other inverse-square central forces, such as the electrostatic interaction described by Coulomb's law. The classical solutions of the Euler problem have been used to study chemical bonding, using a semiclassical approximation of the energy levels of a single electron moving in the field of two atomic nuclei, such as the diatomic ion HeH2+. This was first done by Wolfgang Pauli in his doctoral dissertation under Arnold Sommerfeld, a study of the first ion of molecular hydrogen, namely the Hydrogen molecule-ion H2+. These energy levels can be calculated with reasonable accuracy using the Einstein‚ÄìBrillouin‚ÄìKeller method, which is also the basis of the Bohr model of atomic hydrogen. More recently, as explained further in the quantum-mechanical version, analytical solutions to the eigenvalues (energies) have been obtained: these are a generalization of the Lambert W function. The exact solution, in the full three dimensional case, can be expressed in terms of Weierstrass's elliptic functions For convenience, the problem may also be solved by numerical methods, such as Runge‚ÄìKutta integration of the equations of motion. The total energy of the moving particle is conserved, but its linear and angular momentum are not, since the two fixed centers can apply a net force and torque. Nevertheless, the particle has a second conserved quantity that corresponds to the angular momentum or to the Laplace‚ÄìRunge‚ÄìLenz vector as limiting cases. The Euler three-body problem is known by a variety of names, such as the problem of two fixed centers, the Euler‚ÄìJacobi problem, and the two-center Kepler problem. Various generalizations of Euler's problem are known; these generalizations add linear and inverse cubic forces and up to five centers of force. Special cases of these generalized problems include Darboux's problemDarboux JG, Archives N√©erlandaises des Sciences (ser. 2), 6, 371-376 and Velde's problem.Velde (1889) Programm der ersten H√∂heren B√ºrgerschule zu Berlin Overview and history Euler's three-body problem is to describe the motion of a particle under the influence of two centers that attract the particle with central forces that decrease with distance as an inverse-square law, such as Newtonian gravity or Coulomb's law. Examples of Euler's problem include a planet moving in the gravitational field of two stars, or an electron moving in the electric field of two nuclei, such as the first ion of the hydrogen molecule, namely the hydrogen molecule-ion H2+. The strength of the two inverse-square forces need not be equal; for illustration, the two attracting stars may have different masses, and the two nuclei may have different charges, as in the molecular ion HeH2+. This problem was first considered by Leonhard Euler, who showed that it had an exact solution in 1760.Euler L, Nov. Comm. Acad. Imp. Petropolitanae, 10, pp. 207-242, 11, pp. 152-184; M√©moires de l'Acad. de Berlin, 11, 228-249. Joseph Louis Lagrange solved a generalized problem in which the centers exert both linear and inverse-square forces.Lagrange JL, Miscellanea Taurinensia, 4, 118-243; Oeuvres, 2, pp. 67-121; M√©canique Analytique, 1st edition, pp. 262-286; 2nd edition, 2, pp. 108-121; Oeuvres, 12, pp. 101-114. Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi showed that the rotation of the particle about the axis of the two fixed centers could be separated out, reducing the general three-dimensional problem to the planar problem.Jacobi CGJ, Vorlesungen ueber Dynamik, no. 29. Werke, Supplement, pp. 221-231 In 2008, Birkhauser published a book entitled \\"Integrable Systems in Celestial Mechanics\\".http://cdsweb.cern.ch/record/1315292 In this book an Irish mathematician, Diarmuid √ì Math√∫na, gives closed form solutions for both the planar two fixed centers problem and the three dimensional problem. Constants of motion The problem of two fixed centers conserves energy; in other words, the total energy E is a constant of motion. The potential energy is given by : V(\\\\mathbf{r}) = - \\\\frac{\\\\mu_1}{r_1} - \\\\frac{\\\\mu_2}{r_2} where r represents the particle's position, and r1 and r2 are the distances between the particle and the centers of force; Œº1 and Œº2 are constants that measure the strength of the first and second forces, respectively. The total energy equals sum of this potential energy with the particle's kinetic energy : E = \\\\frac{1}{2m} \\\\left \\\\mathbf{p} \\\\right^2 + V(\\\\mathbf{r}) where m and p are the particle's mass and linear momentum, respectively. The particle's linear and angular momentum are not conserved in Euler's problem, since the two centers of force act like external forces upon the particle, which may yield a net force and torque on the particle. Nevertheless, Euler's problem has a second constant of motion : r_{1}^{2} r_{2}^{2} \\\\left( \\\\frac{d\\\\theta_{1}}{dt} \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\frac{d\\\\theta_{2}}{dt} \\\\right) - 2a \\\\left[ \\\\mu_{1} \\\\cos \\\\theta_{1} + \\\\mu_{2} \\\\cos \\\\theta_{2} \\\\right], where 2a is the separation of the two centers of force, Œ∏1 and Œ∏2 are the angles of the lines connecting the particle to the centers of force, with respect to the line connecting the centers. This second constant of motion was identified by E. T. Whittaker in his work on analytical mechanics,Whittaker Analytical Dynamics of Particles and Rigid Bodies, p. 283. and generalized to n dimensions by Coulson and Joseph in 1967. In the Coulson‚ÄìJoseph form, the constant of motion is written : B = \\\\left \\\\mathbf{L} \\\\right^2 + a^2 \\\\left \\\\mathbf{p} \\\\right^2 -2a \\\\left[\\\\mu_{1} \\\\cos \\\\theta_1 + \\\\mu_2 \\\\cos \\\\theta_2 \\\\right] This constant of motion corresponds to the total angular momentum L2 in the limit when the two centers of force converge to a single point (a ‚Üí 0), and proportional to the Laplace‚ÄìRunge‚ÄìLenz vector A in the limit when one of the centers goes to infinity (a ‚Üí ‚àû while x ‚àí a remains finite). Quantum mechanical version A special case of the quantum mechanical three-body problem is the hydrogen molecule ion, . Two of the three bodies are nuclei and the third is a fast moving electron. The two nuclei are 1800 times heavier than the electron and thus modeled as fixed centers. It is well known that the Schr√∂dinger wave equation is separable in Prolate spheroidal coordinates and can be decoupled into two ordinary differential equations coupled by the energy eigenvalue and a separation constant. G.B. Arfken, Mathematical Methods for Physicists, 2nd ed., Academic Press, New York (1970). However, solutions required series expansions from basis sets. Nonetheless, through experimental mathematics, it was found that the energy eigenvalue was mathematically a generalization of the Lambert W function (see Lambert W function and references therein for more details). The hydrogen molecular ion in the case of clamped nuclei can be completely worked out within a Computer algebra system. The fact that its solution is an implicit function is revealing in itself. One of the successes of theoretical physics is not simply a matter that it is amenable to a mathematical treatment but that the algebraic equations involved can be symbolically manipulated until an analytical solution, preferably a closed form solution, is isolated. This type of solution for a special case of the three-body problem shows us the possibilities of what is possible as an analytical solution for the quantum three-body and many-body problem. Generalizations An exhaustive analysis of the soluble generalizations of Euler's three-body problem was carried out by Adam Hiltebeitel in 1911. The simplest generalization of Euler's three-body problem is to add a third center of force midway between the original two centers, that exerts only a linear Hooke force (confer Hooke's law). The next generalization is to augment the inverse-square force laws with a force that increases linearly with distance. The final set of generalizations is to add two fixed centers of force at positions that are imaginary numbers, with forces that are both linear and inverse-square laws, together with a force parallel to the axis of imaginary centers and varying as the inverse cube of the distance to that axis. The solution to the original Euler problem is an approximate solution for the motion of a particle in the gravitational field of a prolate body, i.e., a sphere that has been elongated in one direction, such as a cigar shape. The corresponding approximate solution for a particle moving in the field of an oblate spheroid (a sphere squashed in one direction) is obtained by making the positions of the two centers of force into imaginary numbers. The oblate spheroid solution is astronomically more important, since most planets, stars and galaxies are approximately oblate spheroids; prolate spheroids are very rare. The analogue of the oblate case in general relativity is a Kerr black hole.Clifford M. Will, Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 061101, 2009, https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.061101 The geodesics around this object are known to be integrable, owing to the existence of a fourth constant of motion (in addition to energy, angular momentum, and the magnitude of four- momentum), known as the Carter constant. Euler's oblate three body problem and a Kerr black hole share the same mass moments, and this is most apparent if the metric for the latter is written in Kerr‚ÄìSchild coordinates. The analogue of the oblate case augmented with a linear Hooke term is a Kerr‚Äìde Sitter black hole. As in Hooke's law, the cosmological constant term depends linearly on distance from the origin, and the Kerr‚Äìde Sitter spacetime also admits a Carter-type constant quadratic in the momenta.Charalampos Markakis, Constants of motion in stationary axisymmetric gravitational fields, MNRAS (July 11, 2014) 441 (4): 2974-2985. doi: 10.1093/mnras/stu715, https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.5228 Mathematical solutions=Original Euler problem In the original Euler problem, the two centers of force acting on the particle are assumed to be fixed in space; let these centers be located along the x-axis at ¬±a. The particle is likewise assumed to be confined to a fixed plane containing the two centers of force. The potential energy of the particle in the field of these centers is given by : V(x, y) = \\\\frac{-\\\\mu_1}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\left( x - a \\\\right)^2 + y^2}} - \\\\frac{\\\\mu_2}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\left( x + a \\\\right)^2 + y^2}} . where the proportionality constants Œº1 and Œº2 may be positive or negative. The two centers of attraction can be considered as the foci of a set of ellipses. If either center were absent, the particle would move on one of these ellipses, as a solution of the Kepler problem. Therefore, according to Bonnet's theorem, the same ellipses are the solutions for the Euler problem. Introducing elliptic coordinates, : \\\\,x = \\\\,a \\\\cosh \\\\xi \\\\cos \\\\eta, : \\\\,y = \\\\,a \\\\sinh \\\\xi \\\\sin \\\\eta, the potential energy can be written as : \\\\begin{align} V(\\\\xi, \\\\eta) & = \\\\frac{-\\\\mu_{1}}{a\\\\left( \\\\cosh \\\\xi - \\\\cos \\\\eta \\\\right)} - \\\\frac{\\\\mu_{2}}{a\\\\left( \\\\cosh \\\\xi + \\\\cos \\\\eta \\\\right)} [8pt] & = \\\\frac{-\\\\mu_{1} \\\\left( \\\\cosh \\\\xi + \\\\cos \\\\eta \\\\right) - \\\\mu_{2} \\\\left( \\\\cosh \\\\xi - \\\\cos \\\\eta \\\\right)}{a\\\\left( \\\\cosh^{2} \\\\xi - \\\\cos^{2} \\\\eta \\\\right)}, \\\\end{align} and the kinetic energy as : T = \\\\frac{ma^{2}}{2} \\\\left( \\\\cosh^{2} \\\\xi - \\\\cos^{2} \\\\eta \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\dot{\\\\xi}^{2} + \\\\dot{\\\\eta}^{2} \\\\right). This is a Liouville dynamical system if Œæ and Œ∑ are taken as œÜ1 and œÜ2, respectively; thus, the function Y equals : \\\\,Y = \\\\cosh^{2} \\\\xi - \\\\cos^{2} \\\\eta and the function W equals : W = -\\\\mu_{1} \\\\left( \\\\cosh \\\\xi + \\\\cos \\\\eta \\\\right) - \\\\mu_{2} \\\\left( \\\\cosh \\\\xi - \\\\cos \\\\eta \\\\right). Using the general solution for a Liouville dynamical system, one obtains : \\\\frac{ma^{2}}{2} \\\\left( \\\\cosh^{2} \\\\xi - \\\\cos^{2} \\\\eta \\\\right)^{2} \\\\dot{\\\\xi}^{2} = E \\\\cosh^{2} \\\\xi + \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\mu_{1} + \\\\mu_{2}}{a} \\\\right) \\\\cosh \\\\xi - \\\\gamma : \\\\frac{ma^{2}}{2} \\\\left( \\\\cosh^{2} \\\\xi - \\\\cos^{2} \\\\eta \\\\right)^{2} \\\\dot{\\\\eta}^{2} = -E \\\\cos^{2} \\\\eta + \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\mu_{1} - \\\\mu_{2}}{a} \\\\right) \\\\cos \\\\eta + \\\\gamma Introducing a parameter u by the formula : du = \\\\frac{d\\\\xi}{\\\\sqrt{E \\\\cosh^2 \\\\xi + \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\mu_1 + \\\\mu_2}{a} \\\\right) \\\\cosh \\\\xi - \\\\gamma}} = \\\\frac{d\\\\eta}{\\\\sqrt{-E \\\\cos^2 \\\\eta + \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\mu_1 - \\\\mu_2}{a} \\\\right) \\\\cos \\\\eta + \\\\gamma}}, gives the parametric solution : u = \\\\int \\\\frac{d\\\\xi}{\\\\sqrt{E \\\\cosh^{2} \\\\xi + \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\mu_{1} + \\\\mu_{2}}{a} \\\\right) \\\\cosh \\\\xi - \\\\gamma}} = \\\\int \\\\frac{d\\\\eta}{\\\\sqrt{-E \\\\cos^{2} \\\\eta + \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\mu_{1} - \\\\mu_{2}}{a} \\\\right) \\\\cos \\\\eta + \\\\gamma}}. Since these are elliptic integrals, the coordinates Œæ and Œ∑ can be expressed as elliptic functions of u.

Formed by the Organic Act of 1801 from parts of Montgomery and Prince George's County, Maryland, Washington County referred to all of the District of Columbia \\"on the east side of the Potomac, together with the islands therein.\\" The bed of the Potomac River was considered to be part of Washington County as well. Originally Alexandria County, D.C. formed the portion of the District west of the Potomac, ceded by the commonwealth of Virginia. Alexandria County, including the City of Alexandria, was returned to Virginia by Congress in 1846, leaving just Washington County. Within Washington County there were two incorporated areas, the City of Washington and the City of Georgetown. At times the rural parts outside of the cities were referred to as \\"Washington County\\" but all three were part of the county. Upon the passage of the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1871, the three governments were unified under a single District government and made coterminous, ending Washington County's separate identity. Government Starting in 1801, Washington County was governed by a board of commissioners, or a levy court, made up all of the Justices of the Peace, or magistrates, of the county appointed by the President and the number of those were not fixed. In 1812, the board was reorganized with seven magistrates, two from east of Rock Creek but outside of Washington City, two from west of Rock Creek but outside of Georgetown and three from Georgetown, with none from Washington City until 1848 when four members from the City were added. The board was again changed in 1863 when it was reduced to nine members, three from the city of Washington, one from Georgetown, and five from county lands outside the city. These justices carried out the duties of county commissioners. Despite being within the federal territory, Congress left Washington County subject to the laws of Maryland. History Rural Washington County, the part outside of the cities, included Pleasant Plains, the estate of the Holmead family; Edgewood, home of Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase; and Petworth, the estate of Colonel John Tayloe III. Also contained in rural Washington County was the U.S. Soldiers' Retirement Home, where President Abraham Lincoln lived during his summers as President. Despite its comparatively large geographic size, rural Washington County was sparsely populated until the end of the 19th century. Slavery was legal in Washington County, as it was in Maryland, but it was illegal to import a slave from Alexandria County for sale in Washington County. Slavery was ended in Washington County in April 1862 by the District of Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act. It was the last part of the United States to end slavery before the 13th Amendment ended it throughout the country. During the American Civil War (1861‚Äì65), Washington County contained a partial circle of defensive fortifications that made Washington one of the most heavily fortified cities in the world at that time. The forts surrounding Union-held territory in Virginia completed the defense circle. The Battle of Fort Stevens, July 11‚Äì12, 1864, took place in Washington County. After the Civil War, many of the old estates in Washington County were sold and developed into suburbs for the growing capital city. Among the earliest developments were LeDroit Park and Mount Pleasant, which eventually became the first \\"streetcar suburb\\". Uniontown and Barry Farm, a settlement for freedmen, developed east of the Anacostia River. Washington County and the cities of Washington and Georgetown were abolished in 1871 following the passage of the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1871. This law brought the entire District of Columbia under the control of a territorial government headed by an appointed governor, an appointed eleven-member council, and a locally elected 22-member assembly. Two of the eleven council seats were reserved for representatives from the District outside of the cities of Washington and Georgetown. Three years later, Congress abolished the territorial government in favor of direct rule over the District by an appointed three-member commission. See also *History of Washington, D.C.

The HSA was cosponsored by 118 members of Congress. The act passed the U.S. Senate by a vote of 90-9, with one Senator not voting. It was signed into law by President George W. Bush in November 2002. HSA created the United States Department of Homeland Security and the new cabinet-level position of Secretary of Homeland Security. It is the largest federal government reorganization since the Department of Defense was created via the National Security Act of 1947 (as amended in 1949). It also includes many of the organizations under which the powers of the USA PATRIOT Act are exercised. Background The Homeland Security Advisory System scale. The new department assumed a large number of services, offices and other organizations previously conducted in other departments, such as the Customs Service, Coast Guard, and U.S. Secret Service. It superseded, but did not replace, the Office of Homeland Security, which retained an advisory role. The Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2004 provided the new department its first funding. A major reason for the implementation of HSA is to ensure that the border function remains strong within the new Department. The Act is similar to the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act (IRTPA) in reorganizing and centralizing Federal security functions to meet post‚ÄìCold War threats and challenges. Like IRTPA, there are some inherent contradictions in the bill not solved by reorganization. These reflect compromises with other committees needed to secure passage, but the result is at times inconsistent or conflicting authorities. For example, the Act identifies the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) first responsibility as preventing terrorist attacks in the United States; but, the law's language makes clear that investigation and prosecution of terrorism remains with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and assigns DHS only an analytical and advisory role in intelligence activities. Similarly, with Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP), which relates to the preparedness and response to serious incidents, the Act gave DHS broad responsibility to minimize damage but only limited authority to share information and to coordinate the development of private sector best practices. Establishments The Homeland Security Act of 2002 is the foundation for many other establishments, including: # the Department of Homeland Security, which is headed by the Secretary of Homeland Security # an established Directorate for Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection within the Department of Homeland Security, which is headed by the Under Secretary for Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection. # the Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002 # the Cyber Security Enhancement Act of 2002 Titles The Homeland Security Act of 2002 documented under Public Law is divided into 17 titles that establishes the Department of Homeland Security and other purposes. Each title is broken down into several sections, summarized below. :1. Department of Homeland Security ::Title I consists of three sections that establish the Department of Homeland Security, which carries out several missions that comply with the United States Code. :2. Information Analysis And Infrastructure Protection ::Title II consists of two subtitles, including the Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002, and nineteen sections, including the Cyber Security Enhancement Act of 2002. It is headed by the Under Secretary and used to access, receive and analyze law enforcement information, intelligence information, and other information from federal, state, and local government agencies for further use towards the prevention of terrorist acts. :3. Science And Technology In Support of Homeland Security ::Title III consists of thirteen sections. It is described as a plan to develop national policy and strategic plans to develop countermeasures for chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and other emerging terrorist threats. It also establishes, conducts, and administers primary research and development. :4. Directorate Of Border And Transportation Security ::Title IV consists of forty-eight sections and regulates what comes in out of United States territory in an effort to prevent terrorists and instruments of terrorism. This is done generally by securing the borders, territorial waters, ports, terminals, waterways, and air, land, and sea transportation systems of the United States, including managing and coordinating governmental activities at ports of entry. :5. Emergency Preparedness and Response ::Title V consists of nine sections and it helps to ensure the response time and preparedness of providers for terrorist attacks, major disasters and other emergencies. In addition, it establishes standards, joint exercises and trainings and providing funds to the United States Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency. :6. Treatment of Charitable Trusts For Members Of The Armed Forces Of The United States And Other Governmental Organizations ::Title VI consists of one section which, through several requirements, designates the late Central Intelligence Agency officer Johnny Michael Spann as a trust fund for distribution towards surviving spouses, children, or dependent parents, grandparents, or siblings of Government related service members. :7. Management ::Title VII consists of six sections which is headed by the Under Security to manage the budget, appropriations, expenditures of funds, accounting, and finance, human resources, information technology, and procurement of the Departments. :8. Coordination With Non-Federal Entities; Inspector General; United States Secret Service; Coast Guard; General Provisions ::Title VIII consists of fifty-three sections that establishes an Office for State and Local Governments to oversee and coordinate Departmental programs for and relationships with State and local governments. :9. National Homeland Security Council ::Title IX consists of six sections which establishes a \\"Homeland Security Council\\" within the Executive Office of the President. This Council functions as an advisor to the President. :10. Information Security ::Title X consists of seven sections regarding the establishment of several divisions of information security.

The script was originally penned by writer Vince Gilligan for a film class at New York University. It was filmed in Lockhart, Taylor and Bastrop, Texas. Plot The film opens at Burger- Matic, where Henry Lever orders a milkshake at the drive-thru. At the window, he tells the attendant, Sally Jackson, that his wife knows about their affair. She asks him if he has also told his wife about her pregnancy. On his way home, he encounters a ferocious wind. It turns out to be a Cobra attack helicopter, which runs him off the road. In a panic, he flees through the woods and drops his heart medication. At an outdoor chapel, he sits on a bench as the helicopter hovers in front of him. The pilot, Angus Montier, shoots at the ground near him despite the protests of his copilot and brother, Dorian. The shots scare him enough to cause a fatal heart attack. Throughout their attack, Dorian and Angus can hear the chatter of Sally and her coworkers. Likewise, they can hear the helicopter pilots on their headsets. The next day, the police inform Beatrice Lever that Henry has died. She appears shocked and crestfallen, when Dorian and Angus arrive. It quickly becomes clear that she encouraged her sons to scare him to death. She is also furious about his affair, and wants revenge on his mistress. Angus and Dorian are worried that the people they heard on the radio might have overheard enough to connect them to his death. They quickly deduce that Burger-Matic is the only location close enough to have been on the same frequency. Angus goads Dorian into getting a job there to ensure that no one is wise to their crime. Sally is heartbroken at the news about Henry. At work, Dorian bonds with her quickly. He gives her a model helicopter for her baby, and he explains that he and Angus fly them as reservists for the National Guard. She asks him to accompany her to lamaze class, since she doesn't have a partner. Eventually, he takes her to the base to see the helicopter that he flies. As she sits in the cockpit, she tells him about Henry. Knowing that his mother is still furious about Henry's affair and that Angus would hurt Sally if he knew her identity, Dorian frantically tries to keep the truth from his family. When Angus discovers Sally's identity, Beatrice visits her under the pretense of making amends. Dorian is terrified of what Angus might do out of a misplaced loyalty to their crazy mother. Sure enough, he arrives at Sally's house in the attack helicopter. She, Dorian, and Beatrice escape in a truck. He eventually forces them to stop on the road. Beatrice pretends to be unaware of what is going on and leaves the truck. Dorian gradually convinces Angus to stop his attack. The stress of the chase triggers Sally's labor, and Dorian drives her to the hospital. After she has a boy, he talks to him. He struggles to explain how they are related, and he tells him that he is lucky to have the best mother in the world.

She was murdered in Anapu, a city in the state of Par√°, in the Amazon Basin of Brazil. Stang had been outspoken in her efforts on behalf of the poor and the environment and had previously received death threats from loggers and landowners. Her cause for canonization as a martyr and model of sanctity is underway within the Congregation for the Causes of Saints. Life work Born on 7 June 1931 in Dayton, Ohio but naturalized Brazilian, She entered the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur community in 1948 and professed final vows in 1956. From 1951 to 1966, she taught elementary school classes at St. Victor School in Calumet City, Illinois, St. Alexander School in Villa Park, Illinois and Most Holy Trinity School in Phoenix, Arizona. She began her ministry in Brazil in 1966, in Coroat√°, Maranh√£o. Stang dedicated her life to defending the Brazilian rainforest from depletion from agriculture. She worked as an advocate for the rural poor beginning in the early 1970s, helping peasants make a living by farming small plots and extracting forest products without deforestation. She also sought to protect peasants from criminal gangs working on behalf of ranchers who were after their plots. Dot, as she was called by her family, friends and most locals in Brazil, is often pictured wearing a T-shirt with the slogan, \\"A Morte da floresta √© o fim da nossa vida\\" which is Portuguese for \\"The Death of the Forest is the End of Our Lives\\". Murder On the morning of 12 February 2005, Stang woke up early to walk to a community meeting to speak about the rights for the Amazon. Ciero, a farmer Stang invited to the meeting, was going to be late. Ciero was a couple of minutes behind Stang, but he was able to see her and hid from the two armed men who followed her. She progressed on and was blocked by the two men, Clodoaldo Carlos Batista and Raifran das Neves Sales, who worked in a livestock company. They asked if she had any weapons, and she claimed that the only weapon would be her Bible. She then read a passage from the Beatitudes, \\"Blessed are the poor in spirit...\\" She continued a couple of steps but was suddenly stopped when Ciero called her \\"sister\\", as she was held at gunpoint by Raifran. When Clodoaldo approved of discharging at Stang, Raifran fired a round at Stang's abdomen. She fell face down on the ground. Raifran fired another round into Stang's back, then fired all four remaining rounds into her head.Murphy, Roseanne S.N.D. de N. Martyr of the Amazon: The Life of Sister Dorothy Stang. Maryknoll, New York 10545: Orbis Books, 2007. Investigation and trials The US Attorney's Office, Transnational Crime Unit, in Washington, DC, pursued an indictment of the four people (three in custody, one at large) under Title 18, USC 2332, a statute on international homicide. The key elements of this statute require 1) the victim be a US citizen, 2) that the murder takes place outside the US, and 3) that the murder was carried out to influence, pressure, or coerce a government or civilian group. Stang's murder met all the key elements. In June 2005, two men were charged with conspiracy to murder an American outside the United States in connection with her death. These men, Rayfran das Neves Sales and Clodoaldo Carlos Batista, were convicted on 10 December 2005. On 15 May 2007, a court in the city of Bel√©m sentenced Vitalmiro Bastos de Moura, aged 36, to the maximum term of 30 years in prison for paying gunmen to shoot Stang. Stang's brother David, who was at the trial, said: \\"justice was done.\\" In a second trial, Moura was acquitted of all charges, because the gunman, Rayfran das Neves Sales, declared in court to have killed Dorothy Stang for personal motivation. The prosecution appealed, however, and Moura was found guilty, and re-sentenced to 30 years in prison, on 12 April 2010. Rayfran das Neves Sales was retried on 22 October 2007. He was again found guilty, and a judge in Bel√©m sentenced him to 27 years in prison-the same punishment as in the first trial in 2005. Prosecutors said Moura had ordered Stang's death because she had sent letters to the local authorities accusing Moura of setting illegal fires to clear land, which led to his receiving a substantial fine. At a third trial, on 6 May 2008, Rayfran das Neves Sales was sentenced to 28 years in prison. Regivaldo Pereira Galv√£o, a rancher suspected of ordering the killing, was arrested in December 2008 and was to be charged with the murder. He had been arrested previously for the murder but released. On 7 April 2009, the Court of Justice, in Par√°, decided to void the third trial. The same court decided to put Vitalmiro Bastos de Moura back in jail but Moura's lawyer appealed that decision. A new trial was to be scheduled. On 22 April 2009, Superior Court of Justice of Brazil set Vitalmiro Moura free until a final decision about his request of Habeas corpus. Roniery Lopes, a witness in the trial of Regivaldo Galv√£o for fraud, was shot in November 2009, just before he was to testify. On 4 February 2010, Superior Court of Justice revoked Vitalmiro Moura's habeas corpus. Moura was arrested on 7 February, after surrendering voluntarily to police. On 12 April 2010, he was convicted again by a jury and sentenced to 30 years in prison. On 1 May 2010, Regivaldo Galv√£o was also convicted of having ordered the murder. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison. On 21 August 2012, the Brazilian Supreme Court conceded a Habeas Corpus to Regivaldo Galv√£o. The defense attorney claims that the jury decided to condemn Reginaldo before all the legal recourses available to the defendant were exhausted. Regivaldo Galv√£o was freed the following day. On 15 May 2013, Brazil's Supreme Court overturned the conviction of Vitalmiro Moura. On 19 September 2013, Moura was convicted of the murder for a fourth time and sentenced to 30 years in prison by a court in Par√° State.Reuters.

Documentary On 2 March, U.S. Ambassador John Danilovich met with Dorothy Stang's brother David, Daniel Junge, who was traveling with Stang to film a documentary, and Sister Mary Ellis McCabe, a member of Dorothy's religious congregation who was stationed in Cear√°, Brazil. Stang and Junge were in Bras√≠lia to meet with Minister of Justice Marcio Thomaz Bastos after visiting the site of Stang's sister's murder in Para state. Stang thanked the Ambassador for the Embassy's support and said that he was pleased with the Brazilian federal government's reaction. He was very critical, however, of Para state authorities for failing to protect his sister and for failing to offer their condolences during his visit. In 2008, the American filmmaker Daniel Junge released a documentary titled They Killed Sister Dorothy. The film is narrated by Martin Sheen in the version in English and by Wagner Moura in the version in Portuguese. The film received the Audience Award and the Competition Award at the 2008 South by Southwest Festival, where it had its worldwide premi√®re. Opera In 2009, Evan Mack composed an opera based on the life of Sr. Dorothy Stang. Angel of the Amazon depicts her life's work, her devotion to her mission with Brazilian peasant farmers, and the events that sent her on a path of martyrdom. Encompass New Opera Theatre developed the opera in 2010.  Other notable mentions  A brief overview of the circumstances and murder of Sister Dorothy Stang is discussed in the movie Cowspiracy (2014).
