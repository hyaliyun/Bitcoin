Music Like many songs from Murmur, \\"Perfect Circle\\" has a sound typified by unusual instruments and recording techniques. The song opens with Honky tonk piano, a style more associated with ragtime and early country music than the college rock scene of which R.E.M. was a member. Two pianos were recorded, and the slightly out-of-sync sound and reverb achieve a detached otherworldly effect. The song also features Peter Buck's 12 string guitar. After R.E.M.'s drummer Bill Berry left the band in 1997 for personal reasons, the band began reintroducing \\"Perfect Circle\\" into their live performances and radio appearances to promote their then forthcoming album Up. During this time period, members of the band stated that the song was primarily written by Berry and dedicated their performance of it to him. Lyrics The lyrics of \\"Perfect Circle\\" are purposely opaque. Members of the band agree that the song has an emotional theme that can be interpreted in many ways. For guitarist Peter Buck, the song elicits images of children playing football one evening in Trenton, New Jersey. Singer Michael Stipe interprets the song as being about longing in a relationship. He also has stated that other interpretations are equally valid: \\"It was an intensely personal song to me. I really like that it can mean two different things. ...

It spans an area of , which is located between East 138th and 145th Street and covers two main avenues, Third Avenue and Morris Avenue.  Development  Construction on the Patterson Houses began in 1948 and were a part of a large push to build public housing developments in the five boroughs. It was the first low rent development completed in the Bronx since World War II and the first families moved into the development in March 1950 with priority for veterans. It was completed on December 31, 1950 and named after judge Lester Patterson (1893‚Äì1947). The development's playground was later completed in 1953, and was used by the adjacent school P.S. 13 during school hours. Tenants of the development in the 1950s were a diverse mix of people from the South, Caribbean, and Puerto Rico. They introduced each other to their cultures including food and music. Many inter-ethnic marriages resulted from the fusion of cultures. By the early 1960s, crime in NYCHA developments had risen and the agency added extra detectives to help control crime at 28 developments including Patterson. By the late 1960s, tenants felt that policing was inadequate in the development and an increase in muggings and burglaries due to drugs being found on the site and went on strike by withholding rent from the agency. NYCHA took the tenants to court and the judge sided with the agency citing state law that lack of police presence wasn't a violation that tenants could withhold rent for. This resulted in tenants paying $25,000 in back rent.

They build a variety of freestanding structures and additions for each other, as well as helping others build their own, and sharing natural building skills through affordable workshops. Principles Mudgirls promote the use of natural, local, and recycled materials, and are committed to the principles of sustainable development espoused by the permaculture movement. Although they sometimes collaborate with male craftspeople and welcome men as clients and workshop participants, Mudgirls are strictly a women's collective. Part of their mandate is to empower women with employment and the skills in the traditionally male-dominated field of construction. This associates them with the feminism and ecofeminism movements. Free childcare is provided at all Mudgirls events to encourage mothers to participate. Mudgirls promote non- capitalist business practices and economic accessibility. Their wages and material costs are low in order to keep their fees low, and encourage alternative economic systems such as barter. Mudgirls have non-hierarchical organization. All members earn the same wages and are encouraged to share responsibilities equally. Decision are made in a consensus-based manner using nonviolent communication. Projects Mudgirls have constructed a variety of freestanding structures, ranging from small cookie stands, ovens, and outhouses to multi-story homes. They have also done renovations and additions to pre-existing structures, such as roofs, floors and walls. Their work can be found throughout the south-west coast of Canada, particularly Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands. Materials Mudgirls specialize in using cob, as well as other natural material such as strawbale, driftwood, cordwood, earthen plasters and natural insulations, and recycled materials like window panes, car tires and glass bottles.

The Union victory opened up the Culpeper region to Federal control, a prelude to the subsequent Bristoe Campaign. Background On September 12, 1863, the Army of the Potomac's 10,000-man Union cavalry corps under Maj. Gen. Alfred Pleasonton left camp near Warrenton, Virginia, and crossed the Rappahannock River, where various elements concentrated near the hamlet of Sulphur Springs. Their objective was to attack Confederate Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart's headquarters at Culpeper Court House, the seat of Culpeper County. Battle At 4 a.m. the following day, Pleasonton's three divisions moved forward nearly two miles, fording the Hazel River and approaching Culpeper. Advancing in three columns, the Union troopers drove off scattered Confederate pickets and skirmishers. Near the main Confederate defensive line at 1 p.m., 1st Division commander Brig. Gen. H. Judson Kilpatrick ordered a mounted charge by the Michigan Brigade of Brig. Gen. George Armstrong Custer, which carried the Confederate position centered at the railroad depot. Custer seized more than 100 prisoners, as well as three artillery pieces. The three columns converged at Culpeper and continued their advance, driving the Confederates towards the Rapidan River in heavy skirmishing. At nightfall, the victorious Federals encamped near Cedar Mountain, with the Confederates across Raccoon Ford on the Rapidan. Maj. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren's II Corps occupied Culpeper Court House, although his infantry took no part in the cavalry skirmishing.O.R., Series I, Vol. XXIX, Part 1, p. 9. Probing actions the next two days indicated the new Confederate position across the Rapidan was too strong to carry. References * Newhall, Walter S., Walter S. Newhall: A Memoir.

It was formed in 1997 as a partnership between the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), Global Tiger Patrol (GTP) and Tusk Force (both now defunct) so that the three groups could collaborate, rather than compete, in raising money for tigers in the UK. The two current members of the coalition are Zoological Society of London (ZSL) and Dreamworld Wildlife Foundation (DWF). Based in offices provided by ZSL and with administration funded by a sponsor, it is able to spend 100% of funds raised on tiger projects. 21st Century Tiger is one of the top seven contributors to tiger conservation worldwide (IUCN Cat Projects Database, unpubl.) and since its inception it has provided over ¬£2 million to over 70 tiger projects in seven countries. In 2018 21st Century Tiger merged with the Amur Leopard and Tiger Alliance to become WildCats Conservation Alliance. History 21st Century Tiger was established in 1997 and formally launched at the Tigers 2000 meeting at ZSL in 1997 by John Gummer, the then UK Minister for the Environment.Seidensticker et al., \\"Riding the Tiger\\", p. xiii It assisted the UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) in channeling funds for tiger conservation to effective projects in tiger range. Current support has come from members of the public, businesses, and notably from zoos, particularly in Europe and Australasia. Realising the potential fundraising abilities of the European Zoo community, between 2002 and 2004 the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) Tiger Campaign in European zoos raised over three-quarters of a million euros which was channelled through 21st Century Tiger. Over 130 zoos in 24 countries took part in the campaign, from Finland to France and from Ireland to Russia. Zoo and Aquarium Association (Australasia) formerly known as ARAZPA, launched a parallel tiger campaign during 2003, also using 21st Century Tiger to channel the funds and raised more than A$100,000. ZAAA zoos hold only the Sumatran tiger, unlike European zoos which have both Amur and Sumatran, and their efforts continue to be focused on projects in Sumatra. Projects Since its inception, 21st Century Tiger has funded over 70 projects, distributing over ¬£2 million and supported projects in seven countries - India, Indonesia, China, Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand and Russia. The projects cover a wide spectrum of requirements for tiger conservation, including training for wildlife rangers in the application of wildlife law, jungle survival and identification of endangered species, support for anti-poaching units which deal directly with poachers, uncover networks of illegal trading, and even advise in cases of human-tiger conflict. In Russia and Indonesia scientific research is also funded, including studies of tiger home ranges and tiger prey densities, and of methods for limiting the habitat damage caused by economic development. Comprehensive and thorough research provides a sound scientific basis for conservation planning and is an essential part of any conservation programme. 21st Century Tiger also funds education and awareness raising programmes within tiger range countries; vital for ensuring sustainable local support for wildlife conservation. 21st Century Tiger works with a range of organisations from the internationally known Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) to small, focused local groups such as Phoenix Fund in Russia. All projects submitted for funding are rigorously examined by a panel of international experts. The projects must have sound practical scientific and conservation value and use local staff wherever possible. Year of the Tiger and beyond The international conservation community who met at the Kathmandu Tiger Workshop in late 2009, announced in their official recommendations that we should \\"celebrate 2010, Year of the Tiger, throughout the world, to create global awareness of the critical plight of the wild tiger and enlist broad and deep support for their conservation\\". 21st Century Tiger did just that and worked with other NGOs, businesses, the zoo community and members of the public and raised over ¬£144,000 for tigers. The International Tiger Forum took place in St. Petersburg, described by Simon Stuart of the IUCN as \\"the most significant meeting ever held to discuss the fate of a single non-human species\\". The conference brought the plight of wild tigers to the world's attention, there were promises of funding, attendance by world leaders and much press. The initial push during 2010 was impressive, but that momentum must be sustained to ensure a future for tigers in the wild.

The special was first broadcast May 17, 1988 on CBS and February 24, 1989 on CITV. It has only been released on VHS home video. Synopsis The program featured the people behind the strips and animated adaptations, which include *A very brief animated short made in 1980 from The Fantastic Funnies (two years before Here Comes Garfield) by Bill Melendez and Lee Mendelson (well known for their Peanuts specials) featuring jokes from the strips of June 21 and August 2, 1978 and July 7, 1979. *A recording session for the upcoming Garfield and Friends series (with Lorenzo Music, Gregg Berger and Thom Huge), apart from some footage from it and from Garfield: His 9 Lives. *Spanish- and German-dubbed clips of Here Comes Garfield and Garfield Goes Hollywood respectively were shown. *A sneak peek for the unproduced feature film Garfield's Judgment Day. *A rehearsal for the theme song of Garfield's Babes and Bullets. *A chat Davis has with Dik Browne (H√§gar the Horrible, Hi and Lois), Mike Peters (Mother Goose and Grimm) and Lynn Johnston (For Better or For Worse). The last part of the program features the celebrations held for the strip's anniversary, most notably the one where fellow cartoonists drew their characters as their \\"presents\\", followed by man-in-the-street interviews about Garfield, before the camera shows him and Odie (both played by human actors) living the \\"good life\\" in Hollywood (even Garfield takes his time to kick Odie).

The island is formed where the Back River breaks off to the north from the Savannah River. Historically, Hutchinson Island's land use has been primarily industrial, much of which supported the Port of Savannah, one of the busiest containerization cargo ports in the world. The island is roughly long and wide at its widest point. History The island was named after Archibald Hutchinson, an acquaintance of General Oglethorpe. It played a major role in the capture of Savannah during the American Civil War. After capturing Atlanta, Union Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman turned his army east and south, toward the Atlantic Ocean, and arrived in Savannah in December 1864. Rather than destroying Savannah, Sherman elected to demand the city's surrender. Confederate Gen. William J. Hardee led his troops, under cover of darkness, across the Savannah River on a makeshift pontoon bridge, across Hutchinson Island and into the South Carolina wilderness. On the Back River, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers formerly maintained a tidal control system that slowed the natural filling-in of the main river's shipping channel. The tide gate was abandoned after studies showed that it had increased saltwater intrusion into the upriver freshwater Savannah National Wildlife Refuge. Facilities 150px Totaling approximately , Hutchinson Island was targeted as the site for a public- private partnership to build a convention center and hotel. Chatham County voters approved spending $63 million in public special-purpose local-option sales tax money for the trade center and $10 million for the road system on the island. The Savannah International Trade and Convention Center and the Westin Savannah Harbor Resort were built. In addition, the state of Georgia provided $18 million, and former land owner CSX railroad donated for the public trade center. While much of Hutchinson Island has been trade convention and resort-oriented in the past, the island's first residential community is under way, The Reserve at Savannah Harbor, and plans are being drawn to develop the riverfront into a mixed-use, urban extension of Savannah. The Georgia Ports Authority and International Paper still own undeveloped tracts of land on the far west end of Hutchinson Island. =Grand Prize of America Road Course= In the 1990s, a group of local businessmen formed the Colonial Motorsport company, deciding it was time to bring back international racing action to Savannah. Major international races had last been held on the streets of Savannah with the American Grand Prize in 1908, 1910, and 1911; and the Vanderbilt Cup Race in 1911. After four years of careful negotiations, an agreement was reached for a stand-alone race of the then PPG/Firestone Indy Lights series in 1997, with follow up events in '98 and '99 offering the possibility of a future CART round. Public monies helped build a 1.965-mile county road to serve as a 10-turn circuit; the first time a public road had been pre-designed with the intention of also using it for racing in the USA. In May 1997 the inaugural Dixie Crystals Grand Prix was held, with support races for the North American Touring Car Championship, Barber Dodge Pro Series, and the U.S. F2000 National Championship. Before of a race day crowd of over 30,000, future Indianapolis 500 winner, H√©lio Castroneves, won the race. Mark Blundell quoted, after a feasibility test for future CART races, \\"As a drivers track, it's good, It's quite demanding and really physical. It's a fun circuit to drive, and there are at least two and possibly three spots for overtaking. It doesn't have a street course feel, it's more of a road course feel. From a spectator viewpoint, there are plenty of great vantage points.\\"The Hilton Head Island Motoring Festival & Concours d'Elegance  Savannah Speed Classic The event looked like a modest success; drivers seemed happy with the course, fans turned out in reasonable numbers, and a contract was in place for future years. However, creditors and several companies involved in the construction didn't want to give the promoters a reasonable time frame to make the event profitable. The resulting lawsuit threw Colonial Motorsport company into Chapter 11, and all its contracts, including the one with CART, were dissolved. The track itself came into public ownership and fell into disrepair. In the 2010s the track was reworked and reopened for historic racing. Historic Sportscar Racing (HSR) has been sanctioning the Savannah Speed Classic, part of the Hilton Head Island Motoring Festival & Concours d'Elegance, taking place the last weekend of October (in Savannah) through the first weekend in November (in Hilton Head Island) each year. Access Ferry boats take visitors and residents across the Savannah River on a regular, daily schedule. The island can also be accessed by car from the south, via the Talmadge Memorial Bridge, and from the north, in South Carolina, via U.S. Highway 17.

Establishing Psychology Department in Pakistan After returning from England, he was appointed lecturer in psychology in the department of Philosophy at Government College. Psychology was not recognised or established as a separate subject. This became his lifelong passion, to introduce and establish psychology in Pakistan, starting with the Government College Lahore. His efforts ultimately yielded results and a separate psychology department was established and he became its first head and professor. He established the first ever counselling center in Pakistan, in his department and established the Lahore Mental Health Society. His popularity increased due to his scholarship and charisma.Later, he was the driving force in establishing National Institute of Psychology, in Islamabad. This institute was later named after him to become Dr. Mohammad Ajmal National Institute of Psychology, and continues to this day as the most important centre of teaching and research related to Psychology in Pakistan. He was admired and loved by his students because of his enchanting teaching style. He was a quiet and reflective man but had great passion for all things human and psychological. His fame and popularity were heightened by his frequent appearances on radio and TV lectures and discussions. Many years after his death, his son Dr Muhammad Asir Ajmal became the head of GCU Psychology Department which had been set up by his late father.

Before his death in 1994, of sudden cardiac arrest, he had become an icon of scholarship, honesty and moral uprightness. He was considered one of the greatest and influential scholars of Pakistan and South Asia. Within his lifetime, he achieved the colossal task of making psychology one of the most popular subjects in the country, establishing psychology departments in all colleges, universities and educational institutions. He was a humble man and never really saw himself as a famous icon, idealised by thousands. He also established the Center of Excellence, The National Institute of Psychology at Quaid-i-Azam University. After his death, the Government of Pakistan named it after him and it is now \\"Dr. Ajmal National Institute of Psychology. He participated in activities of UNESCO and was visiting professor at Chicago and later, the first Iqbal Professor at Heidelberg University. He was given the title of 'National Professor of Psychology'. Islam-Marxism theory Dr Ajmal was successfully able to combine three parallel streams in his thought, Islam, Marxism, Sufism and Liberalism. He believed in the individual's right to self- expression without any restrictions from religion, state or any other authority. He also believed in equality of human beings and was opposed to the feudal power structures in Pakistan. But above all he was a Sufi who believed that love of God can truly liberate man from the clutches of materialism and all the suffering that results from attachment. It was due to such eclecticism that he was able to admire great personalities such as Frithjof Schuon, Iqbal, Mao Zedong and Rene Guenon simultaneously. His love for Prophet Muhammad was intense and deep. He believed in establishing a separate psychological construct for Muslim psyche and worked to establish a Muslim tradition of psychotherapy since the 1960s, based on Sufism.

He was born in Giessen. He wrote a biography of Louis XIV of France in 1715, and became secretary to King George I of Great Britain in 1719. During his stay in Italy he received the title of count. In 1741 he settled down in Leiden and married Joanna Maria Boerhaave, daughter of the famous Dutch physician Herman Boerhaave. Part of his art collection is still on display in the Dutch National Museum of Antiquities and in the in Utrecht. An anonymous portrait is kept by the Museum De Lakenhal in Leiden. Art collection In the 1730s Frederic Count de Thoms lived in Naples and had begun collecting antiquities. He had bought various of the most interesting pieces from art dealers in Rome, using his considerable capital. After he settled in the Dutch city of Leiden, part of the collection was placed in Oud Poelgeest, the castle of his wife's family. The rest of the art was set in the house in the city, Rapenburg 31. During his stay in Holland De Thoms invested a lot of time and money in the private museum he was planning for himself. After De Thoms' death at Leiden in 1746, the collection was sold to Dutch stadtholder William IV, Prince of Orange, for 30,000 guilders. The collection stayed in the Orange family until Napoleon's troops conquered the Netherlands and seized all art for transportation to Paris. In 1815, after Napoleon's defeat, the collection was returned and placed in various museums in Amsterdam, The Hague and Leiden. References and further reading *Halbertsma, R. B.

Prelude  The battle occurred after North Korea began a sustained campaign to redraw the maritime boundary line ‚Äì known as the Northern Limit Line (NLL) ‚Äì between the two Koreas. On 6 June 1999, North Korea's state-controlled Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) claimed that the \\"sea boundary line\\" had been violated by South Korean warships that had illegally trespassed in the North's territorial waters. The following day, three North Korean patrol boats and thirteen fishing boats belonging to the North Korean Navy (KPN) crossed the NLL off Yeonpyeong. The South Korean Navy (ROKN) responded by sending five fast boats and four patrol ships in a bid to prevent the North Koreans from crossing the NLL. On 8 June, seven North Korean patrol boats and seventeen fishing vessels repeatedly crossed the NLL between 05:55 and 23:20 local time. Twelve South Korean fast boats and four patrol ships were deployed and South Korean fishing boats were ordered to leave the area. The South Korean military issued a directive ordering a \\"bold response\\" to North Korean provocations, while stressing the need to uphold the rules of engagement. The first physical confrontation occurred on 9 June, when six North Korean patrol boats and five fishing boats crossed the NLL again. As on the previous day, the South Koreans deployed twelve patrol boats and four patrol ships. At 06:35, a North Korean patrol boat collided with a South Korean fast boat, causing minor damage. The South Korean Ministry of National Defense issued a statement calling on the North Koreans to desist. Further clashes occurred the following day when South Korean fast boats confronted four North Korean patrol boats that were accompanying a group of twenty fishing boats. The South Korean government decided at this point to use force to oppose further crossings of the NLL.

Four North Korean boats were damaged, two seriously, while three of the South Korean boats suffered damage to their hulls. The North Koreans retaliated on 12 June by attempting their own \\"bumping offensive\\" but were outmanoeuvred by the South Koreans. The North Korean Navy deployed three torpedo boats the next day, prompting a deployment of two s by the South Koreans on 14 June. By this time, the North Koreans' patrol boats had crossed the NLL 52 times and their fishing boats had crossed 62 times.  Main clash  The battle began on the morning of 15 June. The North Koreans had twenty fishing boats south of the NLL, which were joined at 08:45 by four patrol boats. The patrol boats began attempting to \\"bump\\" South Korean fast boats. At 09:04 they were reinforced by three North Korean torpedo boats which joined in the \\"bumping offensive\\". The South Koreans again outmanoeuvred the North Koreans and began ramming them, hitting six North Korean vessels in the stern. The North Korean patrol boat PT-381 found itself being bumped by two South Korean fast craft simultaneously, one hitting it in the stern and the other in the side. At 09:28, the crew of PT-381 fired machine guns and 25 mm cannon at the two South Korean fast craft. The South Koreans retaliated with a 20 mm Gatling gun and 40 mm and 76 mm weapons. During the next fourteen minutes, the South Koreans fired a total of 4,584 rounds of ammunition before breaking off the engagement. The battle resulted in the sinking of at least one forty-ton North Korean torpedo boat, severe damage to a 420-ton patrol craft, crippling of two 215-ton patrol boats and slight damage to two seventy-ton patrol boats. Official South Korean estimates put the casualties at seventeen to thirty North Korean personnel killed, though unofficial estimates suggested that the figure could have been over 100. One South Korean patrol ship and four fast craft were damaged and nine sailors were slightly injured.\\"KPA navy command spokesman on S. Korea's anti-DPRK campaign \\". KCNA, 19 June 1999  Post- battle  The North Koreans retreated to their side of the NLL by 11:00 and ceased crossing the line. Although military tensions on the Korean peninsula escalated for a while as a result of the battle, no further conflict resulted at that time. Despite the severe losses suffered by its navy, the North Korean government claimed victory; KCNA asserted that \\"more than ten enemy battleships were either burned or severely damaged and they had no alternative but to flee, taking many dead bodies and remnants with them.\\" Minor incidents and incursions concerning fishing in the area have since continued, including another naval skirmish in 2002 known as the \\"Second Battle of Yeonpyeong\\" and another in the 2009 known as the \\"Battle of Daecheong\\". In November 2010, North Korea attacked Yeonpyeong itself. Notes References  Van Dyke, Jon M., Mark J.

Perhaps coming from Fyvie in Formartine, from a family of Teesdale origin, Robert was Archdeacon of Ross and a student at the University of Bologna by 1269. In 1275, he was not only a graduate but the new Bishop of Ross, a post he held until his death in the first half of the 1290s. Early life and career There has been confusion over his name in some sources. Papal sources use S instead of F, Syvin instead of Fyvin, while Scottish sources use the F; Walter Bower erroneously believed his forename was \\"Thomas\\", a mistake that was followed by the early modern ecclesiastical historian Robert Keith.Dowden, Bishops, p. 213; Keith, Historical Catalogue, p. 187; Watt, Dictionary, p. 208. His name almost certainly indicates that he came from Fyvie, a royal burgh in the province of Formartine, a royal demesne territory under heavy influence from the immigrant le Cheyne family as well as the Comyn-controlled earldom of Buchan.Watt, Dictionary, p. 208. He is found as a student at the University of Bologna on 5 December 1269, when along with one Alan de Edinburgh he gave a receipt for 20 marks to some Florentine merchants; in this appearance he is recorded as Archdeacon of Ross, a position which, under the Fortrose Cathedral constitution of 1256, meant he must have already been in deacon's orders, as this constitution made that a prerequisite for holding the archdeaconry.Watt, Dictionary, p. 208; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 285. He must have become Archdeacon of Ross sometime after the last known archdeacon, Robert, had become consecrated as Bishop of Ross, that is, after either 1249 or 1250, though there may have been one or several unrecorded archdeacons in an intervening period.Watt, Dictionary, p. 208; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, pp. 267, 285. It is extremely probable that his accession to the archdeaconry owed something to Comyn influence, Fyvie being from Comyn's area of influence and Alexander Comyn, Earl of Buchan, being sheriff of Dingwall in the 1260s (1264‚Äì1266).Reid & Barrow, Sheriffs of Scotland, p. 10; Watt, Dictionary, p. 208. It is likely that Robert was still in Bologna in 1272; in that year, Robert was not one of the five compromissarii selected by the Ross cathedral chapter who elected Matthew as Bishop of Ross, but the chapter did appoint him to accompany Matthew to the papal court at Orvieto, presumably because he was conveniently still in Italy.Watt, Dictionary, pp. 208, 385. Robert had graduated with a Master's degree by 1275. Bishop of Ross Robert de Fyvie was back in Scotland when, on 8 April 1275, Pope Gregory X granted Robert de Fyvie, now Bishop-elect of Ross, mandate for local confirmation and consecration; the election had occurred at some point after the death of Bishop Matthew at the Second Council of Lyons in the summer of 1274.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 267. The decree of election had been presented to the Pope by Donnchadh and Master William, canons of the diocese of Ross; having been examined and approved by three cardinals, the mandate was sent to William Wishart, Bishop of St Andrews, and Hugh de Benin, Bishop of Aberdeen, instructing them to examine his fitness for the bishopric and, if they approved, consecrate him with the assistance of a third bishop.Dowden, Bishops, p. 213. The bishopric was still in crown hands in June, but it is probable that Robert was consecrated by 6 August, the date of the meeting of the Scottish prelates with the papal tax collector at Perth.Watt, Dictionary, p. 208; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 285. Bishop Robert appeared next on 16 September 1278, at Eddyrdor (now Redcastle), witnessing alongside three of his canons and Uilleam II, Earl of Ross, a grant to Beauly Priory. On 27 September 1279, at Kiltarlity in Inverness-shire, and on 26 March 1280, at Kinloss in Moray, Bishop Robert, along with his cathedral dean and the Prior of Beauly, acted as a papal judge-delegate in a dispute between Archibald, Bishop of Moray, and the lord of Beaufort, a French settlement in the Aird that had the Scottish name D√πnaidh (Dounie). On 18 July 1285, Pope Honorius IV issued Bishop Robert a letter protecting the bishop and his churches against alleged oppressions conducted by the officials of King Alexander III of Scotland; it is possible that Bishop Robert had travelled to the papal curia at Tivoli to obtain this protection. However, five years later the bishop found himself in trouble with the papacy. On 28 November 1290, Pope Nicholas IV commanded the Bishop of Aberdeen, Henry le Chen, Thomas de Balmerino, Abbot of Scone, and John de Haddington, Prior of St Andrews, to ensure that certain complaints regarding Bishop Robert were redressed; Bishop Robert's dean and cathedral chapter were unhappy regarding his alleged abuse of property, particularly the granting of money and benefices to his kinsmen and friends at the expense of the clergy of the diocese.Dowden, Bishops, p. 213; Watt, Dictionary, p. 208. Men who benefited under Robert's episcopate included a large number of Englishmen from the area around the River Tees, including Adam de Darlington, Thomas de Jar and John de Hedlam, perhaps indicating that Robert's family may have taken its ultimate origin from that area of England. Bishop Robert was one of the Scottish political figures present when the Treaty of Salisbury was confirmed as the Treaty of Birgham on 17 March 1290; he subsequently became one of the Comyn-backed auditors appointed for the case of John de Balliol at Norham, in the Great Cause.Dowden, Bishops, p. 213; Watt, Dictionary, pp. 208-9. Bishop Robert de Fyvie swore fealty to King Edward I of England on 1 August 1291, along with the Earl of Ross and Henry le Chen.Dowden, Bishops, p. 213; Watt, Dictionary, p. 209. He can be found as an auditor at Berwick during the proceedings, on 21 June, 6 November and 17 November 1292.Watt, Dictionary, p. 209. The bishop cannot be found in the records after 17 November, though no successor to the bishopric is known until 18 November 1295, making Bishop Robert's date and year of death something of a mystery.Dowden, Bishops, p. 213; Watt, Dictionary, p. 209; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 267.

Ekipa is the second Polish political fiction series after the 1980s miniseries The Career of Nicodemus Dyzma based on Tadeusz Do≈Çƒôga-Mostowicz's novel of the same name.  Creators  The series is directed by three directors - Agnieszka Holland, Magdalena ≈Åazarkiewicz and Katarzyna Adamik, and produced by ATM Grupa and Grupa Filmowa. Copyrights are owned by Telewizja Polsat. The script was created by Dominik Wieczorkowski-Rettinger and Wawrzyniec Smoczy≈Ñski. Plot The action of the series is set in present-day Poland. The story begins when Prime Minister and legendary opposition leader during Communist rule Henryk Nowasz of \\"Polish Centre Bloc\\" (Polski Blok Centrum) was suspected of being an agent of the former communist security services. Nowasz decided to resign in order to prevent a government downfall and proposed non- partisan 37-year-old Professor of Economy and Political Sciences Konstanty Turski, his friend and an unofficial advisor, to become a caretaker until he could prove his innocence. Turski was narrowly confirmed by the Sejm, with silent opposition of the coalition party, \\"Right-wing for Poland\\" (Prawica dla Polski), whose leader, Jan Matajewicz, soon became his archenemy, with support of his party colleague, President Juliusz Szczƒôsny and both far-right and left-wing opposition parties. Turski, however, soon proved to be an effective (but idealistic and unconventional) leader, but his administration is involved with serious odds with other politicians. The key ally of Matajewicz is deputy Sejm Marshal Krystyna Sochaczewska, a longtime Nowasz's friend from opposition and his successor as party leader.

However, there are some significant similarities to other U.S. political drama - Commander in Chief. Like Mackenzie Allen, Turski became a leader very accidentally. Also his chief opponent is Sejm Marshal, which could remind one of odds between Allen and Speaker of the House Nathan Templeton. Third of all: Turski preserved all cabinet of his predecessor just as Allen did, despite lack of loyalty from number of ministers. Nowasz's PBC is said to be based on former Freedom Union, while Matajewicz's PDP on Law and Justice.

Description  The coat of arms of Galicia includes, enclosed in a field of azure, a chalice of gold with a silver host, accompanied by seven silver crosses, three on each side and one in the center of the shield (representative of the seven historic provinces of Galicia). The royal crown in gules, i.e. red, enclosed in a golden ring set with precious stones, made up of eight acanthus leaf fleurons, out of which five are visible. Each leaf is set with pearls, and five tiaras are born from them to converge in a globe of azure, with the semi-meridian and the equator in gold, topped by a golden cross.  History  The historians Faustino Men√©ndez-Pidal and Juan Jos√© S√°nchez Badiola find the first references to it in two rolls of arms from the late 13th century ‚Äì in Segar's Roll and in the Armorial du H√©rault Vermandois ‚Äì which attribute the coat of arms to the king of Galicia, although by that time it did no longer exist as a separate title. The first source describes three uncovered chalices, whereas the second only describes one covered chalice. Since the Middle Ages, the concept of the chalice as a canting linguistic metaphor spread: chalice = Galice; many European authors eventually theorized about this fact from the 16th to the 18th centuries, a fact the Romanticist Galician author Manuel Murgu√≠a would later echo. Later rolls of arms also make reference to it, e.g. the Armorial Gymnich of Flanders (1445), and, especially, the Armorial Bergshammar, a compilation of some 3300 coats of arms belonging to states and families of almost all over Europe as of 1436. In that roll of arms it says \\"in the fourth turned sheet... a well-stylized big cup occupying as much space of the field as possible\\". Above the composition the word Galisci√©n (Galicia) is written. The most ancient remaining representations of the coat of arms in Galician civil architecture are also from the 15th century depicted in the Royal hospital of Santiago de Compostela, Betanzos town hall, Corunna walls, Lugo Cathedral's organ, Noia Church's tower, Moscosos residence in Laxe. From the 16th century onwards, crosses were added around the chalice as ornamentation. Joseph de Avil√©s, in \\"Heroic science\\", defined the coat of arms: \\"The kingdom of Galicia in Spain includes a field of azure with scattered crosses and a big golden cup and chalice\\".

He attended New York University, and served in a camera unit of the United States Air Force during the Second World War. Following the war, Levitt was the screenwriter for such films as The Boy with Green Hair (1948), Mrs. Mike (1950), and The Barefoot Mailman (1951). In 1951 he was called before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) for his communist involvements, and was entered on the Hollywood blacklist. Following a screenwriting credit for Dream Wife (1953), he was unemployed as a screenwriter for about five years. Levitt and Pearl Helen Slote (December 6, 1916 - April 3, 1993) were married in 1938; they had two children. Helen Slote Levitt, as Slote was called after her marriage, was also blacklisted in 1951. After more than five years, the Levitts were employed again as screenwriters. They were credited as \\"Tom and Helen August\\". Their credits included many episodes of television shows such as Bewitched and The Bionic Woman and also the feature films The Misadventures of Merlin Jones (1964) and The Monkey's Uncle (1965). In 1971 they were nominated for a Writers Guild Award for an episode of the television program, All in the Family. Their last credit was for a 1979 episode of the program Diff'rent Strokes. The Levitts' experiences as blacklisted screenwriters have been described in several books about the Hollywood blacklist.

Hitchcock House is a historic house museum in Cass County, Iowa, near the city of Lewis. Built in 1856 by the Congregationalist minister George B. Hitchcock, it has features indicative of its use as a \\"station\\" on the Underground Railway, corroborated by documentary evidence of Hitchcock's involvement in the shelter and transport of escaped slaves. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 2006. It now houses a museum. Description and history The Hitchcock House is located west of the city limits of Lewis, on a hill overlooking the western bank of the East Nishnabotna River. It is a two-story structure, built out of locally sourced random ashlar sandstone, and resting on a rubblestone foundation. Its walls are thick, and its interior framing is heavy hand-hewn timbers. Stylistically it is a vernacular interpretation of Federal period architecture. Unusual features of its interior include an apparently purpose-built basement chamber, whose access was probably concealed by a false cabinet. The other basement room is fitted with a cooking fireplace, and was accessible via an exterior entrance and by stairs from above. It is surmised that these rooms were used for the shelter and support of fugitive slaves. The minister George B. Hitchcock (1812‚Äì1872) built the house around 1855 and lived in it from 1856 to 1865. At the time of its construction, it overlooked two major east-west trails, leading to ferry crossings on the river. Hitchcock was involved in the American abolitionism movement known as the Underground Railroad, giving sanctuary to escaped slaves. The property was used as a farm until 1966, when it was sold to the state. It underwent a major restoration in the 1980s, and is now managed by the county as a historic house museum, interpreting the history of the Hitchcock family and the Underground Railroad.

Released the same year as but preceding the better known The Best Years of Our Lives, it covers much the same topic: the adjustment of World War II veterans to civilian life. It was based on the novel They Dream of Home by Niven Busch. Unlike the soldier, sailor and airman of The Best Years of Our Lives, the male leads in this film are all U.S. Marines. Fr√©d√©ric Chopin's Polonaise Op. 53 is played throughout the film; it was given lyrics and became a major hit at the time. Plot Right after VJ Day, two Marine Corps buddies, Cpl. Bill Tabeshaw (Mitchum) and Pfc. Cliff Harper (Madison), are among a group selected to return immediately to civilian life. Bill, a former cowboy, has a silver plate implanted in his head, a \\"souvenir\\" of Iwo Jima, but has won $2,100 gambling and plans to buy a small cattle ranch in New Mexico. Former college student Cliff is physically uninjured but harbors deep resentments about losing nearly four years of his life because he enlisted right after Pearl Harbor. Arriving home in Los Angeles, Cliff finds that his parents are not home but meets his new neighbor, Helen Ingersoll (Jean Porter), a vivacious 18-year-old who is instantly infatuated with the decorated hero. Anxious to see old friends, he heads for Scuffy's, a bar that was his favorite soda shop before the war. He is greeted by his friend and naval aviator Pinky, who introduces him to Pat Ruscomb (McGuire). Immediately attracted to each other, they abandon Pinky, go to Pat's apartment and kiss impetuously. Pat withdraws from him, however, and reveals that she is a war widow who has never gotten over her husband's death 14 months before. Discouraged by Pat's moodiness, Cliff returns home to be reunited with his ecstatic father C.W. (Tom Tully) and mother Amy (Ruth Nelson). Cliff wants to talk about his experiences, but Amy immediately changes the subject. His family wants things to be like they were before the war, making Cliff feel increasingly out of place. He tries to call Pat, who does not answer, and goes to bed. After his mother tucks him in as if he were still a boy, Cliff cries himself to sleep. The next day, Pinky invites Cliff to go to ice skating with him and Pat. Unsure if Pinky and Pat have a relationship, Cliff brings along Helen as his date, who treats Pat as middle-aged matron. In a coffee shop, Cliff spots a lonely soldier with \\"the shakes\\" and goes to help him. Cliff comforts the veteran, a psychiatric patient on leave who is afraid to go home, while Pat talks about a fearful moment in her own past to give him courage. A few days later, C.W. questions his apparently direction-less son about his future and is disappointed when Cliff tells him the only decision he has made is to make no decisions for now. At breakfast Cliff tries to relate to his mother the misery of living in a foxhole but Amy forcefully refuses to listen. Bill Tabeshaw, on his way to New Mexico, stops by to invite Cliff to make a \\"social call\\" with him. Bill makes repeated references to gambling. Amy is polite to Bill but clearly disapproves of his many differences from her son. The \\"social call\\" is a visit to Marine Sgt. Perry Kincheloe (Bill Williams), a legless double amputee who was in the hospital with Bill, now living at home with his mother (Selena Royle). Perry, once a boxer, is grooming his younger brother to become the fighter he can no longer be. Though happy to see Bill, Perry is discouraged and politely rejects encouragement to use his artificial legs. At Scuffy's, Bill expresses disappointment that Perry, after progressing nicely in the hospital, is no longer part of a military team and has given in to self-pity. Cliff runs into Pat at the bar, where she is waiting to go out with an Army Air Forces captain. Unhappy and jealous, Cliff comes home late and argues with his parents, who are upset that he is always out and accuse him of \\"gallivanting around with boys like this Bill Tabeshaw.\\" C.W. tells Cliff \\"it's just not like old times,\\" but Cliff is unable to make them understand that old times were three years ago and he has to make his own plans. Cliff waits for Pat's return outside her apartment. He sees an intoxicated Pat impulsively kiss the captain goodnight. Embarrassed that Cliff has seen her, Pat treats him flippantly and he calls her a tramp. Later Cliff apologizes to Pat for his behavior, explaining that he had begun to think of her as his girl. Pat breaks down and confesses that she is still miserable over dashed dreams of having a future with her late husband. Pat reveals that her captain date was her husband's co-pilot traveling home after his discharge, and in the moment that Cliff saw her, the captain had become her husband in her mind. Ashamed, Cliff admits that he too is lonely and confused. At Pat's suggestion, Cliff then takes a job at the electronics factory where she works but on his first day tries to pick a fight with his supervisor. Talking it over with Pat, Cliff proposes to her, but she rejects him when he says he wants only to live carefree on the beach until his money is gone. Bill returns to Los Angeles after losing all his stake money gambling in Las Vegas. The plate in his head is also causing him severe headaches. Cliff tries to convince him to go to the veteran's hospital but Bill refuses. They go out drinking and Cliff telephones Perry to help him convince Bill to see a doctor. Perry finds the courage to don his artificial legs with encouragement from his mother and goes to the bar. Before they can talk Bill into getting help, they are approached by a group of men who invite them to join their veterans' organization. Bill is told that the organization is restricted to exclude \\"Catholics, Jews, and Negroes\\" and spits in the face of one of them. During the ensuing m√™l√©e, Perry discovers that he can still throw a punch and Bill is hit over the head with a beer bottle, seriously injuring him. At the hospital, Bill is prepped for surgery, and tells Cliff that if he pulls through he plans to go back home to New Mexico and work toward one day buying that ranch he's dreamed about. Cliff and his father, C.W., keep a vigil while Bill is undergoing surgery. Cliff tells his father that despite what he's been through readjusting to civilian life, in many ways he feels luckier than Bill and Perry - he has a job that he likes, though he's not sure he wants to make it a career, and he has Pat, with whom he desires a lasting relationship. C.W. accepts his son's modest ambitions for the future, telling him \\"You didn't make yourself a soldier overnight, you can't become a civilian overnight.\\" The next morning, Cliff and C.W. leave the hospital, having learned that Bill will be all right, and meet Cliff's mother, who has brought Pat with her. Cliff and Pat run toward each other and happily embrace.

Previously walkers on the Thames Path had been required to take a detour away from the river bank along a road through Bisham and Marlow. The bridge was opened by Lord Hesketh on 24 May 1989, following a campagn by Margaret Bowdery, a local advocate of access to open spaces and improvements to footpaths.

The name \\"Temple\\" comes from Temple Mill Island which was owned by the Knights Templar and the site of a mill, which was used to create copper sheets used in the construction of ships for the Royal Navy. The mill had a large water wheel to drive the milling machinery. In May 2019 the bridge was declared unsafe and closed to pedestrians. It was repaired and reopended in June of the same year. It is a haunched girder bridge with a wooden deck. At , it is the longest hardwood bridge in Britain. The centre of the bridge gives a height of above the water allowing the passage of a range of vessels.

The County Library was established in 1910 and is governed by the Alameda County Board of Supervisors. The Alameda County Library Advisory Commission advises the County Librarian and the Board of Supervisors on library services. Funding The County Library is funded primarily by local property taxes, with additional revenue from State grants and contracts with cities for additional open hours and services. The Board of Supervisors allocates a portion of a utility users and business license tax which is collected only in the unincorporated areas of the County to the Library for service to the unincorporated areas. The Alameda County Library Foundation and active Friends or Library League groups in each community support library programs and services. Branches As of 2011, the Alameda County Library has ten branch libraries. * Albany * Castro Valley (received funding for a new library that opened in 2009) * Centerville (Fremont) * Dublin * Irvington (Fremont) * Fremont Main * Newark * Niles (Fremont) * San Lorenzo * Union City =Castro Valley= The Castro Valley Library serves approximately 60,000 residents in the unincorporated area of Castro Valley, California, United States. History The original Castro Valley library was first opened in 1927 on Castro Valley Blvd, in a water tank owned by the Booth family. It later moved to another building, at 20055 Redwood Road, which was designed by architects Wahamaki and Corey. It opened in 1962 with a collection of over 23,000 and a cost of $230,000. The current collection is approximately 100,000. A new replacement library opened on October 31, 2009 at 3600 Norbridge Ave (artist‚Äôs rendering below).

Targets must be manually selected, but are then tracked automatically, including range, bearing, target speed, target direction (course), CPA (closest point of approach), and TCPA (time of closest point of approach), safe or dangerous indication, and proximity alarm. MARPA is a more basic form of ARPA (automatic radar plotting aid). User selected Targets are initially highlighted with a small box whilst MARPA resolves the relative motion by comparing the relative motion of the target on the screen with the true, actual motion (speed) of the tracking vessel. Once resolved the acquiring box will become either a Circle for safe targets or a triangle for dangerous targets. MARPA can indicate further information with 2 very different but similar looking vectors: True Vectors and Relative Vectors. True heading and speed of a target can be ascertained with a True Vector, the length of the line indicates the distance the target will actually cover per duration of vector, usually 6 or 3 minutes (this is user selectable). Range permitting, the 6 minute vectors provide quicker mental calculation of speed. E.g. True 6min vector (TV6) of 0.75 NM indicates the target's true speed is 7.5 Knots, the direction of this vector indicates the vessels heading relative to the tracking vessel or its electronically fed heading if one exists. The relative motion of a target can be seen with Relative vectors, these just show the future position of the target on the Radar screen per Vector Duration, again usually 6 or 3 minutes depending on range in use. A relative vector of 6 minutes (RV6) would be a line representing the movement of the target for the next 6 minutes. Most colour Radar displays can show both TV and RV simultaneously. It is essential that users of MARPA not confused them, especially on Radars that cannot display. True vectors allow users to determine the aspect of a target at a glance, something otherwise requires manual plotting. Relative vectors provide, at a glance, information about which vessels pose a collision risk; a RV pointing at the centre of the Radar screen indicates a risk of collision. All the information pertaining to a target is also available numerically, but when tracking multiple targets this information distracts the user from the image. With proper training, viewing vectors is much safer. Manufacturers use a variety of acronyms for the small crafts or yacht, e.g. MARPA (mini or manual ARPA, depending on which company you talk to) is the dominant one. MARPA, ATA (automatic tracking aid), and ARP (automatic radar plotting) all function similarly to ARPA. The major difference of this Radar plotting aids may not be fully equivalent to all ARPA performance standard of IMO approved type which is a mandatory requirement for large ocean-going ships. Therefore, they are less expensive for small craft.

The Nawab was supported by troops of the British East India Company, in a successful campaign brought about by the Rohillas reneging on a debt to the Nawab. Background Having been driven into the mountains by the Marathas, a few years earlier, the Rohillas had appealed for aid to Shuja-ud-Daulah, at that time an ally of the British. The Nawab demanded in return 40 rods of gold, that Rohilla chiefs refused to pay. The Nawab then decided to annex their country, and appealed to Warren Hastings for assistance, which was given in return for a sum of forty lakhs of rupees. Hastings justified his action on the ground that the Rohillas were a danger to the British as uncovering the flank of Awadh. Course of the war The Rohillas under Hafiz Rahmat Ali Khan Introduction to the Eleven Illustrations of Ghulam Yahya were defeated by Colonel Alexander Champion on 23 April 1774 at the Battle of Miranpur Katra. The decisive battle, in which Hafiz Rahmat Khan died, caused the Rohillas to flee to the mountains near Loll Dong.Miranpur Katra in India = Guerrilla War and Siege= By October 1774, the war evolved into a war of attrition. Faizullah Khan with the remaining loyal Rohillas retreated to a forest located in the hills of Lal Dang. The combined forces of the British and Awadh laid siege to the area from late August 1774 to October of the same year. Both sides were worn down and wished for peace. Shah Shuja, who was suffering from cancer in his leg, wanted an early peace and thus after several attempts to break Rohilla unity under Faizullah Khan, he finally decided to release Mohabbat Khan, son of the late Hafiz Rehmat Khan in an attempt to undermine Faizullah's authority while at the same time he kept communication with Faizullah. His strategy worked and on 7 October 1774 Faizullah signed an amicable treaty of Lal dang and was granted a princely state in the area of his choosing, leading to the creation of Rampur State. Consequences Rohilkhand fell to Awadh, was plundered and occupied. The majority of the Rohillas left. They fled across the Ganges in numbers, to start a guerrilla war; or emigrated. A Rohilla state under British protection was set up in Rampur. Faizullah Khan managed to become the nawab of newly created Rampur state. After his death his son Muhammad Ali Khan succeeded him who was deposed by his younger brother and second son of Faizullah Khan named Ghulam Muhammad Khan Bahadur.The aspirations of Afghan Rohillas under him led him to participate in the Second Rohilla War, in 1794.The primary intention was to regain the erstwhile territories of Rohillas. However, Ghulam Muhammad's accession to the throne by leading a conspiracy against his brother was not liked by Britishers, who derecognised him as ruler of the Rampur state. Large number of Afghans then flocked to join him against the British but ultimately he was defeated and the state which was now considerably reduced in size was handed over to the infant son of Muhammad Ali Khan. Warren Hastings The war became a matter of Westminster politics during the Impeachment of Warren Hastings. Charges of destroying a nation were brought against Hastings by Edmund Burke and later Thomas Macaulay.

The fungus, widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, has been found in Africa, Asia, Europe, North and South America, and Australia. The type species of the genus Sarcoscypha, S. coccinea has been known by many names since its first appearance in the scientific literature in 1772. Phylogenetic analysis shows the species to be most closely related to other Sarcoscypha species that contain numerous small oil droplets in their spores, such as the North Atlantic island species S. macaronesica. Due to similar physical appearances and sometimes overlapping distributions, S. coccinea has often been confused with S. occidentalis, S. austriaca, and S. dudleyi. The saprobic fungus grows on decaying sticks and branches in damp spots on forest floors, generally buried under leaf litter or in the soil. The cup-shaped fruit bodies are usually produced during the cooler months of winter and early spring. The brilliant red interior of the cups‚Äîfrom which both the common and scientific names are derived‚Äîcontrasts with the lighter- colored exterior. The edibility of the fruit bodies is not clearly established, but its small size, tough texture and insubstantial fruitings would dissuade most people from collecting for the table. The fungus has been used medicinally by the Oneida Native Americans, and also as a colorful component of table decorations in England. Molliardiomyces eucoccinea is the name given to the imperfect form of the fungus that lacks a sexually reproductive stage in its life cycle. Taxonomy, naming, and phylogeny The species was originally named Helvella coccinea by the Italian naturalist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli in 1772. Other early names include Peziza coccinea (Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin, 1774) and Peziza dichroa (Theodor Holmskjold, 1799). Although some authors in older literature have applied the generic name Plectania to the taxon following Karl Fuckel's 1870 name change (e.g. Seaver, 1928; Kanouse, 1948; Nannfeldt, 1949; Le Gal, 1953), that name is now used for a fungus with brownish-black fruit bodies. Sarcoscypha coccinea was given its current name by Jean Baptiste √âmil Lambotte in 1889. Drawings by Jean Louis √âmile Boudier Obligate synonyms (different names for the same species based on one type) include Lachnea coccinea Gillet (1880), Macroscyphus coccineus Gray (1821), and Peziza dichroa Holmskjold (1799). Taxonomic synonyms (different names for the same species, based on different types) include Peziza aurantia Schumacher (1803), Peziza aurantiaca Persoon (1822), Peziza coccinea Jacquin (1774), Helvella coccinea Schaeffer (1774), Lachnea coccinea Phillips (1887), Geopyxis coccinea Massee (1895), Sarcoscypha coccinea Saccardo ex Durand (1900), Plectania coccinea (Fuckel ex Seaver), and Peziza cochleata Batsch (1783). Sarcoscypha coccinea is the type species of the genus Sarcoscypha, having been first explicitly designated as such in 1931 by Frederick Clements and Cornelius Lott Shear.Korf and Harrington (1990), citing A 1990 publication revealed that the genus name Sarcoscypha had been used previously by Carl F. P. von Martius as the name of a tribe in the genus Peziza; according to the rules of Botanical Nomenclature, this meant that the generic name Peziza had priority over Sarcoscypha. To address the taxonomical dilemma, the genus name Sarcoscypha was conserved against Peziza, with S. coccinea as the type species, to \\"avoid the creation of a new generic name for the scarlet cups and also to avoid the disadvantageous loss of a generic name widely used in the popular and scientific literature\\". The specific epithet coccinea is derived from the Latin word meaning \\"deep red\\". The species is commonly known as the \\"scarlet elf cup\\", the \\"scarlet elf cap\\", or the \\"scarlet cup fungus\\". S. coccinea var. jurana was described by Jean Boudier (1903) as a variety of the species having a brighter and more orange-colored fruit body, and with flattened or blunt-ended ascospores. Today it is known as the distinct species S. jurana. S. coccinea var. albida, named by George Edward Massee in 1903 (as Geopyxis coccinea var. albida), has a cream-colored rather than red interior surface, but is otherwise identical to the typical variety. Within the large area that includes the temperate to alpine-boreal zone of the Northern Hemisphere (Europe and North America), only S. coccinea had been recognized until the 1980s. However, it had been known since the early 1900s that there existed several macroscopically indistinguishable taxa with various microscopic differences: the distribution and number of oil droplets in fresh spores; germination behavior; and spore shape. Detailed analysis and comparison of fresh specimens revealed that what had been collectively called \\"S. coccinea\\" actually consisted of four distinct species: S. austriaca, S. coccinea, S. dudleyi, and S. jurana. The phylogenetic relationships in the genus Sarcoscypha were analyzed by Francis Harrington in the late 1990s. Her cladistic analysis combined comparisons of the sequences of the internal transcribed spacer in the non-functional RNA with fifteen traditional morphological characteristics, such as spore features, fruit body shape, and degree of curliness of the \\"hairs\\" that form the tomentum. Based on her analysis, S. coccinea is part of a clade that includes the species S. austriaca, S. macaronesica, S. knixoniana and S. humberiana. All of these Sarcoscypha species have numerous, small oil droplets in their spores. Its closest relative, S. macaronesica, is found on the Canary Islands and Madeira; Harrington hypothesized that the most recent common ancestor of the two species originated in Europe and was later dispersed to the Macaronesian islands. Description Initially spherical, the fruit bodies are later shallowly saucer- or cup-shaped with rolled-in rims, and measure in diameter. The inner surface of the cup is deep red (fading to orange when dry) and smooth, while the outer surface is whitish and covered with a dense matted layer of tiny hairs (a tomentum). The stipe, when present, is stout and up to long (if deeply buried) by thick, and whitish, with a tomentum. Color variants of the fungus exist that have reduced or absent pigmentation; these forms may be orange, yellow, or even white (as in the variety albida). In the Netherlands, white fruit bodies have been found growing in the polders. The stalks and outer surface are lighter in color than the interior. Sarcoscypha coccinea is one of several fungi whose fruit bodies have been noted to make a \\"puffing\\" sound‚Äîan audible manifestation of spore-discharge where thousands of asci simultaneously explode to release a cloud of spores.Buller, 1958, pp. 329‚Äì31. Retrieved 2010-08-22. Spores are 26‚Äì40 by 10‚Äì12 ¬µm, elliptical, smooth, hyaline (translucent), and have small lipid droplets concentrated at either end. The droplets are refractive to light and visible with light microscopy. In older, dried specimens (such as herbarium material), the droplets may coalesce and hinder the identification of species. Depending on their geographical origin, the spores may have a delicate mucilaginous sheath or \\"envelope\\"; European specimens are devoid of an envelope while specimens from North America invariably have one. The asci are long and cylindrical, and taper into a short stem-like base; they measure 300‚Äì375 by 14‚Äì16 ¬µm. Although in most Pezizales all of the ascospores are formed simultaneously through delimitation by an inner and outer membrane, in S. coccinea the ascospores located in the basal parts of the ascus develop faster. The paraphyses (sterile filamentous hyphae present in the hymenium) are about 3 ¬µm wide (and only slightly thickened at the apex), and contain red pigment granules. =Anamorph form= Anamorphic or imperfect fungi are those that seem to lack a sexual stage in their life cycle, and typically reproduce by the process of mitosis in structures called conidia. In some cases, the sexual stage‚Äîor teleomorph stage‚Äîis later identified, and a teleomorph-anamorph relationship is established between the species. The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants permits the recognition of two (or more) names for one and the same organism, one based on the teleomorph, the other(s) restricted to the anamorph. The name of the anamorphic state of S. coccinea is Molliardiomyces eucoccinea, first described by Marin Molliard in 1904. Molliard found the growth of the conidia to resemble those of the genera Coryne and Chlorosplenium rather than the Pezizaceae, and he considered that this suggested an affinity between Sarcoscypha and the family Helvellaceae. In 1972, John W. Paden again described the anamorph, but like Molliard, failed to give a complete description of the species. In 1984, Paden created a new genus he named Molliardiomyces to contain the anamorphic forms of several Sarcoscypha species, and set Molliardiomyces eucoccinea as the type species. This form produces colorless conidiophores (specialized stalks that bear conidia) that are usually irregularly branched, measuring 30‚Äì110 by 3.2‚Äì4.7 ¬µm. The conidia are ellipsoidal to egg-shaped, smooth, translucent (hyaline), and 4.8‚Äì16.0 by 2.3‚Äì5.8 ¬µm; they tend to accumulate in \\"mucilaginous masses\\". =Similar species= Similar species include S. dudleyi and S. austriaca, and in the literature, confusion amongst the three is common. Examination of microscopic features is often required to definitively differentiate between the species. Sarcoscypha occidentalis has smaller cups (0.5‚Äì2.0 cm wide), a more pronounced stalk that is 1‚Äì3 cm long, and a smooth exterior surface. Unlike S. coccinea, it is only found in the New World and in east and midwest North America, but not in the far west. It also occurs in Central America and the Caribbean. In North America, S. austriaca and S. dudleyi are found in eastern regions of the continent. S. dudleyi has elliptical spores with rounded ends that are 25‚Äì33 by 12‚Äì14 ¬µm and completely sheathed when fresh. S. austriaca has elliptical spores that are 29‚Äì36 by 12‚Äì15 ¬µm that are not completely sheathed when fresh, but have small polar caps on either end. The Macaronesian species S. macaronesica, frequently misidentified as S. coccinea, has smaller spores, typically measuring 20.5‚Äì28 by 7.3‚Äì11 ¬µm and smaller fruit bodies‚Äîup to wide. Ecology, habitat and distribution A saprobic species, Sarcoscypha coccinea grows on decaying woody material from various plants: the rose family, beech, hazel, willow, elm, and, in the Mediterranean, oak. The fruit bodies of S. coccinea are often found growing singly or clustered in groups on buried or partly buried sticks in deciduous forests. A Hungarian study noted that the fungus was found mainly on twigs of European hornbeam (Carpinus betulus) that were typically less than long. Fruit bodies growing on sticks above the ground tend to be smaller than those on buried wood. Mushrooms that are sheltered from wind also grow larger than their more exposed counterparts. The fruit bodies are persistent and may last for several weeks if the weather is cool. The time required for the development of fruit bodies has been estimated to be about 24 weeks, although it was noted that \\"the maximum life span may well be more than 24 weeks because the decline of the colonies seemed to be associated more with sunny, windy weather rather than with old age.\\" One field guide calls the fungus \\"a welcome sight after a long, desperate winter and ... the harbinger of a new year of mushrooming.\\" Common over much of the Northern Hemisphere, S. coccinea occurs in the Midwest, in the valleys between the Pacific coast, the Sierra Nevada, and the Cascade Range. Its North American distribution extends north to various locations in Canada and south to the Mexican state Jalisco. The fungus has also been collected from Chile in South America. It is also found in the Old World‚ÄîEurope, Africa, Asia, Australia, and India. Specimens collected from the Macaronesian islands that once thought to be S. coccinea were later determined to be the distinct species S. macaronesica. A 1995 study of the occurrence of British Sarcoscypha (including S. coccinea and S. austriaca) concluded that S. coccinea was becoming very rare in Great Britain. All species of Sarcoscypha, including S. coccinea, are Red-Listed in Europe. In Turkey, it is considered critically endangered. Chemistry Near Llandegfan, North Wales The red color of the fruit bodies is caused by five types of carotenoid pigments, including plectaniaxanthin and Œ≤-carotene. Carotenoids are lipid-soluble and are stored within granules in the paraphyses. British-Canadian mycologist Arthur Henry Reginald Buller suggested that pigments in fruit bodies exposed to the Sun absorb some of the Sun's rays, raising the temperature of the hymenium‚Äîhastening the development of the ascus and subsequent spore discharge.Buller, 1958, p. 301. Retrieved 2010-08-22. Lectins are sugar- binding proteins that are used in blood typing, biochemical studies and medical research. A lectin has been purified and characterized from S. coccinea fruit bodies that can bind selectively to several specific carbohydrate molecules, including lactose. Uses Sarcoscypha coccinea was used as a medicinal fungus by the Oneida Indians, and possibly by other tribes of the Iroquois Six Nations. The fungus, after being dried and ground up into a powder, was applied as a styptic, particularly to the navels of newborn children that were not healing properly after the umbilical cord had been severed. Pulverized fruit bodies were also kept under bandages made of soft- tanned deerskin. In Scarborough, England, the fruit bodies used to be arranged with moss and leaves and sold as a table decoration. The species is said to be edible, inedible, or \\"not recommended\\", depending on the author. Although its insubstantial fruit body and low numbers do not make it particularly suitable for the table, one source claims \\"children in the Jura are said to eat it raw on bread and butter; and one French author suggests adding the cups, with a little Kirsch, to a fresh fruit salad.\\" The fruit bodies have been noted to be a source of food for rodents in the winter, and slugs in the summer.

Wednesbury Old Canal as it stands today is shown in pink/yellow. The Ridgacre Branch is a canal branch of the Wednesbury Old Canal, part of the Birmingham Canal Navigations, in the West Midlands, England. It opened in 1828, to serve collieries and iron works, and was disused by the 1960s. Except for its branches and a small section at the eastern end, which have been filled in, most of it is still in water, but it is not navigable as a low-level bridge carrying the Black Country New Road spans the entrance. History The Wednesbury Old Canal was the first part of the Birmingham Canal to be opened. It was authorised by Act of Parliament in 1768, as a branch to the main line between Birmingham and Wolverhampton, but because there were coal mines at Balls Hill, the branch and the route into Birmingham were built, to tap into the lucrative coal trade. It opened in 1769, with the main line to Wolverhampton opening three years later. The Birmingham Canal formed the backbone of the Birmingham Canal Navigations system as the network expanded. The Ridgacre Branch was one of the many which the Birmingham Canal Navigations opened to generate trade. It was in length, and opened in 1826, running from the Wednesbury Canal at Swan Bridge Junction, just to the north of the modern New Swan Lane / Black Country New Road roundabout, in a north easterly direction to a basin and coal mines near Hateley Heath. As mining expanded, so additional branches were added. The Dartmouth Branch ran northwards for about and opened in 1828, as did the Halford Branch, which initially headed south then east and finally north. It was around ling, and tramways linked the terminal basin to the Hall End Colliery. The Jesson Branch was connected to the Halford Branch, and was named after the owner of the mines which it served. It was long and opened in 1831.Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 maps, 1904 The canal and its branches were closed down following the Second World War. Parts of the Dartmouth and Halford Branches were closed in 1947, and in 1954, the Jesson Branch was closed, as were parts of the Wednesbury Canal to the north of its junction with the Ridgacre Branch, with more closing in 1960. When plans were drawn up for the Black Country Spine Road in 1992, they included the provision of a navigable culvert under the road near the Swan Bridge roundabout, with headroom of . The existing junction with the turning head for the Balls Hill Branch would have been closed and a new entrance created slightly further to the east. However, when it was built, the canal was culverted under the bridge, so the Ridgacre has been cut off from the canal network. It is in water for nearly all of its original length, although its branches have gone. Route Some modern sources, such as Nicholson, mark the Ridgacre as starting at Ryder's Green Junction, but historically, the Wednesbury Old Canal continued to Swan Bridge Junction, where the Ridgacre Branch began. The Wednesbury Canal continued on to the Balls Hill Collieries, and was often called the Balls Hill Branch beyond the junction. The Wednesbury Canal arrived at the junction from the south west, and the Ridgeacre headed east. There was a large gas works on the south bank, while to the north, the Wednesbury Canal entered a wider section, with a short basin to the east and a longer one to the west, flanked by railway sidings. The canal passed under the Great Western Railway Great Bridge Branch on its way to Balls Hill. The wider section and the western basin remain in water, although the junction is beneath the modern roundabout of the Black Country Spine Road.Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 maps, 1890, 1904, 1920, 1938, 1966, modern The West Midlands Metro bridge at Black Lake On the Ridgacre Branch, a basin to the south, crossed by a footbridge, served the gasworks. Gas Street crossed to the east of the gasworks on Sandy Gay Bridge, and there was another basin just after the bridge, which served Swan Meadow Swa Mills. Both were still evident in 1938, but by 1966 the basin had been reduced to a tiny stub. Next came a railway bridge carrying the Great Bridge Branch over the canal. A tramway from the Blacklake Colliery crossed the canal in 1890, to reach Blacklake Wharf on the south bank of the canal, but the colliery was marked as disused in 1904, and the tramway had been lifted. By 1966, most of the wharf had gone, but the area was still used as a coal yard. The next bridge was for the Birmingham, Wolverhampton and Dudley Railway, which has since been re-used for the West Midlands Metro tramway system. Blacklake Bridge carried Blacklake Lane, now the A4196, over the canal to the east of White's Farm Colliery, where there was another basin. Open in 1890, it was disused in 1904, by which time an electricity generating station had been built on the southern part of the site. The basin had gone by 1920. On the north bank, opposite the basin entrance, the Dartmouth Branch began. It headed due north, passing under Coles Lane Bridge and Hatchey Heath Bridge. Between the bridges there were two basins to the east in 1890 and one to the west, above which was Albert Street Ironworks. By 1904, the western basin had gone, but a tramway connected the works to the canal. Housing had covered the area to the east of the canal by 1938. Hatchey Heath Bridge carried Witton Lane, and beyond it, Witton Lane Colliery lay to the west, while a tramway connected the terminal basin to Crookhay Colliery to the north east. Balls Hill Colliery lay a little further to the west, on the other side of Crookhay Lane. Coles Lane, Witton Lane and Crookhay Lane still follow approximately their old routes, but modern housing has destroyed most traces of the historical landscape. The modern terminus, overlooking Hateley Heath Returning to the Ridgace Canal, it continued for a little way past the junction and terminated at a basin. Coppice Colliery lay to the north, and Coppice Colliery Bridge crossed the channel to the west of the basin, but the colliery was already disused by 1890. The colliery bridge is the eastern limit of the modern watered section. A stream crossed the area near the waste tips, and fed the canal through a sluice. Between the bridge and the basin, the Halford Branch turned off and headed south. On its east bank were the Ridgacre Oil Works, the Cyclops Iron Works, the Waterloo Iron Works and the Hall End Iron Works. Ridgacre Iron Works was on the west bank. By 1904, the oil works had become the Hall End Chemical Works, and the Cyclops Works was processing soap and tallow. Church Lane crossed the canal at Ridgacre Bridge, beyond which the Jesson Branch continued to the south, while the Halford Branch turned to the east. Jesson Bridge crossed the entrance to the Jesson Branch, which was bordered by an iron works and Ridgacre Tube Works to the west and the workings of a disused colliery to the east in 1890. By 1904, the iron works was a rolling mill, and the tube works had become the Acme Iron Foundry. The Oriental Tube Works had been built on the north bank of the next section of the Halford Branch by 1904, and a wharf served the Hall End Brick Works, where the canal turned to the north to pass under Church Lane again, at Church Lane Bridge. There was a large basin beyond the bridge in 1890, connected by tramways to workings to the east and to Hall End Colliery to the north. The canal appears to terminate before the bridge by 1904, and the colliery buildings and tramways have gone. By 1966, the brickworks and the Jesson Branch had both gone.

Womack and Daniel T. Jones published an article in the Harvard Business Review describing a new theory called Lean Consumption. Lean Consumption is based on Lean Manufacturing, also known as Lean Production. Lean Manufacturing was pioneered by Toyota founder Taiichi Ohno, and revolutionized and streamlined the manufacturing industry. Whereas Lean Manufacturing set out ways to streamline manufacturing processes, Lean Consumption \\"minimizes customers' time and effort by delivering exactly what they want when and where they want it\\". Processes are focused on eliminating waste, while increasing productivity, speed of operation and improving customer interaction. This process was proposed for large corporations, but smaller corporations have been able to take this theory and apply it to small business. This has the effect of more efficient business and better customer service and SLAs. Related fields to Lean Consumption include: * Lean Thinking * Six Sigma * Theory of Constraints Principles of Lean Consumption * Solve the customer's problem completely by ensuring that all the goods and services work, and work together. * Don't waste the customer's time. * Provide exactly what the customer wants. * Provide what's wanted exactly where it's wanted. * Provide what's wanted where it's wanted exactly when it's wanted. * Continually aggregate solutions to reduce the customer's time and hassle. Methodology * Identify and improve activities that create and add value for the customer. * Determine what processes are necessary to deliver that value. * Cut down on activities that do not add value. * Deliver products precisely when the customer requires them. * Improve and streamline these processes continuously. Companies that Use Lean Consumption and Variations * IBM * Microsoft * Motorola * Toyota * Behamooz * List of Six Sigma companies Lean Consumption in the IT Industry The industry most affected by Lean Consumption is the IT and Computer Services Industry. Companies like Microsoft and IBM are the most notable companies to employ Lean Consumption or some variation of the theory. A notable smaller adoptee is Cybernomics, which has been able to employ Lean Consumption theory to better satisfy customers by giving them exactly what they require when they require it and at the same time, planning ahead with Proactive IT to avoid break-fix situations, all while lowering cost to the end user.

Bowers is viewed as an innovator in gender confirmation/affirmation surgery, and is the first transgender woman to perform such surgeries. Bowers operates at Mills- Peninsula Medical Center in Burlingame, California, and San Mateo Surgery Center in San Mateo, California. From 2003 to 2010, she practiced in the town of Trinidad, Colorado, where she apprenticed under Stanley Biber, a general surgeon and father of international transgender surgery, until relinquishing these duties to Bowers in July 2003. Biber performed more than 2300 male-to- female genital reassignment surgeries and 1000 female-to-male surgeries and is credited for earning Trinidad the moniker, \\"Sex Change Capital of the World.\\" Biber died in January 2006. Bowers is also an international expert on functional clitoral restoration after female genital mutilation and cutting. She was chosen in 2007-2009 to mentor under Pierre Fold√®s, pioneer of clitoral restoration surgery and is the first US surgeon to do so. She has spoken about her practice and other transgender topics in numerous documentaries, interviews, news reports, and articles. Media appearances have included The Oprah Winfrey Show (2007), The Tyra Banks Show (5 episodes), The Today Show, and CBS Sunday Morning feature. She is also the featured surgeon in the six- part 2006-2007 television series Sex Change Hospital. In May 2020, The Times featured Bowers on their Science Power List.  Education  Marci Bowers is a University of Minnesota Medical School graduate and former class and student body president. After Ob/Gyn residency at the University of Washington, she continued in Seattle as an Obstetrician/Gynecologist at the Polyclinic and Swedish Medical Center.  Career  Before moving to Trinidad, Bowers practiced obstetrics and gynecology at the PolyClinic/Swedish Medical Center in Seattle. In her 20 years practicing obstetrics, she delivered more than 2000 babies. She has served as Obstetrics and Gynecology Department Chairperson at Swedish (Providence) Medical Center, and was named the only physician member of the Washington State midwifery board. She is a member- elect of the European Academy of Sciences. When Stanley Biber retired in 2003 at the age of 80, Bowers took over his practice, and since then, has done more than 2000 genital reassignment surgeries, performing as many as 12 gender affirming surgeries weekly. While performing surgery in Trinidad, Bowers estimated revenue at US$1.6 million per year to the hospital. In 2010, she relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area and continues to practice in Burlingame, California. She has also helped initiate transgender surgical education programs at Sheba Medical Center in Tel Aviv (2014), Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sina in New York (2016), Denver Health in Colorado (2018), and University of Toronto (2019). The transgender surgical fellowship at Mount Sinai is acknowledged as the first of its kind in the United States. In 2018 and 2019, Bowers performed the first live surgical vaginoplasty surgeries in surgical educational programs sponsored by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. Bowers is an elected board member of WPATH and has served on the board of directors for both GLAAD and the Transgender Law Center. Bowers is the first U.S. surgeon to perform clitoral restoration surgery for survivors of female genital mutilation, whom she does not charge for surgery. She was trained for this specific operation under Pierre Fold√®s and has now performed more than 500 clitoral restorations at her clinic in San Mateo. She has led medical missions to Burkina Faso (2014), Nairobi, Kenya (2017 and 2019). Working with local plastic surgeon, Abdullahi Adan, and others, this specific surgical venue is a first for Africa after the failed opening of the Pleasure Hospitalhttps://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26577358 in Bobo-Dioulasso.  Media appearances  Perhaps Bowers' first television appearance was a dramatic role in \\"Ch-ch-ch-changes\\" (2004), a season 5 episode of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation that focused on transgender issues. She also served as a production consultant for the episode. She appeared briefly in the 2005 docuseries TransGeneration, produced by World of Wonder; soon after, World of Wonder turned their attention to Bowers herself and her practice, in their 2007 documentary series Sex Change Hospital‚Äîa six-episode series that follows 12 patients before, during, and after surgery. Sex Change Hospital premiered on More4, and was rebroadcast on E4 in the UK and WE tv in the US. She and her practice were also the focus of Trinidad (2009), an independent documentary directed by PJ Raval and Jay Hodges. The filmmakers examine the success of Dr. Bowers' practice, and the transgender people who travel to the town of Trinidad, Colorado for sex reassignment surgery. The film premiered in the US on the Showtime channel. Bowers appears as herself in the television documentary, Gender Revolution: A Journey with Katie Couric (2017), and in the 2016 and 2018 (seasons 3 through 6) of the reality series, I Am Jazz. She has been a guest on US talk shows including The Oprah Winfrey Show and The Tyra Banks Show. She has been interviewed for several publications. She is the author of at least five book chapters in surgical textbooks.  Opposition  Not all of Trinidad's residents were happy with the town's title of \\"Sex Change Capital\\". In 2005, Terry Keith, a pastor for the All Nations Fellowship church, told The Pueblo Chieftain, \\"Our reputation as sex-change capital of the world has brought shame and reproach on the community.\\" That same year, two pastors circulated a petition for the closure of the clinic. They cited a Johns Hopkins University study that they claimed was proof that gender confirmation surgeries were an ineffective treatment for gender dysphoria. The petition was rejected. Bowers said that the church misrepresented the study data: \\"If you look at the actual study itself, the satisfaction rates and happiness rates after [surgeries] were overwhelmingly positive, their interpretation of the study was that the respondents‚Äîthe patients themselves‚Äîcouldn't possibly be accurate about what they were feeling, because they were crazy in the first place. There's been nothing like it since‚Äîand it's very important to point out that it's from 1972.\\" So too, clitoral restoration surgery remains controversial with some doubting restoration of sensation to the clitoris. After Pierre Fold√®s's landmark study in Lancet (February 2012), his results were met with skepticism from British gynecologists who wrote a rebuttal to his findings, questioning his methods and outcomes. Bowers is conducting ongoing studies using standard measures of female sexual function to definitively affirm Fold√®s's conclusions, but as Bowers has stated, \\"There is no happier text that I receive at three in the morning than someone stating they have had their first orgasm in their life.\\"  See also  * LGBT people in science  References   External links  Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:American gynecologists Category:American surgeons Category:LGBT people from the United States Category:People from Trinidad, Colorado Category:Surgeons specializing in transgender medicine Category:Transgender and transsexual physicians Category:Transgender and transsexual women Category:University of Minnesota Medical School alumni Category:Transgender and transsexual media personalities Category:Women surgeons ","title":"Marci Bowers"},{"id":"13667682","text":"The Izvorul Muntelui is a right tributary of the river Bistri»õa in Romania.

At the end of October 2000 he replaced Gigi Simoni when he was dismissed from the bench leading the team to gain the first position in Serie A . With the Granata team he made his debut in the Serie A by winning the Intertoto qualification. Although he had achieved the highest number of points the previous year, he was dismissed in October 2002. In the 2003‚Äì04 season he replaced Franco Colomba as coach of the Serie A Reggina team and led them to safety. In 2005, he became coach of the Vicenza team (for which he had been captain from 1990 to 1991) and managed to save them on the last day and was reconfirmed as coach for the 2006‚Äì07 season. On 10 October 2007 he replaced Fernando Orsi as coach of the Livorno team finishing last in the Serie A table. After a good recovery, he was dismissed after a difficult second round a few days before the end. On 24 March 2009 he was back on the bench for Torino, where he took over from Walter Novellino, although he was not able to save the team from relegation which occurred on 31 May 2009 after being defeated 3‚Äì2 by Roma and despite having obtained 10 points in 9 matches this defeat cost him his reappointment for the following season. After a long absence from the bench, due to family problems, on 15 October 2012 Camolese started coaching again and became the Manager of the Pro Vercelli team. He was dismissed on 3 January 2013 having only gained 8 points from 2 draws and 2 wins in 13 matches. On 20 October he replaces the outgoing M.Schallibaum in Chiasso FC (Swisse Challenge League ) with a contract valid until June 2016, reaching a comfortable salvation finishing in seventh place, the best result of the Club over the last three years. Outside of football =TV sports- caster= In 2002, he commented on various World Cup matches of the Korean and Japanese teams for RAI, while in 2007 he was a football pundit for Mediaset Premium. =Teaching activities= At present he is a University Lecturer at SUISM in Turin and Teaches at the FIGC National Technical Centre and Coach Education School in Coverciano.

A similar project was proposed later, resulting in the 1908 collaborative work The Whole Family, though Twain declined the offer to participate.Powers, Ron. Mark Twain: A Life. New York: Free Press, 2005: 387. The scheme for \\"A Murder, a Mystery, and a Marriage\\" failed, and Twain was the only one to flesh out the plot. The resulting manuscript remained unpublished until it was purchased by Lew D. Feldman. Feldman held that ownership of the original manuscript gave him the right to publish. To test this theory, in 1945 he brought out a limited edition of 16 copies of the printed story. The case went all the way to the U.S. Court of Appeals before it was determined that \\"Ownership of a manuscript does not include the right of publication\\". It was not until 2001 that publication rights were settled, and the story was finally published in the Atlantic Monthly. This was followed by a book edition by W.W. Norton ().

Callers did not pay for the service, but had to listen to ads. The service offered local business listings including numbers and addresses. How it worked Like other advertising supported services, callers use a toll-free number to reach an automated system. They then can ask for a particular business, or ask for business recommendations by a location in a city. This type of category search is different from typical 411 requests that focus on asking for specific listings. At the outset, the system plays an advertisement and there can be other ads later on in the call. The system can also provide details to the caller's wireless phone via text message. The free-DA market Verizon‚Äôs service competed with many new entrants providing similar services. 1-800-FREE-411 is currently the market leader with reportedly 20 million calls per month in 2007. AT&T;'s yellow pages, and others, are also now competing for this small but growing segment. Current growth figures suggest the segment will reach 1.5 billion calls per year in the U.S. by 2010. Nearly all of these services targeted traditional, paid DA services, rates of which can range from $0.39 on a landline phone to $1.99 (i.e. Verizon wireless) or more on cell phones.

It is most famous for its use in the 1964‚Äì1966 sitcom The Munsters, but has appeared in several other productions, both before and after. According to The Munsters series, the mansion was built on the remains of an old fort, with Grandpa providing the down payment when Herman and Lily bought the home.  History =1946: So Goes My Love= The house, built in the Second Empire Victorian architectural style, was constructed on Stage 12 in 1946 for the filming of the turn-of-the-century period romantic film So Goes My Love. Placed alongside another Victorian-style house built specifically for the production, the two-and-a-half story set was utilized on a soundstage for all shots in the film. =1950s: On the Universal backlot= After production of So Goes My Love ended, both house sets were put into storage. In the early 1950s Universal decided to build a new exterior residential street on its front lot, and these sets were then taken out of storage and reassembled where they became a part of \\"River Road;\\" one of a number of residential streets constructed in the area. The house was then seen in a number of Universal productions through the 1950s (see List of appearances in film and television, below). =1964: Kraft Suspense Theatre TV series= Season One, Episode 13 ‚Äì \\"Who Is Jennifer?\\" starring Gloria Swanson & Brenda Scott. =1964: The Munsters TV series= The house received its most famous make-over in 1964 when it was being redressed for the premiere of the sitcom The Munsters. The third-story octagon tower with its mansard roof and four windows was altered into a covered widow's walk with a tented roof, the second story center window was given a faux gingerbread gable, and a chimney and a crooked vampire-bat weathervane were added.Universal Studio's original photos before remodeling for The Munsters series The grounds were equipped with bare trees, dead leaves and a stone entrance gate. After a slight \\"roughing up\\" with new darker paint, the house and its grounds were used for all the exterior shots on the series, with interiors filmed on separate soundstages. The address for the house was at one point supposed to be 43 Mockingbird Lane, Camelot, New Jersey, but was changed to 1313 Mockingbird Lane in the city of Mockingbird Heights (state unknown) as shooting began. After production of The Munsters in 1966 and the film Munster, Go Home, the house was stripped of its trees, gates and other landscape dressing. =After The Munsters= Universal had replaced its entire front lot and the Munster house among other sets were relocated to the backlot on \\"Colonial Street\\". Although the house was used for the television movie The Munsters' Revenge only close up shots of windows and the side garden exterior were possible, with stock footage from the previous 1966 movie Munster, Go Home used for long shot as the house had undergone several changes. Throughout the early part of the 80s the house was renovated again and became more modern. The most notable changes were the removal of the architectural details added for The Munsters, including the gingerbread gable over the second-story center window and the replacement of the columns and railings of the widow's walk tower. The original first floor front porch was replaced with a larger wrap-around porch. The house then fell into a state of severe disrepair and by 1987 was unable to be used for the original TV pilot of The Munsters Today. Stock footage was again used from Munster, Go Home. The house, after production had ceased on The Munsters Today, appeared in many films and TV shows again ‚Äì including The 'Burbs, Dragnet and on the TV series Coach starring Craig T. Nelson. In the mid-2000s, for the second season of Desperate Housewives, the second floor was demolished and all of the remaining architectural details on the first floor were removed. A new second floor was constructed with a somewhat similar design, changing the original mansard gable into a gambrel gable, reflecting a more Dutch Colonial Revival architectural style. Scale model replica for The Munsters Today TV series The producers on The Munsters Today felt the well known Munster house was just as important as the characters, so an authentic scale model replica was built for the series to accompany the limited colour stock footage from Munster, Go Home!. The scale model worked well on the show, and many did not notice it was not the same house. The garden was decorated with dried oregano. There are some slight differences between the original house and the scale model used for the new show: seen from the front, the gates are now directly in front of the porch as opposed to slightly to the right. The gateposts are also dramatically smaller and less bulky than in the original; and around the perimeter, instead of a wall, are yet more posts with spiked fencing in-between for several intervals, somewhat similar to what is seen in the 1964 color pilot. There is also a small arched basement window that looks down into Grandpa's lab. Today this model can be seen in Universal's new House of Horrors. A virtual tour of the Munster Mansion is available on The Munsters Today Information Archives website, along with the shows \\"career\\" across film and TV history. The website also includes rare details of the model replica, and details the various made for TV movies that utilised different Munster Mansion variations, such as Here Come The Munsters and The Munsters' Scary Little Christmas.  Today  As stated above, the set's most recent appearance is as 4351 Wisteria Lane in the ABC series Desperate Housewives, with a radical second floor makeover due to the show's producers being concerned that audiences would be distracted by seeing the Munster's house in the series. The house has been a center of bad news on Wisteria Lane, with a total of four families having established a residence in the home: Mr & Mrs Edwin Mullins; Betty Applewhite and her children; Alma Hodge; and partners Bob Hunter and Lee McDermott.

The word blue-red-red-blue-red-red-blue-red-red is a synchronizing word that sends all states to the yellow state; the word blue-blue-red-blue-blue- red-blue-blue-red is another synchronizing word that sends all states to the green state. In computer science, more precisely, in the theory of deterministic finite automata (DFA), a synchronizing word or reset sequence is a word in the input alphabet of the DFA that sends any state of the DFA to one and the same state.Avraham Trakhtman: Synchronizing automata, algorithms, Cerny Conjecture. Accessed May 15, 2010. That is, if an ensemble of copies of the DFA are each started in different states, and all of the copies process the synchronizing word at the same speed, they will all end up reaching the same state as each other, at the same time as each other. Not every DFA has a synchronizing word; for instance, a DFA with two states, one for words of even length and one for words of odd length, can never be synchronized. Existence Given a DFA, the problem of determining if it has a synchronizing word can be solved in polynomial time using a theorem due to J√°n ƒåern√Ω. A simple approach considers the power set of states of the DFA, and builds a directed graph where nodes belong to the power set, and a directed edge describes the action of the transition function. A path from the node of all states to a singleton state shows the existence of a synchronizing word. This algorithm is exponential in the number of states. A polynomial algorithm results however, due to a theorem of ƒåern√Ω that exploits the substructure of the problem, and shows that a synchronizing word exists if and only if every pair of states has a synchronizing word. Length The problem of estimating the length of synchronizing words has a long history and was posed independently by several authors, but it is commonly known as the ƒåern√Ω conjecture. In 1964 J√°n ƒåern√Ω conjectured that (n ‚àí 1)2 is the upper bound for the length of the shortest synchronizing word for any n-state complete DFA (a DFA with complete state transition graph). (in Slovak). If this is true, it would be tight: in his 1964 paper, ƒåern√Ω exhibited a class of automata (indexed by the number n of states) for which the shortest reset words have this length. The best upper bound known is (n 3 \\\\- n)/6, far from the lower bound.https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2409v7 Trahtman at one point thought he had proven a better bound of n(7n2+6n‚àí16)/48, but this proof turned out to be incorrect and the paper has been retracted, leaving the best-known bound to be (n^3 - n)/6 For n-state DFAs over a k-letter input alphabet, an algorithm by David Eppstein finds a synchronizing word of length at most 11n3/48 + O(n2), and runs in time complexity O(n3+kn2). This algorithm does not always find the shortest possible synchronizing word for a given automaton; as Eppstein also shows, the problem of finding the shortest synchronizing word is NP-complete. However, for a special class of automata in which all state transitions preserve the cyclic order of the states, he describes a different algorithm with time O(kn2) that always finds the shortest synchronizing word, proves that these automata always have a synchronizing word of length at most (n ‚àí 1)2 (the bound given in ƒåern√Ω's conjecture), and exhibits examples of automata with this special form whose shortest synchronizing word has length exactly (n ‚àí 1)2. Road coloring The road coloring problem is the problem of labeling the edges of a regular directed graph with the symbols of a k-letter input alphabet (where k is the outdegree of each vertex) in order to form a synchronizable DFA. It was conjectured in 1970 by Benjamin Weiss and Roy Adler that any strongly connected and aperiodic regular digraph can be labeled in this way; their conjecture was proven in 2007 by Avraham Trahtman..

A DFA corresponds to a transformation semigroup with a distinguished generator set. References Further reading *.

The small home vineyard has grown; as a result Sharon has to work out in the vineyard, with about twenty other workers where everything is done by hand. The winery's early experimentation with grape varieties led to the conclusion that the humid weather of the Virginia Piedmont region favored grapes with thick skins and loose grape clusters.

Bj√∂rn Prytz was the man behind the name Volvo during the time he was the managing director for SKF sales company in America 1914‚Äì18. Volvo was registered as a trademark, as well as a subsidiary company to SKF, in May 1915 (the application for Volvo as a trademark was sent to PRV on May 11), with the intention to use it for a new developed low-price ball bearing for the automobile industry in the America. However, these plans were never realized and the SKF name and logotype (as it looks today) was used instead for all type of bearings produced by SKF. The name and company Volvo was almost forgotten but came into use when the SKF employee Assar Gabrielsson (SKF sales manager) and engineer Gustav Larson finally had succeeded to convince SKF that they should start to manufacture automobiles within SKF.

On 16 April 1992, he was ordered to leave Sarajevo and on 19 April he arrived in Visoko, where he worked with a group of TO officers on the formation of units in central Bosnia. Eventually the Visoko Tactical Group was formed, headed by Rasim Deliƒá. By 12 May he also became a member of the Main Staff and on that date was tasked officially with organizing and commanding armed combat activities in various municipalities in central Bosnia. On 20 May 1992, the TO forces became the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 17 October 1992, Sefer Haliloviƒá, then Chief of the Main Staff, appointed Rasim Deliƒá as Acting Head of the Department of Operations Planning and Training in the Main Staff. 3 June 1992 this group was named the Operation Command Visoko. In autumn 1992, the Visoko group was officially named Staff of the Supreme Command - Visoko Department, thus going over the head of the command of the General Staff and Defense Ministry and directly answering to the Presidency and the President. On 27 April 1993, Sefer appointed Rasim as one of the four officers representing the ARBiH in the joint command of the ARBiH and the Croatian Defence Council (HVO).

According to the international prosecutor's indictment Deliƒá was informed about these crimes but did nothing to prevent them or punish the criminals. *On 21 June 1995, two soldiers of the Army of Republika Srpska were arrested and soon afterwards beheaded by soldiers of Army of BiH. The indictment states other prisoners arrested on the same day were tortured and then taken to Kamenica Camp. Another Serbian soldier, Gojko Vujiƒçiƒá, was alleged to have been beheaded on 24 July 1995. Other prisoners were forced to kiss the head which was on display in the room they were held in. Various types of torture were practiced in Kamenica Camp, including by electric shock, or causing horrible pain to the subjects by having rubber pipes inserted into their legs and then pumping the tubing up with increasingly higher air pressure. *On 11 September 1995 around sixty Serbian soldiers were arrested together with three women who were all then transferred to Kamenica Camp. All of the soldiers were never seen again and it is presumed they are dead. It is alleged that three women were raped and later freed, on 10 November 1995.

According to presiding judge Bakone Moloto, in the course of its case, the prosecution did not lead any evidence on count three related to the rape.SENSE TRIBUNAL - ICTY: DELIC ACQUITTED ON RAPE CHARGES *Another group of ten Serbian soldiers was arrested on 10 September 1995. They were all subjected to torture for a period of twelve days. It was alleged that Deliƒá knew that the Mujahideen and other soldiers of his army intended to commit those crimes and knew that Kamenica Camp was the place those crimes were likely to happen but he did nothing to prevent those crimes. On 3 March 2005, Deliƒá surrendered voluntarily to the International Court. He pleaded not guilty on all accounts. =Trial and verdict= On 15 September 2008, after around eleven months of trial, the court passed the judgment in case of Deliƒá. He was two times temporarily released to Bosnia, the first time in May 2005B92: Deliƒá temporarily released and the second time during new year break on 11 December 2007. The prosecutors did not have remarks on these decisions. While on his second release, Deliƒá was held in home detention for a while because he spoke with Haris Silajd≈æiƒá - he was accused of having talked about his case with him, but he claimed he only talked about friends and family.B92: Deliƒá in home detention in Bosnia The prosecutors requested fifteen years of jail, while the defence requested his release for his guilt had not been proven. The defence claimed that in critical time he did not have control over Mujahideen so that he had not been in a position to have stopped them or for that matter to have punished them.MTS Mondo News: Rasim Deliƒá sentenced to 3 years The court, however, concluded that Deliƒá was not guilty for crimes over Croatian soldiers in Maline for he had been appointed commander of the headquarters on the same day. He was also found not guilty of cruelty and murder in village Kesten and Kamenica Camp, where Mujahideen were alleged to have killed one old man and 52 Serbian soldiers as well as having tortured another 10. He was found guilty only for one charge for failure to prevent or punish the cruel treatment of twelve captured Serb soldiers in the village of Livade and in the Kamenica camp (three incidents between 1993 and 1995) and he was found not guilty for other accounts. Although the war crimes of the El Mujahideen battalion were proven, and it was agreed by most of the court that Deliƒá had effective control over that unit during that time, the judges concluded that Deliƒá could not have known about those murders at the time so he could not have stopped them.Danas.rs: Rasim Deliƒá sentenced to three years of prison Deliƒá was sentenced to three years in prison,Herald Tribune: Rasim Deliƒá gets three years in prison with the 448 days already spent in detention counted as part of that sentence.

Richmond Depot uniforms were not issued to western or Deep South Confederates, such as the Army of Tennessee. History In April 1861 at the beginning of the American Civil War the Confederates States Congress turned to Prussian artist Nicola Marschall to design a new uniform for the Confederate military. Marschall‚Äôs designs were inspired by the grey uniforms he had seen on a group of Austrian sharpshooters in Italy in 1857. Marschall‚Äôs new uniform designs were approved and released as General Order #9 on 6 June 1861 to be applied to all Confederate forces. Early in the War the Confederate government had relied upon the \\"Commutation System\\" to keep its troops well supplied with clothing and equipment, but as the war dragged on into its second year of conflict, the system proved to be faulty. Early in 1862, the Confederate Government set new guidelines and developed the \\"Depot system\\", a series of federal government controlled facilities, that would have a steady supply of equipment to the soldiers and sailors of the Confederacy in the region of that depot. The Richmond Clothing Bureau was one of these such facilities, and was one of the more successful, keeping in operation from the early winter of 1861/62, to the last days of the Confederate States Army's control over Richmond, Virginia, in April 1865. It had two branches: the Shoe Manufactory under Captain Stephen Putneyhttp://dig.library.vcu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/postcard/id/451 and the Clothing Manufactory under O.F. Weisiger, a civilian (until 1863 when he was made a Captain.) =Produced equipment= The Richmond depot produced several variations of jackets, trousers, and caps; including militia styled uniforms authorized by the Confederate Government for construction and distribution. The most common items produced, are the Richmond Depot style shell jacket, the Trousers, and the Kepi. The materials used by the Richmond Depot, were produced by the Crenshaw Wool Mill, in Richmond, Virginia, near the Tredegar Iron Works, both of which were burnt down in mid-1863. The wool produced by this mill was a medium to bright cadet grey, often in 60 inch-wide bolts, with the blankets being produced in , probably of the same cadet grey material. Later in the war, imported dark cadet grey kersey, known as \\"English Army cloth\\", was being used in the domestically produced jackets, trousers, and caps, as well as the complete uniforms brought through the blockade by companies, such as Peter Tait of Limerick, Ireland. These uniforms started to become commonplace in the Army of Northern Virginia and the rest of the Confederate States Army later in the war. Battle flags were also produced by the depot from early 1862 to the end of the war in Virginia. These flags were made using captured red, blue, and white bunting stock from the captured Norfolk Naval yards. These fabrics were originally intended to be sewn into United States and other various flags. =Jacket design= Richmond Depot shell jacket The jackets produced during the war were not grouped into different types until long after the war was over, being set by modern historians. Many, if not all of the jackets were produced from the Richmond depot in a production line, with the details being omitted as time went by to save material due to war time shortages and faster completion rates. One of the parts of this 'production line', consisted of sewing groups, or the ladies of the towns and city, that would come to the facilities, take unfinished uniforms and bolts of cloth, and drop off the completed uniforms. Three types of Richmond Depot jackets were produced: #The Richmond Depot Type I was issued late in 1861 or the beginning of 1862. The Richmond Depot Type I, was a jacket with a six piece body and two piece sleeves, with an eight or nine button front, shoulder straps and probably belt loops. There were generally two buttons on the cuffs. The lining was probably a cotton osnaburg. The distinctive point about the first pattern jacket was that instead of having the regulation collar and sleeve facings as prescribed in General Order #9, it was trimmed on the collar, shoulder straps and cuffs with either tape or piping which appears to be usually dark colored, using 1/4\\" inch tape, or 1/8\\" piping.Confederate Issue Jackets, Part 2 Today, there are no surviving Type I jackets, but based on photographs, these details can be deduced. #In mid-1862, the Type I was phased out for the Richmond Depot Type II. Due to scarce supplies, they were made of jeans (a mixture of wool and cotton) or satinette and cassimere. There are several extant examples of Type IIs throughout out the United States, including in the American Civil War Museum.The Museum of the Confederacy: The Richmond Depot Type II jacket is characterized by a nine- button front, no buttons on the cuffs, top-stitched edges, shoulder straps, belt loops on each hip, an unbleached cotton osnaburg lining and interior pockets. It has a six piece body and two piece sleeves. Generally, it has no trim, although examples with partial trim do exist. #The Type II was phased out in mid-1864 for the Richmond Depot Type III. This was the last Richmond Depot jacket issued to the Army of Northern Virginia. It was primarily made from a blue-grey English wool material which had been imported from Britain. The major contractor was Peter Tait of \\"Tait and Co Army Contracts\\" located in Limerick, Ireland, who also supplied uniforms for the British Army. The Confederate government had commenced trading with Tait in late 1863 specifically for the supply of jackets and trousers. Pants were made of the same material. Tait not only made the uniforms but also ran them through the Union blockade in his own steamers the Elavey, Eveline and Kelpie, none of which were captured. The bulk of the contract started to arrive in the autumn of 1864.https://acws.co.uk/archives-military-petertait In addition to supplying ready-made uniforms, Tait also supplied raw material for local construction by the depot. The Type III was issued concurrent with the type II, from 1863 till the end of the war but with no epaulettes, belt loops or trim. Seven of these jackets have survived, and there are a number of identifiable photographs that show them in use.http://irishamericancivilwar.com/2011/04/22/book-review-imported- confederate-uniforms-of-peter-tait-co-limerick-ireland/ From the handful of surviving artifacts it appears that most may have been made with either all blue or blue-trimmed collars, and either all blue or blue-trimmed epaulettes (despite different colors prescribed for the different branches of service.) To confuse things further, one original artifact, worn by a Private from South Carolina, Francis M. Durham, has a red collar and no epauletteshttp://adolphusconfederateuniforms.com/francis-m-durham-peter-tait- imported-jacket.html. All had British sizings stamped inside the jackets. This makes them easy to identify as none of the surviving depot-made artifacts have sizings noted in them. Since these jackets were produced over a considerable period of time, and because they were made from materials available at different times, variations in the coat material and the number of buttons have been noted. *There are also different variations of these jackets, in both cut and material, as the war progressed. Such as the number of buttons on one jacket, which belonged to George H. T. Greer, General Jubal Early's staff; this example only possesses six of the nine buttons that are normally found on the other jackets. One other, which is believed to belong to Pvt. Henry Redwood, has eight buttons, however, the bottom of the jacket shows evidence of new stitching and other modifications, leading historians to believe that this was intentional on the part of Pvt. Redwood. =Trouser design= The Design of the trousers issued by the Richmond Depot, are similar in design to some pre-war civilian trousers, with a back buckle and belt for adjustment to the wearer, and squared, \\"mule ear\\" pockets, some with buttons to keep the square flaps of these pockets up. The original depot-issued trousers were French Blue and made of wool. This blue was darker and more vibrant than the sky blue color of Federal uniform pants. In late 1862 when the depot started producing uniforms made of cadet-grey jeans cloth, trousers were also produced in matching material and color. Then again in 1863 after the depot began receiving the blue-grey cloth from Europe uniform trousers were once again manufactured in the same material and color until the conclusion of the War in 1865.http://adolphusconfederateuniforms.com/basics-of-confederate- uniforms.html Nevertheless there are several artifacts of late-war trousers, that were produced with light or sky blue wool kersey, which by colour resemble the United States Army regulation trousers, but are not similar in construction to any pair produced in the northern U.S. held Arsenals. =Battle flag designs= The design of the Battle flag from the Richmond depot, are similar to the specifications stated in the autumn/winter of 1861. There are three types of Battle flags made from this depot, much like the jackets, these groups were not designated until after the war. These three primary designations had the corps traits of the A.N.V. design flags: a red back ground, a blue cross, with a white edge on the cross, and an edge border of either orange or white cloth, with twelve or thirteen stars inside the blue cross. #The first bunting issue flags, were large, some at , had an 8 in-wide saltire, or cross, in blue wool, with an orange wool edge around the entire flag, except the header, or pole edge, which was made of heavy canvas. #The second type was different, only by the size of the cross, being reduced to wide, saving a large amount of material for flags in production. #The third type was changed by only one feature from the second type, the orange bunting edges were exchanged for an off-white border, as the orange bunting was becoming exhausted by mid-1862. Many of these flags were produced using the same design, but due to influences by the sewing groups making them, all of these flags are unique, some having a continuous strip of edge cloth around the flag, others had the stars on the separated part of the cross further from the center star. Several flags from this depot were made in various sizes, most were, or were close to , while several examples show flags of smaller designs, ranging from , down to . Many of such variations can be seen in the collection held by the American Civil War Museum.

Lexington Reservoir Spillway/James J. Lenihan Dam, overflowing Lexington Reservoir (James J. Lenihan Dam) Spillway, emptying into Los Gatos Creek Lexington Reservoir Spillway filled with water. Lexington Reservoir overflows into spillway, a rare event. Lexington Reservoir is an artificial lake on the Los Gatos Creek near Los Gatos, California. The James J. Lenihan Dam, a high, thick earthen dam, forms the third-largest reservoir in Santa Clara County. Background Lexington Reservoir aerial, from the north, with Monterey Bay and the Monterey Peninsula in the background The reservoir is in the foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains, at an elevation of .Lexington Reservoir, California: Lexington Reservoir, California Latitude and Longitude State Route 17 runs alongside the dam's western edge and over part of the reservoir. Alma Bridge Road (Limekiln Canyon Road) runs around the eastern side, connecting with 17 at the north end and again at the south end via other surface streets. The reservoir is contained in Lexington Reservoir County Park, which includes hiking trails in the hills with good views of the reservoir and of Silicon Valley. The Los Gatos Creek Trail starts at the dam and continues downstream along the creek's canyon. It is part of the Santa Clara Valley Water District and provides water for Silicon Valley. History In 1943, because of the rapid expansion of orchards in the county, the Santa Clara Valley Water District determined that the well water in the Santa Clara Valley was being diminished rapidly and a dam was needed on Los Gatos Creek, with one goal being to percolate the water into the ground and ultimately increase the amount of well water available. After rerouting State Route 17 near Windy Point, which is a mile south of Los Gatos, the District began dam construction in the spring of 1952, completing it that fall. The reservoir covered the towns of Lexington and Alma. Alma and Lexington reached their peak population in the mid-19th century, when about 200 people lived in each. Each of the towns had a post office, hotel, saloons, blacksmith shops, and half a dozen redwood sawmills. Lexington was the halfway stop for stagecoaches running between San Jose and Santa Cruz. The town served as a place to switch from four horses to six horses to get over the mountains. Lexington declined after 1880 when the narrow gauge railroad from Los Gatos to Santa Cruz bypassed it, while Alma declined when Highway 17 bypassed it in 1940. The railroad ceased operations in 1940. By 1950, only about 100 people lived in the two communities. Lexington gained national attention in 1883, when a Los Gatos saloon keeper, Lloyd Majors, hired two thugs to rob an elderly Lexington man who kept $20,000 in gold in his cabin. They burned him with turpentine-soaked rags and beat him with pistols, killing him, and then fled with the gold. Their sensational trial in San Jose drew national attention similar to that accorded to the Lizzie Borden ax murders nine years later. Majors and one of the thugs were hanged. The other spent 15 years in prison.  Renovation project  In September 2007, the Santa Clara Valley Water District began its ‚ÄúLenihan Dam Outlet Project‚Äù at Lexington Reservoir. This project replaced the old outlet pipe that ran through the base of the dam, from the reservoir to Los Gatos Creek. The old pipe was replaced with a -diameter pipe, new valves, outlet structures, and a control building. The increase in size was made to allow the reservoir to drain quickly enough to prevent dam collapse during emergencies, such as after a major earthquake that could cause cracks in the dam, or during a series of heavy winter storms. A collapse would pose flooding risks to Los Gatos and Campbell. The old pipe was aging, and required frequent maintenance, and repairs; it had collapsed in several places. The new outlet pipe, which runs through a new tunnel in Saint Joseph's Hill, on the east side of the dam, also features new actuating valves, and a new intake structure. The project was completed in Fall of 2009, and ‚Äúfirst release‚Äù celebration was held on Oct. 20, 2009.

For fishing, the reservoir is stocked with black bass, trout, bluegill, and crappie. The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) has developed a safe eating advisory for Lexington Reservoir based on levels of mercury or PCBs found in fish caught from this water body. The park includes part of the San Andreas Fault, which crosses Los Gatos Creek just south of the upstream end of the reservoir.

Built in 1812‚Äì1813, it is a rare, well-preserved example of a sixteen-sided meeting house. It was built to serve as the meeting place for the town as well as five Protestant congregations. Today it is maintained by the Richmond Historical Society and is open to the public during the summer and early fall, It is also available for weddings and other events.Old Round Church website It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1996 for the rarity of its form and its exceptional state of preservation.. Description and history The Round Church is set on the east side of Round Church Road, a short way south of the Winooski River and Richmond's main village center. It is a two-story wood frame structure with sixteen sides, finished with wooden clapboards and modest Federal period styling. All but four sides have two sash windows; the wall section behind the pulpit has no windows, and three sides have doorways in the first level and windows in the second. The doorways are framed by simple pilasters and unadorned entablatures. The building is topped by a sixteen-sided roof with a two-stage octagonal belltower at the center. The church was built in 1812‚Äì13 by William Rhodes, a native of Claremont, New Hampshire, where there was a sixteen-sided brick church (since demolished) whose only surviving view shows great similarity to this building. Rhodes adapted the conventional meeting house to this distinctive form, borrowing at least some details from architectural pattern books, using a panel from Asher Benjamin's 1797 Public Builder's Assistant for the styling of the pulpit. The construction was funded by the sale of pews, most of which were purchased by Congregationalists, but at least four other Christian denominations were represented. The building was used for both religious service and town meetings for many years. The Baptist Congregation folded in 1843, and the Congregationalists moved to a new building in 1850. The Universalists built their own church in 1879, and the Methodists apparently stopped using this building in the 1880s.Cotton Boll Conspiracy, Old Round Church: A Curiosity in the Heart of the Green Mountains, September 5, 2015 The town continued to use it until 1973, when it was closed over concerns for its structural soundness. The building had in 1927 undergone some work to shore up its leaning tower and sagging roof, but these changes may have been ineffective. The town gave the building to the Richmond Historical Society in 1976, and it underwent a major restoration in 1980‚Äì81. This restoration reversed major alterations made since its original construction (including, for example, the removal of a stairway to the attic), the careful reconstruction of the tower using similar materials (due to extensive rot in the original), and a sympathetic reframing of the roof.

Early years Suttill was born in Mons-en-Bar≈ìul near Lille, France, to an English father, William Francis Suttill, and a French mother, Blanche Marie- Louise Degrave. His father managed a textile manufacturing plant in Lille. Suttill studied at Stonyhurst College, Lancashire, England. For the school year 1927/8, he attended the College de Marcq in Mons-en-Bar≈ìul, gaining his Baccalaur√©at. He then read law at the University of Lille and was accepted as an external student at University College London. In 1931, he moved to London to continue his studies and eventually became a barrister at Lincoln's Inn. He married Margaret Montrose in 1935 and had 2 sons.Suttill and Foot, Perrin, Nigel, \\"Francis Suttill,\\" , accessed 17 Jan 2020 Suttill suffered from polio as a child and one leg was shorter than the other although he could walk without a limp.Suttill, Francis (2014), Shadows in the Fog, London: The History Press, pp. 21-24, , accessed 31 Jan 2020 World War II =Prosper= In May 1940, Suttill was commissioned into the East Surrey Regiment of the British Army. He was recruited and trained by SOE during the summer of 1942. Charismatic and a natural leader, Suttill was considered by SOE to be \\"highly resourceful and smarter than most\\" and thus chosen for its \\"most challenging job: to establish a circuit in Paris, covering a vast chunk of central France.\\" His network was named Physician, although more commonly was called by his code name of Prosper.Helm, pp. 12, 28-29 Earlier SOE networks, Carte and Autogiro, led by Frenchmen Andr√© Girard and Pierre de Vom√©court respectively, had been destroyed by the Germans. Suttill's job was to build a network under British control on their remnants. With the allied invasion of North Africa approaching, and tentative (but unrealized) plans for an invasion of France in 1943, SOE Section F (France) leader Maurice Buckmaster in London envisioned a strong resistance network based in Paris to harass the German occupiers of France.Cookridge, E. H. (1967), Set Europe Ablaze, New York: Thomas H. Crowell, p. 127 On 24 September 1942, Suttill's courier, Andr√©e Borrel, code names Denise and Monique, was parachuted into France to prepare for his arrival. He himself parachuted into France on 1 October 1942 near La Fert√©-sous-Jouarre. Suttill was fluent in spoken French, but had an accent and he relied on Borrel, already experienced in the resistance, for much of his communication. After meeting in Paris, Suttill and Borrel took a month long trip around central France, exploring the potential for setting up resistance networks. They posed as an agricultural salesman and his assistant. Their early successes and high level of activity led SOE to send them two wireless operators, Gilbert Norman (Archambaud) in November, and Jack Agazarian (Marcel) in December. Most SOE networks had only one wireless operator.Helm, 12, 28-29Suttill and Foot, During late 1942 and the first half of 1943, the Prosper network grew rapidly, covering a large part of northern France, and involving hundreds of locally recruited agents and some 60 networks and sub-networks. SOE headquarters in London was both surprised and elated at the rapid progress of Prosper, although concerned about its connections with the communists who were especially powerful in the northern suburbs of Paris. SOE, Suttill, and the French Resistance groups had the expectation that an allied invasion of France would occur in fall 1943. The efforts of Prosper and its sub-networks were directed toward becoming a potent resistance force to aid that invasion. Suttill stockpiled arms and ammunition parachuted in from England to that end.Marshall, Robert (2012), All The King's Men, London: Bloomsbury Reader, Kindle Edition, originally published in 1988, locations 1119-1136.Helm, p. 29 In April 1943, Benjamin Cowburn, a careful, effective SOE agent, delivered radio crystals to Suttill in Paris and remarked that a large number of SOE agents and their French contacts were going in and out of the same apartment. Suttill responded that SOE headquarters kept sending people to him who needed help and that the address of the apartment had been passed around by agents. Cowburn, Benjamin (2014), No Cloak, No Dagger, Barnsley, Yorkshire: Frontline Books, p. 149 The size and scope of Prosper violated SOE doctrine that agents in different networks should have no contact with each other and even that agents in the same network should rarely meet, but rather communicate through intermediaries or letter-drops. Suttill, however, was running a large organization in which contacts among SOE agents were extensive. Security was loose. Norman, Borrel, and Agazarian and his wife, Francine, met frequently to play poker at a Paris cafe. The remnants of the Carte network which were folded into Prosper included at least one German agent. Moreover, the German Gestapo and Abwehr were becoming more expert at rooting out SOE agents and their French collaborators. The consequence would be the capture of Suttill and many of his agents and the destruction of the Prosper network.Suttill and Foot, Foot, p. 104. =Dericourt and air operations= The Westland Lysander ferried agents back and forth to England. A canister beneath the fuselage carried supplies. On the night of 22/23 January 1943, a much-traveled French pilot named Henri Dericourt, code named Gilbert, was parachuted into France, landing about south of Paris. As the air movements officer for Prosper, Dericourt was charged with finding farm fields suitable for landing small aircraft from England and arranging for the embarkation or disembarkation of SOE agents. He collected mail and reports, often written in plain text rather than coded, from the agents and delivered messages to them. He was unusually successful and efficient. He accomplished the dangerous tasks of arranging clandestine aircraft landings and the reception and departure of agents without problems.Marshall, location 1373-1390Foot, p. 289-290, 298. Parachute drops of weapons and supplies also began in March 1943.Perrin, Nigel, \\"Francis Suttill,\\" , accessed 23 Jan 2020 Parachute reception teams and drop areas were in the Ardennes in Belgium, near Falaise in Normandy, three areas around Le Mans and two around Troyes, soon to be taken over by the Tinker network. Also, both the Privet network around Nantes and the Musician network around Saint-Quentin, Aisne were originally part of the Physician network. There were two main clusters: one in the Vernon/Beauvais/Meru triangle to the northwest of Paris and the other between Tours, Orl√©ans and Vierzon, an area known as the Sologne between the Loire and Cher rivers.F J Suttill, , Bulletin d'Association ERIL, 2010. . =Arrests= On 22 April 1943, the Tambour sisters, Germaine and Madeleine, long-time members of the French Resistance were arrested in Paris. Suttill, through an intermediary, attempted to buy their release with a one million franc bribe, but the Germans deceived him by releasing two prostitutes rather than the Tambour sisters. The danger of the arrest to Prosper was that ten of its agents had used the house as a letter-box and meeting place, far more than prudence dictated. Foot, pp. 309,315.Cookridge, pp.131-132. On 15 May 1943, Suttill returned to London for unknown reasons. He was parachuted back in France over Romorantin, now Romorantin-Lanthenay, on 21 May 1943, with another SOE agent, France Antelme. On his return, his confidence seemed shattered. He feared that Prosper had been penetrated by the Germans, and he was highly critical of the ignorance of SOE personnel in London about the conditions he faced in the field. Arrests of people in Suttill's network began to multiply and concerns of betrayal heightened. On 19 June, Suttill sent a bitter message to London blaming SOE for the near-arrest of his newest wireless operator, Noor Inayat Khan, by directing her to a compromised letter-box. He cancelled all passwords and letter-boxes.Helm, pp. 33-34 On the night of 15-16 June, two SOE agents, Canadians John Kenneth Macalister and Frank Pickersgill, were dropped to one of sub-network leader Pierre Culioli's reception sites. On the morning of 21 June, Culioli and his courier, Yvonne Rudellat, set off with the two Canadians to catch a train to Paris unaware that the Germans had set up extensive roadblocks. They were caught and the Germans found packages of letters and instructions and radio crystals in the car, two of which were clearly labelled \\"For Archambaud\\". This led the Germans to Archambaud (Gilbert Norman, Suttill's wireless operator) because, as Culioli admitted after the war, he had the address of Archambaud in his briefcase when he was caught. Shortly after midnight of 23 June, a German officer pretending to be one of the recently parachuted Canadian agents came to the apartment where Norman was staying and he and Andr√©e Borrel were arrested. The apartment was full of identification cards and other documents. The Germans learned, presumably from the documents or from one of those arrested, where Suttill was and he was arrested mid-morning on 24 June where he was staying in a cheap hotel. The arrests continued. On 1 July Jean Worms, head of the Juggler Network, and Armel Guerne, Suttill's de facto second in command, were arrested in a Paris cafe where Worms ate lunch every day. Over the next three months, hundreds of local agents associated with Prosper were arrested, of whom 167 are known to have been deported to Germany where about one-half were executed, killed, or died in concentration camps.Suttill, p. 325, The communists in the Paris suburbs with whom Suttill worked mostly survived the debacle because of their rigid security practices and their dependence on SOE only for arms and money, and not guidance and communications.Foot, p. 319 The survivors of the Prosper Network were mostly in the sub-networks of Prosper scattered around northern France. One temporary survivor was newly-arrived wireless operator Inayat Khan who was not captured until 13 October.Foot, pp. 319, 339. =Buckmaster's blunder= On 25 June, an agent in Paris radioed SOE headquarters in London that Suttill, Norman, and Borrel \\"had disappeared, believed arrested.\\" Thereafter, there was radio silence from Paris about the fate of Suttill until 7 July when a message from Gilbert Norman's radio arrived in London. The message confirmed that Suttill had been captured, but apparently Norman was still at large and transmitting. However, the message was strange. It was distorted, but that could have been caused by atmospheric conditions. The style of transmitting, the \\"fist,\\" was different than the usual for Norman, and, most importantly, both the \\"bluff\\" and \\"true\\" checks were missing from the message. These checks were spelling mistakes or phrases deliberately inserted into a message by a wireless operator to prove that it was indeed he or she who was transmitting. The absence of the checks in a message meant the operator or the radio, or both, were under the control of the Germans and transmitting under duress. Norman had a high reputation for efficiency and character and SOE's French section leader, Maurice Buckmaster, refused to believe that he had been captured. He sent back a message to Norman's radio saying, \\"You have forgotten your double security check. Be more careful next time.\\" Buckmaster had inadvertently told the Germans how to transmit messages to SOE which would be accepted as genuine.Helm, p. 34-37 =Funkspiel= Dr. Josef Goetz was the wireless expert at 84 Avenue Foch in Paris, the headquarters of the Sicherheitsdienst (SD), the security service of the German SS. When wireless operator Gilbert Norman was captured on 23 June, the Germans also captured his wireless set. With this wireless, and others soon captured, including that of Noor Inayat Khan, and after Buckmaster's blunder on 7 July Goetz was able to play radio games (\\"Funkspiel\\") with SOE headquarters. His false messages were regarded as genuine. He was able to pretend for months that the Prosper network was still functioning. The practical results were that Goetz deceived SOE into air-dropping arms and equipment into German hands and, with details of their travel, the Germans captured 17 SOE agents immediately upon their arrival in France.Foot, pp. 328-335.Suttill, p. 325, Helm, 306-314 By 6 June 1944, the date of the Normandy invasion, the radio game was worn out, but the Germans could not resist taunting the British. Although Goetz protested, the German government ordered Josef Kieffer, head of SD at 84 Avenue Foch, to wire his opposite number, Maurice Buckmaster, at SOE. Kieffer drafted and sent a message saying: > We thank you for the large deliveries of arms and ammunition which you have > been kind enough to send us. We also appreciate the many tips you have given > us regarding our plans and intentions which we have carefully noted. In case > you are concerned about the health of some of the visitors you have sent us > you may rest assured they will be treated with the consideration they > deserve.Glass, Charles (2018), They Fought Alone, New York: Penguin Press, > p. 189. Most of the SOE \\"visitors\\" captured by the Germans were executed.Foot, pp. 319, 339 =Suttill's pact= Some authors report that Suttill or Norman or both after their arrest made a pact with Josef Kieffer, the head of SD in Paris. The terms were that, if Suttill or Norman told the Germans where their caches of arms were located, captured SOE agents would be treated as prisoners of war and not executed as spies.Cookridge, pp. 142 Whether such a pact existed has been debated by historians. SOE's Vera Atkins interviewed Kieffer after the war while he was on trial for war crimes. Atkins' report did not confirm that such a pact existed. She was uncustomarily vague about this all- important question. She reported only that Kieffer said that Suttill \\"did not want to make a statement\\" and not whether or not he did. She also reported that Kieffer said that Norman \\"had not the character of\\" Suttill, which gives the impression that Norman was the more malleable of the two. At the time of this interview in 1947, accusations were being made by the French that Suttill had sold out his French followers. Atkins and SOE neither confirmed nor denied this accusation. Suttill's family was bitter at the lack of support they received from SOE.Helm, pp. 359-360 If a pact existed, the Germans violated it as many SOE agents and French collaborators were executed.Cookridge, pp. 150-153 =Dericourt's deception= The role of Henri Dericourt, Suttill's air movements officer, in the destruction of the Physician/Prosper network is much debated. Dericourt, as mentioned above, arranged for the arrival and departure of SOE agents by air and collected their mail, including their uncoded reports, for transmittal to London. He was highly successful in these duties, but doubts about him began to be expressed in June 1943, at about the same time that Germans had begun destroying the Prosper network. Several SOE agents communicated that \\"Gilbert is a traitor,\\" but it is unclear whether they were talking about Dericourt, code named Gilbert, or Gilbert Norman who had been captured by the Germans. In October 1943, Henri Frager, a veteran resistance leader, flew to London specifically to denounce Dericourt as a traitor. Dericourt, however, enjoyed the support of SOE French section leader Buckmaster and his deputy, Nicolas Bodington.Foot, pp. 298-300 What Dericourt appears to have done was to copy the letters and reports which agents gave him for transmittal by airplane to England and give them to the Germans. The Germans learned much about the Prosper network and individual agents, which facilitated the arrests of agents and the destruction of the network. Moreover, interrogators such as Kieffer were able to weaken the resolve of captured SOE agents by revealing how much the Germans knew about them personally. After World War II in 1948, Dericourt was put on trial in Paris. Nobody who had worked for SOE showed up to testify against Dericourt, but Bodington testified on his behalf. He said Dericourt's contacts with the Germans were known to the SOE and that Dericourt was loyal to the allies. Dericourt was acquitted. This was not the first time that Bodington had defended Dericourt, which ignited doubts of Bodington's loyalties.Helm, 116-117, 304-306Dericourt was killed in Laos in a crash of a plane he was piloting on 9 November 1962; Bodington died on 3 July 1974. Execution and honours After his capture on 24 June 1943, Suttill was imprisoned and interrogated at Sicherheitsdienst (SD) headquarters at 84 Avenue Foch in Paris and later sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp near Berlin where he was held in solitary confinement in the prison block until he was hanged about 21 March 1945.Cookridge, p. 244 He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order posthumously. Francis Suttill is honoured on the Commonwealth War Graves Commission Memorial at Groesbeek in the Netherlands and also on the Roll of Honour on the Valen√ßay SOE Memorial in Valen√ßay, in the Indre department of France.

Over the span of a 15-year period (1986‚Äì2000) the New York Guitar Show was the only regularly scheduled vintage guitar event dedicated entirely to charity in the United States. Originally started by Ken and Kathy Heer, East Village music dealers (Saint Mark's Music Exchange) in 1983‚Äì84 at a midtown Manhattan hotel as a for-profit event, the production was purchased by Skip Henderson, an ex-social worker turned vintage guitar dealer (City Lights Music) from New Brunswick, New Jersey, moved to the Mary Help of Christians church auditorium at E.12th St. and Ave. A, and changed into a not for profit venture primarily to support the AIDS Resource Foundation for Children in Newark, New Jersey. Henderson later went on to establish the non-profit Mt. Zion Memorial Fund in Clarksdale, Mississippi to assist rural black churches in the Mississippi Delta. The New York Guitar Show was also a venue for a Saturday night performance series which Henderson produced over the lifespan of the event. These shows featured an eclectic array of performers such as Nokie Edwards of the Ventures, guitar maker Semie Moseley, Junior Brown, The LeRoi Brothers, Lonnie Pitchford, Elliot Easton of The Cars, YouTube favorites The Otis Brothers featuring Bob Guida (an early financial backer of the event), and numerous others. In 1996 as Henderson became more involved with the activities of the Mt. Zion Fund, production of the show was transferred to another vintage guitar dealer James Pasch, with the contractual stipulation that it remain a fund raising event for the AIDS Resource Foundation for Children. Primarily because of its East Village location, the event was known for attracting a diverse crowd of notable musicians and figures from New York City such as Billy Idol, Allen Ginsberg, Lenny Kravitz, Willy DeVille, and many others. In 2013 Mary Help of Christians Church, the original site of the guitar show, was sold for $41 million and demolished despite protests from Greenwich Village historic preservationists. In 1993 Skip Henderson produced a Chorale \\"The Faith of Avenue A\\", consisting of three selections sung by the Mary Help of Christians Choir, professionally recorded on Neumann microphones in the Church itself the only recording ever done in the Church Sanctuary. In September, 2020, The Mount Zion Memorial Fund assumed control of that legacy.

Hafiz Rahmat Khan Barech (1723 ‚Äì April 1774) was Regent of Rohilkhand in North India, from 1749 to 1774.Genealogy of Rampur princely state, [‚Üí] He was a Pashtun by background, ruling over Rohillas. Hafiz Rahmat Khan had served honorably throughout the reign of three Mughal Emperors: Ahmad Shah Bahadur, Alamgir II and Shah Alam II. He was also a mentor of Prince Mirza Jawan Bakht. Early life and origins In 1623 two Pashtun brothers of the Barech Durrani tribe, Bahadur Shah I and Husain Khan, settled here and founded a small state of Rampur, bringing with them many other Pashtun settlers. Ali Muhammad Khan, grandson of Bahadur Shah I, later united the Rohillas between 1707 and 1720, making Bareilly his capital. Hafiz Rahmat Khan Barech, who was his uncle, succeeded him, extended his power from Almora in the North to Etawah in the South-West. Victory against Ahmad Shah Durrani (1748) In the year 1748, Ahmad Shah Durrani led an expedition to plunder the western regions of the Mughal Empire. This incursion posed as a major challenge to the Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah, who urgently Asaf Jah I from the Deccan in order to lead the Mughal Army based in the North-West South Asia, this army was also headed by Prince Ahmad Shah and according to the advise of Ali Mohammed Khan, Hafiz Rahmat Khan was appointed as the Subedar of Sirhind in order to lead and regain and recover territories from the Durrani, forces even Muradyab Khan Kalhoro the Subedar of Sindh to dispatch reinforcements to assist the Mughal Army along the river banks. Prince Ahmad and the respected Grand Vizier Asaf Jah I were dispatched by the Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah to command a large Mughal Army of 75,000 to confront the advancing Durrani's. At Sirhind both forces fought a decisive battle and Prince Ahmad was nominally victorious. He was thereupon conferred with the title Bahadur, by the Mughal Emperor. Mughal Civil War According to a Firman by Ahmad Shah Bahadur Hafiz Rahmat Khan was assigned to support Feroze Jung III against the Mughal Grand Vizier Safdarjung, who was defeated and forgiven and thus withdrew to become just the Nawab of Awadh and died in 1753. When Ahmad Shah Bahadur tried to have young Feroze Jung III removed from the imperial court, the outcast then sought an alliance with the detested Maratha chieftain Sadashivrao Bhau. Together they deposed Ahmad Shah Bahadur after the devastating First Battle of Sikandarabad in the year 1754. Since then Hafiz Rahmat Khan entered the service of Najib-ul-Daula and constantly fought the Marathas led by Sadashivrao Bhau and opposed Feroze Jung III. Alliance with the Ahmad Shah Durrani In 1757, the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II with courtiers such as Najib-ul-Daula and Hafiz Rahmat Khan, nobles such as Shah Waliullah and the imperial family went to Sirhind to meet Ahmad Shah Durrani, whose forces then engaged the Marathas in combat and threatened to overthrow and execute the regime of Imad-ul-Mulk.

Internal conflict with Awadh After the war Nawab Shuja-ud-Daula demanded payment for their help from the Rohilla chief, Hafiz Rahmat Khan Barech. When the demand was refused the Nawab joined with the British under Governor Warren Hastings and his Commander-in-Chief, Alexander Champion, to invade Rohilkhand and Hafiz Rahmat Khan Barech was killed in the ensuing Battle of Miranpur Katra in 1774. The whole of Rohilkhand (including Bareilly, Pilibhit and Shahjanpur) was surrendered to the East India Company by the treaty of 10 November 1801. Later, Bareilly was a centre of rebellion for the entire area in the Indian Mutiny of 1857. Hafiz British Library.

The three main canals (Herengracht, Prinsengracht and Keizersgracht), dug in the 17th century during the Dutch Golden Age, form concentric belts around the city, known as the Grachtengordel. Alongside the main canals are 1550 monumental buildings. The 17th-century canal ring area, including the Prinsengracht, Keizersgracht, Herengracht and Jordaan, were listed as UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2010, contributing to Amsterdam's fame as the \\"Venice of the North\\". History Numerous tourists view Amsterdam from canal boat tours (2015) Much of the Amsterdam canal system is the successful outcome of city planning. In the early part of the 17th century, with immigration rising, a comprehensive plan was put together, calling for four main, concentric half-circles of canals with their ends resting on the IJ Bay. Known as the \\"grachtengordel\\", three of the canals are mostly for residential development (Herengracht or ‚Äò‚ÄôPatricians' Canal‚Äô‚Äô; Keizersgracht or ‚Äò‚ÄôEmperor's Canal‚Äô‚Äô; and Prinsengracht or ‚Äò‚ÄôPrince's Canal‚Äô‚Äô), and a fourth, outer canal, the Singelgracht, for purposes of defense and water management. The plan also envisaged interconnecting canals along radii; a set of parallel canals in the Jordaan quarter (primarily for the transportation of goods, for example, beer); the conversion of an existing, inner perimeter canal (Singel) from a defensive purpose to residential and commercial development; and more than one hundred bridges. The defensive purpose of the Nassau/Stadhouderskade was served by moat and earthen dikes, with gates at transit points but otherwise no masonry superstructures. Construction proceeded from west to east, across the breadth of the layout, like a gigantic windshield wiper as the historian Geert Mak calls it ‚Äì not from the center outwards as a popular myth has it. Construction of the north-western sector was started in 1613 and was finished around 1625. After 1664, building in the southern sector was started, although slowly because of an economic depression. The eastern part of the concentric canal plan, covering the area between the Amstel river and the IJ Bay, was not implemented for a long time. In the following centuries, the land went mostly for park, the Botanical garden, old age homes, theaters and other public facilities ‚Äì and for waterways without much plan. Several parts of the city and of the urban area are polders, recognizable by their postfix -meer meaning 'lake', such as Aalsmeer, Bijlmermeer, Haarlemmermeer, and Watergraafsmeer. The canals in Amsterdam are now used for tourism, recreation, houseboats, and a relatively small amount of private transport compared to the main modes of walking, light rail, subway, and bicycle. Most of the canals are paralleled by automobile roads on both sides. File:Amsterdam1662.jpgA map showing Amsterdam with its canals from 1662 CE.

Water quality Through the mid-19th century, the water in the canals was stagnant and unsanitary, full of garbage, dead fish and feces. To remedy this, in 1879 the steam-powered pump station Gemaal Zeeburg was built to flush the canals out using water from Zuiderzee. Conditions were further improved in 1935 when the inner city was first connected to the sewer system, though the Grachtengordel was not fully connected until 1987. Up until this point, houses released wastewater into the canal. Further attempts to improve the water quality in recent years have included legislation prohibiting houseboats from releasing waste water into the canals. As of 2018, all houseboats are required to be connected to the sewage system, though this is not expected to be achieved until 2021. As of August 2018, more than 50 house boats were still releasing their sewage into the canals. Another source of water pollution, particular to Dutch transport patterns, is the bicycle. Each year, between 12,000 and 15,000 bicycles are pulled out of the canals in what is colloquially referred to as 'bike fishing' (fietsen vissen). While swimming in the canals is not officially encouraged, locals now swim each year in a number of locations around the city. Furthermore, since 2012, the Amsterdam City Swim has been held yearly to raise money for ALS research. In it, volunteers swim from Nieuwe Herengracht to Keizersgracht. However, the swimming part of the event was canceled in 2018 due to high levels of E. coli found in the water due to heavy rains the preceding weeks which overloaded the sewer system. Notable canals in the Canal Belt Singel Herengracht Keizersgracht Prinsengracht Inward to outward, the canals are as follows: =Singel= Singel encircled the medieval city of Amsterdam. It served as a moat around the city from 1480 until 1585, when Amsterdam expanded beyond Singel. The canal runs from the IJ Bay, near Central Station, to the Muntplein square, where it meets the Amstel river. It is now the inner-most canal in Amsterdam's semicircular ring of canals. The canal should not be confused with Singelgracht canal, which became the outer limit of the city during the Dutch Golden Age in the 17th Century. =Herengracht= Herengracht (Patricians' Canal or Lords' Canal) is the first of the three major canals in the city centre of Amsterdam. The canal is named after the heren regeerders who governed the city in the 16th and 17th century. The most fashionable part is called the Golden Bend, with many double wide mansions, inner gardens and coach houses on Keizersgracht. Samuel Sarphati (1813-1868) lived at the house at number 598 and Peter the Great stayed at the house at number 527 during his second visit to Amsterdam. =Keizersgracht= Keizersgracht (literal English translation: Emperor's Canal) is the second and widest of the three major canals in the city centre of Amsterdam, in between Herengracht and Prinsengracht. It is named after Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor. http://www.jlgrealestate.com/English/Amsterdam/Keizersgracht John Adams stayed at the house at number 529, Heinrich Schliemann worked for almost three years at number 71, Daniel Fahrenheit at 463-465, and during his first visit to Amsterdam (1693), Peter the Great stayed at the house at number 317. The Homomonument (Gay Monument) faces the Keizersgracht. =Prinsengracht= Prinsengracht (Prince's Canal) is the fourth and the longest of the main canals in Amsterdam. It is named after the Prince of Orange. Most of the canal houses along it were built during the Dutch Golden Age of the United Provinces. The bridges over the Prinsengracht canal connect with the streets in the Jordaan in the West and the Weteringbuurt on the East side. Notable buildings along Prinsengracht include the Noorderkerk (Northern Church), the Noordermarkt (Northern Market), Anne Frank House, and the Westerkerk (Western Church, Amsterdam's tallest church). Annually, the Prinsengrachtconcert is held on a pontoon in the canal in front of Hotel Pulitzer. Other notable canals Zwanenburgwal Brouwersgracht Brantasgracht =Zwanenburgwal= Zwanenburgwal is a canal and street in the center of Amsterdam. The painter Rembrandt and philosopher Spinoza lived here. In 2006 it was voted one of the most beautiful streets in Amsterdam by readers of Het Parool, a local daily newspaper.Het Parool: Mooiste Amsterdamse straat (Dutch) Zwanenburgwal flows from Sint Antoniessluis sluice gate (between the streets Sint Antoniesbreestraat and Jodenbreestraat) to the Amstel river. The canal was originally named Verversgracht (\\"dyers' canal\\"), after the textile industry that once dominated this part of town. Dyed textiles were hung to dry along the canal. =Brouwersgracht= Brouwersgracht is a canal in the city centre of Amsterdam and is part of the canal belt connecting the Singel, Herengracht, Keizergracht and Prinsengracht and marks the northern border of the canal belt. The canal served as a site for ships returning from Asia with spices and silks, therefore Brouwersgracht had many warehouses and storage depots for the ships inventories. Likewise some officials of the Dutch East India Company lived here such as their cartographer (1708-1743) Isaak de Graaf. Breweries were also prevalent in the area due to the access to fresh water shipments. Today the warehouses are now apartments, some of the most expensive in Amsterdam. Houseboats also are seen in the canal. In 2007, Brouwersgracht was voted the most beautiful street in Amsterdam by readers of Het Parool, a national daily newspaper.Het Parool - Mooiste Amsterdams straat (Dutch) =Kloveniersburgwal= Kloveniersburgwal is a canal running south from Nieuwmarkt to the Amstel River on the edge of the medieval city. The east side became populated in the 17th century and has a few grand mansions, like the Trippenhuis, now housing the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW). Kloveniersburgwal was popular with administrators at the Dutch East India Company, being close to its nerve center on Oude Hoogstraat and its warehouse. =Brantasgracht, Lamonggracht, Majanggracht and Seranggracht= These four canals are the newest in Amsterdam, constructed on Java Island in 1995, a manmade island in the IJ Harbor, north-east of the City Center. The canals are lined with modern interpretations of classic Amsterdam canal houses, which were designed by 19 young Dutch architects. Each house is 4.5 meters wide and 4 or 5 stories tall, but the designs are totally unique and are often featured in Amsterdam travel guides despite being off the beaten path of most tourists. Nine ornate metal bridges, designed by artist couple Guy Rombouts and Monika Droste, cross the canals for pedestrians and cyclists.

S. Eliot at the University of Minnesota in 1956.Eliot's lecture was delivered on 30 April 1956 in Minneapolis, Minnesota to an audience of 14,000 at a stadium. Ackroyd, Peter. T. S. Eliot: A Life. (1984) p. 317 It was reprinted in On Poetry and Poets, a collection of Eliot's critical essays, in 1957. The essay is an attempt by Eliot to define the boundaries of literary criticism: to say what does, and what does not, constitute truly literary criticism, as opposed to, for example, a study in history based upon a work of literature. The essay is significant because it represents Eliot's response to the New Critical perspective which had taken the academic study of literature by storm during Eliot's lifetime. It also presents an analysis of some of its author's own poetic works, an unusual characteristic for modern criticism‚Äîit has become far more usual today for poets and critics to be in separate camps, rather than united in one individual. Perhaps even more importantly, it demonstrates the progress and change in Eliot's own critical thought over the years between 1919 and 1956. Background =Prior critical work= Part of the reason for the importance of this particular piece in Eliot's body of work is the position it holds as successor to an earlier (and probably better known) effort at defining the critical endeavour, Tradition and the Individual Talent. In that earlier piece (first published in 1919), Eliot made famous use of a metaphor drawn from chemistry to describe the process of \\"depersonalization\\" that Eliot claimed to be a necessary condition of poetic creation. In this analogy, Eliot compares the poet him- or herself to a catalyst, whose presence causes \\"feelings\\" and \\"emotions\\" to react with one another and combine in ways not possible without the poet's mind. The essay also makes the point that \\"No poet, no artist of any art, has his complete meaning alone. His significance, his appreciation is the appreciation of his relation to the dead poets and artists. . . . The existing [literary] monuments form an ideal order among themselves, which is modified by the introduction of the new (the really new) work of art among them.\\"T. S. Eliot, \\"Tradition and the Individual Talent\\", The Sacred Wood (1920). Eliot contended that while art never actually got better, it was in a continual state of flux. =Eliot and New Criticism= Eliot is often claimed by the New Critics as one of their founding fathers, an \\"honor\\" he rejected for much the same reasons that he avoided explicit theorising on the subject of literature: namely, because of his conception of the only true criticism as that of a poet trying to better his art.T. S. Eliot, \\"The Perfect Critic\\", The Sacred Wood (1920). In some of his work, Eliot had espoused the idea of criticism as necessarily impersonal. The evaluation of Eliot's criticism occurred relatively early; for example, an appraisal of his work focusing exclusively on Eliot the critic (as opposed to Eliot the poet) appeared in 1941 in a book by John Crowe Ransom. Ransom, participating in the New Critical tradition of borrowing from Eliot, writes that > One of the best things in his influence has been his habit of considering > aesthetic effect as independent of religious effect, or moral, or political > and social; as an end that is beyond and not co-ordinate with these.John > Crowe Ransom, The New Criticism (Norfolk, CT: New Directions, 1941), 138. This is quite similar to the New Critical attitudes of such authors as W. K. Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley. In their theories of literary criticism, it is of vital importance to separate the work in question from all other factors, both on the side of creation (i.e., the writer's intentions) and on that of consumption (the reader's reactions). Content of the lecture Eliot's paper is a concise statement of his reactions to the new directions that literary criticism had taken in the years since the publication in 1923 of his article \\"The Function of Criticism.\\" In this way, the paper is also a more mature re- evaluation of his own positions. Much of its length is involved in this kind of self-study, both of his earlier critical work as well as of his poetry. =Influences on later critics= Throughout, the essay demonstrates the influences Eliot had on the New Critics. While Eliot states early on that he failed to see why he was deemed by current literary scholarship to have given birth to New Criticism (106), he also uses the essay as a platform from which to proclaim a number of principles that are quite similar to those of the New Critics: * the idea of the circumstances surrounding a work's creation as irrelevant (112) * the \\"danger . . . of assuming that there must be just one interpretation of the poem as a whole, [and] that it must be right\\" (113) * the lack of a need to assess the author's intent (113‚Äì14) * the unimportance of the \\"feelings\\" of the reader (114) * the limitation of literary criticism to the study of the literary object, i.e., the work itself (116) However, at the same time, Eliot takes the opportunity to disavow that school of criticism. He ridicules one of the methods of New Criticism, known today as close reading, describing it thus: > The method is to take a well-known poem . . . without reference to the > author or to his other work, analyse it stanza by stanza and line by line, > and extract, squeeze, tease, press every drop of meaning out of it that one > can. It might be called the lemon-squeezer school of criticism. . . . I > imagine that some of the poets (they are all dead except myself) would be > surprised at learning what their poems mean . . . (113) Eliot is here giving voice to one of the most common objections to New Criticism, namely that it removes all the enjoyment from a work of literature by dissecting it. This essay strongly asserts that enjoyment is an important component of the reading of literature. Eliot makes no distinction between \\"enjoyment and understanding,\\" seeing the two not \\"as distinct activities‚Äîone emotional and the other intellectual. . . . To understand a poem comes to the same thing as to enjoy it for the right reasons\\" (115). On the whole question of enjoyment, Eliot diverges from the general trend of New Criticism, which primarily concerned itself with interpretation. Eliot further distances himself from the New Critics with his implication of the possibility of misunderstanding a poem (115), an idea that the New Critics would consider heretical.The precise line from Eliot's paper is \\"to enjoy a poem under a misunderstanding is to enjoy what is merely a projection of our own mind.\\" The \\"official\\" New Critical line on this subject would follow Stanley Fish's argument that there is no text without the mind of a reader; in other words, since the only way for a poem to exist is for it to be constructed in a reader's mind by the act of reading, there is no possibility of \\"misunderstanding\\" any work of literature. =Difference between understanding and explanation= A large part of this lecture is devoted to Eliot's critique of what he calls \\"the criticism of explanation by origins\\" (107). One of these is The Road to Xanadu, by John Livingston Lowes, a work that is now virtually unknown. The other, however, is James Joyce's Finnegans Wake, a work composed mostly what Eliot refers to as \\"merely beautiful nonsense\\" (109) that has puzzled critics since its publication. These works provide Eliot a springboard from which to launch an \\"analysis\\" of his own poems. He takes an amused tone when describing his feelings on hearing what some readers have thought about his various works, with primary reference to The Waste Land. Eliot discusses the process by which the notes to that poem came to be, saying that, to his regret, \\"They have had almost greater popularity than the poem itself\\" (110). Eliot uses the example of Finnegans Wake to illuminate the distinction between explanation and understanding. =Definition of literary criticism= Eliot, like the New Critics, distinguishes among types or classes of criticism, isolating (as the lecture's title suggests) a certain area for literary criticism. Also like the New Critics, he allows that there is merit to such studies. He credits Coleridge with bringing other disciplines (e.g., philosophy, psychology) into the field of literary study. Eliot defines specifically literary criticism as criticism written in order > to help his [i.e., the critic's] readers to understand and enjoy [a work of > literature]. ... We can therefore ask, about any writing which is offered to > us as literary criticism, is it aimed towards understanding and enjoyment? > If it is not, it may still be a legitimate and useful activity; but it is to > be judged as a contribution to psychology, or sociology, or logic, or > pedagogy, or some other pursuit‚Äîand it is to be judged by specialists, not > by men of letters. (116‚Äì17) The argument of the essay is for a strongly individualist criticism, made clear by the frequent references to the author's own works. \\"The best of my literary criticism . . . consists of essays on poets and poetic dramatists who had influenced me\\" (106).

Originally known as the Indexing and Abstracting Society of Canada/Soci√©t√© canadienne pour l'analyse de documents (IASC/SCAD), its name was changed in 2006 to reflect the fact that indexing is the major specialty of its members; however, members maintain a variety of skill sets. History Although Canada‚Äôs national indexing society was formally established in 1977, its origins go back to the early seventies. When the Index Committee of the Bibliographical Society of Canada held its first executive meeting on March 20, 1971, in Toronto, it was resolved that > the Committee should concern itself primarily with the promotion of indexing > and the training of indexers, rather than undertake major indexing projects > itself. Guidelines for future activities were agreed upon, including the > compilation of a Union List of Indexes and a Directory of Indexers. An \\"index training workshop pilot project\\" was later set up in co-operation with the School of Library Science (now the Faculty of Information) at the University of Toronto.Peter Greig, \\"Book Indexing in Canada,\\" The Indexer, 8(3), April 1973, 164-71, quoted in Hazel K. Bell, \\"History of Societies of Indexers, Part II: Three Affiliations,\\" The Indexer, 20(4), October 1997, 212-15, p. 214. In March 1977, the Committee on Bibliographical Services for Canada (CBSC) hosted an indexing and abstracting workshop in the National Library of Canada (now Library and Archives Canada). Attendees \\"noted the absence of a specific forum for abstracters and indexers in Canada, and recommended that such an association be formed.\\" The CBSC then sponsored an Open Forum for Indexers and Abstracters on June 12, 1977, at the Canadian Library Association conference in Montreal. This meeting led to the establishment of IASC/SCAD.Peter Greig, in G. Norman Knight, Indexing, The Art of (London: George Allen & Unwin, 1980), quoted in Bell, \\"History of Societies of Indexers, Part II,\\" p. 214. =Affiliation with the Society of Indexers= The first International Conference of the British Society of Indexers (SI) in 1978 was attended by IASC/SCAD representatives, who discussed with their British counterparts affiliation of the Canadian organization with the SI. As noted by the SI: > It was Canada's bilingualism, reinforced by the influence of a strong > contingent of delegates from France, that stimulated consideration ‚Äì for the > first time ‚Äì of the possibility of moving out of the English-speaking > limitations within which we have hitherto operated.

Gordon, \\"The Canadian Connection,\\" > The Indexer, 11(2), October 1978, 109. Formal affiliation of IASC/SCAD with the SI took place on January 1, 1979, and terms of affiliation were published in The Indexer in April 1979. At that time, IASC/SCAD had 115 individual and institutional members.\\"Terms of Affiliation with the Canadian Society,\\" The Indexer, 11(3), April 1979, 170. The current terms of affiliation can be found in the International Agreement of Indexing Societies. Membership Society members are located across Canada, and there are members in the United States and Europe as well. The Society encourages students to join by offering them a special membership rate. =Regional representation= The Society has established four regions, each with its own representative: British Columbia; Central Canada; Eastern Canada; and the Prairies and Northern Canada. Regional boundaries are reviewed annually to ensure that they reflect the geographic distribution of Society membership. Publications The BulletinISC/SCI Bulletin: Bulletin SCI/ISC is published three times a year, and the Register of Indexers AvailableISC/SCI Publications: Publications SCI/ISC annually. =Register listings= In addition to an alphabetical listing, the Register lists indexers by their skill sets, materials indexed, and subjects indexed. Indexers who work in French are also given separate listings. Some specialized skills listed in the Register include glossary writing, HTML encoding, project management, teaching, and thesaurus construction. Materials on which Society members work go beyond the standard trade or scholarly monograph to include archives, correspondence, legal and medical materials, maps, style guides, and Web sites. And subjects in which Society members specialize run the gamut from art, history, literature, music, political science, psychology, and sociology to alternative medicine, aviation, Canada‚Äôs First Nations, community activism, ethics, folklore, home improvement, oceanography, and popular culture. Conferences and events The Society holds its conference and annual general meeting in a different Canadian city each year. The Society has also held joint conferences with its sister organization in the United States, the American Society for Indexing (ASI). =International representation= The Society actively participates in international indexing matters, sending a representative to the annual Society of Indexers conference, as well as to the ASI conference if possible.

The festival was created to promote Jackson County's leading agricultural product, which at the time was grown by over forty farms in the area. Dates The Apple Festival is held on the 3rd weekend in September. The festival starts at noon on Tuesday and ends on Saturday night. Locations Starting on the Saturday before the festival, downtown streets (Broadway St. between Water St. and Walnut St.; Main St. between Columbia St. and Portsmouth St.; and Pearl St. between Church St. and Portsmouth St.) are closed in Jackson. They are reopened by 5:00 pm on Sunday. History In the spring of 1937, a group of members from the Jackson Chamber of Commerce decided to create a festival that would help promote the county's leading industry. The Apple Festival has been held annually since 1937. The Apple Festival was silenced from 1942 to 1945 during World War II & 2020 caused by COVID-19 pandemic.  Traditions The Friday night home high-school football game at Jackson High School during the week of the festival, is dubbed \\"The Apple Bowl.\\" Several parades are held during the festival. A school parade is held on Wednesday afternoon. Wednesday evening is the Opening Parade. Thursday at noon is the Pre-School Parade. The Saturday night \\"Grande Finale\\" Parade is the festival's biggest event with over 70,000 people attending, and has a claim as \\"the largest lighted parade in Ohio.\\" The parade annually includes local dignitaries and politicians, neighboring festival royalty, and invited high school marching bands from across southern and southeastern Ohio and northern West Virginia; as well as \\"floats\\" from each of the elementary schools in and around Jackson, which depict the annual theme of the festival. The Budweiser Clydesdale Horses have been a part of this parade two times during the 1990s. On September 21, 2001, The Ohio State University Marching Band (TBDBITL) performed a halftime field show at the Jackson High School football field, and that night marched in the Festival parade for the first time; the Ohio State Alumni Band has also made several appearances in the parade lineup. The U.S. Marine Corps Band appeared in the 2007 parade. Another long-standing tradition of the Jackson County Apple Festival is a pageant for the Apple Festival Queen.

Origins Allen was born in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, and lived in the town of Higham Ferrers.\\"Who Was Who\\", A & C Black. He attended only an elementary school before going into the local footwear industry. In 1952 he said he had begun in the boot and shoe industry at the age of 13, working 54¬Ω hours a week, earning half a crown a week.See Hansard, House of Commons, 5th series, vol. 500, col. 1141. In 1914 Allen married Polly Mary Bradshaw; they had a son and a daughter. He served in the Army throughout the First World War, being part of the expeditionary force sent to Salonica in 1915M.

Under the sponsorship of the union he obtained a Trades Union Congress sponsorship to study at Ruskin College, Oxford, where he obtained a diploma in economics and political science.\\"The Times House of Commons, 1950\\", p. 197. He was elected to the Union's Executive in 1933, and was also active in local politics for the Labour Party as chairman of Irthlingborough Urban District Council and a member of Northamptonshire County Council. In 1937 Allen was elected a County Alderman of Northamptonshire. Election to Parliament Allen was adopted in April 1945 as the Labour Party candidate for the Bosworth division,\\"Motherwell Election\\", The Times, 4 April 1945, p. 2. which was held by the Liberal Nationals with a 7,000 majority although the sitting member did not seek re-election. In the ensuing general election, he won the seat with a majority of 5,297 in line with national trends.\\"The Times House of Commons 1945\\", p. 88. Foreign tours He was happier being active behind the scenes in Parliament than he was taking a front rank position, and was a member of several important delegations to foreign countries. In 1946 he visited occupied Germany and made his maiden speech when he reported back to the House of Commons that the British administration was working well but that more coal and food were needed otherwise the German population would grow unwilling to cooperate.\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 30 July 1946, p. 8.

In Russia he was able to have an interview with Joseph Stalin. Economic policy In matters of economics, Allen strongly supported the unity of the Labour Party with the Trade Unions, speaking in 1948 of how it was essential for full employment; he also called for restraint \\"for the nation's sake\\" on the part of some politicians and journalists.\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 3 November 1948; p. 2. However, he spoke at the annual conference of his union in May 1947 in opposition to a motion calling for Conservatives to be expelled in the same way as Communists, arguing that \\"it was just as well to be fair\\" and that Conservatives did not ban other parties from operating as Communists did.\\"Politics In Trade Unions\\", The Times, 7 May 1947, p. 2.

In the new Parliament, Sir Stafford Cripps appointed Allen to be his Parliamentary Private Secretary.\\"Ministers' Secretaries\\", The Times, 1 April 1950, p. 3. In June 1950, Allen helped to defend Cripps against a Conservative motion which called for the United Kingdom to participate in negotiations on the \\"Schuman Plan\\" to organise European coal and steel production. He sponsored an amendment which refused to enter undefined commitments and stressed the importance of the Commonwealth.\\"Government's Amendment For Schuman Plan Debate\\", The Times, 23 June 1950, p. 6. After Cripps' sudden resignation, his successor as Chancellor Hugh Gaitskell kept Allen on as his Parliamentary Private Secretary; Allen had also worked for Gaitskell in Gaitskell's previous position as Minister of State for Economic Affairs. Opposition Whip Allen was again re-elected in the 1951 general election, with a majority of 7,645 in a straight fight with the Conservative Party candidate. He was appointed an Opposition Whip in the new session.\\"Labour Party Whips\\", The Times, 7 November 1951, p. 4.

Relationship with Gaitskell When Hugh Gaitskell was elected as Leader of the Labour Party, he took Allen out of the Opposition Whips' office to serve as his Parliamentary Private Secretary once again. Allen, who was a party loyalist who never broke the Labour Party whip,Philip Norton, \\"Dissension in the House of Commons 1945-1974\\" (Macmillan, 1975) shows no dissenting votes. maintained relationships between Gaitskell and Labour Party backbenchers. A speech by Allen was a rarity, and when speaking from the benefit of experience in February 1958 in favour of a statutory wages policy in order not to let too much money loose in the economy, it was the first speech he had made for six years. Allen believed that stable money was needed in order to get full employment. In 1958 he was a member of a Private Bill Committee on two Bills dealing with private Water companies which sat for the longest time in sixty years.\\"Water Bills Set Up A Record For Evidence And Argument\\", The Times, 6 February 1959, p. 6.

Adam's name occurred for the first time in a Moray document datable between 1255 and 1271, where he was named as the Precentor of Fortrose Cathedral.Innes (ed.), Registrum Episcopatus Moraviensis, p. 282; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 275. He seems to have been introduced into the diocese of Ross, along with others from the north-east of England, by Bishop Robert de Fyvie, who may have been descended from the area.Watt, Dictionary, p. 208. After the death of Bishop Robert, sometime between 17 November 1292 and 18 November 1295, two elections were conducted by the cathedral chapter of Ross: one elected Precentor Adam and the other elected Thomas de Dundee.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 267. Darlington travelled to the papal curia, but on or before 18 November, resigned his right to Dundee. He did however obtain a bishopric, becoming Bishop of Caithness. On 26 April 1296, as Precentor of Ross he was provided to the Caithness diocese, vacant since the death of Alan de St Edmund in 1291, and consecrated by Hugh Aycelin, Cardinal-Bishop of Ostia.Dowden, Bishops, p. 239; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 59. He was not to be bishop long however, perhaps not even long enough to visit his new bishopric.

He was born in King Street, Carmarthen, the son of a solicitor. Educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford, he went on to Lincoln's Inn to qualify as a barrister. His work on the South Wales circuit took him back to his home area, and he stood as a Conservative at the election of 1812. In 1815, he replaced Sir Thomas Picton as MP for Pembroke Boroughs. In 1818 he was again defeated at Carmarthen, but eventually won the seat three years later. Althjough regarded as a Tory in politics, Jones's main pre-occuption was local politics and after his election to Parliament he concentrated much of his energy upon having a controlling interest in the Carmarthen Town Council. In 1831, he was injured in rioting at Carmarthen during the general election. The voting was called off, and the election for the constituency had to be re-run in August, when Jones retained the seat. Later that year he fought a duel with another politician, Robert Fulke Greville. Despite voting in favour of the Reform Bill, he was defeated in the 1832 general election. From 1837 to 1841 he was MP for Carmarthenshire. His efforts to have the salt tax abolished earned him the nickname \\"Jones yr Halen\\" (\\"Jones the Salt\\").

On 6 October 2001, he finished in 6th place in the Ironman of Hawaii, widely regarded as the toughest triathlon competition in the world. Marc had only been training for triathlons since 1998, and he was considered by his trainers to have an enormous potential. He was expected to compete for one of the top three positions the following year. Paralysis Unfortunately, on 28 January 2002, every dream of winning the Ironman was crushed when Marc, during bike training in Lanzarote, fell at a dangerous bend, landed on rocks and broke his back. Marc was immediately brought to a hospital, yet the doctors quickly diagnosed that Marc had suffered total paralysis from his stomach to his feet, and would be forced to live in a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Remarkably, only 3 months after the accident, Marc refused to be discouraged and began training for the Ironman Championship as a wheelchair athlete. In 2002, he was elected by the Belgian press as sports personality of the year. He earned the nickname \\"Mad Max\\" due to his determination and unwillingness to give up. Late 2007, Marc got condemned for 2750 euros and 8 days of delayed prison sentence due to benefit fraud.https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf05112007_014 The appeals court confirmed his guilt but suspended his sentence in 2008.https://m.hbvl.be/cnt/aid780216/marc-herremans-krijgt-in-beroep- opschorting-van-straf/ Wheelchair athlete Marc participated in the Ironman of Hawaii in 2002, only 10 months after his accident. He participated again every following year. In 2006, he finally succeeded in his goal: he was the first wheelchair athlete to arrive at the finish of the Ironman of Hawaii (ironically, he didn't receive any prize money, because wheelchair athletes do not receive prizes). To Walk Again In 2003, he started a foundation called \\"To Walk Again\\" that supports other disabled people, with such efforts as creating a sports centre for disabled people, and investing in bone marrow research. Marc was especially inspired when he met disabled celebrity Christopher Reeve. In October 2007, Herremans became the first person to complete the Crocodile Trophy with a hand bike. The Crocodile Trophy is one of the world's hardest mountain bike races, traversing part of Northern Australia.  Book and movie  Marc Herremans has written a book and helped in the making of a film about his life. The book, the film and Marc's foundation are all titled To Walk Again. The film, directed by Stijn Coninx with a soundtrack provided by Ozark Henry, follows Marc in both his effort to win the Ironman and to help disabled people with their lives, by encouraging them through his To Walk Again Foundation.

Thomas Totney 21 January 1608 - 1659) was an English preacher and religious visionary. Early activities Totney was born at South Hykeham, Lincolnshire, the third, but eldest surviving, son of John Totney and Anne, n√©e Snelle. His father, although a poor farmer and never of the parish elite, was a respectable member of the local community. Nothing is known of Thomas's education, yet it seems likely that by the age of seven he would have learned to read and by the age of nine, if his family could still cope without him, he would have learned to write. =Goldsmithery= In April 1626, Totney was bound as an apprentice in London to a fishmonger but was not taught their trade, instead receiving instruction in his master's adopted profession of goldsmith. On receiving his freedom, he married a daughter of Richard Kett, a prosperous Norfolk landowner, whose great-uncle had been executed as leader of the 1549 East Anglian rebellion. Rather than serving as a journeyman, Totney quickly established himself as a householder ‚Äì a costly progression suggesting he received a charitable loan or financial assistance from family and friends. He set up in St. Katherine Creechurch, a location favoured by small retailers for its inexpensive rents, his shop marked by an unknown sign near Aldgate. To ensure that Totney's business activities fell within their orbit, he was translated to the Goldsmiths Company in January 1634. However, along with the majority of ‚Äòremote‚Äô goldsmiths, he resisted a Company initiative (which had gained royal approval) to vacate his dwelling and relocate in Cheapside, the hub of the goldsmiths‚Äô trade. =Early political and religious involvement= Totney remained in St. Katherine Creechurch for another six years. There he heard the fiery sermons of Stephen Denison on the immutability of God's decrees of predestination. It was a doctrine that troubled Totney until his epiphany. When his first son was born in December 1634, Totney refused to have him baptized and was presented before an ecclesiastical court as a result. Following his wife's death, he remarried by licence during Lent, probably on Friday, 25 March 1636. This was the first day of the New Year in the old calendar and his actions hint at a type of confrontational godliness and perhaps also zealous Sabbatarianism. Upon his father's death in 1638, he went to Little Shelford, Cambridgeshire to manage the family farm. In the summer of 1640, probably while serving as one of the parish's petty constables, he played an important part in resisting the collection of ship money. By his own account he was imprisoned in London and his horse distrained on the county sheriff's authority. A series of payments in 1642 show his support for those opposed to Charles I. Moreover, he claims to have witnessed one of Captain Oliver Cromwell‚Äôs orations delivered at Huntingdon to newly mustered volunteers. Totney later possessed a great saddle, musket, pair of pistols and sword, suggesting he served as a harquebusier. By December 1644, he had returned to Little Shelford where he resumed his duties as a local tax official, as well as taking up sequestered land and providing quarter for Parliamentarian soldiers and their horses. Following the outbreak of a second Civil War, Totney uprooted. He rented out his lands to a local villager and moved with his family to St. Clement Danes, Westminster. In June 1648, his second wife died and was buried in the parish. Revelation and preaching =New identity= After his revelation, Thomas Totney assumed the prophetic name TheaurauJohn Tany. 'TheaurauJohn' he understood to mean ‚ÄòGod his declarer of the morning, the peaceful tidings of good things‚Äô.TheaurauJohn Tany, THEAURAUJOHN TANI His Second Part OF HIS Theous-Ori APOKOLIPIKAL: OR, God‚Äôs Light declared in Mysteries (London, 1653), p. 19 While his former surname may have been vocalized as Tawtney, his new last name was usually pronounced Tawney. Because he had a speech impediment he may have dropped the consonant. In addition, he appropriated the coat of arms azure, three bars argent surmounted by the crest a hind's head erased, gules, ducally gorged, or. This device, borne by Sir John de Tany of Essex during the reign of Edward I, appears on several of his works. Furthermore, he declared himself ‚Äòa Jew of the Tribe of Reuben‚Äô and took the titles High Priest and Recorder to the thirteen Tribes of the Jews.TheaurauJohn Tany, I Proclaime From the Lord of Hosts The returne of the Jewes From their Captivity, and the Building of the TEMPLE in Glory, in their owne LAND (London, 1650), broadsheet Tany justified his claims by inventing a fantastic genealogy that traced his descent from Aaron, brother of Moses, through the tribe of Judah and by way of the ten tribes of Israel, the Tartars and the Welsh. He also circumcised himself. Thereafter, believing he had been given the gift of tongues with which to preach the everlasting gospel of God's light and love to all nations, he went forth armed with sword and word. Crying vengeance in the streets of London, he declared woe and destruction upon the city, prophesying that the ‚ÄòEarth shall burn as an Oven‚Äô and all the proud, the wicked and the ‚Äòungodly shall be as stubble to this flame‚Äô.TheaurauJohn Tany, THEAURAUJOHN His Aurora in Tranlagorum in Salem Gloria (London, 1651), p. 49 Drawing on the potent image of Christ as goldsmith, purging dross and corruption in a furnace, Tany forged his prophetic identity ‚Äì the messenger foretold by Malachi. He claimed his authority rested with the one who sent him, God: > but who may abide the day of his appearing? for he is like fullers sope, a > refiners fire.TheaurauJohn Tany, THEAURAUJOHN His THEOUS ORI APOKOLIPIKAL: > Or, Gods Light declared in Mysteries (London, 1651), p. 53 =Jewish millenarianism= Insisting that the restitution of the Jews was at hand and that he had been sent forth to gather them and proclaim ‚ÄòIsraels return‚Äô, Tany set about enacting a millenarian mission to restore the Jews to their own land. In the manner of the children of Israel before him, he began living in a tent, perhaps modelled upon the tabernacle, which he decorated with a symbol representing the tribe of Judah. He preached in the parks and fields around London and gathered a handful of followers. His message was strong, denouncing the clergy as ‚Äòdiabolical dumb dogs, Tythe-mongers‚Äô, who fleece rather than succour the people.TheaurauJohn Tany, THEAURAUJOHN His THEOUS ORI APOKOLIPIKAL: Or, Gods Light declared in Mysteries (London, 1651), p. 34 Gospel injunctions also made him demand justice: > feed the hungry, clothe the naked, oppress none, set free them bounden, if > this be not, all your Religion is a lye, a vanity, a cheat, deceived and > deceiving.TheaurauJohn Tany, THEAURAUJOHN TANI His Second Part OF HIS > Theous-Ori APOKOLIPIKAL: OR, God‚Äôs Light declared in Mysteries (London, > 1653), p. 90 Tany's first publication was a broadside entitled I Proclaime From the Lord of Hosts The returne of the Jewes From their Captivity (25 April 1650). It is likely that Captain Robert Norwood, a wealthy London merchant, paid for its printing. =Apocalyptic writings and preaching= In early September 1650, Tany was at Bradfield, Berkshire at the same time as William Everard, one-time leader of the Diggers. There was bedlam. It was reported that the rector, John Pordage, fell into a trance while preaching and bellowing like a bull, ran to his house. There he found his wife upstairs, clothed all in white from head to toe, holding a white rod in her hand. Moreover, an adolescent was said to have fallen into a very strange fit, foaming at the mouth for two hours. He dictated verses concerning the destruction of London and demanded to go there to meet a goldsmith. Tany next published two tracts: Whereas TheaurauJohn Taiiiiijour My servant (15 November 1650) and THE NATIONS RIGHT in Magna Charta (28 December 1650). Both demonstrated his earnest desire for social reformation, the latter exhorting the common soldiers to dissolve Parliament and call fresh elections. His next offering, Aurora in Tranlagorum in Salem Gloria, seems to have been written on three consecutive days in late December 1650. It was printed by a Baptist who had previously printed a ‚Äòvery dangerous‚Äô book. The publisher was Thomas Totney's brother-in-law. It was sold by Giles Calvert from his shop at ‚ÄòThe Black-spread-Eagle‚Äô at the west end of St. Paul's Cathedral. In January 1651, Tany wrote the first of the epistles that eventually comprised THEOUS ORI APOKOLIPIKAL (1651) and Second Part OF HIS Theous-Ori APOKOLIPIKAL (1653). Blasphemy charges and trial =Excommunication and imprisonment= On 6 March 1651, Tany was apparently brought before the Westminster Assembly of Divines, responding to their questions with thirty-seven of his own queries. Nonetheless, they accounted him mad. Perhaps shortly thereafter he forsook his trade. On 25 March, Tany preached at Eltham, Kent and then again on 13 April at Norwood's house in St. Mary Aldermary. In May, Norwood was excommunicated from his gathered church. The following month an indictment was prepared jointly against Norwood and Tany. The indicters seem to have understood Tany as some type of Ranter, as one of ungodly conduct who allegorized the Bible and internalized hell; as an antiscripturian universalist who repudiated gospel ordinances and averred that men might live as they wished; as one who glorified sin and maintained that the soul is God. Yet, as Norwood recognized, only two of the charges fell within the scope of the Blasphemy Act of August 1650 ‚Äì the allegations that Tany and Norwood affirmed: > the Soul is of the essence of God > There is neither hell nor damnation.Robert Norwood, A Brief Discourse made > by Capt. Robert Norwood (1652), pp. 3‚Äì4; Robert Norwood, The Case and Trial > of Capt. Robert Norwood, now prisoner in New-gate (no date = 1651?), pp. > 9‚Äì10 As their own accounts of the trial's proceedings make clear, the defendants adamantly maintained that their words had been misrepresented, altered and taken out of context. Even so, on 13 August 1651, they were convicted jointly of blasphemy by a jury of twelve men at the London sessions of the peace held in the Old Bailey. They were each sentenced to six months imprisonment in Newgate gaol without bail or mainprize. Conditions for those that could not afford the services of the gaoler were apparently intolerable. =Appeals= On 27 October 1651, legal proceedings were initiated in the Court of Upper Bench appealing the verdict. After several sessions the case was deferred until the next law term. More hearings followed. On 4 February 1652, Tany appeared before the Court. A London tailor named John Reeve claimed that the same morning God revealed to him that he had been chosen as the Lord's ‚Äòlast messenger‚Äô. Reeve and his cousin Lodowick Muggleton, a freeman of the Merchant Taylors‚Äô Company, announced themselves to be ‚Äòthe two Witnesses of the Spirit‚Äô foretold in the Revelation of Saint John.John Reeve, A Transcendent Spiritual Treatise (no date = 1652?), p. 5; Lodowick Muggleton, The Acts of the Witnesses of the Spirit (1699), p. 40 In addition, they denounced Tany as a ‚Äòcounterfeit high Priest‚Äô and pretended prophet, marking him as a Ranter, the spawn of Cain.John Reeve and Lodowick Muggleton, A Divine Looking-Glass (1661 edn), pp. 167-68 A few days later, the judges of the Upper Bench made their judgement: Lord Chief Justice Rolle washed his hands of the business. On 16 February 1652, Tany and Norwood, having served their sentence, were each released on ¬£100 bail pending good behaviour for one year. Thomas Totney's former master and another man later described as a goldsmith, provided sureties. In Easter term Norwood initiated a new legal appeal. After several hearings the judges deferred proceedings until the following law term. On 28 June 1652, they reversed the guilty judgement against Norwood and Tany, resolving that their opinions had been made to rigidly conform to the strictures of the Blasphemy Act. For, whereas the Act made it unlawful to maintain that ‚Äòthere is neither Heaven nor Hell, neither Salvation nor Damnation‚Äô, the defendants who affirmed that: > there is ‚Äòno Hell nor Damnation‚Äô, are not within the Statute, for tho by > Implication if there be no Hell there is no Heaven, yet the court is not to > Expand these words by Implication but according to the Letters of the > Stat[ute].Gray‚Äôs Inn, London, MS 33 fol. 142 =Resumption of activities and second name change= Within a month of his release, Tany published a pamphlet he had written in Newgate entitled High Priest to the IEVVES, HIS Disputive challenge to the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge and the whole Hirach. of Roms Clargical Priests (March 1652). Echoing Paul's epistle to the Romans, Tany proclaimed the return of ‚ÄòIsraels Seed‚Äô from captivity.TheaurauJohn Tany, THEAVRAUIOHN High Priest to the IEVVES, HIS Disputive challenge to the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and the whole Hirach. of Roms Clargical Priests ([London], 1652), p. 8 About 1 January 1653, it appears from his own account that Tany underwent another purificatory ritual. He refrained from speaking for thirty-four days, isolating himself for twenty-one of them. On the fourteenth day he transcribed an edict to ‚Äòall the Jewes the whole earth over‚Äô, which was to be engraved in brass and sent to the synagogue in Amsterdam. He signed this proclamation with his new name and titles, Theauroam Tannijahhh, King of the seven Nations, and Captain General under my Master Jehovah, and High-Priest and Leader of the Peoples unto HIERUSALEM.TheaurauJohn Tany, HIGH NEWS FOR HIERUSALEM ([London], no date = 1653?), pp. 10‚Äì12; cf.

It exasperated one reader, who complained ‚Äòtruly I skill not the man, nor his spirit; in his writing he offends against all rules of Grammar, Geography, Genealogy, History, Chronology, Theology & c, so far as I understand them‚Äô.Sheffield University Library, Hartlib Papers, 34/4/11A‚Äì12B In March 1654 a list of some thirty ‚ÄòGrand Blasphemers and Blasphemies‚Äô was submitted to the Committee for Religion, which included: > XIX.

He saluted them as descendants of the Jewish race, an elect remnant who spoke a pure language and trembled at the word of God.TheaurauJohn Tany, THARAM TANIAH, Leader of the LORDS Hosts, Unto his Brethren the QUAKERS scornfully so called ([London], 1654), broadsheet On 8 May 1654, he issued an edict to all ‚Äòearthen men and women‚Äô announcing that he would shortly proclaim the Law and Gospel from his tent standing in the bounds of the Middle Park at Eltham, Kent.TheaurauJohn Tany, Hear, O Earth, ye earthen men and women ([London], 1654), broadsheet On 8 June 1654, he read out a speech in which he laid claim to the crowns of France, Reme, Rome, Naples, Sissiliah and Jerusalem, as well as reaffirming an earlier claim to the crown of England. He did this by repeating Pontius Pilate‚Äôs reply to the chief priests of the Jews after Pilate had written ‚ÄòJESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS‚Äô as the title to be put on Christ's cross: > What I have written, I have written.TheaurauJohn Tany, ThauRam Tanjah his > Speech in his Claim, verbatim ([London], 1654), broadsheet =Assault on Parliament= On the morning of Saturday, 30 December 1654, in the week that Cromwell was offered the crown, Tany solemnly made a large fire at Lambeth into which he cast his great saddle, sword, musket, pistols, books and bible. He crossed the River Thames in a rowing boat and made his way to Parliament, ascending the stairs into the lobby outside the door. Unable to deliver a petition he departed, returning after about an hour oddly attired with a long, rusty sword by his side. Pacing up and down the lobby he suddenly threw of his cloak and began slashing wildly, but was disarmed before anyone was hurt. He was brought to the bar of the House and questioned by the Speaker. He refused to remove his hat, was evidently mistaken for a Quaker and committed to the Gatehouse prison. Having been examined by the Committee for regulating printing, he wrote to the Speaker requesting liberty to have an audience with Cromwell. He then attached a great lock and long chain to his leg as a symbol of ‚Äòthe people of Englands Captivity‚Äô.The Faithful Scout no number, 5‚Äì12 January 1655 p. 1668 Legal proceedings were transferred to the Court of Upper Bench, but on 10 February 1655 he was bailed upon habeas corpus. Two days later a fire broke out in Fleet Street. In the following months, London was engulfed by several more unexplained fires which were interpreted as a sign of the impending destruction of the world. Eventually an arsonist was apprehended who may have been in the pay of William Finch, one of Tany's disciples. =Final years= In September 1655, after weeks of heavy rain and widespread floods, Tany ‚Äòin one of his old whimsies‚Äô pitched his tent in the large tract of open ground between Lambeth Marsh and Southwark known as St. George's Fields.Certain Passages of Every dayes Intelligence No. 4, 21‚Äì28 September 1655 p. 26 A satirical newsbook writer thought him ‚Äòa madman‚Äô, fitter ‚Äòfor Bedlam then a Tent‚Äô.Mercurius Fumigosus No. 70, 19 September ‚Äì 3 October 1655 pp. 550‚Äì51 Sometime after 16 June 1656, Tany set sail. He crossed the English Channel successfully and at an unknown date arrived in the United Provinces, perhaps to gather the Jews of Amsterdam. Some three years later, now calling himself Ram Johoram, he was reported lost, drowned after taking passage in a ship from Brielle bound for London.Occurrences From Foreign Parts No. 50, 20‚Äì27 December 1659 p. 552 He was survived by his eldest daughter and probably also a second daughter and second son. Evaluation Tany's writings embrace currents of magic and mysticism, alchemy and astrology, numerology and angelology, Neoplatonism and gnosticism, hermeticism and Christian Cabbala. His sources were varied, although they seem to have included almanacs, popular prophecies, and legal treatises, as well as The Testament of the Twelve Patriarches, the Sonnes of Jacob (1647), Jacob Boehme's A Description of the Three Principles of the Divine Essence (English translation, 1648) and Mercurius Teutonicus (1649), Theologica Germanica, or, Mysticall Divinitie (1648), Paracelsus of the Nature of Things (1650), Henry Cornelius Agrippa's Three Books of Occult Philosophy (1650), and Menasseh ben Israel's The Hope of Israel (1650). Tany had a few loyal followers but he failed to found a sect.

The Corps was created on 4 October 1941 by special request of the STAVKA supreme command, in an area of the city of Mtsensk (the Oryol Oblast). Initially its structure included the 6th Guards Rifle Division, 5th Airborne Corps, 4th Tank Brigade, 11th Tank Brigade, the Tula military school, several Border Guard Regiments, two artillery regiments, two rocket artillery battalions and the 6th reserve aviation group. Major General Dmitri Lelyushenko was appointed the commander of the corps. The corps was given several tasks: to destroy the nearby enemy, to break through into Oryol, to slow the progress of the German tank armies, and to block the way to Tula. The Soviet government and STAVKA command highly valued the efforts and sacrifices of the 1st Guards Rifle Corps in the Oryol-Bryansk defensive operation, which took place from 4 to 18 October 1941. On 11 November the National Commissioner of Defense renamed the 4th Tank Brigade, which played a vital role in the battle of Mtsensk, the 1st Guards tank brigade. The Commander of the brigade, Colonel Mikhail Katukov, was eventually promoted to commander of the Soviet 1st Guards Tank Army, and was twice awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union award. On 12 October 1941, by the order of STAVKA supreme command, the corps was transformed into the 26th Army. On 25 October 1941, its field HQ was disbanded, and its constituent formations were transferred to the 50th Army of the Bryansk Front. 2nd Formation A new 1st Guards Rifle Corps was formed on 31 December 1941. Its first commander, Col. Afanasy Gryaznov, was appointed the same day; he would be promoted to Major General ten days later. As of 1 February it was under the direct command of Northwestern Front, with the following units in its order of battle: * 7th Guards Rifle Division * 14th, 15th, 52nd Rifle Brigades * 72nd Naval Rifle Brigade * 203rd, 204th and 205th Ski BrigadesCombat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942, p. 26 * 878th Corps Artillery Regiment (re-designated 37th Guards Artillery Regiment later that month, with 4 batteries of 4 122mm guns each.) The Corps saw action around the Demyansk Pocket for most of 1942, with a number of rifle brigades under command, but also with 7th Guards Rifle and 37th Guards Artillery under command as well. In October the Corps headquarters went into the Reserve of the Supreme High Command, where it was assigned to the 1st Reserve Army, which later became the 2nd Guards Army. For the duration of the war it served as an administrative command, with no assigned support units.Charles C.

The organisation specialises in transparency and accountability issues, with a focus on access to justice and access to information. The organisation mainly works in the South Asia, East Africa, and Ghana region. Across the 52 countries of the Commonwealth, it periodically monitors the progress and rollbacks of civil and political rights with the help of research, workshops, and cooperation with other civil society networks. In 2017, the NGO consists of over 50 employees and interns, working in New Delhi, London, and Accra.  Creation and History  The CHRI was founded in 1987 by six existing Commonwealth NGOs: the Commonwealth Lawyers Association, Commonwealth Legal Education Association, Commonwealth Journalists Association, Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, Commonwealth Press Union and the Commonwealth Broadcasting Association. CHRI was founded on the consensus that, while Commonwealth countries had a common set of values and a forum from which to work, there was little focus on human rights issues. The shift in headquarters from London to New Delhi was a conscious decision, guided by the need to be based in the developing ‚ÄòSouth‚Äô. CHRI has since grown and is now a family of offices in Delhi, London and Accra. The office in Accra, Ghana coordinates work in Africa and a small office in London acts as a liaison office. Each office is registered as a separate legal entity under the laws of the country in which it is located. The organisation is officially accredited to the Commonwealth, has observer status with the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights and also has consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. The CHRI is also a member of the Commonwealth Family network of NGOs and often collaborates with the United Nations Human Rights Council.  Principles and Objectives  CHRI is mainly involved in the fight against the following human rights violations: *Torture in police custody *Enforced disappearances *Arbitrary arrest and detention *Corruption *Death in custody *Extrajudicial killings *Unethical Prison conditions *Modern slavery *Denial of the right to information The organisation also advocates for the following: *Right to information *Prison Reform *Police Reform *Protection of Human Rights Defenders and Promoters *Democracy *Freedom of the press *Civil and political rights *Government transparency and accountability  Areas of work  CHRI consists mainly of three programmes: the Access to Information Programme, the Access to Justice Programme (police reform and prison reform) and the Strategic Initiatives Programme (SIP) = Access to Information (ATI) = The Access to Information Programme works to protect the right to information (RTI) in Commonwealth countries. The team conducts workshops and training sessions for government servants and members of civil society organisations in order to develop their skills and build their capacities. The programme also hosts public education campaigns in order to raise awareness on the importance of the right to information. Internationally, the ATI team works with local partners to lobby for RTI legislation in Commonwealth countries which do not have them. The team also provides technical assistance to countries drafting Freedom of Information (FoI) Bills. In India, The ATI programme is well known for having actively participated in the passage and implementation of the new right to information Bill. = Access to Justice (ATJ) = CHRI's programme Access to Justice Programme works towards developing accountability and transparency in Commonwealth judicial systems. The programme is divided into two branches: police reform and prison reform. In the police reform programme, CHRI aims to increase demand for a rights-based police reform and to strengthen police accountability. The team does this with research, policy analysis, accountability monitoring, public education campaigns, and with civil society networking. The programme has a focus on creating long-term structural changes to policing and accountability systems, this in order to improve accountability, transparency, and performance. The organisation works to ensure that policing laws conform to internationally recognised human rights standards and to the best international practices. In India, nearly 67% of prisoners are still in undertrial. These prisoners are often forgotten, locked in overcrowded prisons for years. To solve this kind of issue, the prison reform programme seeks to increase jail transparency and to facilitate access to legal aid for prisoners. The team also aims to reform prison management, monitors Commonwealth jail conditions and encourages a better cooperation between the different judicial system branches. = Strategic Initiatives Programme (SIP) = The Strategic Initiatives Programme (SIP) operates through several strategic interventions that together have a positive impact on human rights in the Commonwealth. SIP engages with official Commonwealth institutions with the aim of holding the Commonwealth accountable to its human rights commitments. SIP also works on the United Nations Human Rights Council and the role that the Commonwealth plays in this premier global human rights body. SIP attempts to strengthen National Human Rights Institutions in the Commonwealth and encourages partnerships between these institutions and human rights groups.  Governance  CHRI has an International Advisory Commission made up of eminent people from across the Commonwealth. This Commission sets the policy directions for the organisation as a whole. Each office is governed by a separate Executive Committee. For cohesion, the Chairs of the Executive Committees also sit on the International Advisory Commission. = Members = Members of the International Advisory Commission: * Yashpal Ghai * Alison Duxbury * Wajahat Hab Bullah * Neville Linton * Vivek Maru * Edward Mortimer * Sam Okudzeto * Sanjoy Hazarika Members of the Executive Committee in India: * Wajahat Habibullah * B.K.

It was an episode in the continuing Balkan Crisis as vassal states struggled for independence from the Ottoman Empire but achieved a mosaic of nascent nation states (Balkanisation) and featured unstable alliances that frequently led to war, and eventually to the First World War.  Background  Turkey's rejection of the terms of the Constantinople Conference (1876-1877) led to the Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì1878. This concluded with the Treaty of San Stefano and the subsequent Treaty of Berlin in 1878 which established an independent Bulgarian principality. The original treaty signed by Russia and Turkey at San Stefano created a greater pro-Russian Bulgaria out of the defeated Ottoman lands. This appeared to contravene earlier secret Russian undertakings both in Reichstadt on July 8, 1876 and later in Budapest between Count Andrassy and the Russian Envoy, Eugene Novikov, (Budapest Convention, 15 January, 18 March 1877). These treaties agreed that in the eventuality of war and a Russian victory that they would not create any large Slavic states. Russia had also traded Austrian neutrality for Bosnia-Herzegovina.

ISA Annual Convention, New Orleans, March 24-27, 2002 Pribram, Alfred, ed. (1921) The Secret Treaties of Austria- Hungary. Vol. 2. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. This enlargement of the Russian sphere of influence angered the other Balkan states and alarmed the other great powers who initially threatened war with Russia and then convened the Berlin conference at the behest of Austria's foreign minister Gyula Andrassy to dismantle and rework the provisions of San Stefano. The treaty which also established international recognition of the neighbouring former Ottoman vassal states of Romania, Serbia and Montenegro broke up this 'Greater Bulgaria' into a northern principality of Bulgaria and two southern territories under Ottoman control, Macedonia and autonomous Eastern Rumelia. Bosnia and Herzegovina were transferred to Austria-Hungary. Unfortunately the Treaty solved little. It satisfied Britain and Austria- Hungary, but only at the expense of Russia and the peoples of the Balkan states, making further crises inevitable. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: Congress of Berlin Consequently, the future of the Balkan lands was now perceived as a matter for the disposal of the European Great Powers. These events significantly impacted the dynastic relations between Germany and Russia. Consequently, to counterbalance Russian influence and perceived panslavic expansion in the Balkans, Germany and Austria-Hungary concluded a Dual Alliance (Zweibund) in 1879.  Bulgarian unification and Serbo-Bulgarian War  Bulgaria following treaties of San Stefano and Berlin, 1878 Bulgaria and Rumelia 1882 Bulgaria 1888, post unification In September 18, 1885, a rebellion and coup in the Ottoman province of Eastern Rumelia, aided by the Bulgarians, saw the people proclaim a union with the new (1878) state of Bulgaria, in violation of the Berlin Treaty of 1878. The union caused consternation amongst the Great European Powers since it altered the power balance in the repeatedly unstable Balkans, and risked Ottoman retaliation and Russian intervention on behalf of Bulgaria. However tension between Alexander III, the Tsar of Russia and the German born Knyaz (Prince) Alexander I of Bulgaria led to the Russians standing aside, withdrawing their troops from Bulgaria and advocating a conference in Constantinople. While the other great powers in general supported Russia's unexpected position, Greece and Serbia did not. Serbia had signed a secret treaty with Austria-Hungary in 1881, and feeling sure that Austria would support them made territorial demands on its western border with Bulgaria, and on being rebuffed declared war on November 14. However, by November 28 Serbia had been defeated by Bulgaria. Further humiliation of Serbia was only prevented by Austrian intervention. Subsequently, there was a Russophile coup against Alexander I in 1886 who was replaced by the Austriophile (he was the Austrian Emperor's nephew and an officer in the Austrian army) Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (1887‚Äì1918). The relations between the young Bulgarian state and Russ deteriorated.  Effects on the Great Powers  The events in the Balkans were in a way proxy events for their supporters, Russia and Austria-Hungary, effectively dissolving (1887) the fragile alliance between Germany, Austria and Russia known as the League of Three Emperors (Dreikaiserabkommen) 1873‚Äì1878, which had been revived on June 18, 1881. The league provided for mutual aid in the event of an attack on a member and benign neutrality in the event of one of them being involved in conflict outside the League. The terms also provided for consultation on any proposed Balkan operations. This offered Germany Russian neutrality in the event of a further war with France, and Russia the neutrality of Germany and Austria in the event of war with Britain or Turkey. The protocol was secret, and was renewed in 1884. It stated, inter alia:Text of the Protocol of the league of Three Emperors 1881 > ‚Äû4. Die drei M√§chte werden sich der etwaigen Vereinigung Bulgariens und > Ostrumeliens in den Gebietsgrenzen, die durch den Berliner Vertrag > angewiesen sind, nicht widersetzen, wenn diese Frage sich durch die Macht > der Dinge erheben sollte.‚Äú > (4. The three powers will not oppose the eventual unification of Bulgaria > and Eastern Rumelia within the limits set by the Treaty of Berlin, should > this eventuality occur by force of circumstances) When this eventually occurred, the situation was more complicated. Prince Alexander of Battenberg had been elected in 1879 as Prince of Bulgaria at the request of the Russian Tsar, his uncle, Alexander II. Prince Alexander found himself obliged to support the nationalist movement for re-unification despite the advice of the Russian ministers and advisers, but with the apparent support of the British Prime Minister, Gladstone, an opponent of Russia's position. Russia then withdrew its ministers and advisers from Bulgaria. Another complication was the role of King Milan of Serbia, an ally of Austria, another opponent of Russia in the Balkans. The King sought territorial compensation from Bulgaria. When he did not receive it, he declared war in 1885. Defeated, Serbia saw Bulgarian troops reach Belgrade before Austria intervened. The subsequent Treaty of Bucharest in March 1886 essentially restored the status quo.Lothar Gall, Bismarck. Der wei√üe Revolution√§r, Frankfurt 1980, , p. 619 ff. The Great Powers and the Porte finally accepted the Unification of Bulgaria through the Tophane Agreement in 1886. Russia, however, was not satisfied and the Russian Tsar, Alexander III, refused to recognise Prince Alexander as ruler of the new enlarged Bulgaria. Subsequently, a Russian backed coup, involving a group pro-Russian officers, forced Prince Alexander to abdicate on 9 August 1886. He was then exiled to Russia. When, in a counter-coup, Prince Alexander I returned to the Bulgarian throne, Russia broke off diplomatic relations with Bulgaria. The Great Powers which were in a constant fear of war between them continued with a series of complicated agreements and alliances, many of which were secret, as deterrents to each other's actions, largely at the behest of Bismarck. These included the Triple Alliance which replaced the Dual Alliance in 1882 by including Italy, two Mediterranean Agreements (Mittelmeerentente) in 1887 and the Reinsurance Treaty (1887). Finally publication of the terms of the 1879 treaty persuaded Russia that further action was not in its interests and withdrew from involvement in Bulgaria, and the fear of war dissipated. Bismarck's strategy though arcane was largely successful in averting war during his time in office (1871‚Äì1890). Unfortunately these arrangements which were heavily dependent on Bismarck, failed to provide long term solutions.

Mario Fireballs 2\\\\. Luigi Knights 3\\\\. Peach Monarchs 4\\\\. Daisy Flowers 5\\\\. Yoshi Eggs 6\\\\. Birdo Bows 7\\\\. Wario Muscles 8\\\\. Waluigi Spitballs 9\\\\. DK Wilds 10\\\\. Diddy Monkeys 11\\\\. Bowser Monsters 12\\\\. Bowser Jr. Rookies =Challenge Mode= The player starts as Mario and must recruit all the characters. This is also where to unlock all characters and stadiums. The plot of this mode is that Bowser Jr. is taking over the ball parks. After defeating Bowser Jr., Bowser appears and the player must defeat him in his Castle. The player can choose between five different captains: Mario and the unlockable captains Yoshi (Yoshi Park), Donkey Kong (DK Jungle), Wario (Wario City), and Princess Peach (Peach Ice Garden). The player may switch captains at any time during gameplay. =Minigames= Some minigames can only be played in day or night time. There are nine minigames in total. However, several of the minigames are unlockable. Some minigames only play with the Wii Remote with Nunchuk and the Wii Remote sideways. Minigames List 1\\\\. Bob-Omb Derby 2\\\\. Wall Ball 3\\\\. Barrel Basher 4\\\\. Gem Catch 5\\\\. Piranha Panic 6\\\\. Ghost K 7\\\\. Blooper Baserun 8\\\\. Graffiti Runner 9\\\\. Bowser Pinball =Toy Field= Players try to hit baseballs to point spaces all around the field. The other players try to catch the ball. If a player catches a ball, it is his turn to bat. At the end of the game, king medals are awarded for various achievements. The computer adds up the score and the player with the most points will win. Toy Field can be played with the Wii Remote with Nunchuk, or with the Wii Remote sideways. =Practice= Players learn to bat, pitch, fielding, special moves and base running so they can be better. =Records= Shows MVPs of exhibition games, star players in challenge mode and high scores of the minigames. There are also videos, and when the game is completed, the records will show the Intro movie. Gameplay A pre-release screenshot of Yoshi up at bat against Bowser Jr.. The gameplay of Mario Super Sluggers is similar to that of its predecessor; the main difference being the controls, with the Wii Remote adding immersion using a control scheme similar to the baseball sub-game in Wii Sports. There are three control methods available: Wii Remote by itself, Wii Remote and Nunchuk, and the Wii Remote held sideways. Reception Mario Super Sluggers received mixed to positive reviews. The lack of online play was a generally major factor in the reviews. GameRankings gave it a score of 69.72%, while Metacritic gave it 69 out of 100. The game was nominated for the 2009 Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards for Favorite Video Game, in which it lost to Guitar Hero World Tour. Promotion As part of the North American marketing launch, Nintendo created a series of collectible online cards along with a website that served as a virtual collector's album. The site promises that the series will include a card for each of the 41 characters featured in Mario Super Sluggers. The cards began appearing in banner ads on popular children websites on August 18, 2008, but have since begun to appear as embedded hyperlinks in other, less obvious locations. Mario Super Sluggers Cards have been found on other sites, such as YouTube. When the Seattle Mariners played the New York Yankees on September 5, 2008, the game was promoted there at Safeco Field. The first 20,000 fans received special Mario Super Sluggers foam mitts. There were also two booths with the game demo, and Mario Super Sluggers Cards were also passed out there. Every inning, someone was randomly chosen to win a Wii system along with the game. Whenever a home run or a good play happened, the Safeco Field video screen showed a gameplay clip with Mario, Luigi, or Bowser. A Mario mascot also appeared before the game with the Mariners' mascot, the Moose, but left after the first inning. Nintendo of America's offices are based in the Seattle area, and was the majority owner of the Mariners at the time of the game's release (hence the promotion).

The J-Hierarchy figures prominently in fine structure theory, a field pioneered by Ronald Jensen, for whom the Jensen hierarchy is named. Definition As in the definition of L, let Def(X) be the collection of sets definable with parameters over X: : Def(X) := \\\\\\\\{ \\\\\\\\{y \\\\in X \\\\mid \\\\Phi(y,z_1,...,z_n) \\\\text{ is true in } (X,\\\\in)\\\\\\\\} \\\\mid \\\\Phi \\\\text{ is a first order formula}, z_1, ..., z_n\\\\in X\\\\\\\\} The constructible hierarchy, L is defined by transfinite recursion. In particular, at successor ordinals, L_{\\\\alpha+1} = Def(L_\\\\alpha). The difficulty with this construction is that each of the levels is not closed under the formation of unordered pairs; for a given x, y \\\\in L_{\\\\alpha+1} \\\\setminus L_\\\\alpha, the set \\\\\\\\{x,y\\\\\\\\} will not be an element of L_{\\\\alpha+1}, since it is not a subset of L_\\\\alpha. However, L_\\\\alpha does have the desirable property of being closed under ‚àë0 separation. Jensen's modified hierarchy retains this property and the slightly weaker condition that J_{\\\\alpha+1} \\\\cap \\\\textrm{P}(J_{\\\\alpha}) = \\\\textrm{Def}(J_{\\\\alpha}), but is also closed under pairing. The key technique is to encode hereditarily definable sets over J_\\\\alpha by codes; then J_{\\\\alpha+1} will contain all sets whose codes are in J_\\\\alpha. Like L_\\\\alpha, J_\\\\alpha is defined recursively. For each ordinal \\\\alpha, we define W^{\\\\alpha}_n to be a universal \\\\Sigma_n predicate for J_\\\\alpha. We encode hereditarily definable sets as X_{\\\\alpha}(n+1, e) = \\\\\\\\{X_\\\\alpha(n, f) \\\\mid W^{\\\\alpha}_{n+1}(e, f)\\\\\\\\}, with X_{\\\\alpha}(0, e) = e. Then set J_{\\\\alpha,n} := \\\\\\\\{X_\\\\alpha(n, e) \\\\mid e \\\\in J_\\\\alpha\\\\\\\\} and finally, J_{\\\\alpha+1} := \\\\bigcup_{n \\\\in \\\\omega} J_{\\\\alpha, n}. Properties Each sublevel JŒ±, n is transitive and contains all ordinals less than or equal to Œ±œâ + n. The sequence of sublevels is strictly increasing in n, since a Œ£m predicate is also Œ£n for any n > m. The levels JŒ± will thus be transitive and strictly increasing as well, and are also closed under pairing, \\\\Delta_0-comprehension and transitive closure. Moreover, they have the property that : J_{\\\\alpha+1} \\\\cap \\\\text{Pow}(J_\\\\alpha) = \\\\text{Def}(J_\\\\alpha), as desired. The levels and sublevels are themselves Œ£1 uniformly definable (i.e. the definition of JŒ±, n in JŒ≤ does not depend on Œ≤), and have a uniform Œ£1 well-ordering. Finally, the levels of the Jensen hierarchy satisfy a condensation lemma much like the levels of G√∂del's original hierarchy. Rudimentary functions A rudimentary function is a function that can be obtained from the following operations: *F(x1, x2, ...) = xi is rudimentary *F(x1, x2, ...) = {xi, xj} is rudimentary *F(x1, x2, ...) = xi ‚àí xj is rudimentary *Any composition of rudimentary functions is rudimentary *‚à™z‚ààyG(z, x1, x2, ...) is rudimentary For any set M let rud(M) be the smallest set containing M‚à™{M} closed under the rudimentary operations. Then the Jensen hierarchy satisfies JŒ±+1 = rud(JŒ±).

His folklore collecting preserved many stories of Cornish witchcraft and cunning folk that would otherwise have been lost. Paynter was born in Callington and later lived at Liskeard. He travelled all over Cornwall on what he called his ‚ÄòWitch Hunt‚Äô and was popularly called ‚ÄòThe Cornish Witch-finder‚Äô for the novelty of his research. He was made a bard of the Cornish Gorseth in 1930 in recognition of his work, and took the bardic name ‚ÄòWhyler Pystry‚Äô, or ‚ÄòSearcher Out of Witchcraft.‚Äô Paynter was a prolific Cornish writer and published a large number of articles on his findings, which are a vital record of the survival of witch beliefs and practices into the early decades of the twentieth century. He also wrote a book on witchcraft in Cornwall, which Paynter was unable to find a publisher for in his lifetime. As well as witches, Paynter also researched the wider folk beliefs and practices of the Cornish and produced articles on ghosts, charms, mermaids, the folklore of birds and wildlife. As Paynter wrote before the Second World War, after which so many of the old beliefs in the supernatural collapsed, Paynter's writings may be said to comprise the last significant collection of Cornish folklore. Paynter also researched the antiquities and history of East Cornwall, upon which he wrote, and his historical writings are of similar interest. Due to his work Paynter was familiar figure on Westcountry television and radio. Paynter was also a founder member of the Callington Old Cornwall Society, in 1928, and did much to stimulate interest in Cornwall's past in that part of the Duchy. In 1959 Paynter set up The Cornish Museum at East Looe, where he exhibited the collection of Cornish artefacts he spent his life collecting. He included displays on charms, early lighting devices, a section on early transport, another on John Wesley, relics of Cornish mining, a china clay exhibit, a section of an old Cornish kitchen, and many others illustrating how people lived in past generations. Presumed lost in the years since William Henry Paynter's death 40 years ago, Paynter's manuscript work on Cornish Witchcraft and folk magic was recovered in 2009 and became available for study for the first time. The manuscript was published in book form in 2016.

Weaver House is a historic house at 102 Weaver Road (United States Route 63) in Bloomfield, Iowa. Built in 1865, it was the home of James Weaver (1833-1912) until 1890. Weaver, a populist and anti-monopolist, was the Greenback candidate for president in 1880 and the Populist candidate in 1892. The house was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1975.. It is now operated as a bed and breakfast inn. Description and history The Weaver House is located north of downtown Bloomfield, on the east side of Weaver Road just north of its junction with North Street. It is a two-story L-shaped brick structure, with a gabled roof, five corbelled chimneys, and a single-story ell to the rear. A two-story porch is set in the crook of the L. The most prominent feature of the exterior is the windows of its principal elevations, which are set in arched openings framed by dentillated brick hoods. The house was built in 1865 for James B. Weaver, an Ohio native who settled in newly formed Bloomfield in 1847. Politically active, he helped organize Iowa's Republican Party, and served in the Union Army in the American Civil War. A champion of the rural farm electorate, he ran for President of the United States on the Greenback Party ticket in 1880, and the populist People's Party in 1892, having helped form the party out of a group of reform-oriented organizations the previous year. Weaver lived in this house until 1890, when he moved to Des Moines. After passing through several private owners, it was acquired by the Davis County Chautauqua Association, which operated it for a time as a historic house museum. It was eventually returned to private ownership, and is now operated as a bed and breakfast inn.

In 1864, when Washington, D.C. appeared under threat after Lt Gen. Jubal Early‚Äôs Confederate army crossed the Potomac River, Bibb was commandeered and armed by the Union Navy. Construction Bibb was laid down for the Coast Survey at the Charlestown Navy Yard on February 24, 1853, by a private contractor; launched on May 12, 1853; and got underway on August 11 for her first cruise. The engines for this vessel came from the , built for the Revenue Cutter Service at Pittsburgh in 1845, and transferred to the Coast Survey in 1847, following blockade duty during the war with Mexico. (Many sources, including the Coast Guard Historian's office, consider these the same vessel.) Bibb spent her career before the Southern rebellion in the Atlantic, on apparently unremarkable duty. Civil War Service  =First assignment to the South Atlantic Blockade= At the outbreak of the Civil War in April 1861, Bibb was transferred to the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service, but returned to the Coast Survey in November. Assigned to the Coast Survey contingent attached to the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, Bibb steamed to Port Royal, South Carolina, and reported to the head of the former organization, Assistant Charles O. Boutelle, USCS, in January 1862, relieving and freeing that vessel to proceed north for repairs. Bibb served the Union cause in many ways: surveying and buoying harbors and channels along the Atlantic coast of the Confederacy between South Carolina and Florida; escorting transports; towing and piloting gunboats; carrying dispatches; and performing any other duties that were of assistance to the Union Army and Navy. Her labors won her the most generous praise of the leaders of both services. =Repairs and emergency duty= Bibb spent the first half of 1864 in the Washington Navy Yard undergoing repairs. As this work was being completed, Confederate Lieutenant General Jubal A. Early crossed the Potomac River on a raid with a sizable force that endangered Washington, D.C. Seeking to help parry this threat to the Union capital, Commander Foxhall A. Parker took command of Bibb from the Coast Survey, armed her and ordered her to the Gunpowder River, where Southern troops had been seen. Commanded by Acting Ensign George E. McConnell, Bibb then ascended the Gunpowder but could not move closer than a point some five miles below Gunpowder Bridge; Bibb never exchanged fire with Confederate troops. After the crisis had passed, Parker returned Bibb to the Coast Survey, and she operated out of the Washington Navy Yard through the end of 1864. =Second assignment to the South Atlantic Blockade= Early in 1865, Bibb rejoined the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, and worked along the Southern coast through the end of the war. A copy of a post-civil war Charleston Harbor chart (NOAA Archives) notes that on 16 March 1865, the Bibb struck a mine off of Fort Moultrie (Charleston), SC, which caused minor damage. Post-war service Following the collapse of the Confederacy, Bibb resumed peacetime service with the Coast Survey and was retired and decommissioned in 1879.

Rocker was born in Stepney, East London in 1907 and named after the Spanish anarchist and mayor of C√°diz Ferm√≠n Salvochea. During his youth, he got to know many prominent anarchists such as Errico Malatesta and Peter Kropotkin and often attended anarchist meetings with his father, a prominent activist, whom he fondly recalls in his 1998 memoir. Later he would also meet Augustin Souchy, Emma Goldman, Alexander Berkman, Erich M√ºhsam, Nestor Makhno, and Buenaventura Durruti. During this period he learned to draw, guided by his half-brother Rudolph, and exhibited a natural aptitude.Whitehead, Andrew: Fermin Rocker: Painter from a family of London anarchists.

When World War I broke out, both his parents were interned as enemy aliens, along with many naturalised Germans and Russians, his father in 1914, his mother in 1916. In 1918, they were released and moved to the Netherlands, then rapidly to Berlin where his artistic practice developed. Fermin Rocker trained as a lithographer. His early works consisted of sketches, watercolours, and graphic work. He also started mixing in the artist milieu of Berlin. In 1929, Rocker followed his father on a lecture tour in the United States. Contrary to his original plans, he remained in New York. After the Machtergreifung in 1933, his parents joined him there to live in a rural commune in New York State.He worked as draftsman, a cartoon animator, a commercial artist, and as a book illustrator. Among his employers was the Survey Graphic. In 1944, he had his first one-man exhibition in New York. His works would also be exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum, and the Chicago Art Institute. The Library of Congress bought some works of his. In 1946, he received a prize from the Philadelphia Print Club for his graphic works. In 1952, he married Ruth Robins, a dentist from California who he had met in New York. In the same year, his mother died; three years later his father followed.Fermin Rocker. AskArt: The Artists' Bluebook. Retrieved October 26, 2007. In 1956, he visited the United Kingdom for the first time since 1929. His wife liked the continent so much that she returned to settle in England in 1970, Fermin following her in 1972, to escape the crime and expensive rents in New York, and because Rocker thought New York had become ugly. He and Ruth lived in Tufnell Park for the rest of their long lives. Rocker illustrated books for the Oxford University Press and did paintings on the side. Mick Jagger bought a painting for ¬£4,000 from him depicting Basque refugees fleeing Franco's allies towards the French border. Aside from his animation work, Rocker worked in the realist tradition, mostly landscape paintings with warm colors up to this point. His images were rarely overtly political and after his move to New York he had mostly concentrated on oil paintings of intimate everyday scenes. Once back in London, his style evolved. He started painting still lifes and even political paintings such as the one he sold to Jagger. His colour palette became darker and more melancholy. Rocker's relationship to Anarchism was ambiguous. He was deterred by the endless feuds and factionalism within Anarchism and acknowledged that capitalism had raised the standard of living. After Rocker turned 65, he quit illustrating and concentrated on painting instead. He had 13 solo exhibitions in the last twenty years of his life, mostly at Stephen Bartley Gallery, in Chelsea, London. In 1989, Ruth Rocker died and the same year he published an account of his childhood in London.The East End Years: A Stepney Childhood Freedom Press.

It was published in 1933. Conroy wrote it initially as nonfiction, but editors insisted he fictionalize the story for better audience reception. The novel explores the 1920s and 30s worker experience through the eyes of Larry Donovan. Plot Monkey Nest Camp The Disinherited is heard through the voice of Larry Donovan, a young boy, growing up in the Monkey Nest coal mine camp. It is a difficult life, and after Larry's brother Dan starts working in the mines, Larry's father prods Larry to do well in school so he too won‚Äôt have to go into the mines. Larry makes many observations about the differences between miner families and other families, especially farmer Ben Haskins and his daughter Bonny Fern. Larry throws a dirt clod at Bonny Fern's head one day and the next tries to give her a flower. She calls him ‚Äúcamp trash‚Äù and Ben chases Larry away. Larry also distinguishes differences between the miners themselves. His father and his father's friend, ‚ÄúFrenchy‚Äù are both educated. So is Lionel Stafford, but Larry's father doesn‚Äôt get along with Mr. Stafford. Lionel flaunts his education whereas Larry's father does not. One day the mine owner, Edward Stacpoole, comes to the mine with his wife and son. The son pushes Larry's sister, Madge, into a mud puddle and taunts her. Dan is hurt in a mining accident and dies three days later. Frenchy also dies in a separate mining accident. The camp miner's go on strike, and Larry's father meets unsuccessfully with Mr. Stacpoole to negotiate. One night during a storm a strikebreaker knocks on the Donovan's door seeking shelter. Tom punches him in the mouth and sends him away. Tom tells his children never to become scabs. Eventually, the miners go back to work. Aunt Jessie comes to take Larry to the house of a dead man; she asks Larry if Rollie Weems ever talks about her. Larry says that he does but plays innocent. At the dead man's house, Aunt Jessie forces Larry to touch the man's face. Afterwards, Larry suffers nightmares about the dead man. Larry's father takes a more dangerous job within the mine in order to make more money to pay for Larry's schooling. However, there is an accident while Mike Riordan and Tom are in the mine. Larry's father dies, and without an income Mother begins to take in others‚Äô laundry. One of Mother's customers is the butcher's wife, Mrs. Koch, who is very particular about her laundry. Larry stains a load of her clothing and Mother takes the blame. Rollie Weems leaves town after rumors start that he got Mattie Perkins pregnant. Mike Riordan, who had disappeared following Tom's funeral, reappears and periodically leaves groceries on the Donovan's porch. When the mine goes on strike again, the superintendent approaches Mother about cooking for the strikebreakers; Mother refuses on principle. Rollie Weems returns to say he has gotten work at a railroad; since Larry is of working age now, Rollie recommends that Larry get a job at the railroad also. Bull Market Larry starts going to night school and also gets a job at the railroad, where he becomes friends with Ed Warren. Ed introduces Larry to Wilma and Larry has his first experience with sex, which he reacts to with disgust. American involvement with World War I begins. Rollie Weems enlists and marries Aunt Jessie before going on tour. A baby is born to the newlyweds while he is France. A man speaks in the town square denouncing war and capitalism. Lionel Stafford joins in and the crowd attacks the two men, beating them very badly. Afterwards the Stafford's leave town defeated. During this time Madge dies. Ed enlists after making several attempts to join the army. Larry stays away from the war he calls ‚Äúcruel.‚Äù Ed sends Bonny Fern letters, and she approaches Larry to ask about Ed. When the soldiers return from war, the railroad goes on strike. Ed returns and moves to Detroit with the Haskins. Rollie emerges as a leader in the strike. During a conversation between him and Larry, he propounds the advantages of staying single. Larry listens and seems to remember Rollie's advice throughout the narrative. One evening, Rollie starts a fight with a strikebreaker and is shot. He tells Larry to pretend the fight hadn‚Äôt happened. Rollie crashes his car into a streetlight and dies. After Rollie's death, Larry gets a job at a steel mill which begins a series, throughout the novel, of Larry getting and losing jobs. At the steel mill, Larry meets several people, including an old man the workers call ‚ÄúBun‚Äù Grady. Grady is homeless and unable to get many jobs because of his age. Larry rooms at the home of Nat Moore. Nat's wife Lena is sickly and often places Larry in uncomfortable situations. Larry finds a job at the rubber plant and meets Hans, a German worker, and Jasper, a prankster of sorts. Larry dates Helen, the lunch girl. Larry receives many letters from Ed in Detroit encouraging him to move to Detroit. Ed finally accepts the offer, along with Jasper and Nat, after Lena dies. Nat has also been remarried to Emma, his former cleaning lady, though he plans to send for her after he gets a job. Larry rooms with the Haskins and gets a job at the auto factory. Bonny Fern now takes college classes and Larry takes note of how the classes and the city have affected her. She influences him in the proletarian movement. Getting word that Helen is in Detroit, Larry follows her to a whorehouse that is disguised as a lunch counter. He requests Helen who has become a prostitute. She shares her feelings about him, and mildly drunk, Larry reacts oddly. There is a scene and Larry is thrown out. Nat has sent for his family and has bought a plot of land to build a house on. However he doesn‚Äôt yet have enough money to build. In the meantime, he begins making homebrew which upsets Emma. Bonny Fern also expresses disgust when Larry drinks. The Hard Winter The Stock Market crashes and men from the auto factory are laid off. Ed and Larry bounce from job to job. The Haskins decide to go back to the farm, though the decision distresses Bonny Fern. After being gone for some time, Bonny Fern sends Larry a letter detailing his mother's poor living conditions. Larry and Ed buy a car and head to Monkey Nest Camp. The car is a clunker, and the boys must get jobs to pay for repairs. When they reach the camp, they find Mother, Aunt Jessie, and the kids nearly starved and living in Liam Ryan's old barroom. Larry is shocked at the physical degeneration of his once pretty Aunt Jessie and his mother. After fixing a leaky roof and buying the family groceries, Ed and Larry look for work. While lying pipeline they meet a half-wit who they deduce to be Willy Stafford. It seems his once uppity older brother, Paul Stafford, has been buried alive working in the pipeline ditch. Bonny Fern is friendly with Larry but he recalls again the advice of Rollie and keeps his distance. In conversation, Mother tells Larry to be a fighter like his father was. Nat and his family show up, as does Hans. Ben Haskin's farm is repossessed and is set to be sold piece by piece in an auction. Well-meaning farmers come to the auction and refuse to bid. Hans and a sheriff get involved. Eventually one farmer sells the farm and goods back to Ben Haskins for 99 cents. Larry decides to go West with Hans. Mother and Bonny Fern wave good-bye as the Moore family, Hans, Ed, and Larry drive off.

I agree with that. Novel or not, just so it tells the truth. I describe myself as a witness to the times, not as a novelist. And that‚Äôs what I prefer to be known as.‚Äù - Jack ConroyJack Conroy, Cited in Wixson, Douglas. ‚ÄúIntroduction to the 1991 Edition.‚Äù The Disinherited. Jack Conroy. Columbia: University of Missouri Press, 1991. The Disinherited, Jack Conroy's first novel, was released in November 1933, after being rejected by twelve publishers. Once it was accepted by Covici-Friede in April 1933, it was only accepted subject to revision. Once Conroy made the suggested revisions, the book was released to mixed reviews Wixson, Douglas. ‚ÄúIntroduction to the 1991 Edition.‚Äù The Disinherited. Jack Conroy. Columbia: University of Missouri Press, 1991. 9-10 . Part of the reason for this reception was that many critics weren‚Äôt sure exactly how to judge Conroy's first novel. Critics tended to review The Disinherited using conventional literary standards. But Conroy's novel does not solely align itself with the tradition of literary realism; it is also what Conroy himself calls ‚Äúfictional documentation‚Äù Wixson, Douglas. ‚ÄúIntroduction to the 1991 Edition.‚Äù The Disinherited. Jack Conroy. Columbia: University of Missouri Press, 1991. 9-12 One of the major criticisms of The Disinherited is its broken threads of narrative Wixson, Douglas. ‚ÄúIntroduction to the 1991 Edition.‚Äù The Disinherited. Jack Conroy. Columbia: University of Missouri Press, 1991. 12 . The varying elements of the story never come together to support one unifying purpose. The novel is more a string of events, some of greater importance than others, but all present nonetheless ‚ÄúExamining the life of a worker-writer.‚Äù wsws.org. 9 November 1995. International Committee of the Fourth International. 24 September 2007. http://www.wsws.org/arts/1995/nov1995/conroy.shtml . However, these broken threads lend themselves to the realism of the novel. Characters come in and out of the story in much the same way that people came into and out of Conroy's life as a migratory worker, moving from job to job Wixson, Douglas. ‚ÄúIntroduction to the 1991 Edition.‚Äù The Disinherited. Jack Conroy. Columbia: University of Missouri Press, 1991. 12 Another criticism of The Disinherited was to write this novel off as propaganda. The novel suggests that freedom must be achieved through responsible collective action, not through individual virtue alone. In most naturalistic fiction, one must leave their tragic life behind, to remain within that life to work for change sounds like propaganda (Wixson 22). But Conroy did remain within that life, and because he remained in that position as worker-writer, he held true to his point of view that acted as the subject of his writing, and this contributed to energize his literary work.Wixson, Douglas. ‚ÄúIntroduction to the 1991 Edition.‚Äù The Disinherited. Jack Conroy. Columbia: University of Missouri Press, 1991. 23 Despite these criticisms, many feel that The Disinherited is a notable achievement because it was one of the first works of proletarian fiction to be written from a working class, firsthand experience. This is an arguable position, however, due to the fact that there is no singular definition of proletarian literature. Some believe it is simply literature written about the working class; some believe it is instead written for the working class, or by someone from the working class. Whatever the definition, most of the so-called proletarian fiction in the 1930s was written by middle class authors who had lost faith in capitalism and were interested in dramatizing the ‚Äúcoming struggle for power‚Äù Aaron, Daniel. ‚ÄúIntroduction.‚Äù The Disinherited. Jack Conroy. New York: Hill and Wang, 1963. viii However, once the Great Depression began to weigh heavily on the American landscape‚Äîunemployment, evictions, strikes, etc.‚Äîwriting about these conditions hit home, and became legitimate subjects for literary works.

This decision made it difficult for state governments as well as the federal to enact laws regulating working conditions, such as limiting the number of hours in a work week or requiring a minimum wage. Teddy Roosevelt takes office; the Russian empire is soundly defeated by the Japanese in a bid to enlarge Russian territory. The novel opens in Monkey Nest Camp, a coal mining community, most likely set in northern Missouri, where Conroy lived as a boy. Larry Donovan, Conroy‚Äôs alter ego, is nine years old. April 1917 The United States enters World War I on the side of Britain and France after discovering that Germany is trying to persuade Mexico to enter the war as Germany's ally. Larry now works at the railroad yard. His friend and co- work, Ed Warden, introduces Larry to the pleasures of womanly flesh by setting him up with Wilma, an experienced fifteen-year-old girl. Larry is not quite eighteen years old since he is too young to enlist. Early 1918 A devastating influenza pandemic sweeps the United States and the rest of the world. It appears to have originated in Kansas and causes 50 million deaths worldwide. Larry‚Äôs sister Madge dies of the disease. Nov. 1918 Armistice is declared; World War I is over, with Germany the loser. Over forty million casualties, about half of those fatalities, are suffered between both sides. Ed, who serves in Europe, returns a changed man after seeing horrific things. He begins to show interest in Bonny Fern, the girl for whom Larry has unresolved feelings. 1918 German Revolution takes place after Germany's defeat in World War I. This results in the dissolution of the monarchy, the formation of the Weimar Republic, leading eventually to Hitler‚Äôs rise to power. Larry befriends Hans, who participated in the revolution, while working in the steel mill. Hans‚Äôs viewpoints influence Larry‚Äôs own. 1920 Prohibition begins in the U. S. and lasts until 1933. Ed writes Larry, inviting him to come to Detroit, where jobs are plentiful at the automobile factories. 1921 Herbert Hoover is made Secretary of Commerce under President Warren G. Harding. He serves until 1928, when he is elected President. Hoover declares at one point that poverty will be eliminated in the U. S. Larry changes from job to job, factory to factory, in search of the elusive American Dream. October 1929 The stock market crash occurs despite Hoover‚Äôs promises of prosperity. Larry returns home to Monkey Nest Camp to help his mother as well as Bonny Fern‚Äôs father through the ‚ÄúHard Winter.‚Äù Larry decides that he must follow Hans to fight for the proletariat.

Harper, 494 U.S. 210 (1990), was a United States Supreme Court case in which an incarcerated inmate sued the state of Washington over the issue of involuntary medication, specifically antipsychotic medication..  Background  Respondent Harper, an inmate in the Washington prison system since 1976, was believed to be violent when not on antipsychotic medication. Twice he was transferred to the Special Offender Center (SOC), a state institution detaining prisoners who were diagnosed in psychiatric problems. While there, Harper was forced to take psychiatric medication against his will. The SOC followed its policies of institutional review for making a treatment decision to forcibly medicate an inmate. Upon hospitalizing Harper a second time at the Center, Harper filed suit in state court under 42 U.S.C. 1983, alleging that the Center failed to provide a judicial hearing before involuntarily medicating him, thus violating the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The trial court rejected his claim but the State Supreme Court reversed the decision and remanded the case back to the trial court stating that the State could administer antipsychotic medication to a competent, nonconsenting inmate only if, in a judicial hearing, at which the inmate had full adversarial procedural protections, the State could prove by \\"clear, cogent, and [494 U.S. 210, 211] convincing\\" evidence that the forced medication was necessary and effective for furthering an important state interest, weighing the individual's interest against that of the state. The United States Supreme Court granted a Writ of Certiorari. The American Psychological Association submitted an amicus brief in support of the inmate's right to a due process hearing, stating forced medication of an incarcerated inmate violated the due process, equal protection, and free speech clauses of the Constitution of the United States.  Opinion of the Court  The Court reversed, finding the use of an internal institutional review was adequate in making treatment decisions in this case under the lesser standard of review embodied in Turner v. Safley, . The United States Supreme court ruled that the Due Process Clause permits a state to treat an incarcerated inmate having a serious mental disorder with antipsychotic medication against his will, under the condition that he is dangerous to himself or others and the medication prescribed is in his best medical interest.

It was one of the WiiWare launch games in Japan, Europe, and Australia, and was released on March 25, 2008 (Japan) and May 20, 2008 (Europe/Australia). It was released in North America on May 26, 2008. Gameplay As with other Dr. Mario games, players must manipulate pills to destroy colored viruses in the game area. Dr. Mario Online Rx features versions of the Nintendo DS title Brain Age 2's mini-games called Virus Buster and Germ Buster, which uses the pointer function of the Wii Remote to move pills, and allows up to four players to participate cooperatively. The title supports the now defunct Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service, which allowed players to compete with one another over the Internet. Players can use Mii characters or Dr. Mario during gameplay. Features A majority of features from previous installments, such as the virus and speed levels, are present in Dr. Mario Online Rx. Players played online against another with only one copy, as an online-play demo could be sent akin to DS Download Play. Vs. Mode could also be played offline, if desired. Unlike Dr. Mario 64, Online Rx lacks the ability to play with four players, instead only allowing up to 2 players in Vs. Mode. Several features in this game previously appeared in Dr. Mario 64, including the four musical tracks: \\"Fever\\", \\"Chill\\", \\"Cube\\", and \\"Que Que\\" (the latter two tracks are now named \\"Cough\\" and \\"Sneeze\\"). The music can be randomly selected or turned off. Flash Mode, which challenges the player(s) to clear just three flashing viruses among many, also returns from Dr. Mario 64. Virus Buster, previously seen as a mini-game in Brain Age 2 has more customization than the original. Whereas the original only had Easy, Normal, and Hard as options, this version allows to adjust virus level and music as well. Remixed versions of \\"Fever\\" and \\"Chill\\" are present in this mode. Virus Buster can be played alone or with others, with up to four players. Instead of being controlled directly with the D-pad, they are guided with the Wii Remote pointer.IGN: Dr. Mario & Virus Buster Preview In single player mode, a player can select to start the game at level 20. After winning level 20, levels 21, 22, and 23 increment by four viruses. Level 24 and beyond contain 99 viruses. After 99 levels, gameplay can continue but the game does not progress past level 99 and the player is presented with only the \\"Try Again\\" and \\"Quit\\" menu options. Reception IGN gave Dr. Mario Online Rx an 8.5/10, calling the main game \\"timeless\\" and the new Virus Buster mode \\"chaotically awesome\\". However they were let down by the fact that the main Dr. Mario mode only supported up to 2 players (where some earlier games had supported up to 4) and that Virus Buster was not playable online. Additionally, N-Europe awarded Dr. Mario an 8/10, calling it \\"the same Dr. Mario that we know and love\\" with \\"solid and functional graphics\\" and addictive gameplay. In contrast, GamesRadar gave it 6/10, calling it a \\"slightly awkward puzzler\\" that \\"just isn't addictive enough to make you care\\" and likened it to \\"Puyo Puyo's in- bred cousin\\". However, they praised the online multiplayer functionality and enjoyed its clean presentation, with the exception of the music.GamesRadar - Dr. Mario Review NGamer also criticised the gameplay, and gave it 2/5.

It resulted in a victory under the command of Myeongnim Dap-bu during the 26th year of the reign of King Sindae, the 8th ruler of Goguryeo.  The coup d'etat of 165  In 165, the news of the death of Goguryeo's 7th king spread throughout the land. The man responsible for the death of the king was Myeongnim Dap-bu, a Joui seonin and court official. Myeongnim Dap-Bu invited the dead ruler's youngest and only surviving brother, Prince Go Baek-gu, to the kingdom's capital to become the next ruler of Goguryeo. The Prince became Goguryeo's 8th King Sindae, during that year. This coup was the first successful military revolt in Goguryeo's history. Myeongnim Dap-Bu was given the position of Guksang (Íµ≠ÏÉÅ, ÂúãÁõ∏, Prime Minister), and became the first Prime Minister of Goguryeo. Myeongnim Dap-Bu was never recorded to have abused his position, but strengthened the nation's strength economically, politically, and militarily. Meanwhile, the Han Empire assembled a large army and prepared to invade Goguryeo in the year 172.  The Battle of Jwa-Won  In 169 AD, Xuantu governor Geng Lin invaded Goguryeo, killing hundreds. Goguryeo submitted to the rule of Liaodong Commandery.„ÄäÂæåÊº¢Êõ∏/Âç∑85„Äã: \\"Âª∫ÂØß‰∫åÂπ¥ ÁéÑËèüÂ§™ÂÆàËÄøËá®Ë®é‰πã Êñ¨È¶ñÊï∏ÁôæÁ¥ö ‰ºØÂõ∫ÈôçÊúç ‰πûÂ±¨ÁéÑËèü‰∫ë\\"„Ää‰∏âÂõΩÂøó/Âç∑30„Äã: \\"ÈùàÂ∏ùÂª∫ÂØß‰∫åÂπ¥ ÁéÑËèüÂ§™ÂÆàËÄøËá®Ë®é‰πã Êñ¨È¶ñËôúÊï∏ÁôæÁ¥ö ‰ºØÂõ∫Èôç Â±¨ÈÅºÊù±.\\"„Ää‰∏âÂõΩÂè≤ËÆ∞„Äã: \\"ÂõõÂπ¥ Ê±âÁéÑËèüÈÉ°Â§™ÂÆàËÄø‰∏¥Êù•‰æµ ÊùÄÊàëÂÜõÊï∞Áôæ‰∫∫ ÁéãËá™Èôç‰πûÂ±ûÁéÑËèü\\" According to Samguk Sagi, in 172 AD, Geng Lin led another military campaign against Goguryeo. In preparation for the invasion, Myeongnim Dap-Bu filled in the local wells, and made sure that the surrounding land could yield no food supply to the enemy forces. In addition, a moat was made, and many lines of defense were made outside of Goguryeo's capital, Guknae Fortress, at a place called Jwa-Won. The Goguryeo forces retreated into the fortress, and protected it upon the arrival of the enemy troops. After days of siege, the Han army was exhausted, and began to retreat. Myeongnim Dap-bu took advantage of the enemy's retreat and ambushed the Han army as they were beginning to retreat. The 172 campaign, the battle of Jwa-Won, was not recorded in the Book of the Later Han or the Records of the Three Kingdoms, while the 169 campaign was documented. The battle of Jwa-Won only appears in Samguk Sagi.

Memo 1983-667 (U.S. Tax Court Memos 1983). the U.S. Tax Court held that the payments Conway Twitty, a country singer, made to investors in a defunct restaurant business known as \\"Twitty Burger, Inc.\\" were deductible under ¬ß 162 of the Internal Revenue Code. as ordinary and necessary business expenses of petitioner's business as a country music performer. Facts The petitioner, Harold L. Jenkins, was a well-known country music singer who was commonly known by his stage name of \\"Conway Twitty\\". Conway had been a musical performer since the 1950s, but it was not until the late 1960s that Conway became well-established in the country music industry.Jenkins v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo 1983-667 (U.S. Tax Court Memos 1983) at 4. By mid-1970, Conway Twitty had 43 Number 1 hit records. In 1968, Twitty Burger, Inc. was formed by Conway, along with approximately 75 friends and business associates who invested money in Twitty Burger for the operation of Twitty Burger Fast Food Restaurants.Jenkins v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo 1983-667 (U.S. Tax Court Memos 1983) at 6. Late in 1970, Twitty Burger began to encounter financial difficulties and nearly every Twitty Burger restaurant was closed by 1971.Jenkins v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo 1983-667 (U.S. Tax Court Memos 1983) at 9. Although he had no assets with which to pay the debentures, Conway decided to repay the investors the amount of their investments with future earnings. On his 1973 and 1974 Federal income tax returns, Conway deducted these total amounts, $92,892.46 and $3,600, respectively, as ordinary and necessary business expenses under ¬ß 162.Jenkins v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo 1983-667 (U.S. Tax Court Memos 1983) at 11. Issue Were the payments made by Conway Twitty to investors in the failed corporation known as Twitty Burger, Inc., deductible as ordinary and necessary business expenses of Conway's business as a country music performer? Holding The Court held that the payments to the investor by Conway Twitty were deductible as ordinary and necessary business expenses of his business as a country music performer. Lohrke v. Commissioner, 48 T.C. 679 (1967), a landmark Tax Court case, established a two-part test to determine whether a payment is deductible as ordinary and necessary. The court applied the Lohrke test to the instant case as follows. To determine whether the payments were deductible under ¬ß 162, the United States Tax Court was required to #ascertain the purpose or motive of the taxpayer in making the payments and #determine whether there was a sufficient connection between the expenditures and the taxpayer's trade or business. After a lengthy explanation of how vital personal reputation is to a member of the country music industry, the Court found that Conway's motive in repaying the investors was to protect his personal business reputation.Jenkins v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo 1983-667 (U.S. Tax Court Memos 1983) at 23. Direct quotes from Conway himself, and from a number of country music historians, were presented in this case to explain how the success of country musicians is extremely dependent on their images.Jenkins v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo 1983-667 (U.S. Tax Court Memos 1983) at 28 After determining Conway's motive, the Court went on to find a proximate relationship between payments made to the investors and Conway's trade or business as a country music entertainer.Jenkins v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo 1983-667 (U.S. Tax Court Memos 1983) at 30‚Äì31. Having determined the motive and the connection between the expenditures and the trade or business, Conway's payments to the Twitty Burger investors were held to be ordinary and necessary business expenses of a country music performer. Real World Interest Aside from providing an analysis to use in determining whether certain payments constitute ordinary and necessary business expenses under ¬ß 162, this case provides a fascinating, if brief, history of the country music industry and the unique relationship between country musicians and country music fans. But, the case is probably best known for the rare exchange of public humor it elicited between two government entities. The Tax Court closed its opinion with the following footnote: > \\"Ode to Conway Twitty\\" Twitty Burger went belly up But Conway remained true > He repaid his investors, one and all It was the moral thing to do. His fans > would not have liked it It could have hurt his fame Had any investors sued > him Like Merle Haggard or Sonny James. When it was time to file taxes Conway > thought what he would do Was deduct those payments as a business expense > Under section one-sixty-two. In order to allow these deductions Goes the > argument of the Commissioner The payments must be ordinary and necessary To > a business of the petitioner. Had Conway not repaid the investors His career > would have been under cloud, Under the unique facts of this case Held: The > deductions are allowed. In Action on Decision 1984-022, the Internal Revenue Service announced whether it would appeal the decision as follows: > Our reaction to the Court's opinion is reflected in the following \\"Ode to > Conway Twitty: A Reprise\\": Harold Jenkins and Conway Twitty They are both > the same But one was born The other achieved fame. The man is talented And > has many a friend They opened a restaurant His name he did lend. They are > two different things Making burgers and song The business went sour It > didn't take long.

On the 19 August 1996 the aircraft crashed in a corn field, 1,500 meters (4,921 feet) northeast of Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport's runway in Yugoslavia. Aircraft The aircraft was a 12-year-old Ilyushin Il-76T with tail number RA-76513. Flight chronology Flight 3601 departed from Ekaterinenburg on August 18, 1996. The Il-76T landed at Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport for refueling and a routine check. Flight 3601 tried to take off around 23:00, but when the engines were started, all electrical systems failed. The electrical malfunction was repaired and the plane took off at 00:10 on August 19, 1996 heading for Malta. Although the malfunction had been repaired, the crew had improperly configured their electrical systems, resulting in those systems being fed solely off the aircraft's batteries. About 15 minutes after takeoff, as Flight 3601 reached Valjevo, Yugoslavia, the batteries began to drain completely. Pilot Vladimir Starikov contacted Belgrade air traffic control and said the plane was again having electrical system problems; that was the last contact air traffic control had with Flight 3601. The crew made several attempts to conduct an emergency landing at Belgrade, unsuccessful due to night and difficult weather conditions. During one of these attempts the aircraft crashed, killing all 8 crew and 3 passengers. Flight 3601 appeared over Belgrade about one hour after take off. Many Belgrade residents saw the plane fly over the city and observed that there were no lights active on the aircraft. The weather over Belgrade was very bad that night with heavy clouds. Since there were no electricity aboard the aircraft, the only way to find the runway was by sight. At about 01:30, Flight 3601 circled central Belgrade at a very low altitude; witnesses said that the plane was seen flying very low over New Belgrade. At 03:14, the flight crew tried to land, first making a 180-degree turn and then aiming for Runway 12 on a course of 121 degrees. The aircraft plummeted into a corn field as it attempted an emergency landing at Surcin International Airport, exploding and killing the Russian crew of 11. According to The New York Times, the aircraft was illegally carrying weapons for Libya.

Along with the Grand Staircase and the Canyons of the Escalante, it makes up a significant portion of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. Its extension to the southeast, Fiftymile Mountain, runs nearly to the Colorado River and Lake Powell, and is a prominent part of the northern skyline from the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. Geography The Straight Cliffs, looking northwest from the eastern end of Fiftymile Mountain. Roughly triangular in shape, the Kaiparowits Plateau extends for over 50 miles (80 km) from near the town of Escalante in Garfield County, to the south and southwest through Kane County and nearly to the border with Arizona. At its southeastern end the plateau rises from Lake Powell nearly 4000 feet (1200 m) to an elevation of 7584 feet (2311 m). The northeastern edge of the plateau is defined by the Straight Cliffs, below which are the broad sandstone flats of the Escalante River. The western edge of the plateau is at the Paria River, Cottonwood Canyon, and the Cockscomb. The southern end of the plateau is deeply dissected by tributaries of the Colorado River, including Rock, Last Chance, Warm, Wahweap, and Coyote Creeks. These canyons are now major side channels of Lake Powell. An extension of the plateau's high terrain is known as Smoky Mountain, location of one of the few roads on the plateau. The northwestern end of the plateau is less well defined, essentially merging with the Aquarius Plateau. Canaan Peak, just south of Highway 12 and the town of Escalante, rises to 9233 feet (2814 m). Overall, the plateau covers an area of approximately 1650 square miles (4225 km¬≤),Geology and Coal Resources of the Kaiparowits Plateau much of it covered by pinyon-juniper woodland. The Kaiparowits Plateau (green area in center), as seen from space (NASA) This topography is well illustrated in a synthetic aerial image (here, 450 kB), which looks northwest from a point near Navajo Mountain. The Kaiparowits Plateau is the darker area to the left, while the Escalante River Basin is the lighter area to the right. The Colorado River (as Lake Powell) runs across the bottom of the image, and at the upper right is the Aquarius Plateau and Boulder Mountain. Geology During the later part of the Cretaceous geologic period, the area that is now the Kaiparowits Plateau was located near the western shore of the Western Interior Seaway. The interior of the plateau was an area of peat swamps, while what is now the Straight Cliffs were at the shoreline. Further to the west was an area known as the Sevier Highlands. Erosion from the Highlands deposited approximately 1500 feet (500 m) of what is now known as the Straight Cliffs Formation, a layer of sandstone that makes up the base of the plateau. Remnants of the peat are now seen as beds of coal within this layer. Later deposits during the Cretaceous period formed higher sandstone layers, known as the Wahweap and Kaiparowits Formations. Further deposition during later epochs formed layers that are now seen at the surface of the plateau, including the limestone layers of the Wasatch Formation. Fossils The sandstone layers of the Kaiparowits Plateau have become a unique source of fossilized remains of the Late Cretaceous Period, vital to understanding the evolution of dinosaur and early mammalian species.Page (Arizona) Paleontology Science Center These layers represent not only an unbroken sequence of the period between 70 and 82 million years ago, but have also preserved fine details of the bones, teeth, egg shells, and even the tracks of the animals that lived then. The skull of a ceratopsid, a horned dinosaur, was unearthed from the Wahweap Formation in 1998.Fossil Discoveries in the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument (PDF) A species of Struthiomimus, a toothless (yet carnivorous) dinosaur, was identified in the Kaiparowits Formation. As recently as 2007, the characterization of an unusual species of Gryposaurus, a duck-billed dinosaur, was announced.Newspaper account of the discovery of Gryposaurus monumentensis Fossils of the giant crocodilian Deinosuchus have also been found. Fossilized skeleton of a young hadrosaur displayed at the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument Coal mining Early settlers of the region mined certain parts of the plateau for coal in the 1870s and 1880s. The Spencer mine opened in 1913, reportedly to fuel gold mining activities along the Paria River. In 1965, the Southern California Edison Company proposed the construction of a 3000 megawatt coal- fired generation plant within the Kaiparowits Plateau. This plant was intended to be fed by large coal deposits in the plateau, which may have yielded up to 4 billion tons of fuel. The electricity produced would have gone to the growing populations near Los Angeles, San Diego, and Phoenix. Initially hailed as an economic boon to this isolated area of southern Utah, the proposal met with growing opposition from federal regulatory agencies and from environmental groups, who had only recently experienced the scenic canyons of the Colorado River and its tributaries being inundated by Lake Powell, behind the Glen Canyon Dam. After ten years of dispute and facing rising construction costs, the proposal was abandoned in 1975.

The Autzen Foundation supplied the single largest donation, $250,000, to support the construction of the football stadium at the University of Oregon in Eugene that bears his name. Construction began in 1966, eight years after his death, and was completed in 1967. Autzen's heirs, led by his son Thomas E. Autzen, operated the foundation after his death, per the terms of his will. Although his name is popularly associated with Autzen Stadium in Eugene, Autzen was an alumnus of today's Oregon State University in Corvallis. His foundation's donation to the University of Oregon was as a parent; his eldest son Thomas E. graduated from UO in 1943. Through their Portland Manufacturing Company, Autzen and his family helped revolutionize wood-laminate milling methods still in use today. These discoveries, which were engineered and utilized at the Autzen plants, had an enormous impact on modern building methods and helped radically change plywood production throughout the industry. Early years Born to Danish immigrants in the bayside town of Hoquiam, Washington, Autzen grew up around logging. His father Peter (1854‚Äì1918) spent his early adult life working successfully as a logger through much of the late 1800s. In 1902, Peter purchased an established Northwest wood products mill, originally known as Doernbecher and Holbrook. Once the Autzen family took over management, they renamed the mill \\"Portland Manufacturing Company.\\" Under Peter's leadership, management at the St. Johns-based mill began pioneering some of the nation's earliest known, mass-produced, plywood panels. A self-engineered glue spreader, which allowed \\"plys\\" of wood to easily bond during mass-production, helped drive production levels to a new high. Thomas J. Autzen and the mill's superintendent, Oscar Mason, are credited with developing the device and marketing it into the company's greatest asset. Autzen graduated from Oregon State University in 1909 with a degree in electrical engineering. Known as Oregon Agricultural College during this period, Autzen became active in campus life and joined several clubs, including the Amicitia Literary Society, the Orange staff, the Associated Students, and the college branch of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. Family business Autzen took over management of the family business following the untimely death of his father in 1918. Perhaps, his greatest contributions were in the area of sales and business administration. He played a leading role in resurrecting a company subsidiary from a devastating fire, which completely destroyed the plant's milling operations. As president, he is also credited with growing the family's milling businesses into one of the Northwest's largest suppliers of plywood and helping develop widely used modern plywood bonding technologies. During the midst of America's Great Depression, sales had plummeted at Portland Manufacturing Company and, as with most businesses during this period, profits were slow to recover. Autzen opted to negotiate a profit- sharing deal with M and M Woodworking Company, which allowed him to retire his day-to-day management responsibilities. Over the next 20 years the family maintained an interest in M and M Woodworking Company, but this organization saw many changes in leadership and growth. M and M Woodworking Company became somewhat of a conglomeration, made up of multiple Northwest-area wood products companies. The family's interest in the organization was sold to Simpson Timber Company in 1956. Death On September 8, 1958, after a fishing trip to Astoria earlier in the day, Autzen felt ill after dinner and was taken to Good Samaritan Hospital in Portland, where he died at age 70. He was buried at River View Cemetery in Portland. See also * Thomas J. Autzen House References External links *Oregon Encyclopedia: Thomas J.

Hambrick then departed for KABC-TV in Los Angeles in September 1975, and Ted Henry joined Patterson as co-anchor. After two years as news director and 5:00 and 11:00 P.M. co-anchor on KABC-TV, Hambrick moved on to anchor for three years at KRON-TV in San Francisco. In January 1980 he joined WNBC-TV in New York City as first a reporter and weekend anchor,http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/Archive-BC- IDX/80-OCR/1980-01-21-BC-OCR-Page-0093.pdf then weeknight co-anchor alongside Chuck Scarborough for the next five years.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/Archive-BC- IDX/80-OCR/1980-09-29-BC-OCR-Page-0085.pdf In spring 1985, WNBC-TV chose not to renew Hambrick's contract. He then was recruited by WTVJ in Miami to replace Ralph Renick, the station's original news anchor who retired in April of that year. Hambrick joined WTVJ in July 1985 and spent the next four years as 6:00 and 11:00 P.M. co-anchor. Hambrick then moved to crosstown rival WCIX (now WFOR-TV) at the start of 1990, remaining there until September 1993. His final television job was a brief stint at KBMT in Beaumont, Texas, around 1999. =The Florida Highwaymen (2002)= In 2002, Hambrick and his son Jack co-produced an hour-long PBS-TV documentary film about the Florida Highwaymen, a group of pioneering African-American Florida artists. The film, titled The Highwaymen: Florida‚Äôs Outsider Artist, included interviews with a portion of the artists, their mentor, late renowned Florida landscape painter A.E. Backus, and more than 100 original Highwaymen paintings. The film was produced by their production company, Everglades Productions. Hambrick also served as the project's narrator. =Music= In 1972 Hambrick wrote and recorded a rock/country-western album, Windmill in a Jet Filled Sky, under the Brown Bag Records music label, while moonlighting at his job at WEWS in Cleveland. The album was largely overlooked by consumers, in spite of positive critical reviews. Hambrick never abandoned his full-time television career, but did not record any more music. = Supporting actor roles = Hambrick was a registered member of the Screen Actors Guild, and had supporting and/or bit parts in the movie Telefon, the old 1950s TV series Playhouse 90 and, most recently, the hit NBC-TV series Friday Night Lights. In 1960, Hambrick appeared in one episode of the 1950s CBS-TV series General Electric Theater. Since 2003, Hambrick has appeared in four movies: Mia's Father, Wonderful World, Kings of the Evening, and the Texas-based, Gabriel Folse directed film Guilty. Hambrick was the older brother of retired newscasters Judd Hambrick, who worked alongside John at KABC-TV for a brief period in 1975‚Äì76 and also worked in Cleveland (from 1977‚Äì1985 and 1993-1999 for WJW-TV and WKYC-TV); and Mike Hambrick, who is now a business consultant. John was also the father of television producer Jack Hambrick. Cancer diagnosis and death It was announced on July 23, 2013 that Hambrick had been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. He died at a hospital on September 10, 2013. He was 73.  Awards and accomplishments  Hambrick has received numerous citations for his journalism.

Costing $40,000 to complete, the incline took visitors from the base of the mountain where the present-day Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital is located to the summit in the area where the Mill Mountain Star is now located. Today, the former location of the incline is visible in the form of a cleft in the trees on Mill Mountain, immediately behind the Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital. History The idea of an incline being developed for Mill Mountain was initially proposed in 1892, but was formally organized in November 1909 by a group of twenty-five local investors calling themselves the Mill Mountain Incline, Inc. For the investors, the incline was viewed as a major attraction for the burgeoning city. In late 1909, a pair of counterbalanced incline cars were ordered from the John Stephenson Company, and were delivered in summer 1910. The incline celebrated its inaugural voyage on August 10, 1910, and saw 1,500 passengers on opening day. The roundtrip ride cost $.25 and took four minutes to complete each way. To lure residents and tourists alike onto the incline, its owners installed walking paths, benches, a gift shop and telescopes on the summit. Although the incline saw a profit in its first year, it would sustain significant losses over the following years. Due to mounting losses, in 1919, the original investors sold the line to the local real estate magnate William Henritze. He would subsequently build a toll road to the summit which would open in the early 1920s, and effectively result in the closure of the incline in 1929. The last remnants of the line were dismantled and sold off for scrap in 1934. In 1947, the mountain faced more loss of tourism when two hikers were mauled, one killed, by a rogue grizzly bear. This put the general population into a panic. By 1949, all cave accesses were blocked off. After cave accesses were completely sealed, the city began building subdivisions with no further incident. Roanoke animal control documented one sighting of a black bear in 1992, but no incidents have been documented since. On the trail descending from the mill mountain star, there is a marker named for the killed hiker, Henry Rosico. A July 2007 proposal was introduced by Roanoke City Councilmen to revive the Incline as an economic redevelopment tool. The new incline would be in the form of an automated people mover.

The property preserves the Indian Village Site (13OB4), a prehistoric fortified village of the Mill Creek culture. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964, and made a state preserve in 1968. It is located east of Sutherland, south of 455th Street and west of Yellow Avenue. Access to the preserve requires crossing private land. The site is located on a terrace overlooking Waterman Creek. It has yielded evidence of occupation for a roughly 300-year period around 1200 CE. The site was completely surrounded by a wooden stockade, probably for protection against other Native Americans. Within the bounds of the stockade there were about 20 lodges, partially subterranean structures about , which were accessed by entry tunnels. Each lodge had a fireplace and a storage pit. The site was acquired by the state in 1937, and has been the subject of several excavations by professional archaeologists. It was first excavated by the state in 1965, at which time elements of the stockade and the character of the housing was identified. The site is subject to erosion, which the state has taken steps to mitigate by the installation of gabions on the creek bank. Materials from the site are archived at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, and at the state archaeological office. The state has installed a partial recreation of a stockade, to give an impression of what life might have been like in the village.

Biography Nagamichi was the eldest son of Ogasawara Nagamasa, the first Ogasawara daimy≈ç of Karatsu Domain in Hizen Province, Ky≈´sh≈´, Japan (modern-day Saga Prefecture). An infant at the time of his father‚Äôs death, he was bypassed in the succession by Ogasawara Nagayasu, originally the son of Sakai Tadaari of Shonai Domain. Nagayasu died without heirs, and was replaced in turn by Ogasawara Nagao, and Ogasawara Nagakazu, each of whom was adopted into the Ogasawara clan as a successor, and each of whom died without heirs. Nagamichi was never chosen to be daimy≈ç, but developed a political base within Karatsu Domain and was de facto ruler of the domain for much of his adult life. The final daimy≈ç of Karatsu, Ogasawara Nagakuni attempted to end the factionalism in Karatsu by the expediency of adopting Nagakuni as his son and heir; the end result was that all power devolved to Nagamachi, leaving Nagamichi as little more than a figurehead. Nagayuki became a prominent official in the Tokugawa shogunate, with the positions of wakadoshiyori in 1862; r≈çj≈´-kaku in 1862-1863 and in 1865; and r≈çj≈´ in 1865-1866 and in 1866-1868. During these periods, he was primarily involved with foreign affairs, and was one of the senior Japanese officials during negotiations with Great Britain over reparations following the Namamugi Incident. In 1868, with the start of the Boshin War, Karatsu Domain remained strongly in support of the Tokugawa bakufu. Karatsu domain was a fudai domain, unlike the neighboring Nabashima domains, which were of tozama domain status. The Ogasawara remained loyal to the Tokugawa to the end, with Nagamichi and many samurai accompanying the remnants of the Tokugawa army north to join the Northern Alliance and then the Republic of Ezo, fighting in the Battle of Hakodate. After the war, Nagamichi lived in retirement in Tokyo. In June 1869, the title of daimy≈ç was abolished, and in 1871, Karatsu domain itself was abolished with the abolition of the han system, and became part of the new Saga Prefecture. His son, Admiral Ogasawara Naganari, became a viscount under the new kazoku peerage system; however, Nagamichi was not awarded a title, perhaps due to his involvement with the pro-Tokugawa side in the Boshin War. However, his lower 5th court rank was raised to 4th court rank in June 1880. He died in Tokyo in 1891.

Founded by Emily Griffith in 1916 as Opportunity School, it was renamed in her honor in 1933. The school is a part of Denver Public Schools, serving as the adult education arm of the district and is also a member of the Colorado Community College System. History Denver educator Emily Griffith (1868‚Äì1947) shared her dream of opening a school to serve people of all ages and interests with a Denver Post features writer in 1915. Following its publication, she persuaded the Post and local trolley cars to promote the idea. In May 1916, Griffith received the condemned Longfellow School at 13th and Welton Streets from the Denver Board of Education. Opportunity School opened on September 9, 1916. By 1954, the school served 10,000 students annually and had over 400,000 alumni. Public television in Denver, directed by Jim Case, signed on January 30, 1956 from a studio in an auto body shop at the school. Funding from Denver Public Schools gradually declined over the years, leading the school to begin charging Denver residents tuition in 1991. Courses also changed with the needs of the community, adding more English as a Second Language and health care courses and closing programs in shoe repair, audio/visual electronics, and precision machining in the mid-1990s. Campus The College operates across three campuses. The main campus, located at 1860 Lincoln Street in Denver, houses many of the school's Career Technical Education (CTE) programs, along with Adult Basic Education (ABE) classes for those seeking their GED, as well as the English Language Acquisition (ELA, also known as ESL) programs. A second campus at 1205 Osage Street houses the College of Trades and Industry, while a third campus at 200 E. 9th Ave. houses the Video Production and Editing Program. Organization In 1990 the Emily Griffith Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation, was founded to provide financial support for Emily Griffith Technical College. The foundation is governed by a board of directors. Board members are business and industry leaders, educators, and community representatives. Academics Emily Griffith Technical College is organized into several different areas of study: the Apprenticeships Training Division, the College of Health Sciences and Administration, the College of Trades, Industry, and Professional Studies, the College of Creative Arts and Design, the Adult Basic Education program, and the Language Learning Center.

Its principal feature, a refuse midden, has yielded important information on the formation of middens in the region. The site was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964. Description The Phipps Site is located on the banks of Mill Creek in Cherokee County, occupying a broad terrace about above the typical water level of the creek. The principal feature of the site is a long and deep refuse midden, which, despite losses to plowing and erosion, still contained artifacts to a depth of more than , indicative of a long period of use. Evidence of habitation has also been found in the form of depressions, a feature associated with earth lodges, semi-subterranean dwellings typical of the Mill Creek culture. Finds at the site include pottery fragments from both the Early and Late Little Sioux phases of the Mill Creek culture, and significant assemblages of the remains of raptors, suggesting some sort of ritual importance. The site also has artifacts attributed to the Middle Mississippian culture, evidence of a fairly long-range trading network. The site underwent excavation in the 1930s, and again in 1952 under the auspices of Cherokee's Sanford Museum and the Iowa Archaeological Society. It was excavated by the University of Iowa in 1955 and 1956, and has since then been subject to further investigation. The site is subject to erosion, and was damaged during flooding in 1993.

However, the term more often has the connotation of being an illegal or unauthorized act. To describe the act of an unauthorized person who follows someone to a restricted area without the consent of the authorized person, the term tailgating is also used. \\"Tailgating\\" implies no consent (similar to a car tailgating another vehicle on a road), while \\"piggybacking\\" usually implies consent of the authorized person. Piggybacking came to the public's attention particularly in 1999, when a series of weaknesses were exposed in airport security. A study showed that the majority of undercover agents attempting to pass through checkpoints, bring banned items on planes, or board planes without tickets, were successful. Piggybacking was revealed as one of the methods that was used in order to enter off-limits areas.

During the majority of the Kamakura period through the Muromachi period (c.1185-c.1568), the bow was almost exclusively the symbol of the professional warrior, and way of life of the warrior was referred to as . History A Japanese archer with targets. Ink on paper, 1878. The beginning of archery in Japan is, as elsewhere, pre-historical. The first images picturing the distinct Japanese asymmetrical longbow are from the Yayoi period (ca. 500 BC‚Äì300 AD). The first written document describing Japanese archery is the Chinese chronicle Weishu (dated around 297 AD), which tells how in the Japanese isles people use \\"a wooden bow that is short from the bottom and long from the top.\\"Yamada Sh≈çji, The Myth of Zen in the Art of Archery, Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 2001 28/1‚Äì2 =Emergence= The changing of society and the military class (samurai) taking power at the end of the first millennium created a requirement for education in archery. This led to the birth of the first kyujutsu ry≈´ha (style), the Henmi-ry≈´, founded by Henmi Kiyomitsu in the 12th century.Thomas A. Green, Martial Arts of the World, 2001 The Takeda-ry≈´ and the mounted archery school Ogasawara-ry≈´ were later founded by his descendants. The need for archers grew dramatically during the Genpei War (1180‚Äì1185) and as a result the founder of the Ogasawara-ry≈´ (Ogasawara Nagakiyo), began teaching yabusame (mounted archery). =Civil war= From the 15th to the 16th century, Japan was ravaged by civil war. In the latter part of the 15th century Heki Danj≈ç Masatsugu revolutionized archery with his new and accurate approach called hi, kan, ch≈´ (fly, pierce, center), and his footman's archery spread rapidly. Many new schools were formed, some of which, such as Heki-ry≈´ Chikurin-ha, Heki-ry≈´ Sekka-ha and Heki-ry≈´ Insai-ha, remain today. =16th century= The yumi (Japanese bow) as a weapon of war began its decline after the Portuguese arrived in Japan in 1543 bringing firearms with them in the form of the matchlock.Tanegashima: the arrival of Europe in Japan, Olof G. Lidin, Nordic Institute of Asian Studies, NIAS Press, 2002 P.1-14 The Japanese soon started to manufacture their own version of the matchlock called tanegashima and eventually the tanegashima and the yari (spear) became the weapons of choice. The yumi, however, would be continued to be used alongside the tanegashima for a period of time because of its longer reach, accuracy, and especially because it had a rate of fire 30‚Äì40 times faster. The tanegashima however did not require the same amount of training as a yumi, allowing Oda Nobunaga's army consisting mainly of farmers armed with tanegashima to annihilate a traditional samurai cavalry in a single battle in 1575. =17th century on= During the Tokugawa period (1603‚Äì1868) Japan was turned inward as a hierarchical caste society in which the samurai were at the top. There was an extended era of peace during which the samurai moved to administrative duty, although the traditional fighting skills were still esteemed. During this period archery became a \\"voluntary\\" skill, practiced partly in the court in ceremonial form, partly as different kinds of competition. Archery spread also outside the warrior class. The samurai were affected by the straightforward philosophy and aim for self-control in Zen Buddhism that was introduced by Chinese monks. Earlier archery had been called ky≈´jutsu, the skill of bow, but monks acting even as martial arts teachers led to creation of a new concept: ky≈´d≈ç. Since then, especially due to changes brought by Japan opening up to the outside world at the beginning of the Meiji era (1868‚Äì1912), kyujutsu has experienced a steep decline. =Old school= *Ogasawara ryu Â∞èÁ¨†ÂéüÊµÅ *Heki ryu Êó•ÁΩÆÊµÅ *Heki ryu Sekka-ha Êó•ÁΩÆÊµÅ Èõ™Ëç∑Ê¥æ *Heki ryu Dosetsu-ha Êó•ÁΩÆÊµÅ ÈÅìÈõ™Ê¥æ *Heki ryu Chikurin-ha Êó•ÁΩÆÊµÅ Á´πÊûóÊ¥æ *Heki ryu Izumo-ha Êó•ÁΩÆÊµÅ Âá∫Èõ≤Ê¥æ *Heki ryu Insai-ha Êó•ÁΩÆÊµÅ Âç∞Ë•øÊ¥æ *Heki ryu Yoshida-ha Êó•ÁΩÆÊµÅ ÂêâÁî∞Ê¥æ *Yamato ryu Â§ßÂíåÊµÅ *Yoshida ryu ÂêâÁî∞ÊµÅ *Ikkan ryu ‰∏ÄË≤´ÊµÅ References Category:Japanese martial arts Category:Japanese archery Category:Ko-ry≈´ bujutsu hu:Kj√∫d√≥ ","title":"Ky≈´jutsu"},{"id":"13670644","title":"Puerto Rico Highway 22"},{"id":"13670725","text":"Michael Burak (born October 9, 1980 in Vancouver, British Columbia) is a Canadian former international rugby union footballer.

A native of Jefferson, Texas, Lumpkin attended high school in Dallas. He played college football for Georgia Tech and was an All-Southern fullback for the undefeated 1928 Georgia Tech Golden Tornado football team that defeated California in the 1929 Rose Bowl. In 1929, Lumpkin left Georgia Tech to play professional football for the Portsmouth Spartans. He played five seasons for Portsmouth from 1929 to 1933 and was selected as a second-team All-Pro in 1930 and a first-team All-Pro in 1932. He played one season with the Detroit Lions in 1934 after the Spartans moved to Detroit. He scored the first touchdown in Detroit Lions history. He concluded his football career with the Brooklyn Dodgers from 1935 to 1937. Early years Lumpkin was born in Jefferson, Texas, in 1907. He was the son of Balcombe Lumpkin and Naomi (Davis) Lumpkin. He attended Oak Cliff High School in Dallas where he played fullback for the football team in 1926. College In 1927, Lumpkin enrolled at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, planning to study textile engineering. As a freshman in 1927, he was given the nickname \\"Father\\" because of his fatherly manner. As a sophomore, he helped lead the 1928 Georgia Tech Golden Tornado football team to an undefeated season and a victory over California in the 1929 Rose Bowl. Lumpkin also intercepted two passes in a 13‚Äì0 victory over Notre Dame. At the end of the season, he was selected as a fullback on the All-Southern team of Nash Higgins, chief football scout and assistant coach for the University of Florida.. One writer called Lumpkin \\"the most powerful individual factor\\" on the 1928 Georgia Tech team and noted: \\"This big, fast and powerful backfield star, who is just as valuable as an offensive interferer as a runner, passer and pass-receiver, is the best protectionist we have seen this year in staving off opponents who attempt to reach the player who is carrying the ball.\\" Professional football Lumpkin did not return to Georgia Tech for his junior year in 1929. Instead, he joined a professional football team in Ohio called the Portsmouth Spartans. On November 24, 1929, he returned a kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown against the Ironton Tanks. Lumpkin became the star of the 1929 Portsmouth team that compiled a 12-2-1 record. Lumpkin remained with the Spartans as they joined the National Football League (NFL) in 1930 and through their move to Detroit as the Detroit Lions in 1934. He earned a reputation as an excellent blocker, leading the way for the Spartans' other backs, Dutch Clark, Glenn Presnell, and Ace Gutowsky. He was also one of the last players in the NFL who refused to wear a helmet. Presnell later recalled: \\"Probably our most popular player was Father Lumpkin . . . He was one of the toughest human beings I ever saw. I remember seeing him wrestle during the off-season. He was just a very athletic individual. He was a great blocker, and he would say if he didn't take out two men on each play, then he wasn't doing his job. He meant putting them on the ground, not just bump them and go ahead.\\" Lumpkin was selected as a second- team player on the 1930 All-Pro Team and a first-team player on the 1932 All- Pro Team. On September 23, 1934, Lumpkin scored the first touchdown in the Detroit Lions' first game, intercepting a pass and returning it 45 yards for a touchdown in a 9-0 victory over the New York Giants before a crowd of 12,000 persons at the University of Detroit Stadium. In May 1935, the Lions sold Lumpkin to the Brooklyn Dodgers. According to Dutch Clark, the Lions dropped Lumpkin because he refused to give up professional wrestling. He played for Brooklyn from 1935 to 1937. After spending 1938 as a professional wrestler, he signed in 1939 as the head coach of the Louisville Tanks of the American Professional Football League. Later years Lumpkin was married to Inez P. Lumpkin. After retiring from football, Lumpkin and his wife lived in Dallas. In his later years, Lumpkin sold bowling supplies. Lumpkin died in 1974 at age 67 in Dallas. The cause of death was cerebral insufficiency and pneumonia due to recent subendocardial infarction. For the last three-and-a-half years of his life, he suffered from ischemic heart disease with episodes of cardiac arrhythmia.Death certificate for Roy Lee Lumpkin, born January 27, 1907, died March 31, 1974.

The film was directed by Roland Joff√©, and stars Patricia Arquette, Dermot Mulroney, Don Johnson, Ellen DeGeneres and Mary-Louise Parker. The original script was written by Ron Peer; subsequent drafts were written by Robert Pucci, then Buck Henry. The film premiered at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival, before being released theatrically in April 1999. Following its premiere, reshoots were done in Beverly Hills, and the climax was changed. This was the last film that Warner Bros. had teamed up with Regency Enterprises until The Fountain in 2006. Plot The films opens up with a lovely woman named Sandra Dunmore (Patricia Arquette), a real estate agent wearing an ugly blonde bob-cut wig making a series of calls to her mistress being flirtatious and sexual. The next scene shows that same woman on her way to church where she does various community outreach with her brother-in-law Benjamin \\"Ben\\" Dunmore (Don Johnson), as he plays for the church's choir to be practiced, him and Sandra proceed to have sex and talk about their ongoing affair. The scene carries out to Jake Dunmore (Dermot Mulroney) Sandra's husband & Ben's much younger brother. Ben is an alcoholic who makes a fool of himself in his company's meetings with his Boss and when flirting with the secretary Peggy Blaine (Mary-Louise Parker), who is also having an affair with Ben. When Ben starts to suspect Sandra of revealing their affair, he takes drastic measures to avoid her as he knows how psychotic she can be, when they are almost caught having sex in a house Sandra is selling. Sandra now more furious than ever is stalking and harassing Ben, who is trying to establish a healthy relationship with Peggy. At a dinner party Jake who is hungover, tells Ben he suspects something is wrong in his marriage and he is considering Suicide. Ben dismisses this as nothing and suggest he stop drinking. The next morning Jake causes an outburst and tells Ben he is aware of his wife's infidelity and will stop at nothing to get revenge. One night when Peggy & Ben come home from dinner to go on a second sexual conquest, a drunken Jake calls Ben in a rage telling him he knows of the affair and is going to kill himself if not him. When Ben leaves a now angered Peggy, he goes to his Brother's apartment and sees how the place is trashed with his brother sitting on the balcony ledge. Ben fantasizes about pushing him off the balcony to meet his death, but cannot seem to do so correctly. When he steps outside to attempt to kill him, Sandra blinds him with a Flashlight which startles him and he ends up hanging from the ledge of the balcony. When it is revealed that he has been betrayed by his lover and brothers ben is pushed off from the ledge and falls to his painful death. Sandra & Ben fake cry to the Sargent Rita (Ellen DeGeneres) & Rollins (Ray McKinnon (actor)). Rita is very skeptical about the story they tell in which a drunken Ben attempted to stop a suicide and in the process killed himself. Rita even takes one copy of a hundred The Sound of Music (film) soundtrack cassettes. She begins to investigate around the story, while dealing with a serial killer case as well. Meanwhile, Sandra & Ben are ready to collect Ben's 2.5 million dollar insurance policy as he has no other dependents or living relatives aside from his brother which reveals their true motives. When Rita & Rollins go to inform Ben's Boss at the company both him & Jake worked at, Peggy an emotional wreck at this point breaks down and reveals her & Ben married in secret in Las Vegas making her the rightful heir to the Ben's fortune. This however only angers Sandra & Jake, who go to desperate measures to get the money back. Sandra even has the idea to pin Peggy's death on the serial killer Rollins & Rita are hunting. Which turns out to be a hitman who once loved Sandra. The hitman (Will Stewart ) is an actual paid hitman who takes out his victims using a poison in a needle, this is what fools the police into believing a serial killer is behind the murders. However plans change for Sandra as Jake decides to put the hit out on her instead of Peggy. Sandra eventually discovers that Peggy & Jake have been having an ongoing affair and that Jake actually married Peggy under Ben's Name so she can inherit the money and the two can live comfortably in the woods after his wife died. When Sandra discovers the affair she kills both Jake & Peggy by wearing a disguise to purchase a get away car to push them off a cliff road. While the police discovered the plot between Jake & Peggy, they regretfully inform Sandra who's acting skills don't fool Rita one bit. Rita, who is tired of always getting the short of the stick with her retirement plan decides to blackmail Sandra, by arresting her for her crimes if she doesn't split both Ben & Jake's insurance which is a total 8 million dollars. Sandra has no choice but to oblige to Rita's demands, unfortunately for Sandra who wasn't aware of the hit Jake called on her, she is attacked by the hitman. Luckily when Rita recognizes the man from the crime scene she rushes to Sandra's rescue. After defeating the hitman, Sandra imagined killing Rita and blaming it on the hitman, however this only in her imagination. Two months later both women go to collect their money and enjoy a new life of wealth and luxury, even Rollins is happy for the two of them, which he thinks are new best friends. The films end credits show Sandra continuing Ben's duties at the church with a smile on her face as she has no regrets. Cast Reception Goodbye Lover received negative reviews from critics.

It covers a large range of topics, since science takes on many roles in science fiction. Hard science fiction is based on engineering or the \\"hard\\" sciences (for example, physics, astronomy, or chemistry), whereas soft science fiction is based on the \\"soft\\" sciences, and especially the social sciences (anthropology, sociology, psychology, political science, and so on). Likewise, the accuracy of the science portrayed spans a wide range - sometimes it is an extrapolation of existing technology, sometimes it is a realistic or plausible portrayal of a technology that does not exist, but which is plausible from a scientific perspective; and sometimes it is simply a plot device that looks scientific, but has no basis in science. Examples are: *Realistic case: In 1944, the science fiction story Deadline by Cleve CartmillCARTMILL, CLEVE. \\"Deadline.\\" IN: Astounding Science Fiction, Vol. XXXIII, No. l, pp. 154-178.

Along with the chairman, from 1937 to 1990 Verkhovna Rada was also governed by the Presidium of the Verkhovna Rada that consisted of about 20 members.

Forthbank park was home to King's Park F.C. until the beginning of World War II. During the war Forthbank was destroyed by the Luftwaffe. The ground was victim to the only German bomb strike on the town during the conflict. The majority of the stadium was damaged beyond financial repair by King's Park and was demolished. Shortly after the war King's Park closed down permanently.  History  = King's Park F.C. = Forthbank was the home ground of King's Park F.C. since the late 19th century until 1940 when the ground was destroyed. King's Park also hosted other sporting events at the ground, mostly animal racing. Crowd trouble at a home match against St Johnstone in October 1921 led to King's Park playing a home match against Vale of Leven at Dunblane's Duckburn Park.Paul Smith & Shirley Smith (2005) The Ultimate Directory of English & Scottish Football League Grounds Second Edition 1888‚Äì2005, Yore Publications, p169 = Animal racing = Forthbank was one of a number of stadiums at the time to host animal racing. Greyhound racing started at Forthbank Park on 11 March 1932 and the track was independent (unlicensed). It was the only track in Scotland that also attempted Cheetah racing. The Scottish Football Association at the time was keen to put an end to this practice as, although the racing provided a financial lifeline to many smaller clubs including King's Park, they feared that it would lead to football becoming too reliant on gambling just like the races. An SFA inspection team deemed that the greyhound track at Forthbank encroached on to the pitch and as such it was removed, along with the source of income. = World War II end of an era = On 20 July 1940, the Luftwaffe dropped a bomb on the town of Stirling. The bomb fell on Forthbank partially destroying the stadium. King's Park made temporary repairs to the stadium and played two more games at the ground before the club was closed down. The club was finally given compensation from the War Office in 1953. = Stirling's future stadiums = This was not the end to football in Stirling as local business man Thomas Ferguson started up Stirling Albion F.C. in 1945 and shortly after purchased the Annfield estate to construct Annfield. Annfield remained the main football stadium in Stirling until 1993 when Stirling Council constructed Forthbank Stadium, on the outskirts of the town but situated about two-thirds of a mile (1 km) from the location of the original King's Park's old ground Forthbank Park.

He and his late older brother Dave Schultz, also a wrestler, were noted for both winning gold medals in wrestling in the same Olympics (1984). They are the only American brothers to win both World and Olympic Gold; they won more NCAA, U.S. Open, World, and Olympic titles than any other American brother combination in history. Early life Mark Schultz was born in 1960 in Palo Alto, California to Dorothy Jean St. Germain (n√©e Rich) and Philip Gary Schultz. He was their second son; first-born Dave was 17 months older. They had two half-siblings, Michael and Seana. Schultz is of half Ukrainian Jewish and half British descent. His paternal grandparents were Estelle (Bernstein), the daughter of a prominent paper company executive, and Maxwell L. Schultz, a business consultant. The boys attended local schools. Schultz got interested in gymnastics and started competing. Athletic career =High school career= Mark Schultz attended Palo Alto High, where he was coached by Ed Hart. He competed first in gymnastics, winning the Northern California All- Around Gymnastics Championships for his age group. During his junior year in high school, he moved to Ashland, Oregon and switched to wrestling. After one semester he transferred back to Palo Alto, but was declared ineligible, ending the year with a 4‚Äì6 record. As a senior he did not win any tournaments until the state qualifiers where Schultz won the league, region, section, and the state.

In his senior year, Schultz went undefeated and set the University of Oklahoma record for most victories in a single season without a loss. Schultz was also named University of Oklahoma's \\"Big 8\\" medallion winner for outstanding senior male student-athlete. =Olympics and World championships= In 1984, Mark and Dave Schultz both won Olympic Gold in wrestling events, as did the American twin Banach brothers.

Although stations with such a format date back as far as 2004, the format was first popularized in October 2014, after Radio One dropped a poorly performing news radio format from its Houston station KROI in favor of classic hip-hop. After attracting a dramatic increase in ratings, Radio One began to emulate the station's format and branding in other markets. At the same time, other major radio broadcasters began to introduce classic hip-hop stations in selected markets.  Format and targeting  Doug Abernethy, general manager of Radio One's Houston stations, described the classic hip-hop format as a parallel to the classic rock and classic country formats: these stations focus primarily on hip hop music from the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s, featuring artists such as 2Pac, De La Soul, Mike Jones, LL Cool J, Ludacris, The Notorious B.I.G., Queen Latifah, and Salt-N-Pepa. Some stations may include small amounts of R&B; in their playlists as well. Classic hip-hop stations are aimed primarily at listeners between the ages of 25 and 44; Tommy Boy Records founder Tom Silverman explained that hip-hop had \\"entered the realm of credible nostalgia\\", going on to say that \\"I'm sure there are kids now who think 3 Feet High and Rising by De La Soul is a rite of passage, just like Led Zeppelin is\\". The format also appeals to listeners who may not enjoy contemporary hip-hop: iHeartMedia senior vice president Doc Wynter explained that \\"hip-hop back then was about telling a story about your struggle and your family's struggle. Now the reigning hip-hop king is a multiracial guy from Toronto who did not struggle.\\"  History  = Origins = The classic hip-hop format dates back to 2004, when KZAB, a Spanish-language FM station serving the Los Angeles area, was re- launched as KDAY. The re-launched station served to capitalize on the heritage of the original KDAY on the AM dial (now KBLA), which in the 1980s was the first radio station in the United States to play hip-hop music on a full-time basis. After the station's sale to Fred Sands in 1991, the station dropped hip-hop and switched to business news. The new KDAY originally focused primarily on classic hip-hop music: over the following years, it backtracked on its gold-based format, before reinstating it in 2009. The station's initial success was hampered primarily by its signal, which did not cover all of Greater Los Angeles (a rebroadcaster, KDEY-FM, was also established to improve the station's reach in the Inland Empire), along with the music itself, as hip-hop music from the 1990s was not yet nostalgic to listeners. However, the new KDAY still enjoyed a cult following: after it was announced that KDAY would be acquired by the Meruelo Group, owners of Spanish-language television station KWHY-TV, it was speculated that the station would drop hip-hop and revert to a Spanish-language format to complement KWHY-TV. Following the establishment of a \\"Save KDAY\\" campaign on Facebook led by Dr. Dre (who was among the artists popularized by the original KDAY), the station's new owners confirmed that they would maintain the hip-hop format, citing the \\"value\\" of the KDAY brand, along with plans to broaden the station's audience to include Hispanic listeners. = Mainstream adoption = On October 13, 2014, after having dropped a low-rated all-news radio format five days prior in favor of all-Beyonc√© music as a stunt, the Houston radio station KROI, owned by the urban-oriented radio group Radio One, launched a classic hip-hop format branded as \\"Boom 92\\". Radio One stated that the format was the first of its kind among major-market stations in the United States, and would serve to complement its other urban-oriented music stations in the market. Listenership of the new format saw a dramatic improvement over its previous all-news format: the following month, KROI improved its audience share of 0.9, 26th place among Houston stations, to 3.2, 14th place in the market. In response to its success, Radio One began to flip further stations to the Boom format and brand, including Philadelphia's WPHI-FM and Dallas's KSOC. At the same time, other station groups, including iHeartMedia, Cumulus Media, Univision Radio, and Cox Media Group, began to slowly introduce classic hip-hop formats of their own. In November 2014, WTZA became the first station in the Atlanta market to adopt classic hip-hop; a few days later, both Cumulus Media's W250BC and Radio One's W275BK flipped as well, with the latter using the Boom branding. Some stations, over the 2014 holiday season, shifted towards classic hip-hop as a temporary format. Edison Research analyst Sean Ross compared the growth of classic hip-hop to the emergence of classic rock, which came during a similar youth-oriented shift in mainstream rock towards glam metal bands and grunge. KROI's success was short-lived; by December 2016, it had fell back towards a 1.4 share. In January 2017, KROI would drop its classic hip-hop format in favor of contemporary hit radio.

Produced by TVS for Channel 4 Television in 1989, it was released on VHS by Universal Studios in 1994.Granpa, VHS, Universal Studios, released 12 September 1994. Retail product display. Amazon.com. An expensive film to produce, Granpa is hand-illustrated with coloured pencil, imitating Burningham's style in the book. It was directed by Dianne Jackson, who had previously adapted The Snowman by Raymond Briggs (1978), a wordless picture book, as an exceptionally successful family-oriented animated film (1982). Howard Blake, who wrote the music for The Snowman, wrote the music and the script for Granpa, which is referred to as an \\"animated children's opera\\". The voices of Granpa and Emily are by Peter Ustinov and Emily Osborne. Granpa won the Prix Jeunesse International award for excellence in children's television programming in 1990. Book The animated film is an adaptation of the children's picture book Granpa, written and illustrated by John Burningham and published by Jonathan Cape in 1984. Burningham won the Kurt Maschler Award, or \\"the Emil\\", from Maschler publishers and Booktrust, which annually recognised the author(s) of one \\"work of imagination for children, in which text and illustration are integrated so that each enhances and balances the other.\\"\\"Kurt Maschler Awards\\". Book Awards. bizland.com. Retrieved 2013-10-06. Plot The film celebrates the relationship between a small girl named Emily (voiced by Emily Osborne), and her kindly but ailing grandfather (voiced by Peter Ustinov), along with a dog. Emily's playful innocence is contrasted with Granpa's increasing frailty. Aware that he will not be around for much longer, he shares his memories of adventures and days gone by. These memories are vividly brought to life by her grandfather's tales, beginning with a description of Granpa's childhood and youth in the early part of the 20th Century. Other adventures include a chivalrous tale of Saint George and the Dragon imagined on a bedcover, a fishing trip which ends with a journey down the Thames pulled by a blue whale, a trip to the seaside which culminates in a re-enactment of the Battle of Britain and a Noah's Ark-influenced story, where Granpa's house is submerged and the pair have to accommodate exotic animals. The final jungle section, in which monkeys steal Granpa's storybook, is left intentionally incomplete. As the seasons pass, Granpa grows frailer, and eventually Emily is left alone with an empty chair and the old man's loyal dog. She leaves the house with the dog and climbs a hill. As they travel, a group of children from her grandfather's stories join them. Production In 1984, following the success of the animated Christmas film The Snowman, Channel 4 commissioned another animation from TVC studios; producer John Coates approached Dianne Jackson and composer Howard Blake, suggesting Burningham's picture book Granpa. Blake was initially reluctant due to the book's upsetting ending, but was convinced after witnessing his own daughter's reaction to her grandfather's death that year. Fiona Collins noted in Turning the Page: Children's Literature in Performance and the Media that while Burningham's book is open ended, with Emily ultimately left alone to contemplate her grandfather's death, the film offers a less \\"stark\\" interpretation; his death is explored through her implied remembrance of him in the final scene. Collins suggests that this was probably because the original offered an unremittingly bleak ending that would be difficult for its intended child audience. The film was entirely financed by Channel 4 and cost over one million pounds to make according to Coates. It was first broadcast on the channel on New Year's Eve 1989 at 6.30pm. Music The musical score was written and composed by Howard Blake and is almost in the form of a miniature opera, with many of the tales within the animation sung by the lead characters, along with children from the Wroughton Middle School choir (winners of BBC Choir of the Year) and a forty-piece orchestra (the Sinfonia of London). The end title song \\"Make Believe\\" is performed by Sarah Brightman and has the theme of \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" as a counter-melody. The song was released as a single at the time. Reception The film won the Prix Jeunesse International award for excellence in children's television programming in 1990. The film review site Rotten Tomatoes has called the film \\"a sensitive and life-affirming animated adaptation\\". The film has rarely been repeated, and has never been released on DVD, perhaps due to its subject matter. The \\"Toonhound\\" review suggest that the film takes the tone of the ending of The Snowman even further, \\"exploring an aspect of life rarely approached in animated form.\\" Paul Madden, writing Dianne Jackson's obituary in 1993 suggests that the film \\"was less of immediate popular appeal than The Snowman, but was perhaps more satisfying to her creatively, demanding a more subtle approach.\\" Toonhound notes that \\"Just like that film there is a tangible sense of loss at the end; a loss which builds with repeated viewings. You know that Granpa won't be playing with Emily for much longer, and what's more, you're aware that he knows this too.\\" See also References External links  Granpa at the British Film Institute Granpa at Toonhound.com * Granpa at Fandando.com * Howard Blake official site * Samples of Granpa music scores by Howard Blake Category:1989 films Category:1989 short films Category:1989 animated films Category:British films Category:British animated films Category:British children's animated films Category:British graphic novels Category:Animated films based on children's books Category:Films scored by Howard Blake ","title":"Granpa"},{"id":"13671007","text":"Dandli is a town in Kotli District, Azad Kashmir.

Life and career Stanley Kerr was the son of a Presbyterian minister and was an inactive member of the Army. A clinical biochemist at Walter Reed Hospital, he left the United States in 1919 to serve as a volunteer for Near East Relief, an American charity created to help the Armenians. Kerr began his service in Aleppo during an Armenian refugee crisis when many of the survivors of the Armenian Genocide had escaped. He worked as a medical and sanitary officer who cared for the survivors of the march of refugees through the desert. He also worked to recover Armenian children from the Kurdish and Turkoman families into which they had been forced. In 1921 Stanley and Elsa Reckman joined the staff of a Near East Relief orphanage for Armenian children at Nahr Ibrahim, Lebanon. One of the Armenian refugees was as a flower girl in their wedding in 1922. The orphanage was abandoned in 1923 due to a typhoid outbreak. After Stanley earned his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania, he and Elsa returned to the Middle East where he accepted the position of chairman of the Department of Biochemistry at the American University of Beirut. Elsa Kerr also served on the AUB faculty as Dean of Women students. They had four children: Marion, Dorothy, Douglas, and Malcolm H. Kerr. In 1965, following 40 years of faculty service, Stanley retired with the rank of Distinguished Professor. In recognition of his service, the Republic of Lebanon conferred upon him its Order of Merit and its National Order of the Cedar (Chevalier rank). He and Elsa retired to Princeton, New Jersey. Kerr published The Lions of Marash in 1973. Some have deemed that book as \\"practically required reading for Armenians\\" since it is a firsthand account of the massacre of the Armenian population in Western Armenia. Stanley Kerr died in 1976. He was the father of Malcolm H.

She was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1992. She is open for tours as part of the National Mississippi River Museum & Aquarium. Description and history William M. Black is located at the head of the Dubuque Harbor, where Ice Harbor Drive meets East 3rd Street. She has a riveted steel hull long, and wide at its widest point, including the paddleboxes for its sidewheels. Her hold is deep, and she has a scow-formed bow and no keel. Her superstructure has three decks, supported by a network of steel I-beams, so that heavy equipment could be supported anywhere within her structure. The dustpan dredge is mounted in front, with winched cables on either side to hold the ship in place during dredging operations. The paddleboxes are located about 2/3 of the way down the hull. The pump that operated the dredge was located in a forward position, with its steam power plant located just aft of its position. One of the ship's paddlewheels has been removed, and is on display on the museum grounds. According to information provided on the tour, William M. Black, one of the last paddle steamers built in the US, was used primarily along the Missouri River. She had a crew of 49 and dredged of material per day. She was placed out of service in 1973 because she consumed of heavy oil each day, which became prohibitively expensive during the 1973 OPEC oil embargo.

The Oak Orchard Swamp, which is the heart of the conservation area, is formed by a natural obstruction to the flow of Oak Orchard Creek. Oak Orchard WMA, along with the Iroquois National Wildlife Refuge and the Tonawanda Wildlife Management Area farther to the west, helps form a continuous conservation and management zone, the Alabama Swamp Complex, covering part of three counties.  Geography  The Oak Orchard WMA is located about halfway between Buffalo and Rochester. It is north of the Village of Oakfield. The western boundary is marked by Knowlesville Road, which separates the WMA from Iroquois National Wildlife Refuge. The northern boundary is partly marked by Podunk Road and East Shelby Road. Albion Road passes through the eastern part of the WMA. No highway or other feature marks the south boundary. Public use Most of the pedestrian traffic in the WMA is along the dikes that separate the wetland into discrete marshes. Except for unpaved roads reserved for official use, the only roadways through the area are a few local rural roads. Permissible activities at Oak Orchard WMA include hunting, fishing, non-motorized boating, hiking and nature study, bird watching, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing. Photography is enhanced by blinds that are installed at some locations. An observation tower is located on Albion Road, and an education center is located on Knowlesville Road, which includes some picnicking facilities. Trapping is also allowed via permits assigned by lottery, and dog training is permitted within state regulations. Camping is available only to groups with a permit. Prohibited activities include the use of motorized vehicles (except in parking areas), the use of motorized boats, and hunting of waterfowl in marked areas.

It is a spin-off of the Legally Blonde film series. It was directed by Savage Steve Holland and co- produced by Reese Witherspoon, who played Elle Woods in the first two films. The film stars Camilla and Rebecca Rosso as Elle's British twin cousins. The film was released on DVD on April 28, 2009, and aired on ABC Family and Disney Channel. Plot Starting in the United Kingdom, Isabelle \\"Izzy\\" (Rebecca Rosso) and Annabelle \\"Annie\\" Woods (Camilla Rosso) are introduced as clever twin girls with a love for pink like their cousin, Elle Woods. They and their widowed father move to Southern California to stay in Elle's home; Elle is now a successful lobbyist in Washington, D.C. Awaiting the girls are a pair of chihuahua dogs, who are the nephews of Elle's chihuahua Bruiser. Their giddiness is cut short, when they find out they are going to attend Pacific Preparatory, Elle's alma mater, a private school requiring uniforms. Upon their first day, after meeting the strict Headmistress Elsa Higgins (Lisa Banes), who introduces them to Pac Prep's many rules and extensively detailed honor code, Izzy and Annie register themselves and sign for their ID cards, and meet Chris (Bobby Campo), a scholarship student who is almost immediately smitten with Annie. They also start off on the wrong foot with Tiffany Donohugh (Brittany Curran), the spoiled daughter of a primary funder of \\"Pac Prep.\\" Tiffany later apologizes for her rude behavior and befriends the twins, although she does it merely to \\"keep her enemies close\\". Annie and Izzy believe Tiffany to be a sweet person, though she dislikes classmates on scholarship. However, her true colors come out when she embarrasses Annie and Izzy at a formal dance, revealing that they are on partial scholarship at the school. Izzy and Annie rekindle their friendships with the other scholarship students, including Chris. Izzy wants to help Chris get closer to Annie, but in several instances, Annie believes Chris to like Izzy. The twins and their friends believe the uniforms are stifling their creativity and they re-style their clothing while still cleverly abiding by the school's rules. Chris and Izzy are later accused of cheating on a big history test and they all set out to prove the school wrong. Izzy and Annie suspect Tiffany and Justin (Chad Broskey) are behind this and find that Chris and Tiffany have the same backpack that comes with a lock and key; in Chris's locked zipper pocket, he keeps a master-key that opens all doors in the school (and was found broken off in the lock their history teacher's office), for his work-studies to help pay off his scholarship. They discover that the keys and locks for the backpacks are the same, any key will open any lock. On the floor of the teacher's private office, where the answer key to the test is kept, they discover red markings that match the marks that Justin's expensive shoes create. They conclude that Tiffany told Justin the uber code to access the answers to the test from their teacher's computer. With this new piece of information, Annie and Izzy set to prove Chris and Izzy's innocence. In student court, Annie poses as Izzy when she is locked in the bathroom by Justin, and defeats her fear of public speaking. Even as Izzy escapes and returns to the court, Annie points out that Justin owns a new cell phone, one that has not yet been released to the public, and could only have been gotten from one person: the daughter of the creator of both the phone and the uber code, Tiffany Donohugh. Justin, who is irritated by noises such as pencils being sharpened and pen clicks, struggles to hold himself together as the supporters of the twins and Chris click their pens. He finally admits to framing Chris and Izzy on Tiffany's behalf and Tiffany, upon chewing him out for letting \\"a blonde make (him) crack\\", admits to masterminding the whole plot, though she protests that she cannot be punished since her father is a major founder and continuous donor of the school. Despite this, Headmistress Higgins expels them both for their attempt to frame their classmates for theft and cheating, and their numerous violations of the Pac Prep honor code in the process. At the end of the movie, Annie and Chris dance together at a school dance and Izzy does the same with Brad (Christoph Sanders) (a secret scholarship student who assisted the twins in student court by ringing Justin's phone). The twins and their friends have now become popular at Pac Prep. As for Tiffany and Justin, they wind up facing the consequences for their actions as they are apparently cut off from their wealth as punishment from their parents for their crimes and for shaming their families (who founded and donated to the school), and are seen boarding a rowdy student- filled bus and being whisked off to public school, much to their horror.

Parts of the western slope are privately owned ranchland, while the eastern slope is under the federal protection of the Arid Lands Ecology Reserve, a unit of the Hanford Reach National Monument, managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The mountain is the second highest point in Benton County, with its neighbor Lookout Summit surpassing it by only 98 ft (30 m). Rattlesnake Mountain is notable for its high wind speeds, with the highest recorded being around 150 mph (241 kilometers per hour). History The Yakama Nation referred to Rattlesnake Mountain as Lal√≠ik, meaning \\"land above the water\\". Some historians speculate that the origin of the name Lal√≠ik refers to the inundation of the Columbia River Plateau during the Missoula Floods, as Rattlesnake would have been one of the few mountains not completely inundated by flood waters reaching depths of 1200 ft (366 m). Geologists have found glacial erratics on Rattlesnake at heights up to this level. However, there is scant evidence placing human settlements in the area at the time of the floods, 12 to 13 thousand years ago. Lal√≠ik is held sacred by native peoples of the Columbia Plateau, including the Nez Perce, Umatilla, Wanapum, Cayuse, Walla Walla, and Yakama, and remains a spiritual epicenter to this day. In 1943, Rattlesnake Mountain was seized by the United States government under eminent domain and became a buffer zone for the nuclear project at the Hanford site. In 1955, US Army installed a Nike Ajax missile base on the southeastern end of the ridge and maintained it until December 1958, when it was closed. Rattlesnake Mountain Observatory The Rattlesnake Mountain Observatory was established at the summit in 1966, utilizing some of the former missile base infrastructure, and remained there until its relocation near Wallula, WA in 2009. The observatory's main telescope was installed in 1971 and is a 32-inch (0.8-meter) telescope housed inside a 24-foot domed enclosure. This telescope is the largest permanently mounted telescope in Washington State. The telescope was used regularly through the early 1980s, but soon fell into disuse. Due to its location, renovations and upgrades were done to allow for remote control. Observatory operations are directed by a local nonprofit group founded by scientists and engineers from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory at Hanford. It was announced 14 March 2008 that the Department of Energy would not renew the permit, license or easements for the observatory or most of the other entities that maintain communication equipment on the mountain. DOE instead intends to return the area to its natural conditions, citing the cultural sensitivity of the area. The removal of the observatory from Rattlesnake Mountain began in the latter part of May, 2009. Most of the work, including the removal of the telescope itself, was completed in June of the same year. In late 2012, the telescope moved into its new home at Pacific Northwest Regional Observatory in the hills near Wallula, Washington. Public access Section 3081, \\"Ensuring public access to the summit of Rattlesnake Mountain in the Hanford Reach National Monument\\",https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr3979/text/enr#link=B_XXX_H_3081&nearest;=H1FFC28B5644E408889EBE59A666CF8B4 of the Carl Levin and Howard P. ‚ÄúBuck‚Äù McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (H.R. 3979 (113th)) directs the Secretary of the Interior to provide public access (including motorized access) to the summit of Rattlesnake Mountain in the Hanford Reach National Monument in the state of Washington. This law was enacted ‚Äî Signed by the President on Dec 19, 2014. The provision is supposed to help with tourism and scientific undertakings. The Native American community initially objected this action but now welcome the decision because it restores access to historically significant land they have been unable to visit. Public access has been delayed because the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service wants to use the land as a money maker for the agency. Access was expected to begin in the Fall of 2019 in accordance to the law but no announcement regarding access has been made placing the USFWS in violation of the law.

It is located primarily within Niagara County and Genesee County, with a small portion within Orleans County. It is managed by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. Along with the adjacent Iroquois National Wildlife Refuge to the east and the Oak Orchard Wildlife Management Area farther to the east, Tonawanda WMA contributes to a continuous region dedicated to conservation and wildlife management known as the Alabama Swamp Complex. Approximately 100,000 migratory birds pass through the area each year.  History  The wildlife management area is located in a swampy area that has historically been a stopping point for migratory wildfowl. The area was hunted by Native Americans and early settlers. The land was purchased by New York State to protect the wildlife from over-hunting using funds from duck stamps and taxes on firearms and ammunition. The stated objectives of the WMA are increased waterfowl production, waterfowl protection, and flood control. Geography  Tonawanda WMA lies about halfway between Buffalo and Rochester. It lies halfway between the Village of Akron to the south and the Village of Middleport to the north. The Tonawanda WMA consists of , consisting primarily of wetlands. The WMA is on a floodplain of the Tonawanda Creek. Water retention is facilitated by impoundments, which increase wetland area and control flooding in nearby inhabited areas. NY Route 77, Lewiston Road, passes through the north part of the WMA. The south boundary of part of Tonawanda WMA is the Tonawanda Indian Reservation. The WMA is located adjacent to the Iroquois National Wildlife Refuge and the Oak Orchard Wildlife Management Area, both located east of the Tonawanda WMA. Located several miles north is the Hartland Swamp Wildlife Management Area in the Town of Hartland. The former John White Memorial Game Farm, located south of the community of Alabama on NY-77 at the junction with NY-63, is also available for public use. Public use Hunting, fishing, hiking, bird watching and snowshoeing is permitted at Tonawanda WMA. Trapping is also allowed via permits assigned by lottery. Prohibited activities include the use of motorized vehicles (except in parking areas), and the use of motorized boats. Camping is available only to groups with a permit. Except for Bartel Road and Meadville Road, both of which pass through the WMA, all other roads are unpaved and reserved for official use. Pedestrian traffic in the WMA uses these roads and other paths along the dikes, which divides the WMA into separate marshes. Two observation areas with ample parking and public information are located along Lewiston Road.

Its ideology was broadly centrist, inspired partly by the Paris daily Le Monde. History =Development= Timerman, an Argentine Jewish immigrant from Ukraine, had previously launched numerous successful news publications in Argentina, notably Primera Plana and Confirmado news magazines. Billed as \\"the news daily for the great minority\\" in an initial publicity campaign written by a friend of Timerman, author Pedro Orgambide, La Opini√≥n adopted an editorial line described by Timerman as \\"rightist economically, centrist politically and leftist culturally.\\" The newspaper was created by a team led by Jacobo Timerman (editor), Julio Alga√±araz, Horacio Verbitsky and Juan Carlos Alga√±araz, as managing editors. Editors: Tom√°s Eloy Mart√≠nez, Jose Maria Pasquini Dur√°n, Felisa Pinto, Roberto Cossa and Julio Nudler. Its editorial board was led by Timerman, Julio Alga√±araz, Horacio Verbitsky and Juan Carlos Alga√±araz. Its pages would subsequently include bylines by Juan Gelman, Miguel Bonasso, Carlos Ulanovsky, Tom√°s Eloy Mart√≠nez, Ernesto S√°bato, Pompeyo Camps, Osvaldo Soriano, Ricardo Halac, Enrique Raab, Roberto Cossa, Victoria Walsh, Mar√≠a Esther Giglio, Ra√∫l Vera Ocampo, Pablo Urbanyi, Gerardo Fern√°ndez, Jos√© Agust√≠n Mahieu, Hugo Gambini, Luis Aubele, Bernardo Verbitsky and other noted figures in Argentine journalism and the arts. Instead of photos, the paper illustrated articles with caricatures by Hermenegildo S√°bat. La Opini√≥n grew rapidly, and by 1974, averaged a daily circulation of 150,000, becoming Buenos Aires' fourth-largest news daily. =Silent partner= Planning to purchase a larger printing plant, Timerman sold a 45% stake in 1974 to David Graiver. Graiver, a real estate developer, became the investment banker for the Montoneros guerrilla group. He reportedly laundered us$17 million in funds obtained by the Montoneros from their frequent kidnappings in a variety of interests in both Argentina and overseas, including La Opini√≥n. Graiver died in an aviation crash on August 7, 1976. La Opini√≥n devoted extensive coverage to Third World issues, as well as to the ongoing Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict. Timerman and other La Opini√≥n staff had already suffered death threats by the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance as early as 1973. The paper was supportive of the Marxist government of President Salvador Allende in neighboring Chile, and was labeled \\"Enemy Number One\\" by the subsequent Chilean dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet. The publication was, however, generally supportive of the March 1976 coup that toppled President Isabel Per√≥n in Argentina, describing the nation (referring to left- wing violence) as \\"helpless before the slaughter.\\" =Suppression= The paper gradually distanced itself from the dictatorship as mounting evidence of the Dirty War appeared. A number of its staff would be abducted by the regime throughout 1976, and Timerman responded to these events (as well as to death threats) with critical editorials. The paper also published correspondence between Timerman and Congressman Donald M. Fraser of Minnesota in which the publisher offered to testify in the United States Congress regarding the Dirty War. The daily's opposition to the dictatorship intensified, and on January 30, 1977, its circulation was confiscated, as well as the corresponding color magazine insert, on the charge of \\"offending the Argentine government and military.\\" The technical manager of La Opini√≥n, Edgardo Saj√≥n, was abducted on April 1, and La Opini√≥n placed under Federal intervention. Urged to leave the country by friends and family, Timerman refused, and on April 15, he was abducted by a paramilitary group under the orders of Buenos Aires Province Police Chief Ram√≥n Camps; the publishing house was expropriated in November. Timerman was kept in detention for a period of two and a half years, and was subjected to torture during the early days of his detention; he was ultimately released in September 1979, and sought exile in Israel. La Opini√≥n remained in print under military ownership until its last remaining assets were sold at auction in December 1980. He returned to Argentina in January 1984, and edited La Raz√≥n until 1987. Timerman died in 1999. =A controversy revisited= The long-defunct La Opini√≥n became one of numerous points of contention during a series of political controversies between Clar√≠n and Kirchnerism from 2008 onward. David Graiver's widow, Lidia Papaleo, testified in 2010 to having been intimidated by Clar√≠n Group executive H√©ctor Magnetto, and subsequently tortured by the police, to forfeit further payment in 1977 for her inherited shares in La Opini√≥n and the nation's leading newsprint maker, Papel Prensa. She later recanted her testimony, affirming simply that she had been pressured to sell her shares, though never under duress.

The group was founded in 1983 by Michael Torbert and became a regular fixture at Redskins games for nearly 30 years. When the group announced its retirement following the 2012 Washington Redskins season, it had over 20 members, including three who have been featured in an exhibit at the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

These characters were created by Chika Umino in the manga published by Shueisha between from June 2000 to July 2006 and collected in 10 bound volumes. The series was adapted as an anime television series produced by J.C.Staff, initially broadcast in Japan in two seasons from April to September 2005 and June to September 2006; a live-action movie released in theaters in Japan on July 22, 2006; and two separate live-action television dramas in 2008, one broadcast in Japan from January 8, 2008 to March 18, 2008 and the other broadcast in Taiwan beginning on May 25, 2008. The series is about the lives and relationships of five students at a Tokyo art college, three of whom live in the same apartment building.  Main characters  ; : Portrayed by: Haruka Kud≈ç (anime, Japanese), Heather Halley (anime, English), Y≈´ Aoi (movie), Riko Narumi (Japanese TV drama) :: A supremely gifted artist, Hagu's immense talents are esteemed by all who witness her works, catching the eye of numerous professional artists who insistently urge her to submit her work to exhibitions to heighten her publicity (which she seems to find daunting). She is 18 years of age at the beginning of the series and her appearance is that of a child, and she conveniently behaves as one. Raised in a largely sheltered and obscure home by her irritable grandmother, her sociability is below average. It is while living in that home that Hagu develops her skill in drawing and painting, her only pastime, though she finds nothing to sketch save for the never-changing view she has from her porch, varying only in seasons. Hagu is from Azumino city, Nagano-ken. She is introduced to Takemoto, Morita and Mayama by Sh≈´ji, her father's cousin and also a professor at the college. Upon seeing her, Morita and Takemoto fall in love with her, though both express it in different ways. Hagu knows not of their feelings towards her, but sees them as friends. However, Morita expresses his love for her in very odd ways, and Hagu is often seen trying to escape from whatever shenanigan Morita has planned for her. Though later Hagu develops feelings towards Morita, although she does not at first realize this, as Sh≈´ji points out. Hagu is very shy, and because she is so nervous when interacting with people, the other art students think that she is strange. Hagu doesn't seem to be too close with family members either, with the exception of Sh≈´ji, whom she fondly calls \\"Sh≈´-chan\\". However, as the series progresses, Hagu is able to become closer friends with Takemoto, Mayama, Morita and Yamada. When Sh≈´ji leaves to go do a research project in Mongolia, Hagu forms a deeper bond with each of them, essentially seeing them as a sort of family. Hagu lives with Yamada (whom she calls \\"Ayu\\") when Sh≈´ji is away and they become very close friends. During parties, she is seen to be crying because of her envy of Yamada's beautiful legs and beautiful breasts. Mayama tries very hard to comfort her but failing rather miserably saying that \\"You'll have one of those when you're older....probably\\". While Hagu is crying, Morita is also crying because of her infectious tears. Later in the series, Hagu started to avoid Takemoto after he confessed his feelings for her, but at the end when he was leaving on the bullet train she gave him bread with honey and four leaf clovers, proving that she considered him a precious friend. At the end of the series, Hagu accepts Morita's confession of love and quickly realizes his intentions. Begging him not to run away and promising to always watch him, she returns to Sh≈´ji to complete her rehab. Mayama said that there are people who pursue love, and there are ones who choose passion. Hagu seems to be the second type. Moreover, Sh≈´ji is a very important person to Hagu and is \\"like a rain that soothes her\\". Hagu is often troubled by the thought that she's a burden to Sh≈´ji. ; : Portrayed by: Hiroshi Kamiya (anime, Japanese), Yuri Lowenthal (anime, English), Sh≈ç Sakurai (movie), Toma Ikuta (Japanese TV drama) :: Aged 19 (at the beginning of the series), Y≈´ta Takemoto is a second- year student at the art college. He is from Annaka city, Gunma-ken. He lives in the same apartment complex as Mayama and Morita in room 202. His floor mates are Morita and Hasegawa. Takemoto studies architecture, but has little certainty as to what he wishes to do upon graduating; his decision to attend art college was because he liked to build things with his hands, like he had with his father. Takemoto is one of the more mellow characters in the series. He falls in love with Hagu immediately after being introduced by his professor and keeps his feelings to himself throughout most of the series. His love for Hagu and his inability to act upon his feelings as freely as Morita causes some internal problems for Takemoto. For example, when Hagu received a bird brooch that was made for her as an anonymous present, Takemoto couldn't bring himself to say that Morita was the one who had made it for her. Instead of acting on his feelings, Takemoto decides to be more of a brother figure to Hagu, giving her friendly support when needed. For example, Takemoto accepts Hagu's requests to build her sophisticated dollhouses and the like. Takemoto is very close to her. His relationship with his family also contributes to his mellow mood. His father died when he was still young. Also, his mother works at a hospital as a nurse, so Takemoto would usually spend a lot of his time there, even his Christmas holidays. Furthermore, Takemoto is uncomfortable with his mother's new husband, an outspoken man whose persona seems to a polar opposite to that of his father. However, Takemoto tries to get used to his company and tries to accept the fact that his step-father is capable of looking after his mother, since Takemoto has worried about his mother's well- being ever since he left home. His mother's remarriage and her assurance that he is now free to do as he wishes instead of taking care of her all the time later influenced Takemoto's decision to attend art college. Later in the series Takemoto has to stay another year due to getting a stomach ulcer and not being able to complete his graduation thesis. Near the end of the first season, Takemoto goes on a journey across Japan on a bicycle, meeting several people on the way, including a group in Zuigan-ji in Matsushima which is involved in the renovating of ancient Japanese structures and buildings all around the country (which he wishes to join), finally reaching Cape S≈çya in Wakkanai, Hokkaid≈ç. After arriving back to Tokyo, he finally confesses his feelings for Hagu though he knew from the start that his feelings for her were unrequited. At the end of the manga, he chose to work with the renovating team he had met and left for Morioka. ; : Portrayed by: Y≈´ji Ueda (anime, Japanese), Sam Riegel (anime, English), Y≈´suke Iseya (movie), Hiroki Narimiya (Japanese TV drama) :: 24 years old and a 6th year student in the beginning of the series, Morita occupies room 203, his floor mates being Takemoto and Hasegawa. Morita is unable to graduate, as he can never wake up on time to go to classes. This is mainly due to the work that he does, which forces him to go missing for periods of time. What he does for work though remains a mystery. When Morita comes back from his mysterious job, he immediately falls asleep for at least 48 hours, due to the amount of work he does. He also returns with a large sum of money in his back-pocket and brings a food item to share with his flat mates. Although the flat mates believe he does it to mock them, such as when he brings a bag of croquettes instead of meat, Morita does care deeply for his friends such as Takemoto. Despite being pretty weird sometimes, Morita is extremely smart and talented, showing talent in many fields from a young age such as creating toys, sculpture, drawing, playing musical instruments, and especially CG effects (which is exploited by Peter Lucas). Though he often appears to be childish and playful, he's actually a very thoughtful person, often gives advice and consolation to his friends, mostly Yamada. He also used his crazy methods to rescue his friends from difficult or embarrassing situation (like the Yamada-Mayayma related cases). Morita is a very mysterious person. He does many random, crazy things for his personal enjoyment, such as creating a twister game with too many colors, which resulted in horrific pain for him and Takemoto. Morita is a perceptive individual, but tactless and often states the truth, such as how Mayama secretly stalks Rika outside her apartment, when nobody wants to hear it. He also expresses his love for Hagu in weird and quirky ways, such as forcing Hagu to dress up as a mouse. Morita's obsession with Hagu stems from a fondness of cute things during his childhood, such as causing a cat to become neurotic after cuddling it too much. As a result of Morita's obsession Hagu becomes afraid of him and tries to avoid him but eventually falls in love with him later on. Despite the way Morita treats Hagu he sincerely cares for Hagu, getting her a pair of expensive mules and creating a brooch with a dove on it, both of which was in her scrapbook of things she wanted. Later in the series, Morita leaves for America for work without saying anything to his friends. He eventually returns in about a year's time, and Morita's friends finally discover what he does for his work, being awarded best CGI in the Mocademy Awards (a spoof of the Academy Awards) for the movie 'Space Titanic', after studying with acclaimed director Peter Lucas. Morita's room, which no one had ever been inside, had also been discovered after his departure, and contained a lot of high tech equipment. After returning from America, Morita finally manages to graduate from his course in his 8th year handing his work in on the very last day. Despite graduating and becoming rich from his work in America, Morita applies for a Japanese Arts course believing he hasn't studied for long enough, even though he's been there for 8 years. He re-enters the art school as a 3rd grade student, having already completed half the subjects. From the last chapters of the series, we find out that Morita has been earning money all along to help his brother Kaoru get revenge on a company who ruined his father's company by foul methods. Morita doesn't want this revenge from the bottom of his heart, but did so because of his brother and the former faithful employers of his late father. Hearing Hagu's accident, he rushed back to see her. Looking to her as an escape, he said that it was absurd thinking life only means something if you leave work behind. Morita also finally confesses his love for her. Hagu reciprocated his feelings, but sees through his intentions, begging him not to run away. Promising to always watch over him, Hagu returns to Sh≈´ji and her rehab because she cannot imagine her life without drawing. Later, Morita decides to work in Peter Lucas's company. ; : Portrayed by: Tomokazu Sugita (anime, Japanese), Cam Clarke (anime, English), Ry≈ç Kase (movie), Osamu Mukai (Japanese TV drama) :: 22 years old and a 4th year student at the start of the series, Mayama is from Kanazawa, Ishikawa-ken and an architecture student at the art institute. He lives in the same complex as Takemoto and Morita. He occupies room 101, sharing the floor with an unknown individual and formerly Lohmeyer-senpai. He acts as a senior to Takemoto and tries to help Morita get up for early morning classes. At one point, Takemoto and Morita are seen sleeping alongside him in his futon. Morita also borrows Mayama's shirts from time to time because it's more comfortable. Mayama also used to help Rika out with various errands while Rika was disabled due to the accident that left her husband dead. It is during that time that Mayama develops feelings for Rika. It is unknown whether Rika fully reciprocates the feelings that Mayama has for her, but various flashbacks imply that Mayama and Rika have 'fooled around', or Mayama took advantage of Rika's disability to fulfill his desires, although this is cleared up later as not being the case. Rika suggested that Mayama find another job so that she wouldn't have to continue hurting him, as she realizes how much he cares for her, and is unable (and perhaps unwilling at that point) to allow him to enter into her life. Mayama eventually landed a job at Fujiwara Design. He has to deal with coworkers that are also very interested in his love life, and make comments whenever they can. Mayama also has to keep watch of his boss, Nomiya, whom he considers to be a playboy, when Nomiya begins to take an interest in Yamada. Mayama doesn't return the feelings that Yamada has for him, but he sees Yamada as his close friend. Yamada's innocence is one thing that Mayama has to constantly guard from Nomiya, who has developed an interest with her. When Fujiwara Design later broke up, people had to either stay in the Tokyo branch or transfer to the Tottori branch. Nomiya arranged for Mayama to be transfer to the Tottori branch, but as soon as this was announced Mayama quit. He now works again with Rika at her company, Harada Design, after forcing himself into the position in his own way. Mayama's character design is based upon Suga Shikao.Suga Shikao on extra of Honey and Clover DVD. ; : Portrayed by: Mikako Takahashi (anime, Japanese), Julie Ann Taylor (anime, English), Megumi Seki (movie), Natsuki Harada (Japanese TV drama) :: 21 years old at the beginning, Yamada is well known by her peers at the art college. First, she is good at pottery, and second, she is nicknamed Tetsujin (lit. Iron-lady) for running 6km to school every morning with her dog during freshman year in order to help the dog lose weight. Due to her good looks, she also catches the attention of her male friends/coworkers at the shopping district she works with. She and Hagu seem to be very close, like siblings. While Hagu addresses the three young men by their last names, she calls Yamada by her first name. Yamada really cares for Hagu like a younger sister. She offers to stay with her while Shuji is gone and they get along extremely well, especially as they share an equally unique taste in cooking that is inedible to anyone else but themselves. Although not shown as much as her relationship with Hagu, she is close friends with Takemoto and Morita. Nomiya once said that though Yamada has the look of a fully matured girl, she's actually a \\"baby\\" inside. Yamada is innocent, and cares deeply for her friends. She's also very good at martial arts. Yamada and Hagu often create together many bizarre dishes (like curry with chocolate and so on), and Mayama, Takemoto, Morita and Sh≈´ji are the victims of these dishes in most of the cases. Yamada is deeply in love with one of her friends, Mayama. Mayama, however, doesn't return her feelings, asking her why she is in love with him and encouraging her to go find someone else. Even though Yamada recognizes that her love will bear no fruit, she continues to love him. She can't manage to move on and find another man. While Mayama doesn't love her in that sense, Mayama sees Yamada as an important friend, a feeling that Yamada recognizes later on when she cannot return the love of her coworkers, but still thought of them as her precious friends. Mayama's over protectiveness of her causes Yamada to get angry at him whenever he tries to protect her from his former boss, Nomiya. Later in the series, Yamada decides to continue as a graduate student at the art college. Furthermore, she also makes pottery for Fujiwara and Harada Design. It is revealed in author's next manga March Comes in Like a Lion that she is happily married to Nomiya. Secondary characters ; : Portrayed by: Keiji Fujiwara (anime, Japanese), Chris Kent (anime, English), Masato Sakai (movie), Jun Murakami (Japanese TV drama) :: Sh≈´ji is a professor at the college that Morita, Mayama, Takemoto, Yamada, and Hagu attend, serving as the father figure for the group. He is also Hagu's relative (he is her father's cousin; although it is not clarified if he is her father's 1st, 2nd, or 3rd cousin) and the person that Hagu is really closest to, and gets very overprotective of her at times. Sh≈´ji is a close friend of Rika and her late husband, who had been his roommate until Rika and her husband married. Unlike his friends, Sh≈´ji's artistic talent was not remarkably impressive, but found he was good at explaining things like art history and anatomy (subjects which Harada and Rika struggled with) and eventually decided to become a teacher as a result. When Rika's husband died in a traffic accident, he took care of Rika so that she wouldn't try and join her husband in death, but Sh≈´ji begins to wonder if Rika would've been happier if she died alongside her husband. Because of this, Sh≈´ji recommends Mayama as Rika's new assistant; he believed Mayama's companionship would be a healthy change for Rika. Sh≈´ji is a mellow and thoughtful person, partly because he's older and more experienced than other characters. He bears deep feelings for Hagu, always stays by her side and help her. When Hagu got into the accident and may lose her ability to pursue art, he risked everything for her. In one episode, Sh≈´ji is shown sticking his head out of a window after returning most of the money Shinobu tried to give him for Hagu's rehab. Shinobu goads him into clarifying what his feelings for Hagu were. He blushes at this question but boldly shouts, \\"I love her! I really love her a lot\\". Much to his dismay, Ayu appears behind him at that exact moment, who is flustered and shocked with what she had just heard. Hagu chose to be with him even though she's in love with Morita. ; : :: Rika is the founder and manager of Harada Design. She also ran it with her husband until he died in a car accident that happened on the opening night of one of the stores they designed. This accident also left her badly scarred on her back, and has damaged her legs so she is unable to walk for long periods without the help of a cane and medicine. During college, had been known for being a talented artist, but also very cold and aloof. Harada, Rika's eventual husband, befriended her and she began to live in the apartment Harada and Sh≈´ji shared. The three were very close friends and continued to live together until Harada and Rika got married and founded Harada Design. She is from the city of Otaru in Hokkaid≈ç. When Professor Hanamoto believes that his presence will hinder Rika's recovery, he sends Mayama to help her, believing that Mayama would be the least likely to intrude on other people's business. However, as Mayama tends to Rika's injuries, he develops feelings for her. Rika knows that Mayama likes her, but pushes Mayama away because she doesn't want to hurt him. It was unclear whether Rika reciprocates the feelings that Mayama has for her, but later chapters of the manga and the first episodes of the second series seem to imply that she does. Later in the series, it appears that Rika finally opens her heart to Mayama after a shock ending sequence where Mayama's feelings finally flood out. ; : :: Morita's older brother who seems to have a mysterious agenda in earning ridiculously large amounts of money. It is later revealed that he and Morita are working together to buy back his father's company which was purchased by an electrical company when they were kids. Unlike Morita, he is practical-minded and organized. He appears to be one of the few people who can put up with Morita's quirky idiosyncrasies and is able to control Morita to some extent. Kaoru shares a deep relationship with Morita, but sometimes feels envious and inferior towards Morita's talents. ; : :: He, along with Yamazaki and Miwako, is first introduced on episode 14 of season 1. Nomiya is the type of guy who could \\"throw a cellphone in the sea full of women's numbers, without caring at all\\" as said by Mayama. Mayama is somewhat adverse to him, partially because he sees Nomiya as the ideal professional he wants to become and dislikes the comparison and also because of Nomiya's interest in Yamada. Nomiya is Mayama's former boss at Fujiwara Design. He is described as handsome, intelligent and somewhat workaholic. Though he's deemed by Mayama as a playboy, and is actually quite experienced with women, he falls in love with Yamada. He tries to visit her whenever he can, although he is aware of Yamada's feelings for Mayama. Mayama tries to act as the middleman as much as he can in order to protect Yamada, as he doubts the sincerity of Nomiya's feelings. However, Mayama finally gives in, realizing that Nomiya \\"isn't as evil as he thought\\". In another Chica Umino's manga, March Comes in Like a Lion, it's revealed that Nomiya and Yamada married. Minor characters ; : :: Yamazaki is an employee at Fujiwara Design along with Nomiya and Miwako. He is romantically interested in his co-worker Miwako, but so far his love is unrequited. Yamazaki is somewhat shy around women, since he attended an all-boys high school and did not have the opportunity to meet many female students when he studied engineering in college. ; : :: Miwako is another employee at Fujiwara Design along with Nomiya and Yamazaki. She owns a dog named Leader. She enjoys teasing her co-workers to an extreme extent and has been described as someone who takes advantage of others like an old woman would. Miwako is a big fan of Rika's work and also enjoys going to the health spa to relax. ; :: Miwako's dog, seen mostly in her presence. Although essentially a minor character, Leader exceeds his/her minor character colleagues in registering noteworthy impressions by responding when addressed and often remarking on the behavior or accounts of others. ; :: Takemoto's mother. Works as a nurse. She remarried when Takemoto finished junior high school. Like Takemoto, she has a tendency not to ask people for help because she does not want to burden them with her troubles. ; : :: Takemoto's stepfather. He is an affable and loud man, but Takemoto has difficulty getting used to him because of how different Kazuo is from his father. Kazuo often means well, but is not terribly articulate and usually tries to use his actions to express what he means. He and his family accept both Takemoto and his mother as part of their family, though Takemoto still feels as though he does not belong. Because Takemoto and his mother have an unconscious tendency to avoid relying on others, Kazuo is somewhat frustrated that they don't seem to trust that he will help them. He tells them after Takemoto falls ill and is hospitalized before he is able to graduate; Takemoto openly asks if Kazuo would be able to help him with expenditures since Takemoto will need to attend school for another year, which Kazuo happily agrees to. ; : :: Hasegawa occupies room 201 of the apartment that Takemoto, Mayama and Morita currently live in. His floor mates are Takemoto and Morita. After he graduates, he takes over his family's noodle making business and open a restaurant next door to the factory, as well as using his art skills to make pottery to sell at the restaurant. Hasegawa becomes very successful and his restaurant is very popular for tourists and is also mentioned in some guidebooks. ; : :: PA teacher and the professor emeritus of sculpture at the art institute everyone attends, elderly Tange-sensei is a long suffering supervisor to Morita. Recognizing Morita's genius, Tange makes the mistake of taking Morita seriously and constantly finds himself stressed out while trying to control Morita. Tange's greatest desire is to get Morita to finish his graduation project (and with Morita's talent, it means refusing to accept unfinished works) so that he may retire in peace. When Morita is finally completes his graduation project, Tange expresses bittersweet sentiments towards the role of teacher. Despite constantly upsetting Tange, Morita greatly appreciates and respects Tange for all that he has done for Morita in their eight years together. After Morita graduates and then re- enrolls as a third year student, Morita transfers his attention to , the professor emeritus of Classical Japanese painting. ; : :: Another elderly teacher at the art institute that every attends, Sh≈çda is Yamada's supervising instructor and an extremely avid admirer of her work, along with her \\"Iron Lady\\" fans. He is especially impressed with Yamada's graduation project, a beautifully thrown and large bowl, to point of weeping tears of joy and expresses the same reaction when she creates a similar and equally large bowl post-graduation. After Yamada graduates, she decides to continue studying with Sh≈çda as a post-graduate student until she can find a job. ; : ::A well- intentioned senior professor at the art institute that everyone attends and a supervising instructor of Hagu. As an artist, she struggled to become a painter who would be recognized in Paris, but was ultimately unsuccessful. As a result, she does not want Hagu's talents to fall into obscurity and wants Hagu to develop as an artist by experiencing difficult cultures. ; : :: The president of Artcraft, a design company, Mr. Asai is an elderly gentleman about fifty years of age. He is a friend of Rika's and an acquaintance of both Professor Hanamoto and Mayama. After Mayama is hired by Fujiwara Design, Rika works with Asai, who is able to fill the role her husband once did as a social intermediary for her work. However, because of Mr. Asai's age, many of Rika's friends and acquaintances worry that she will not be able to continue depending on Mr. Asai for a long time. ; : :: A largely absent dorm-mate of the others. A burly, large, buff and kind-hearted giant of an individual, 'Lohmeyer-senpai' (as he is yearningly referred to), is a man of men's dreams (Mayama questions his devotion to Rika at one point). He is the series' taboo response to the age-old inquiry that if strong and able men are the source of security to women, then who is the source of security to men? (stronger, bigger and even more able men). He often returns with a substantial amount of meat for the others, an almost symbolic gesture of his manliness and ability to provide. He worked part time as Nyanzaburou the mascot for an amusement park which upped the charts on visitors. Because of his father's condition, he is often away from his apartment, to the misfortune of its male residents.

The bridges carry M-13 and M-84 over the Saginaw River. They are maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation, and the bascule portion is currently the oldest of Bay City's four modern drawbridges. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 30, 1999, but was removed from the Register in 2015. Description Heading east, the East Channel bridge is a fixed metal continuous deck stringer (Multi-Beam) bridge carrying M-13/M-84 from the western shore of the river to Middle Ground Island. The West Channel bridge is a small drawbridge carrying the road from the island to the eastern shore of the river. M-13/M-84 is known as Salzburg Avenue on the west side of the river, and Lafayette Avenue on the east, which is where the bridge's name comes from. The entire structure is 452 feet long, with a bascule span of 185 feet. When the bascule is raised the bridge provides a 150-foot horizontal clearance. Sidewalks of five feet width run down each side. The bridge also has four observation platforms and a bridge tender's house. History The Lafayette Avenue Bridge replaced an earlier bridge built at the same location in 1876. This bridge was condemned in 1934, and a temporary pontoon swing bridge was immediately installed at the site. The City of Bay City began surveying the condition of its bridges in 1936 and developed a plan to replace the Lafayette Avenue Bridge and rehabilitate the Belinda Street and Cass Avenue Bridges. However, funding was scarce as the country was in the midst of the Great Depression, though funding would eventually come through the Public Works Administration, part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. The current Lafayette Avenue Bridge was completed and opened in 1938. It became the city's southernmost bridge over the Saginaw River in 1955 after the removal of the Cass Avenue Bridge. The bridge was extensively rehabilitated in 1987, but still functions in place as originally constructed. The 1987 rehabilitation replaced nearly all the superstructure, substituting welded girders for the original riveted ones. Another extensive rehabilitation project is planned to begin in 2020.

The Liberty Bridge was built to replace the Third Street Bridge, a small swing bridge located just south of the Liberty Bridge connecting Midland and Third Streets. The Third Street Bridge was the first bridge built across the Saginaw River in Bay City. It was originally built as a wooden bridge in 1864 by the Bay City Bridge Company. Its superstructure was reconstructed with iron and steel in 1872. On June 18, 1976, the swing span of the Third Street Bridge collapsed as it was being opened, forcing the bridge out of service permanently. It had been struck by a vessel the evening before. A debate ensued on where to build a replacement bridge. In order to receive federal funding, the new bridge was required to have four lanes and a four- lane bridge at the same site would have necessitated the demolition of some historic buildings. As a result, the Liberty Bridge was built just north of the old bridge site, connecting Woodside Avenue and Vermont Street.

In May 1779, the family moved to Brady's maternal grandfather's home in Cumberland County and stayed there until October 1779. After a harsh winter, Brady spent the ensuing few years working the fields in the area with his brothers, often armed in case of conflict with Native Americans. Brady's mother died in 1783, and his oldest siblings began to marry. Hugh Brady moved with his brother Samuel Brady to Washington County, Pennsylvania. Samuel married and Hugh stayed with his brother until 1792, when he began his military career. =The Brady and Quigley families= Hugh's father, Capt.

Plaque at Middle Spring Pennsylvania Presbyterian Church Rebuilt Middle Spring Pennsylvania Presbyterian Church Little is known of James' wife, Jeanette, except that she was likely of Scottish descent and probably was born in Hopewell Township in 1725. However, according to Brady family historian, Belle Swope, \\"We are assured she was a devoted wife, a loving mother, and a wise counselor, or she would not have given to the world such brave and illustrious children.\\"Swope, p. 140 In 1738 the log Middle Spring Presbyterian Church was erected three miles (5 km) from their homestead, of which James and Jeanette Quigley became faithful members and in which they along with some of their children came to be buried in its old graveyard. James Quigley had to be and was ever vigilant to keep hostile Indians from killing his family and burning his home‚Äìa fate that befell many of his neighbors in those early days on the Pennsylvania frontier. In addition to successfully keeping his home and family safe, on March 25, 1756 James Quigley was commissioned ensign in the Cumberland County Colonial Rangers. He served as a private in the Revolutionary War. He died in 1782.Swope, p.140. They had six children, who were all born on their Hopewell Township homestead, namely, John Quigley, born in August 1731, Samuel Quigley, born in June 1733, Mary Quigley (who was the wife of Major John Brady, Hugh's mother), born August 16, 1735, Agnes Quigley, born in March 1737 or 1738, Martha Quigley, born in July 1741 and Robert Quigley, born in 1744, who married Mary Jacob. Robert Quigley eventually ended up living on the Quigley Homestead, at Quigley Bridge, Hopewell Township, Cumberland County, Pennsylvania. Robert Quigley and Mary Quigley Brady remained very close throughout their lives. =The Bradys= As to the Brady grandparents of General Hugh Brady, Belle Swope states, \\"No family of pioneers was more conspicuous in the early history and settlement of the country than the Bradys.\\" Hugh Brady was born in 1709 in County Cork, Ireland.There is this credible dissenting opinion about the birthplace of Hugh Brady reported on the Rootsweb web page of Brenda Gallagher. \\"I am convinced from deep investigation that Hugh was born in Surrey, London, England. His father, Rev. Nicholas was born in Bandon, Cork, Ireland, but was sent by the church to serve in Stratford-Upon-Avon and later Surrey at Mary Magdaline and St. Catherine Cree Church where he served as well as other assignments in Surrey ending as rector of Clapham Surrey. These assignments were from 1700 until his death May 20, 1726. The early 1700s were his wife Leticia's child bearing years. O'Hart's Irish Pedigrees bears this out, as well as several other sources that Hugh was most likely born in Surrey. He followed his grandfather Major Nicholas' lead and joined the British ARmy and served in the Inniskiller Regiment, mention of which caused some to conclude he was born in Inniskillen. It is suggested by some, and I believe more logically, that when his service was over at about age 24, he left for America and married Hannah McCormick either just before or just after their voyage. There were several Scottish and Irish families on the ship. It is more likely he met her than and there rather than in Scotland.\\" From Richard Brady, e-mail of December 3, 1998. Rootsweb report of Brenda Gallagher Hannah's maiden name was McCormick. She was born on January 3, 1709 in Dublin, Ireland. After immigrating from Ireland, the Bradys first lived in the American colony of Delaware where they were married in 1733. They are said to have moved to frontier Pennsylvania on the urging of prosperous friends who told them that good land was readily available. Hugh and Hannah Brady moved to the Scottish-Irish Presbyterian community on the banks of Conodoguinet creek around 1733, where they established a homestead close to where the Quigleys had already settled. They thereby became near neighbors of and fellow church members with James and Jeanette Quigley. They had nine children, Major John Brady (General Hugh Brady's father), born in 1733 in Delaware, Samuel T. Brady born in 1734, Joseph Brady born in 1735, Hugh Brady born in 1738, William Robert Brady, born in 1740 in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, Margaret Brady born in 1742, Mary Brady born in 1745, Ebenezer Brady born in 1750 and James Brady born in 1753. All of their children, except Major John Brady were likely born in Hopewell Township, Cumberland County, Pennsylvania.Much of the information on the Brady family was unavailable to Belle Swope. So, some of this information is extracted from the reports of other Brady family researchers on Rootsweb to the extent that information appeared credible and often only when several of these sources agreed. Persons concerned with proof of absolute accuracy should view these various reports on Rootsweb to judge their credibility for themselves. Rootsweb reports on Hugh and Hannah Brady family. Hannah Brady died in 1776 in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania. Hugh Brady died on May 26, 1787, also in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania. As are the Quigleys, they are also buried in the Middle Spring Presbyterian Church Cemetery, Cumberland County, Pennsylvania. Military career =Early career= General Anthony Wayne Brady was first inducted into the military with a commission from George Washington as an ensign in General \\"Mad\\" Anthony Wayne's Legion of the United States in March 1792 and placed in a rifle company under the command of Captain John Crawford. By 1794, Brady rose to the rank of lieutenant, and fought with Wayne in the Northwest Indian War. Brady participated in the decisive Battle of Fallen Timbers, which resulted in the Treaty of Greenville.Thwaites, Reuben Gold, ed.

He arrived there, after further stops in Virginia and Kentucky, in 1797. He remained in Sunbury until, during the winter of 1798‚Äì99, he was appointed a captain in the army raised by the administration of President John Adams during the Quasi-War. This army was disbanded a year later, and Brady went about improving a plot of land, with his brother William, about from Pittsburgh along the Mahoning River. Brady married Sarah Wallis and remained on the plot until 1807. =War of 1812= In 1807 Brady moved to Northumberland County, Pennsylvania and remained there until 1812. In July 1812 he received a commission as colonel from President James Madison and once again rejoined the ranks of U.S. military officers. He was given command of the 22nd Infantry Regiment and saw action at the Battle of Chippawa and the Battle of Lundy's Lane, where he was severely wounded.

Brady left Michigan Territorial Capital for Fort Winnebago, near present-day Portage, Wisconsin. Brady was Commandant of the Department of the Upper Great Lakes at the time and was accompanied by one aide. Brady, having seen combat in the 1790s with Wayne and during the War of 1812, was of the opinion that the Sauk could be easily defeated with only a few companies of soldiers. Brady was given command of two companies and set out to rendezvous with General Henry Atkinson, overall commander, in northern Illinois. Much of Brady's overall involvement in this conflict was peripheral. On the afternoon of June 8, 1832, Henry Dodge and his men, including James W. Stephenson, proceeded to Kellogg's Grove and buried the victims of the St. Vrain massacre. That night Stephenson returned to Galena, Illinois, while Dodge moved to Hickory Point where he remained overnight.Stevens, Frank.

Maj. General Hugh Brady, before 1851 Late life and death Five years after the Black Hawk War, in 1837, Brady was given command of Military Department No. 7, headquartered in Detroit. He remained in the position for seven years, during which time he was in command over the removal of several Native American tribes as well as an incident known as the \\"Patriot War\\". When the U.S.-Mexican War broke out, Brady was too old to join the troops in the field but he assisted by helping to raise troops and equipment and shipping it to the war zone. In 1848, three years before his death, Brady was brevetted to the rank of major general. Hugh Brady died, an accidental death, in Detroit on April 15, 1851. Brady was at the helm of a horse-drawn carriage, when the vehicle became entangled in telegraph wires. The wires, lowered for repairs, caused the horses to panic. In the panic, Brady was thrown from the carriage and fatally injured. He died in the presence of his pastor, Dr. (Rev.) George Duffield.

My Pok√©mon Ranch was released via the WiiWare download service on March 25, 2008 in Japan, in the Americas on June 9, 2008 and in Europe on July 4, 2008. Internationally, this game only works with Pok√©mon Diamond and Pearl versions; the Japanese version was updated to receive Pok√©mon from Pok√©mon Platinum. Overview leftMy Pok√©mon Ranch is similar in concept to Pok√©mon Box, and allows players to transfer up to 1,500 of their Pok√©mon (if they have the Platinum update; without it the limit is 1,000) from up to eight separate Pok√©mon Diamond and Pearl Nintendo DS game cards, to a ranch run by Hayley, a friend of Bebe who runs the PC box system in these versions. Here, they can view their Pok√©mon rendered in 3D, while using their Miis to interact with them. Players do not need to own Pok√©mon Diamond, Pearl or Platinum to play My Pok√©mon Ranch. Players with or without the Nintendo DS game will be given six starter Pok√©mon and a new Pok√©mon at the start of each day. Additionally, each day Hayley will give the player requests for certain Pok√©mon not in the player's Pok√©dex to be added to the ranch, along with instructions on where to find them in Diamond, Pearl and Platinum. It has also been confirmed that players can obtain a special Mew and Phione. Hayley can also trade certain Pok√©mon she already has in her possession. Eventually, adding more Pok√©mon to the ranch unlocks new features to the game and expands the ranch. Similar to the actions in the Mii Channel's plaza, the Pok√©mon on the ranch can perform different idle actions, such as talking, playing, and sleeping at other players' ranches. Players are also able to take snapshots of their Pok√©mon and send them to friends registered on their Wii, as well as downloading the photos in .JPG file to an SD card, and transfer them onto your computer or camera. A simple HUD shows the ability to monitor the time and the number of Pok√©mon in the ranch. Apart from storing collected Pok√©mon on the ranch, players are otherwise unable to further train or level up their Pok√©mon on the ranch. Updates On June 18, 2008 an update was made available for the game. Another update was made available on November 5, 2008 in Japan to ensure compatibility with Pok√©mon Platinum and to improve and add some features, such as adding 500 more Pok√©mon, making a total amount of Pok√©mon go up to 1500. =The Pok√©mon= Most notably, as Pok√©mon Platinum essentially introduces 7 new Pok√©mon in the manner of new forms of previous Pok√©mon and these can all be placed in Pok√©mon Ranch and have their forms remain while in the Ranch. However, this will have some effect on Pok√©mon Platinum. =Shaymin= Shaymin's alternate form is activated in a different manner than Giratina's. If the player has the Gracidea in his or her game, the Ranch will recognize it and will unlock the Gracidea as a new toy in the Ranch. Shaymin will normally be Land Forme, however if the player gets the Gracidea and Shaymin touches it, it will transform into its Sky Forme for the duration of the player's Ranch visit. However, if the player removes Shaymin from the Ranch while it is in its Sky Forme, it will revert to Land Forme. =Rotom= In Pok√©mon Platinum, Rotom was given five different forms. Each form represents Rotom possessing a different appliance. They will keep their form upon being transferred to Pok√©mon Ranch. =The Ranch= Various changes have occurred for the Ranch too, most notably, a 26th level of the ranch has been added, allowing you to deposit a total of 1500 Pok√©mon onto the Ranch. This does not give the player any extra rewards though. =Animations & Toys= Also in the Ranch there are twelve more animations that the Pok√©mon will partake in should the screen be left idle. These include water races, wrestling tournaments between the fighting Pok√©mon, fights between Pok√©mon rivals (such as Zangoose vs. Seviper, Dialga vs. Palkia, Darkrai vs. Cresselia, and so forth), and a Rotom animation utilizing all its formes. Eleven new toys have also been added, including the aforementioned Gracidea Flower. =Menu Options= With this update it is possible to change the background music from the default. It is now possible to store up to 30 in the game. It is now also possible to copy and delete photos over to or from the SD card in bulk. =Club Look-see= There have also been some changes in regard to Club Look-see. Previously, you could only visit the NPC member's ranches whenever they visited yours and made an offer for you to go. With the Pok√©mon Platinum update however, the player now has the option of revisiting ranches that were previously visited. This adds more playability as you can check to see their unique Mii's and specific Ranches at any time. The number of Club Look-see members has also been increased from 37 to 40. Reception Overall, the game has received negative reviews, with an aggregate rating of 46 percent at GameRankings. IGN was disappointed in the game and gave it a 4/10, believing the graphics to be ugly, citing \\"absolutely hideous\\" Pok√©mon models, and likening the gameplay to a screensaver, claiming it to be a largely \\"sit-n-stare experience.\\" However, they had some praise for the Nintendo DS connectivity. WiiWare World, who are today known as Nintendo Life, also gave it a 4/10, calling it \\"half-assed\\" and \\"obtuse\\" and particularly noting the flawed nature of the Pok√©mon storage system. While they believed that it was \\"chock full\\" of missed potential, the game was still ideal for younger Pok√©mon fans. The UK's Official Nintendo Magazine gave the game a below-average score of 48%, finding it hard to justify the 1000 Wii Points price, and believing the game only appeals to Pok√©mon completists. Not all reviews were negative, however; Nintendo Power gave it a \\"Recommended\\" when they reviewed it.

As a nurse in the Union army she worked closely with Mary Ann Bickerdyke treating the sick and injured near Fort Donelson, and was nicknamed the \\"Cairo Angel\\" for her service in Cairo, Illinois. After the war she became one of the first female gynecologists in the United States and was the first woman to perform an ovariotomy. She later taught at Boston University, and was one of the first women elected to the Boston School Committee.  Early life  Mary Jane Safford was born in Hyde Park, Vermont, the youngest of five children of Joseph Safford, a farmer, and Diantha Little Safford. She attended schools in Vermont, Illinois, and Montreal, Quebec. She then returned to Illinois, where she lived with her older brother and taught in a public school in Shawneetown.  Medical career  Mary Jane Safford At the start of the Civil War in 1861, Safford volunteered as a relief worker in Cairo, Illinois, where she became known as the \\"Cairo Angel\\". It was there that she met \\"Mother\\" Bickerdyke, who trained her as a nurse. In 1862, she accompanied the army of Ulysses S. Grant during the Battle of Shiloh, where she comforted and ministered to the wounded. Later, she served aboard a pair of military hospital ships on the Mississippi, the City of Memphis and the Hazel Dell. \\"Worn down\\" and frail, she left for Europe in July 1862.

While studying at Heidelberg, she befriended Isabel Chapin Barrows, the first American woman ophthalmologist. In 1872, Safford opened a private practice in Chicago, becoming one of the first female gynecologists in the United States. She developed a plan for mass housing centered on a common service area for cooperative housekeeping to reduce drudgery for women. Later, she became Professor of Women's Diseases at the Boston University School of Medicine, where she was one of only two professors of gynecology. In 1875 she was one of the first women to be elected to the Boston School Committee. As a physician in Boston's South End, Safford specialized in the care of impoverished inner-city women and girls--mostly immigrants from the North, South, and West Ends and the South Bay area. Her Boston home was located at 5 Percival Street on Meeting House Hill in Dorchester.  Personal life  Safford married James Blake in 1872 and adopted two daughters, Margarita and Gladys. After her marriage, she used the name Mary Jane Safford-Blake. The couple divorced in 1880.

Plot After being blinded in a horse riding accident, Sarah (Mia Farrow) visits her uncle's stately home. Out on a date with her boyfriend, Steve (Norman Eshley), she escapes the fate of her relatives (Dorothy Alison, Robin Bailey, and Diane Grayson), who are murdered at their home, along with the gardener, by a psychotic killer. Sarah returns from her date and spends the night in the house, unaware that three of her family members' corpses are strewn about the house. Sarah eventually discovers the bodies. She also discovers a bracelet containing an engraved name on it, which she correctly assumes belongs to the killer. The killer returns ‚Äì his face is only shown to the audience in the film‚Äôs last scene, otherwise he is only shown from the knees down, wearing jeans and distinctive leather boots ‚Äì to search for the lost bracelet. He discovers Sarah, who manages to flee on horseback. Sarah encounters a family of gypsies and shows them the bracelet. They see the name \\"Jack\\" inscribed on it, leading Tom (Michael Elphick), the head of the family, to conclude his brother, Jack, must be responsible, as he dated one of the murdered women from the estate. In an effort to save Jack, Tom pretends to take Sarah to the police but, instead, locks her in a secluded shed. His plan is to then round up the family and flee the area. Sarah escapes from the shed and is found by Steve, out searching for her. She tells him all she knows. Steve and his men leave Sarah at his house to recuperate and begin a search for the killer, who they assume is a gypsy. They come across the two gypsy brothers and are about to assault them when a frantic Jack explains that his brother suspected him of being the killer because of the name on the bracelet. However Jack insists he had nothing to do with it. They look at the bracelet again and see the name on it is actually \\"Jacko\\". Steve, upon learning the killer's real name, hurries away with his men. Back at his house it is revealed that one of Steve's workers, left behind to guard Sarah, is Jacko (Paul Nicholas). The killer, still searching for his lost bracelet, is stealthily going through the pockets of Sarah's clothes, left beside the tub while she is taking a bath. When she reaches for a towel she touches his hand. Both are momentarily startled, then Jacko attempts to drown Sarah in the bath. Just when it seems he has succeeded, Steve races in, just in time to save her. Cast Production =Development= Interviewed in 1997, writer Brian Clemens recalled that he wrote the script 'on spec' and Columbia Pictures told him: \\"'Well, if Mia Farrow plays the lead, we'll buy it,' and she read it and liked it, and so they bought it and we shot it.'\\" The film was a co-production between the United Kingdom and the United States. =Filming= Filming took place in Berkshire, England, with a mainly British cast and crew. Reception and criticism Its theatrical release in the United States was 'a box office disappointment' and reviews were 'generally mixed'. The New York Times wrote: > \\"See No Evil has its share of thrills.

Screenwriter Brian Clemens was nominated for an Edgar Allan Poe Award. Later reviewers have described the film as a 'creepy, atmospheric thriller', in the style of Terence Young's 1967 film Wait Until Dark, while critic John Derry highlights the way Mia Farrow is presented 'from the first moment' as 'the obvious victim'.

The boat has been restored and drydocked, and now houses exhibits about the Missouri River and local tourism information. The museum is a facility of the Sioux City Public Museum. She was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1989. Description and history Sergeant Floyd is located in a drydock in Larsen Park, on the waterfront of the Missouri River just north of the Sioux City Marina. She is a steel-hulled craft with a superstructure of wood and steel. She has a total length of , a beam of , and a hold depth of . When fully loaded, she had a draft of . Her hull has a sharp prow, and has both longitudinal and transverse bulkheads. She has a hogging frame, which provides additional reinforcement in the event of running aground. The superstructure has three levels, providing crew quarters and the operating spaces of the vessel. In 1937 she underwent alterations to address vibrations in her hull, and in 1962-63 her engines were upgraded. She was built in 1932 at the Howardville Shipyard in Jeffersonville, Indiana, and was delivered to the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Kansas City District. Her early service was as a support vehicle, moving men, equipment, and supplies throughout the district, and conducting inspection voyages. She remained in active service until 1975, when Congress authorized her to be remodeled for use as a USACE museum ship. She served in this role first as a traveling exhibit, and then berthed at St. Louis, Missouri until 1982, when she was given to the city of Sioux City, Iowa.

S. Shrikhande in 1959.. It is a strongly regular graph with 16 vertices and 48 edges, with each vertex having degree 6\\\\. Every pair of nodes has exactly two other neighbors in common, whether the pair of nodes is connected or not. Construction The Shrikhande graph can be constructed as a Cayley graph. The vertex set is \\\\mathbb{Z}_4 \\\\times \\\\mathbb{Z}_4. Two vertices are adjacent if and only if the difference is in \\\\\\\\{\\\\pm( 1,0),\\\\pm(0,1),\\\\pm (1,1)\\\\\\\\}. Properties In the Shrikhande graph, any two vertices I and J have two distinct neighbors in common (excluding the two vertices I and J themselves), which holds true whether or not I is adjacent to J. In other words, it is strongly regular and its parameters are: {16,6,2,2}, i.e., \\\\lambda = \\\\mu = 2. This equality implies that the graph is associated with a symmetric BIBD. The Shrikhande graph shares these parameters with exactly one other graph, the 4√ó4 rook's graph, i.e., the line graph L(K4,4) of the complete bipartite graph K4,4. The latter graph is the only line graph L(Kn,n) for which the strong regularity parameters do not determine that graph uniquely but are shared with a different graph, namely the Shrikhande graph (which is not a rook's graph).. The Shrikhande graph is locally hexagonal; that is, the neighbors of each vertex form a cycle of six vertices. As with any locally cyclic graph, the Shrikhande graph is the 1-skeleton of a Whitney triangulation of some surface; in the case of the Shrikhande graph, this surface is a torus in which each vertex is surrounded by six triangles.Brouwer, A. E. Shrikhande graph. Thus, the Shrikhande graph is a toroidal graph. The embedding forms a regular map in the torus, with 32 triangular faces. The skeleton of the dual of this map (as embedded in the torus) is the Dyck graph, a cubic symmetric graph. The Shrikhande graph is not a distance-transitive graph. It is the smallest distance-regular graph that is not distance-transitive.. The automorphism group of the Shrikhande graph is of order 192. It acts transitively on the vertices, on the edges and on the arcs of the graph. Therefore, the Shrikhande graph is a symmetric graph. The characteristic polynomial of the Shrikhande graph is : (x-6)(x-2)^6(x+2)^9. Therefore, the Shrikhande graph is an integral graph: its spectrum consists entirely of integers.

The name is derived from shotgun sequencing of DNA which is itself named after the rapidly expanding, quasi-random firing pattern of a shotgun. The most common method of shotgun proteomics starts with the proteins in the mixture being digested and the resulting peptides are separated by liquid chromatography. Tandem mass spectrometry is then used to identify the peptides. Targeted proteomics using SRM and data-independent acquisition methods are often considered alternatives to shotgun proteomics in the field of bottom-up proteomics. While shotgun proteomics uses data-dependent selection of precursor ions to generate fragment ion scans, the aforementioned methods use a deterministic method for acquisition of fragment ion scans. History Shotgun proteomics arose from the difficulties of using previous technologies to separate complex mixtures. In 1975, two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) was described by O‚ÄôFarrell and Klose with the ability to resolve complex protein mixtures. The development of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI), electrospray ionization (ESI), and database searching continued to grow the field of proteomics. However these methods still had difficulty identifying and separating low-abundance proteins, aberrant proteins, and membrane proteins. Shotgun proteomics emerged as a method that could resolve even these proteins.  Advantages  Shotgun proteomics allows global protein identification as well as the ability to systematically profile dynamic proteomes. It also avoids the modest separation efficiency and poor mass spectral sensitivity associated with intact protein analysis.  Disadvantages  The dynamic exclusion filtering that is often used in shotgun proteomics maximizes the number of identified proteins at the expense of random sampling. This problem may be exacerbated by the undersampling inherent in shotgun proteomics. Agilent 1200 HPLC Quadrupole Time-Of-Flight tandem Mass Spectrometer (Q-TOF)  Workflow  Cells containing the protein complement desired are grown. Proteins are then extracted from the mixture and digested with a protease to produce a peptide mixture. The peptide mixture is then loaded directly onto a microcapillary column and the peptides are separated by hydrophobicity and charge. As the peptides elute from the column, they are ionized and separated by m/z in the first stage of tandem mass spectrometry. The selected ions undergo collision-induced dissociation or other process to induce fragmentation. The charged fragments are separated in the second stage of tandem mass spectrometry. The \\"fingerprint\\" of each peptide's fragmentation mass spectrum is used to identify the protein from which they derive by searching against a sequence database with commercially available software (e.g. SEQUEST or MASCOT). Examples of sequence databases are the Genpept database or the PIR database. After the database search, each peptide-spectrum match (PSM) needs to be evaluated for validity. This analysis allows researchers to profile various biological systems.  Issues with peptide identification  Peptides that are degenerate (shared by two or more proteins in the database) may make it difficult to identify the protein to which they belong. Additionally, some proteome samples of vertebrates have a large number of paralogs. Finally, alternative splicing in higher eukaryotes can result in many identical protein subsequences.  Practical applications With the human genome sequenced, the next step is the verification and functional annotation of all predicted genes and their protein products. Shotgun proteomics can be used for functional classification or comparative analysis of these protein products. It can be used in projects ranging from large-scale whole proteome to focusing on a single protein family. It can be done in research labs or commercially. =Large-scale analysis= One example of this is a study by Washburn, Wolters, & Yates in which they used shotgun proteomics on the proteome of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain grown to mid-log phase. They were able to detect and identify 1,484 proteins as well as identify proteins rarely seen in proteome analysis, including low-abundance proteins like transcription factors and protein kinases. They were also able to identify 131 proteins with three or more predicted transmembrane domains. =Protein family= Vaisar et al. uses shotgun proteomics to implicate protease inhibition and complement activation in the antiinflammatory properties of high-density lipoprotein. In a study by Lee et al., higher expression level of hnRNP A2/B1 and Hsp90 were observed in human hepatoma HepG2 cells than in wild type cells. This led to a search for reported functional roles mediated in concert by both these multifunctional cellular chaperones.

Other features included a solid alder or ash body, a 1-piece maple neck with rosewood or maple fingerboard, adjustable Lace Sensor Precision and Jazz pickups, Schaller deluxe die-cast tuning machines, 3-ply black, parchment or 4-ply brown tortoise shell pickguard, Schaller Elite fine-tuning bridge, 3-way toggle pickup switch, master volume, series/parallel push-push button for the neck pickup and master TBX tone. It was discontinued in 1993. The Precision Bass Plus Deluxe does not have a pick-guard. The Plus Deluxes also have active EQ, so there will be a battery as well. The jack will be on the lower bout, not on the pick-guard. This is the forerunner of today's American Deluxe Precision which replaced it in the line-up in July 1995. The Plus and the Plus Deluxe shared premium Schaller manufactured hardware similar to the Elite versions that came out during the waning days of Fullerton except for the 5 string versions which got Gotoh bridges instead of Schaller. The Precision Plus and Plus Deluxe were the creation of George Blanda who also designed Plus versions of the Jazz Bass. Blanda was the senior designer at Fender during this period and did some rather drastic mods on the instruments to compete with other high end designs from other companies. The Blanda redesigns were more innovative than anything Fender had done since the 1957 P-Bass and the 1960 introduction of the \\"Deluxe\\" Bass which we now know as the Jazz Bass. The Elite basses of the early 80's were super high quality versions too, but the basic design of the instruments were unaltered on any Elite series. The Plus was a new design. These Blanda Plus designs are sometimes called \\"Boner Basses\\" because of the longer horns required to get good balance due to the 22 fret necks. Besides the missing pick-guard, the Precision Plus Deluxe will have a slightly smaller body than the Plus version also. Fender used select woods on both Plus versions too. \\"I hardly ever see one of either version come up for sale. If you can find one in original condition you should seriously consider it as it is a playable collectible. They traditionally have exceeded the appreciation in actual value over any other Fender basses of the period.\\" brotherdave on http://forums.fender.com/viewtopic.php?t=29416 Precision Bass Plus Deluxe This bass features the same specifications as the Precision Bass Plus, but has a downsized body shape, rear-routed controls, side-mounted jack socket and a Kubicki-designed 2-band active EQ with separate stacked control pots for master volume, pickup pan, treble and bass.

The name literally means \\"where man communes with God\\". Based on Cao ƒê√†i Law, the Cao ƒê√†i Church consists of three branches: #C·ª≠u Tr√πng ƒê√†i (the Executive Branch) or (the Branch of Body), led by Gi√°o T√¥ng (Pope of the Caoddaiist Church). #Hi·ªáp Thi√™n ƒê√†i (the Legislative Branch) or (the Branch of Mind), headed by H·ªô Ph√°p (Cardinals of the Caoddaiist Church). #B√°t Qu√°i ƒê√†i (the Spiritual Branch) or (the Branch of Soul), reigned by God. Theoretically, these branches are mutually run so as to produce the maximum religious power. In reality, nevertheless, only C·ª≠u Tr√πng ƒê√†i and Hi·ªáp Thi√™n ƒê√†i can launch secular or religious activities, so all Cao ƒê√†i dignitaries work for or in these two branches. More characterized by spiritual features, B√°t Qu√°i ƒê√†i is where God reigns. Hierarchy It is stipulated by the Constitution of Hi·ªáp Thi√™n ƒê√†i that the top-ranking dignitary be H·ªô Ph√°p, assisted by Th∆∞·ª£ng Sanh and Th∆∞·ª£ng Ph·∫©m. H·ªô Ph√°p, h∆∞·ª£ng Sanh and Th∆∞·ª£ng Ph·∫©m also lead three divisions each of which includes four other dignitaries called Th·ªùi Qu√¢n as follows. *H·ªô Ph√°p ‚Äì B·∫£o Ph√°p ‚Äì Hi·∫øn Ph√°p ‚Äì Khai Ph√°p ‚Äì Ti·∫øp Ph√°p *Th∆∞·ª£ng Ph·∫©m - B·∫£o ƒê·∫°o ‚Äì Hi·∫øn ƒê·∫°o ‚Äì Khai ƒê·∫°o ‚Äì Ti·∫øp ƒê·∫°o *Th∆∞·ª£ng Sanh - B·∫£o Th·∫ø ‚Äì Hi·∫øn Th·∫ø ‚Äì Khai Th·∫ø ‚Äì Ti·∫øp Th·∫ø Directly under those are the lower-ranking dignitaries: #Ti·∫øp D·∫´n ƒê·∫°o Nh∆°n #Ch∆∞·ªüng ·∫§n #C·∫£i Tr·∫°ng #Gi√°o ƒê·∫°o #Th·ª´a S·ª≠ #Truy·ªÅn Tr·∫°ng #Sƒ© T·∫£i #Lu·∫≠t S·ª± It is imperative that an adherent pass a qualifying examination to become a Lu·∫≠t S·ª±. Then, with enough required experience, he or she will be promoted to the next rank. Unlike C·ª≠u Tr√πng ƒê√†i, where an adherent can be promoted to as high as Gi√°o T√¥ng, Hi·ªáp Thi√™n ƒê√†i only allows believers to achieve the ranks of Th·ªùi Qu√¢n. After H·ªô Ph√°p Ph·∫°m C√¥ng T·∫Øc, Th∆∞·ª£ng Ph·∫©m Cao Qu·ª≥nh C∆∞ and Th∆∞·ª£ng Sanh Cao Ho√†i Sang, there are no replacements designed. Hi·ªáp Thi√™n ƒê√†i‚Äôs religious functions Hi·ªáp Thi√™n ƒê√†i is the body which can: *establish, monitor and modify the Cao ƒê√†i legislations. *set up the religious courts of appeals. *qualify an applicant to get a higher rankexo. *interrogate the religious law violators. *offer training sessions in Cao ƒê√†i laws. *operate foreign missionary. *manage the Meditation Houses. *hold spiritual sessions to communicate with heaven. Exoteric sense Cao ƒê√†i originates in the spirit communication between man and spiritual beings. At the beginning, it was the dignitaries in Hi·ªáp Thi√™n ƒê√†i, also appointed mediums by God, who received the spirit messages from heaven. Consequently, all of the scriptures as well as Cao ƒê√†i Law come from Hi·ªáp Thi√™n ƒê√†i. Playing an important role in the establishment or modification of other Cao ƒê√†i laws, Hi·ªáp Thi√™n ƒê√†i is very important in Cao ƒê√†i Church, like the brain in a human body. Esoteric sense Caodaiists are taught that everything in Cao ƒê√†i contains a method of esoteric practices. As a result, the structure and organization of Cao Dai Church is not an exception. According to Cao ƒê√†i scriptures, C·ª≠u Tr√πng ƒê√†i represents the body of an individual. Also, Hi·ªáp Thi√™n ƒê√†i symbolizes the mind, and B√°t Qu√°i ƒê√†i the soul. To survive, an individual has to possess all of these parts. Appropriately collaborating, these will give the individual good health and intelligence. Especially, practicing at the utmost level, that individual can reach the status of enlightenment which Caodaiists call ‚Äúuniting with God‚Äù. That will be the groundwork for Caodaiists to find the way out of the miserable recycle of birth and death. It is believed by Caodaiists that the statues of H·ªô Ph√°p, Th∆∞·ª£ng Sanh and Th∆∞·ª£ng Ph·∫©m on the Seven-Snake Head- Pedestal inside the T√¢y Ninh Holy See contain metaphoric details of one of the practices that help them to rejoin God the Father in Heaven.

The frequency is currently home to the area's first Alternative format, which is also broadcast on translator W277CH at 103.3. FM Translator WRKO relays its signal to an FM translator in order to provide better coverage, with better sound. It also provides listeners the ability to listen on FM. History WKRO was assigned the AM frequency of 1490 by the Federal Communications Commission in late 1941 and began broadcasting with a power of 250 watts in February 1942. According to Broadcasting Yearbook, the station raised its daytime power to 1000 watts around 1975. The original station owner was Oscar Hirsch. Hirsch had previously started KFVS Radio in Cape Girardeau in the 1920s and expanded his broadcast group in the 1940s to also include radio stations in Sparta, Illinois (WHCO), Flat River, Missouri (KFMO) and Sikeston, Missouri (KSIM). By the mid-1950s, Hirsch expanded into the fledgling television industry with the formation of KFVS-TV in Cape Girardeau, Missouri. The Hirsch family operated WKRO until 1984, when the station was sold to a local funeral director, William T. \\"Bill\\" Crain. Crain operated WKRO for close to ten years. During the 1990s, WKRO was owned and operated by a succession of short lived owners, including Roger Price, Sr. and Dan Moeller. Eventually, in an unusual arrangement for a commercial broadcast license, the station was briefly operated by Alexander County and overseen by the county commissioners before the final license holder, Stratemeyer Media, based in nearby Metropolis, Illinois, took over operations and programming of the station. For much of its existence, WKRO broadcast a \\"block format\\" featuring different genres of music throughout the day and evening ‚Äì such as country, adult contemporary and urban ‚Äì interspersed with frequent news and information segments. The most notable were the longstanding \\"10 O'Clock Local News\\", broadcast every morning at 10:00 a.m.; \\"In Memoriam\\", a daily report of local obituaries; \\"Moments with the Master\\", a daily devotional with local pastor Dr. Larry Potts; and, \\"The Ilmoky Phone Quiz\\", a daily quiz show where listeners were called at random and asked to answer a trivia question for cash prizes. WKRO was a longtime affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals Radio Network and broadcast an extensive schedule of local high school football and basketball games each season.

The skilled linguist may have been the first news correspondent in English-language journalism. As the first Speaker of the Virginia General Assembly, Pory established parliamentary procedures for that legislative body still in use today (although members now elect their Speaker). Early life and education Pory was educated at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge; he earned his bachelor's degree in 1592 and his Masters in 1595.. Politician and traveler Elected a member of Parliament from the borough of Bridgwater in 1605, Pory served until 1610. In 1607 Pory traveled through France and the Low Countries, and was involved in a plan to introduce silkworm breeding to England. He spent the years 1611‚Äì1616 travelling through Europe, to Italy and as far as Istanbul, where Pory was the secretary of English ambassador Sir Paul Pindar. For a portion of 1617 Pory served as the secretary to the English ambassador to Savoy, Sir Isaac Wake. In 1619, Pory travelled to the barely decade old English colony in Virginia as secretary to the new governor, Sir George Yeardley. On July 30, 1619, Gov. Yeardley convened what would be the first session of the Virginia General Assembly in Jamestown, after he and Pory agreed upon an agenda and convened to burgesses from each town. Yeardley also appointed Pory Speaker, and Pory acted as the convocation's secretary, appointing committees to study important questions and report back, as well as establishing rules modeled on those in Parliament. Pory would spend the years 1619‚Äì1621 and 1623‚Äì1624 in Virginia. He explored Chesapeake Bay by boat in 1620, but in 1624 returned to England and settled in London permanently. He would later publish significant narratives about the Jamestown colony in Virginia,. and the Plymouth Colony in Massachusetts. Early in his career, around 1597, Pory became an associate and prot√©g√© of the geographer and author Richard Hakluyt; Hakluyt later termed Pory his \\"very honest, industrious, and learned friend\\". Pory was also a friend of Sir Robert Cotton, William Camden, Sir Dudley Carleton, and other members their circles. It was at Hakluyt's urging that Pory engaged in his first literary effort, a translation of a geographic work by Leo Africanus that was published as A Geographical Historie of Africa (1600).; reprinted as , 3 vols. News In London from the early 1620s on, Pory helped Nathaniel Butter, who was creating news periodicals for the English public.. Headquartered at Butter's shop at the sign of the Pied Bull, Pory was a \\"correspondent\\" in the literal sense, who maintained exchanges of letters with the wide variety of prominent people he had met and cultivated in his earlier public career. Other similarly-situated men of his generation, like John Chamberlain, played comparable roles in such correspondences and exchanges of news; Pory was atypical and perhaps unique in that he channelled his knowledge and contacts into commercial news ventures, Butter's early newspapers. Pory also ran his own manuscript news service, charging patrons for regular news reports; Viscount Scudamore paid Pory ¬£20 for an annual subscription of weekly bulletins for the year 1632.. In some respects, Pory was the first to do what many modern public figures do, moving among official posts, journalism, and positions in the private sector. He accumulated a wide range of acquaintances with people in a range of positions and locations, and maintained a vigorous letter-writing correspondence with influential people during his later years.. However, contemporaries described him as being addicted to both gossip and alcohol. Influences and connections Modern scholars who have studied Pory's published works and his correspondence have unearthed a range of linkages with important figures of his era, like John Donne. and John Milton.. Shakespeare may have borrowed from Pory's book on Africa for his Othello;. For the text apparently relied on by Shakespeare from Pory's book, see . Ben Jonson used it for The Masque of Blackness. Pory's extant correspondence provides researchers with a wealth of detail about London and Court society in the period. He describes, among other things, the last hours of Sir Walter Raleigh, and brawls between nobles at the Blackfriars Theatre.

He was trained in the final phase of Netherlandish illuminated manuscript painting, in which his father Gerard was an important figure, and was the founding painter of the long and distinct English tradition of portrait miniature painting. He has been suggested as the Master of the Cast Shadow Workshop, who produced royal portraits on panel in the 1520s or 1530s. Life and family Horenbout was born in Ghent, where he trained with his father, Gerard Horenbout, becoming a Master of the local Guild of Saint Luke in 1512. Gerard was an important Flemish manuscript illuminator in the dying days of that art-form, who had been court painter, from 1515 to about 1522, to Margaret of Austria, Regent of the Netherlands. Margaret was twice sister-in-law to Catherine of Aragon, still Henry's (first) Queen when the Horenbouts came to England.Margaret was the widow of Catherine's brother Juan, Prince of Asturias. Margaret's brother Philip the Handsome had married Catherine's sister. Both were aunts of the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V Gerard is sometimes identified with the \\"Master of James IV of Scotland\\", one of the many artistic personalities identified as a significant illuminator in the Ghent-Bruges school of the period, to whom no historical person can be attached.Richard Gay and T Kren in T Kren & S McKendrick (eds), Illuminating the Renaissance: The Triumph of Flemish Manuscript Painting in Europe,pp. 427-431 & passim, Getty Museum/Royal Academy of Arts, 2003, Horenbout came over to England at an unknown date with, or perhaps before, his sister Susannah Hornebolt and his father.possibly as early as 1522, says Reynolds, op cit It has been suggested that their move was in connection with an attempt by the King, or possibly Cardinal Wolsey, to revive English manuscript illumination by establishing a workshop in London, but this is controversial.T Kren & S McKendrick, op cit, pp. 427-8 His father Gerard is first recorded in England in 1528, and later returned to the Continent, probably after 1531; he had died in Ghent by 1540. Susanna, who was also an illuminator, is recorded in 1529 as married to a John Palmer and in England.Reynolds (2006):45 Lucas is documented in England from September 1525, when he was first paid by the King as \\"pictor maker\\". By 1531 he was described as the \\"King's Painter\\", and this appointment was confirmed for life in June 1534, when he became a \\"denizen\\" - effectively a naturalised citizen. Horenbout was very well paid, at sixty-two pounds and ten shillings (but only thirty-three pounds and six shillings according to Richard Gay) per year, a \\"huge\\" sum according to Strong,Strong 1983a, p. 34; although Gay in Kren:434 says only ¬£33 6s and better than Holbein's thirty pounds a year in his period as Henry's court painter.Gay op cit, p.434 He was granted a \\"tenement\\" in Charing Cross, and permitted to take on four foreign journeyman. Lucas died in London, and was buried at Saint Martin in the Fields and left a wife and daughter, Margaret and Jacquemine. Margaret was paid sixty shillings three years later by Queen Catherine Parr for some paintings.Gay op cit, p.434 Work Hans Holbein the Younger, 1543, Horenbout copied a self-portrait drawing. He can be said to be the founder of the English school of portrait miniature painting, which begins suddenly at the time of his arrival in England, and had very few continental precedents, although three lost miniatures, possibly by Jean Clouet, sent from the French to the English court, may have inspired the new form.Strong, 1983a, p.34 Horenbout later taught the art of illumination to Hans Holbein the Younger, also a court artist of Henry, at least according to Karel van Mander who refers to a \\"Lucas\\", assumed to be Horenbout. However, this has been doubted.Rowlands, 88‚Äì90. Karel van Mander wrote in the early 17th century that \\"Lucas\\" taught Holbein illumination, but art historian John Rowlands downplays Horenbout's influence on Holbein's miniatures, which he believes follow the techniques of Jean Clouet and the French school. Twenty-three surviving portrait miniatures have usually been attributed to Horenbout in recent decades; all but one, a portrait of Holbein, are of members of the English or other royal families. Paintings of at least four of Henry's Queens are attributed to him. A high proportion of those capable of being dated come from the 1520s.Gay op cit, p.434 Horenbout's miniature of Holbein (1543) is among his most accomplished works, not least because he copies the face from a self-portrait drawing by Holbein; his own drawing skills are not the strongest.Reynolds (1980) pp.33-39. The drawing is in the Uffizi image - \\"much retouched\\" and not universally accepted as an original Holbein (Reynolds (1980):38 & passim) This miniature was also nearly always regarded as a self-portrait, until recent technical examination made clear that the style of painting is actually very different from that of undoubted Holbein miniatures: there is \\"an absence of his subtle gradations of flesh tone and colour\\" and \\"no sign of the extremely thin pen-like lines which are so notable a feature in Holbein's drawing of such details as the embroidered edges of costume\\".Reynolds,1980:38 There are two versions attributed to Horenbout, of which the better is in the Wallace CollectionThe other is owned by the Duke of Buccleuch It may be a memorial portrait, painted in the six months interval between the death of Holbein and that of Horenbout.Reynolds (1980):38 He is recorded as working in other forms, probably including panel paintings, woodcuts and decorations for festivities, but there are no certain survivals from these, except for illuminations on documents.Gay op cit, p.434 Roy Strong linked Horenbout with an artist known only as the Master of the \\"Cast Shadow Workshop\\", who produced a series of rather undistinguished portraits mostly of English monarchs past and present, presumably working for the King.Strong 1983b:42‚Äì44 Illuminated decorations on some charters, Acts and similar royal documents are also attributed to him,Strong 1983a:34 and an illuminated manuscript with two elaborate full-page miniatures at Hatfield House has been attributed to him or his sister. More tentatively, some illuminations from the major Sforza Hours have been attributed to one of the two.Gay op cit,No. 132, p.434-5 Unlike that of Levina Teerlinc a generation later, Susanna's oeuvre, and that of another brother, remains obscure, although Albrecht D√ºrer records buying a miniature by her in Antwerp in May 1521. Fine illuminations in a collection of works by John Lydgate (British Library) and the Letters Patent for Cardinal College (Public Record Office), Cardinal Wolsey's foundation in Oxford, renamed Christ Church after his fall, are attributed to one or more of Gerard, Lucas and Susanna, without specifying which one or ones.T Kren & S McKendrick op cit,Nos. 130 & 131, p.431-3 Gallery Image:Horenbout Catherine of Aragon with a monkey.jpgCatherine of Aragon with a monkey, 1525‚Äì26 Image:Horenbout Catherine of Aragon.jpgCatherine of Aragon, 1525‚Äì26 Image:Horenbout HenryFitzRoy.jpgHenry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Richmond and Somerset, Henry VIII's illegitimate son, 1534-5 Image:Horenbout Jane Seymour.jpgJane Seymour, 1536‚Äì37 See also *Artists of the Tudor court Notes References *T Kren & S McKendrick (eds),Illuminating the Renaissance: The Triumph of Flemish Manuscript Painting in Europe, Getty Museum/Royal Academy of Arts, 2003, * Strong, Roy: Artists of the Tudor Court: The Portrait Miniature Rediscovered 1520-1620, Victoria & Albert Museum exhibit catalogue, 1983, (1983a) (includes twenty works attributed to Horenbout or the Cast Shadow Workshop). * Strong, Roy: The English Renaissance Miniature, Thames and Hudson, 1983, (1983b) *Reynolds, Graham, Wallace Collection, Catalogue of Miniatures, 1980, Wallace Collection, London (1980) *Reynolds, Graham ; The Sixteenth and Seventeenth- Century Miniatures in the Collection of Her Majesty The Queen, Royal Collection Publications Ltd; 2006; (2006) *Rowlands, John.

This information has been categorized into the books the characters were first introduced, in order of appearance. Because several of the characters exist in multiple books, this list will stick to an introduction of the characters, rather than give too much revealing detail about their actions and/or fate.  Book 1 - Fablehaven  The stories of the Fablehaven series are revealed to us through the personal experience of Kendra and Seth Sorenson, who are the main characters of the novels. = Major characters = Kendra Sorenson Kendra Sorenson, a typical 13-year-old girl, is not at all enthusiastic to go on a mandatory vacation to her grandparents place, while her parents are on a 17-day cruise. However, it is here at Fablehaven, the magical preserve her grandparents oversee, she becomes immersed in a whole new world full of fairies and other mystical creatures hidden to most other eyes. She is described as a good student who rarely takes risks, overly cautious and far from the adventurer and rule breaker that her brother is. But when she is in Fablehaven, it doesn't take long for trouble to find her, as the evil witch Muriel Taggert releases a powerful demon named Bahumat. The situation becomes desperate when everyone but her is captured and she must risk her own life to seek the Fairy Queen for help. As a result of her heart-felt supplication to the Fairy Queen, she becomes fairykind, a status which gives her certain magical abilities to aid her in her subsequent adventures. Seth Sorenson Seth Sorenson is Kendra's younger brother, who starts the series at age 11. He has a much more outgoing, risky, curious, and adventurous personality. Seth has great courage, almost too much! However, he has little patience, and he doesn't always think things through. Because of this, he tends to be the source of mischief as the story continues. After learning many lessons the hard way, he eventually becomes more responsible and succeeds in overcoming many obstacles. His efforts against dark forces eventually mark him with the powers of a shadow charmer that, like his sister with her fairykind abilities, he is able to use through the series to successfully complete nearly impossible tasks. Stan Sorenson Stan Sorenson is Kendra and Seth's grandfather on their father's side. He and his wife Ruth have not been a large part of the lives of their grandchildren until Fablehaven. He is the caretaker of Fablehaven. Grandpa Sorenson leaves clues about the true nature of the preserve, in hopes that Kendra and Seth will discover the truth that it is a preserve for magical creatures. He is a strict rule enforcer, though Seth still finds ways to get around them. He lives on Fablehaven with his wife knowing that it is dangerous, but he is capable. However, bad things happen, and in the first book he is captured by a witch who is endeavoring to free a demon named Bahumat. Ruth Sorenson Ruth Sorenson is Stan's wife, and Kendra and Seth's grandmother. She used to teach college history, and is an expert masseuse. She is missing from the first part of book one, and Stan explains that she is away visiting a relative. But she turns out to be the pet chicken living in the house named \\"Goldilocks\\". When Kendra and Seth discover the chicken is their grandmother, they seek the witch's help to change her back. After she is restored, she explained later that she had previously lost a confrontation with a Jinn, who turned her into the chicken. Ruth leads the assault on Muriel at the Forgotten Chapel, in hopes to stop her attempts to free Bahumat and release Stan and Lena. She fails, then is captured leaving Kendra alone to save them. Dale Burgess Dale is the grounds keeper at Fablehaven. He is a quiet, reserved man who helps Stan Sorenson out with chores and general upkeep of the preserve. Kendra spotted him giving the magical milk to the fairies, and he attempts to mislead her into believing it was not for human consumption. It is revealed that one of the biggest reasons he is staying at the preserve is to take care of his catatonic brother, Warren. Dale is second cousin to Stan Sorensen. He plays only minor, but helpful roles in subsequent books. Lena Burgess Lena was introduced to Kendra and Seth as the elderly housekeeper to Grandpa and Grandma Sorenson. She was revealed after Kendra and Seth learn the truth about Fablehaven, as a former Naiad who was married to Patton Burgess, a former caretaker of Fablehaven. She was captured by Muriel and Bahumat in the first book, and was unwillingly restored as a Naiad and returned to the pond by the fairy army by the end of the book. In the Second Book, Kendra goes to see if Lena will return, but the other Naiads take Lena away. In the Third Book, the appearance of Patton Burgess, by means of a powerful time-travel artifact, coaxes Lena from the pond, though it ultimately results in her death when they enter their final confrontation to save the preserve. Maddox Fisk Maddox Fisk, a grizzly looking mountain man, is one of Grandpa's friends and a fairy broker, which means that he catches and sells or trades fairies. He presents to the Sorensons his collection of fairies that he had gathered from around the world. In book 2 it is mentioned that Maddox went on a mission to the secret preserve in Brazil but contact with him was lost. Rescue attempts were made, but unsuccessful. Hugo Hugo is a golem, a manufactured being made of soil, rocks, and clay, animated by a powerful spell and given rudimentary intelligence. He has no will of his own and will do whatever he is told. However, he was destroyed in the battle against Muriel and Bahumat. After the battle, the empowered fairies rebuilt him, turning him into a true golem and giving him a spark of free will. Hugo is very strong, about 10 feet tall, and has the general appearance of a large ape made of dirt and rocks with disproportionately larger hands and feet. He is a powerful ally throughout the entire series. Newel and Doren Newel and Doren are the satyrs. They are introduced in the series as Kendra and Seth are inadvertently stealing stew from an ogress. The satyrs are light hearted and fun, but they can be conniving. They tell Seth that if he brings them the batteries so that they can watch their portable television they will give him gold. Seth does bring them batteries and they give him gold which they have stolen from the troll, Nero. The satyrs enjoy chasing hamadryads, and playing tennis, and are sometimes invited to parties inside the house. They are described as the \\"ultimate fair weather friends\\" and detest work. Muriel Taggert Muriel is the first villain of the Fablehaven series. She used to be the wife of a previous caretaker, but she became enamored with dark magic and witchcraft. For her crimes she was imprisoned in a shack on the grounds of Fablehaven, held from using magic by a rope with thirteen magical knots tied in it. The knots could only be undone by a human who asked for a favor of their own free will. The person would blow on a knot and Muriel would use the magical power released by unraveling the knot to grant the person a favor. She was freed by Kendra and Seth when she used the power of the final knot to transform Grandma Sorenson from a chicken to her human self. She then attempts to free the demon Bahumat and overthrow the preserve. Mendigo Mendigo is a wooden puppet held together with metal hooks at the joints. He used to be a small toy that Muriel the witch created to keep her company, (she called him a limberjack). When she was freed she used a spell to make him human size and gave him golem like intelligence. He follows any order given by his master. He initially followed orders from Muriel, until fairies turned his will to take orders from Kendra. From this point on he becomes a strong ally. He is quite a bit stronger than he looks, and he can carry two people at once while running. The Fairy Queen The Fairy Queen introduces herself not as \\"a fairy\\" but as \\"the fairy\\" the mother, the eldest sister. She does not dwell on earth, but in a different realm where she cannot be tainted by dark magic. Her only portals to the human world is through her shrines located on some of the magical preserves. The fairy queen shrine at Fablehaven is located in a beautiful park, on an island in the middle of a naiad pond. Unworthy visitors are instantly obliterated, as goes the story of a grounds keeper who was turned into dandelion fluff. Kendra, however, must visit the Fairy Queen for help to save her family, and Fablehaven from Muriel and Bahumat. The Fairy Queen spares her life and through the experience, makes her fairykind, giving her many of the powers of the fairies. With her help Kendra and the empowered fairy army defeat Muriel and Bahumat. Bahumat Bahumat is an ancient demon who plagued the Fablehaven area before the preserve was founded. Some Europeans imprisoned him in exchange for ownership of the land that he had terrorized. Fablehaven was founded on this land. He is bound by knots similar to those that bound Muriel, but in greater multitude. He was never bound by the treaty of Fablehaven, and therefore Bahumat has to overthrow the treaty to escape Fablehaven. Bahumat is not seen until the end of the first book as Muriel is trying to release him. She succeeds, but the fairies prevail in the end and imprison him underground. Nero Nero is a greedy cliff troll whom Ruth, Kendra and Seth visit to obtain information on where Stan is being held. He is a black, scaly, repilian humanoid with yellow markings who owns a seeing stone. Nero, a tough bargainer, requests a large amount of treasure, but Ruth convinces him to accept a full body massage instead for the information. = Minor characters = Scott Michael Sorenson & Maria Kate Sorenson Scott and Maria are Kendra and Seth's parents. They have only minor roles in the series as they are oblivious to the magical world their children have been thrust into. Until the third book when they are captured by the evening star and Seth and Kendra rescue them at the end of the 5 book.  Book 2 - Fablehaven: Rise of the Evening Star  The Society of the Evening Star, an arcane organization, is bent on freeing all captive magical creatures, even the dark ones. Also introduced are The Knights of the Dawn, a secret organization set to combat the evil efforts of the Society of the Evening Star. = Major characters = Errol Fisk/Christopher Vogel Christopher Vogel is an agent of the Society of the Evening Star. He met Kendra and Seth outside their school using the name Errol Fisk. He impressed them with his magician's skills, and told them he was sent by Coulter Dixon to get rid of the kobold Case. He convinced Seth to break into a mortuary to get a frog shaped statue, who turned out to be the demon - Olloch the Glutton. He tried to convince Kendra and Seth to accompany him on another mission, but they were warned by Grandpa Sorenson that he was not a friend, and likely a member of the Society of the Evening Star, which he actually turned out to be. He was a boyfriend to Vanessa in book two while the duo were working for the Society. Vanessa Santoro Vanessa is a friend of the Sorensons, with a strikingly beautiful appearance, and a fancy souped up sports car. She first appears at Kendra and Seth's home. She has been sent to pick them up and take them to Fablehaven, escaping Errol Fisk, alias Christopher Vogel. She is presented as a keeper of magical creatures. She is a Knight of the Dawn, and helps fellow knights Coulter and Tanu with their efforts to find the secret artifact hidden at Fablehaven, until she is revealed as a narcoblix and traitor. Her abilities give her power to control others while they are sleeping after she bites them. She had been secretly working for the Society of the Evening Star for a while by the time she was revealed. Once her plan is thwarted she was imprisoned in the Quiet Box, but leaves a message with Kendra revealing the Sphinx as a traitor. She is hoping to be released from confinement, expressing her desire to switch sides and help them defeat the Sphinx. Tanugatoa \\"Tanu\\" Dufu \\"Tanu\\", as he says people call him, is a large Samoan who is introduced to Kendra and Seth as an expert on potions. Warren calls him a \\"Potions Master\\". He is a Knight of the Dawn, and was brought in to help recover the artifact from Fablehaven. He gave Seth a mild fear potion and Kendra a mix of embarrassment and shame potion when he was introducing them to his work. He proves to be a skilled adventurer, healer, and in some cases, fighter. His potions come in handy throughout the series. Warren Burgess Warren is only slightly mentioned in the first book. He appears for the first time in the second book, but as a catatonic albino living in a cabin. No one could explain Warren's condition, or how he got like that, though efforts were made to restore him. His brother Dale cared for him for almost two years before he emerged from his catatonic state, which happened when Seth defeated the revenant in the second book. He is a member of the Knights of Dawn and was on a mission to find the treasure of the Fablehaven preserve before he was turned catonic/albino. At the end of Book 2, and throughout the rest of the series Warren proves himself to be an experienced adventurer and key player. Coulter Dixon Stan Sorenson describes Coulter Dixon as one of his oldest friends, and one of the most stubborn men he knows. Coulter is introduced to Kendra and Seth as an expert on magical items, relics and talismans. He is a Knight of the Dawn, and is brought onto the preserve along with Tanu and Vanessa to help recover the secret artifact. He teaches Kendra and Seth about some of the magical items in his possession, including a magical glove that renders the wearer invisible, how a distractor spell works, and a magic cocoon that allows the occupant to survive any environment. He and Kendra have a feud because he believes that there are some places that it is ok for a male to go but not for a female, which he calls \\"an outdated sense of chivalry\\". Mr. Lich The Sphinx's bodyguard, and the man who Seth and Kendra follow to their first meeting with the Sphinx. After the Sphinx's betrayal, Mr. Lich is found to be a powerful viviblix capable of reanimating the dead. The Sphinx Kendra and Seth were introduced to the Sphinx in the second book. He was well received in the magical community as the most trusted and wise ally. He is described as a black man with short beaded dreadlocks. The Sphinx is the one who tells Kendra she is fairykind, and offers to help her develop her new abilities. He's been a leader for the cause for several hundred years, until suspicions arise when Vanessa reveals that he is a traitor. It is discovered that his ultimate quest is to obtain all the keys to the demon prison - Zzyzx, becoming the greatest enemy of the Knights of the Dawn. The Fairy Queen tells Kendra that he is a man and not another being in disguise, and attributes his age to magical tampering. = Significant magical creatures = Casey \\"Case\\" Hancock Casey Hancock, who introduces himself as \\"Case\\" is a goblin-like creature called a kobold. He appears in Kendra's class at school, but only she can see him for what he really is. Everyone else sees him as a blond haired, handsome boy. As Kendra's friends swoon over his good looks, he asks them out on a movie date. He even goes as far as kissing some of her friends, revealing a major case of bad breath, causing them to avoid him. Errol Fisk helps Kendra and Seth get rid of the kobold by having Seth steal a statue that he says is sacred to kobolds. Supposedly, when Case received the statue, he immediately left, under a compulsion to return it to a kobold shrine in the Himalayan Mountains. Olloch the Glutton Olloch the Glutton is a demon who spends most of his time in a state of dormancy. While dormant he appears to be a statue of a frog. Seth is tricked into feeding the statue, thereby awakening the demon. The statue bites Seth, marking him as the target of the demon. The demon slowly comes to life and begins an unrelenting quest to find and devour Seth. He eats along the way, and as he eats he grows in size and power. He manages to breach the barriers of Fablehaven, and eventually succeeds in hunting down Seth, but Seth is protected by the fairy cocoon given to him by Coulter. Olloch consumes the cocoon, but Seth passes through the demon's digestive system and is expelled at the other end safely. This satisfies the demon's quest, and Olloch returns to his dormant state. Navarog When the Sphinx replaced the current occupant of the Quiet Box with Vanessa, he took into custody the previous occupant. Graulus the Demon revealed to Seth that the prisoner the Sphinx took out of the Quiet Box was in fact, Navarog, the Demon Prince, Lord of the Dragons, and that the Sphinx released him to retrieve the revenant's nail, starting the ball rolling that would plunge Fablehaven into the Shadow Plague.  Book 3 - Fablehaven: Grip of the Shadow Plague  As the story continues in the third book, a new array of characters and magical creatures are introduced, from new friends at Lost Mesa, to a crowd of beings aiding Kendra and Seth in trying to defeat the shadow plague. = Major characters = Dougan Fisk Dougan Fisk is Kendra and Gavin's lieutenant for the Knights of Dawn. He makes his first appearance in book 3. It is revealed that he is Maddox Fisk's brother. He goes on the mission with Kendra, Warren, and Gavin to get the artifact hidden at Lost Mesa. At the end of book 3, Dougan comes to Fablehaven and reveals that The Sphinx is the captain of the Knights of the Dawn, and is a traitor. Gavin Rose Gavin Rose is inducted as a member of the Knights of the Dawn with Kendra in the third book. He is 16 years old and goes on the mission with Kendra, Warren and Dougan to Lost Mesa to get the artifact. Gavin stutters sometimes when he talks, which gets worse if he's nervous. Gavin's father, Chuck Rose, was an expert dragon tamer, and kept his son a secret. However, Chuck was eventually killed by a dragon. Gavin, a natural dragon tamer, can talk to dragons and is not affected by dragon's ability to paralyze humans by projecting fear. He also proves himself quite skilled at combat on the top of Lost Mesa when the party is ambushed by kachinas. At the end of book 3, Gavin goes on another mission and sends a letter to Kendra saying that he is interested in getting to know her better. Mara Tabares Mara is the daughter of Rosa, the caretaker of the Lost Mesa preserve. She was going to inherit the position after her mother, but after tragedy struck the preserve, decided to join the Knights of the Dawn instead. Neil One of the groundskeepers at the Lost Mesa secret preserve. He was a Native American apparently in his 50s, but he was also a Skinwalker. Skinwalkers have the ability to turn into another animal at will. Neil turns into a horse to save several members of the artifact search party when they were attacked by kachinas on top of Lost Mesa. Neil is killed in Lost Mesa trying to retrieve the artifact. Patton Burgess Patton Burgess is Lena's husband and was the caretaker of Fablehaven in the late 1800s. He is mentioned in the first two books, but does not appear until the third book when Seth, with the aid of the Chronometer, inadvertently brings him through time to the present. Patton quickly learns of the plight Fablehaven is in with the Shadow Plague. He knows he only has three days to help save the preserve from being overtaken by the plague. In those three days Patton duels with a centaur, easily convinces Lena to leave the naiad pond again, and battles the dark creatures to defeat Ephira, Kurisock, and the Shadow Plague. Patton revealed that he had defeated the dragon Ranticus, and that he was fairystruck. He told Kendra that the Journal of Secrets was his personal journal that he wrote in with the special Umite crayon, indicating that he would be sending Kendra messages from the past. Patton refers to himself as \\"The World's Greatest Adventurer.\\" = Minor characters = Rosa Tabares The Native American woman caretaker of the Lost Mesa magical preserve. She welcomes the Knights of the Dawn to stay at the manor during their stay as they attempt to retrieve the secret artifact located there. She is killed when Lost Mesa falls. Hal Rosa's spouse who takes Kendra and Gavin on a tour of the Lost Mesa preserve. An old, pot-bellied cowboy, he works to maintain the parts of the preserve associated with the homestead, such as the zombie graveyard, the museum, and Mazy the milch cow. Tammy A knight of the Dawn who was assigned to the task force to retrieve the secret artifact from Lost Mesa. She joined Javier and Zack, the team leader, because of her skill and experience navigating magical traps and other dangers. She was the only one not injured in their failed first attempt. She accompanied Dougan, Warren, Kendra, Neil, and Gavin on the second trip up the mesa. Javier A knight of the Dawn who was assigned to the task force to retrieve the secret artifact from Lost Mesa. He is a skilled with potions, collecting and making. He was injured when their team walked in on Chalize, a young dragon and artifact guardian. She killed the team leader Zack before they knew what hit them. She swiped him with her tail, and he lost a leg and injured the other one. He did not accompany the second team's trip to the mesa. = Significant magical creatures = Cloudwing and Broadhoof These are centaurs trapped by the Shadow Plague at the Fairy Queen's pond. They are pompous and arrogant, but they successfully lead the diversion against the dark creatures allowing Grandpa's party to safely escape to the old manor. Broadhoof loses a duel to Patton Burgess. They join the force attacking the dark creatures in the battle at Kurisock's tar pit. Kurisock The demon Kurisock is one of the four known demons on the Fablehaven preserve. He is barely mentioned in book 2, but not a focal character until book 3. He is described as a demon more of shadow than substance. After the dragon prince Navarog was released, he found the revenant's talismanic nail that Seth pulled out and discarded. He gave the powerful nail to Kurisock, who inserted it into Ephira's tree. Then he merged with the tree. With the cursed nail in the tree, both Kurisock and Ephira's power were greatly enhanced, and together they caused the Shadow Plague. Graulas A very old demon who once threatened the mountainous regions of India and China. He was admitted to Fablehaven essentially to die, and doesn't make an appearance until he notices that Seth successfully removes the nail from the Revenant. To thank Seth for his first surprise in centuries, he provides Seth with knowledge that helps them defeat the Shadow Plague. Chalize A very young dragon, who is very coppery and the dragon who Kendra finds that she can talk to some dragons. The first dragon Gavin talks to in Fablehaven.

The band built up a regular following, playing gigs up and down the East coast, and their first single caught the ear of Billy Terrel, who asked the band to record a cover of \\"Fly Like an Eagle\\" for the Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl XV team.

The publication's feature stories and monthly columns cover a diverse range of topics by contributors, including some of the biggest names in the industry and renowned authorities like Dan Erlewine, George Gruhn, Wolf Marshall, Richard Smith, and Seymour W. Duncan, as well as some of the best-known writers in the field, including Walter Carter, A. R. Duchoissoir, Dan Forte, Lisa Sharken, Rich Kienzle, Michael Dregni, John Heidt, John Peden, Greg Prato, and others. The magazine's classified-ad section provides readers with access to thousands of classic, used and new guitars, amps, accessories, books, videos, and more for sale. Other editorial content focuses on reviews of music as well as objective reviews of new gear. Vintage Guitar also includes monthly repair columns written by noted luthiers Dan Erlewine and Will Kelly. Originally published as The Music Trader, its inaugural issue was distributed in September, 1986, with the intent of achieving two goals: to supply musicians with a market to buy and sell instruments and equipment or locate other musicians, and to inform and entertain readers. Today, these remain the basic goals of the magazine. Though The Music Trader was a publication for all types of instruments, the majority of advertisements and articles were guitar-centric. In 1989, publisher Alan Greenwood changed its name to Vintage Guitar magazine because he felt it better represented the publication. VG Classics From 1993‚Äì1997, Vintage Guitar also published the periodical VG Classics. Much like the monthly, it focused on classic guitars and amps but in a traditionally-sized format on thicker, glossy stock and employing layouts designed to highlight the artistic photography commissioned for its use. In 2001, VG began using glossy paper in the editorial sections of its monthly offering. Vintage Guitar books For more than two decades, the magazine has also published The Official Vintage Guitar Price Guide through its Vintage Guitar Books imprint. Adapted from the 1988 article \\"Asking Price ‚Äì Selling Price,\\" The Guide originally appeared as a monthly installment titled \\"The Instrument Price Guide\\" in the April '89 issue. In 1992, the company issued the first version of The Guide as a booklet, and today the annual book compiles historical data and lists values on more than 2,000 brands derived from comprehensive research and market analysis on thousands of vintage and recent‚Äìmodel guitars, amps, basses, effects pedals, mandolins, lap steels, ukuleles, and banjos. It is regarded by professional players, guitar dealers, and collectors as the premier source for accurate values on vintage gear. To date, The Guide has sold more than 150,000 copies, and in 2012 it became available on digital e‚Äìreaders. The company's Vintage Guitar Book imprint has published several other books: * Stellas & Stratocasters (1994), by Willie G. Moseley, is an anthology of articles, interviews, and columns from the pages of VG, including talks with Eric Johnson, Jeff Cook, and Noel Redding. * Guitar Stories: Volume One (1995), by Michael Wright, is a look at the histories of some of the more interesting instruments that have ‚Äì successfully and sometimes unsuccessfully ‚Äì tried to win the hearts of Americans dreaming of their 15 minutes of fame strapped to a six‚Äìstring. * Executive Rock: A Fan's Perspective on the Evolution of Popular Music Since 1950 (1996), by Willie G. Moseley, is a collection of essays that originally appeared in the VG column \\"Executive Rock.\\" * Guitar Stories: Volume Two (2000), by Michael Wright, continues where Volume One left off. A foray into more brands that made a heavy impact in the world of the guitar, and how its many forms came to be. More than 800 rare photos help tell the tale of these instruments, from the innovations of Mario Maccaferri to Martin's journeys into the solid body kingdom. * Guitar People (1997), by Willie G. Moseley, includes 65 profiles and interviews with guitar players and builders, discussing equipment, bands, and performances. * Bill Carson: My Life and Time with Fender Musical Instruments (1998), by Bill Carson with Willie G. Moseley, is the inspiring, quintessential American success story of Bill Carson and Fender. Online Since 1995, VG has maintained a website that features archival editorial content, the magazine's Hall of Fame page, an RSS feed with the latest industry news, regular promotional giveaways, a store in which it sells books and other merchandise, and various other features. The magazine also maintains a Twitter account that features news from industry insiders and insight into the latest products, gear and technology, and more. And in 2012, the magazine began publishing a twice-monthly e-newsletter called VG Overdrive, or VGOD. Hall of Fame Each year, Vintage Guitar magazine honors those who inspire and awe guitar players, fans, and listeners by inducting great players, innovators, and instruments to the VG Hall of Fame. The Hall of Fame began in 1990 with the induction of the Fender Stratocaster and Gibson Les Paul Standard. Today, the Hall of Fame includes four categories: Instrument, Innovator, Player, and Album of the Year.

Death On 8 February 1942, the Japanese began their assault on Singapore, with the Battle of Sarimbun Beach; and Ball's unit was overwhelmed with the task of evacuating the many wounded to a dressing station known as \\"Hill 80\\". Ball was working from a forward dressing station, near the aerodrome at Tengah, and his team were working tirelessly collecting and transporting the wounded. On the afternoon of 9 February 1942, conditions were such that the medical officer in charge of the dressing station ordered all of his personnel to evacuate to \\"Hill 80\\".

He made his first screen appearance in the pilot episode broadcast on 28 August 2007. MacPherson departed the series on 14 July 2010. Casting In March 2009, MacPherson revealed to Richard Clune of The Sunday Telegraph that he would be quitting City Homicide. Storylines In the first episode, it was established that he was having an affair with Detective Senior Sergeant Wilton Sparkes's wife Lorraine. Wilton found out and assaulted Simon in the bathroom at work and threatened to tell Senior Sergeant Stanley Wolfe but had a heart attack before he got the chance. Simon's affair with Lorraine has recently ended after she dumped him. Late in season 1, Simon was held hostage and nearly shot. This traumatised him for a time and he considered resigning from the police force, until his colleagues talked him around. Early in season 2, Simon‚Äîalong with Jennifer, Karen and Wilton Sparkes‚Äîwere held hostage when a man who wanted the investigation of his son, jailed after being the prime suspect in the murder of a teenage girl re-opened after he committed suicide in jail held the homicide floor under siege. Simon was handcuffed to a chair, along with Karen and Wilton while the man took Jen at gunpoint to find documents regarding the case on police computers. Later the man had Simon, Karen and Wilton chained together at a desk and tried to force them to investigate this case. Karen was shot in this incident but survived. The man later committed suicide. This event did not seem to put nearly as much pressure on Simon as the first time he was held hostage, however this time he had workmates with him and the first time he was all alone. Relatively late in season 3, Simon became obsessed with incriminating a man that he thought had raped a young girl, going as far to threaten to shoot him if he didn't tell the Homicide squad that he'd raped and later killed the girl. It is rumored that since no one has yet found out about this, that his departure from the show (confirmed to be in 2010) may be a result of someone finding out. However, Joyner's departure in season four was more complicated. He saw fellow detective, Duncan Freeman be badly beaten by two assailants which left him in a critical comatose state. The guilt Joyner felt over not being able to help his partner carried with him until he departure which was partly due to the trauma he suffered and having been implicated in the death of a man who was shoved off a balcony, however he was later cleared. He was then alleged to have assaulted a man and threatened him to come to a police interview otherwise he'd kill him. The man was later found dead, and Joyner the prime suspect. He confessed to the assault, and was charged with the murder, but was later exonerated and given his badge and gun back (which had been taken when it was believed that he pushed the man off the balcony). Reception Michael Idato of The Sydney Morning Herald said Simon was \\"self-assured\\". While The Age's Paul Kalina called him \\"cocky\\" and \\"too- handsome\\".

First published in 1633, the poem is viewed as exemplifying Donne's wit and irony. It is addressed to one friend from another, but concerns itself with the complexities of romantic love: the speaker presents love as so all-consuming that lovers forgo other pursuits to spend time together. In this sense, love is asceticism, a major conceit in the poem. The poem's title serves a dual purpose: while the speaker argues that his love will canonise him into a kind of sainthood, the poem itself functions as a canonisation of the pair of lovers. New Critic Cleanth Brooks used the poem, along with Alexander Pope's \\"An Essay on Man\\" and William Wordsworth's \\"Composed upon Westminster Bridge, September 3, 1802\\", to illustrate his argument for paradox as central to poetry. Summary The speaker begs his friend not to disparage him for loving, but to insult him for other reasons instead, or to focus on other matters entirely. He supports his plea by asking whether any harm has been done by his love. The speaker describes how dramatically love affects him and his lover, claiming that their love will live on in legend, even if they die. They have been \\"canonized for Love\\". Imagery The poem features images typical of the Petrarchan sonnet, yet they are more than the \\"threadbare Petrarchan conventionalities\\". In critic Clay Hunt's view, the entire poem gives \\"a new twist to one of the most worn conventions of Elizabethan love poetry\\" by expanding \\"the lover‚Äìsaint conceit to full and precise definition\\", a comparison that is \\"seriously meant\\".Hunt, Clay. Donne's Poetry: Essays in Literary Analysis. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1954. 72‚Äì93. In the third stanza, the speaker likens himself and his lover to candles, an eagle and dove, a phoenix, saints, and the dead. A reference to the Renaissance idea in which the eagle flies in the sky above the earth while the dove transcends the skies to reach heaven. Cleanth Brooks argues that the phoenix, which means rebirth, is a particularly apt analogy, since it combines the imagery of birds and of burning candles, and adequately expresses the power of love to preserve, though passion consumes. All of the imagery employed strengthens the speaker's claim that love unites him and his lover, as well as giving the lovers a kind of immortality. The conceit involving saints and the pair of lovers serves to emphasise the spirituality of the lovers' relationship. Analyses and applications in criticism In his analysis of \\"The Canonization\\", critic Leonard Unger focuses largely on the wit exemplified in the poem. In Unger's reading, the exaggerated metaphors employed by the speaker serve as \\"the absurdity which makes for wit\\".Unger, Leonard. Donne's Poetry and Modern Criticism. Chicago: Henry Regnery Company, 1950. 26‚Äì30. However, Unger points out that, during the course of the poem, its apparent wit points to the speaker's actual message: that the lover is disconnected from the world by virtue of his contrasting values, seen in his willingness to forgo worldly pursuits to be with his lover. Unger's analysis concludes by cataloguing the \\"devices of wit\\" found throughout the poem, as well as mentioning that a \\"complexity of attitudes,\\" fostered largely through the use of the canonisation conceit, perpetuates wit within the poem. \\"The Canonization\\" figures prominently in critic Cleanth Brooks's arguments for the paradox as integral to poetry, a central tenet of New Criticism. In his collection of critical essays, The Well Wrought Urn, Brooks writes that a poet \\"must work by contradiction and qualification,\\" and that paradox \\"is an extension of the normal language of poetry, not a perversion of it\\".Brooks, Cleanth. \\"The Language of Paradox: 'The Canonization'.\\" John Donne: A Collection of Critical Essays. Ed. Helen Gardner. Englewood Cliffs, N. J.: Prentice Hall, 1962. 100‚Äì108. Brooks analyses several poems to illustrate his argument but cites \\"The Canonization\\" as his main evidence. According to Brooks, there are superficially many ways to read \\"The Canonization,\\" but the most likely interpretation is that despite his witty tone and extravagant metaphors, Donne's speaker takes both love and religion seriously. He neither intends to mock religion by exalting love beside it nor aims to poke fun at love by comparing it to sainthood. Instead, Brooks argues, the apparent contradiction in taking both seriously translates into a truer account of both love and spirituality. The paradox is Donne's \\"inevitable instrument\\", allowing him with \\"dignity\\" and \\"precision\\" to express the idea that love may be all that is necessary for life. Without it, \\"the matter of Donne's poem unravels into 'facts'\\". Brooks looks at the paradox in a larger sense: > More direct methods may be tempting, but all of them enfeeble and distort > what is to be said. ... Indeed, almost any insight important enough to > warrant a great poem apparently has to be stated in such terms. For Brooks, \\"The Canonization\\" illustrates that paradox is not limited to use in logic. Instead, paradox enables poetry to escape the confines of logical and scientific language. However, Brooks's analysis is not the definitive reading of \\"The Canonization\\". A critique by John Guillory points out the superficiality of his logic. On whether to regard the equation of profane love with the divine as parody or paradox, Guillory writes that \\"the easy translation of parody into paradox is occasioned by Brooks's interest\\".Guillory, John. Cultural Capital: The Problem of Literary Canon Formation. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1993. 160‚Äì166. Guillory also questions Brooks's decision to concentrate on the conflict between sacred and secular, rather than sacred and profane, as the central paradox: \\"the paradox overshoots its target\\". Guillory also writes that \\"the truth of the paradoxes in question\\", here the biblical quotations Brooks uses to support his claim that the language of religion is full of paradox, \\"beg[s] to be read otherwise\\", with literary implications in keeping with Brooks's agenda for a \\"resurgent literary culture\\". Likewise, critic Jonathan Culler questions the New Critical emphasis on self-reference, the idea that by \\"enacting or performing what it asserts or describes, the poem becomes complete in itself, accounts for itself, and stands free as a self-contained fusion of being and doing\\".Culler, Jonathan. On Deconstruction: Theory and Criticism after Structuralism. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1982. 201‚Äì205. For Brooks, \\"The Canonization\\" serves as a monument, a \\"well-wrought urn\\" to the lovers, just as the speaker describes his canonisation through love: the lovers' \\"legend, their story, will gain them canonization\\". To Culler, however, this self-referentiality reveals \\"an uncanny neatness that generates paradox, a self-reference that ultimately brings out the inability of any discourse to account for itself\\", as well as the \\"failure\\" of being and doing to \\"coincide\\". Instead of a tidy, \\"self-contained urn\\", the poem depicts a \\"chain of discourses and representations\\", such as the legend about the lovers, poems about their love, praise from those who read these poems, the saintly invocations of the lovers, and their responses to these requests. In a larger sense, self-referentiality affords not closure but a long chain of references, such as Brooks's naming his New Critical treatise The Well-Wrought Urn to parallel the urn in the poem.n References Category:1633 poems Category:Poetry by John Donne ","title":"The Canonization"},{"id":"13673179","text":"Gyula B√≠r√≥ (10 May 1890 ‚Äì 4 October 1961) was a Hungarian Olympic football (soccer) player and manager of Jewish heritage.

Retrieved February 29, 2016 History The Diocese or Archdiocese of M√©rida (dioecesis Emeritensis) was a Catholic and Arian see centred on the Spanish city of M√©rida during the periods of Roman and Visigothic rule. M√©rida was also the provincial capital of Lusitania. The see prospered in the late 5th century under Zeno, a Greek, who was offered greater authority in order to defend the province from Suevic raids. At about that time the diocese fell under the control of the Visigoths and it remained a Visigothic see until the Moorish conquest of 711. Throughout that period, however, it only ever had two Gothic bishops: Masona and his successor Renovatus in the late sixth and early seventh centuries. In the mid-sixth century the see became the richest in Spain through the private wealth of bishops Paul and Fidelis, Greek uncle and nephew. Under these four, the city was ruled de facto by the bishops independent of the central government, a situation which led to conflict between the Arian king Leovigild and his bishop, Sunna. The bishopric of Badajoz was erected in 1225, shortly after it was reconquered from the Moors by King Alfonso IX of Le√≥n. Its first bishop was Don Pedro Perez, appointed by Alfonso X, the Wise. The diocese was suffragan to the archdiocese of Seville, and was bounded on the north by the diocese of Coria, diocese of Plasencia, and diocese of Toledo, on the east by Toledo, the diocese of Ciudad Real, and the diocese of C√≥rdoba, on the south by the archdiocese of Seville, and on the west by Portugal.http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02193a.htm On July 28, 1994, Pope John Paul II established the Archdiocese of M√©rida-Badajoz, making the Church of Saint John Baptist his metropolitan cathedral..

He made his debut screen appearance in the first series episode \\"In The Hands Of Giants Pt 1\\", which was broadcast on 28 August 2007. Casting Actor Damien Richardson originally played the minor role of a police officer in the unaired City Homicide pilot. But after he proved popular with the test audience, the producers asked him to attend a screen test for the main cast and he won the role of Matt. He told The Age's Bridget McManus, \\"When I auditioned for the role of Matt, I thought, 'Do I mention the pilot?' because it was a different director but obviously the same project. But they had noticed and a lot of the feedback that was pretty strong was about the other character I had played. That was the difficulty in finding where to pitch Matt Ryan.\\" Richardson said that he received some pressure from the network to keep some elements of his character from the pilot. However, it did not work out as the writing was too different. Richardson admitted that he had not experienced a similar pace of work before, and it gave him a new appreciation for the television serial. Development The character was created by the show's co-creators and writers John Hugginson and John Banas. A notable storyline for Matt saw him discover the truth about his mother's disappearance. During the second season, Matt took on a supporting role to the other character's personal problems. In early 2011, Seven Network announced the series would be rested following the six-part mini-series City Homicide: No Greater Honour. Richardson believed that the show would not be coming back, saying \\"it is not like getting a band back together. It is a massive logistical exercise.\\" Richardson also thought No Greater Honour returned to the popular style of the show's early series', which focused on the personal lives of the detectives. Storylines Matt's Italian mother, Isabella, disappeared when he was young. Following her disappearance, Matt's father started drinking more often. For a long time, Matt's boss, Stanley Wolfe (Shane Bourne), was the only colleague who knew about Isabella. Matt becomes attracted to Jennifer Mapplethorpe (Nadine Garner) and they develop a close friendship. In the final episode of season one \\"Raising the Dead\\", the case centres around the body of a woman found in a construction park. This is later revealed to be Matt's mother. In the season two episode \\"Somersaulting Dogs\\", it is revealed that Matt has a new girlfriend called Emma Treadgold (Meredith Penman), whom he met at salsa classes. Emma and Matt move in together. The relationship has issues, as highlighted in season 4, episode 4, where Emma and Matt have a fight at his work. This comes directly after the episode before, where he forgot about her dinner party, and stayed back at work instead. He also neglected to call. In season 4, episode 7, Matt states that he delayed taking the sergeant exam for Emma, but now intends to sit the exam as she has left for France. Reception McManus (The Age) stated, \\"The morally upright Detective Senior Constable Matt Ryan has had his share of dramatic conflict, most notably during the climactic storyline about his murdered mother which concluded season one.\\" References External links *Character profile at TVNZ *Character profile at TV Week *Character profile at the Internet Movie Database Category:City Homicide characters Category:Fictional Australian police detectives ","title":"Matt Ryan (City Homicide)"},{"id":"13673229","title":"Daniel Lima"},{"id":"13673255","text":"S√°ndor Br√≥dy (15 August 1884 - 19 April 1944) was a Jewish-Hungarian football (soccer) player.

Located 5 km (3 miles) northeast of the Olmec ceremonial center of La Venta in the Grijalva river delta section of the Tabasco Coastal Plain, San Andr√©s is considered one of its elite satellite communities, with evidence of elite residences and other elite activities. Several important archaeological finds have been made at San Andr√©s, including the oldest evidence of the domesticated sunflower,Pope 2001 insight into Olmec feasting rituals,Seinfeld 2007 didactic miniatures,Pohl 2005 and possible evidence of an Olmec writing system.Pohl et al. 2002 Mary Pohl, funded by The Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies, Inc. (FAMSI), has been a crucial part of conducting ceramic analysis and collecting evidence of feasting vessels and early Olmec writing on greenstone plaques and ceramic roller stamps.Pohl 2005 Overview The earliest evidence of human activity at San Andr√©s ‚Äì maize (Zea species) pollen and extensive charcoal deposits from swidden (slash-and-burn) agriculture ‚Äì has been dated to 5300 BCE. At that time, the Gulf of Mexico was further inland and San Andr√©s was the site of beach ridges and barrier lagoons, features that are today some 15 km to the north.Pope 2001 Later evidence of human habitation includes pollen dated to 4600 BCE, seeds from 2600 BCE, and evidence of maize cultivation from 2000 BCE. San Andr√©s and La Venta in the context of the Olmec heartland The first evidence of Olmec occupation has been dated to 1350 BCE, an occupation that lasted some 150 years (until 1200 BCE), with an ensuing hiatus lasting until roughly 900 BCE. Continuously occupied over the following 550 years, San Andr√©s was finally abandoned some time before 350 BCE. This date roughly coincides with the abandonment of the La Venta and the dissolution of the Olmec culture.Pohl et al. 2004, p. 18 Early traces of domesticated plants San Andr√©s is notable for the ancient pollen and seeds recovered there. Although the humid rainy tropical lowlands have made quick work of organic substances, including Olmec skeletal remains, the multi-disciplinary research team delved below the water table, hoping that the preservative nature of water-logged soil would enable them to retrieve ancient samples. Their findings include: *Early maize (Zea species) pollen from as early as 5100 BCE. *A single manioc pollen grain dated to roughly 4600 BCE. Since manioc pollen is rare in sediments, its discovery was either \\"fortuitous, or abundant stands of manioc were growing close to the site\\". *A domesticated sunflower seed and fruit dated to roughly 2650 BCE and 2550 BCE respectively. This is the earliest record yet of the domesticated sunflower. *Cotton (Gossypium) pollen from roughly 2500 BCE. The researchers suggest that this cotton was domesticated, although wild cotton does occur naturally along the Gulf Coast to the east.Pope 2001 Evidence of Elite Feasting ‚ÄúIn Formative period Mesoamerica, high-status goods were significant components of cultural practice and a source of social, political, and ideological power.‚Äù Pohl 2005, p. 3 Seinfeld (2007) asserts that ‚Äúearly complex societies often used feasting as a way for individuals to gain followers and to assert their status‚Äù and that this occurred at San Andres.Seinfeld 2007, p. 10 This study is particularly interesting because the researchers used sound and updated methods to determine social facts concerning feasting at a site where little is conclusively known about social structures. Maize and cacao were detected due to their distinctive biomarkers including C4 signature plant carbon for maize and nitrogen containing organic compounds for cacao.Seinfeld 2007, p. 89 ‚ÄúDiscoveries include patterns of maize use suggestive of its use as an elite feasting food and beverage rather than as a dietary staple. Further results suggest possible evidence of Olmec cacao use.‚Äù Seinfeld 2007, p. 10 During the Middle Formative period feasting allowed the elite to demonstrate their power and enhance their status and identity, as the consumption of alcohol had ritualistic and spiritual meaning among the elites. Cocoa, maize-alcohol, and ‚Äúelite-foods‚Äù gave these gatherings special significance and provides definite proof that there was an elite class in San Andres, and, by extension, La Venta. Didactic Miniatures Pohl (2005) and her colleagues found plenty of evidence to suggest that miniature representations of everyday objects were used ritualistically. ‚ÄúThese miniatures may have been crafted with the express purpose of composing didactic or ritual reenactments of crucial mythic or conventionalized historic events much in the same fashion as La Venta Offering 4.‚Äù Pohl 2005, p. 7 Other elite-religious-status denoting objects (greenstone artifacts, jewelry, maskettes, iron-ore mirrors, etc.) were found at San Andres. ‚ÄúA contextual comparison suggests that, like the La Venta prestige artifacts, the San Andr√©s sumptuary items were significant components of ceremonial activity.‚Äù Pohl 2005, p. 8 Indications of an Olmec writing system glyphs. The top set of glyphs have been interpreted as \\"3 Ajaw\\". The bottom two glyphs were found incised into semi-precious greenstone artifacts. Excavations at San Andr√©s in 1997 and 1998 produced three artifacts that many archaeologists contend demonstrate that the Olmec civilization used a true writing system. These artifacts, dated roughly to 650 BCE (the middle of the Olmec concentration at La Venta and San Andres), were found in a refuse dump, the remains from a festival or feast. ‚ÄúThe fact that the artifacts with glyphs were found in the context of feasting refuse suggest that writing among the Olmec was sacred and was closely tied to ritual activities.‚Äù Pohl 2005, p. 10 The most important find was a fist-sized ceramic cylinder seal, likely used to print cloth. When rolled out, the seal shows two speech scrolls emanating from a bird, followed directly by a number of design elements enframing what has been interpreted as logograms for ‚Äúking (sideways U shape),‚Äù \\"3 (three dots, according to the Mesoamerican bar and dots numbering system),‚Äù and ‚ÄúAjaw (from the sacred 260-day calendar)\\", a designation used for both a calendar date and, in keeping with Mesoamerican custom, the name of an Olmec ruler. In addition to the ceramic cylinder seal, two fingernail-sized fragments from a greenstone plaque have been recovered, each containing an incised glyph. Both these glyphs have been linked to well- documented glyphs in other Mesoamerican writing systems, including the Isthmian and Maya scripts.Pohl, et al. p. 1984-1985 See also *El Manat√≠ - an Olmec archaeological site where, like San Andr√©s, water-logged soil also preserved organic artifacts Notes References : \\"Script Delivery: New World writing takes disputed turn\\" in Science News, Vol. 162, No. 23, December 7, 2002, p. 355. : : : , and (2004) \\"Olmec Civilization at San Andres, Tabasco, Mexico\\", Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies, Inc.

Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four tires, and mainly transport people rather than goods. Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them. The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car when German inventor Karl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars became widely available in the early 20th century. One of the first cars accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts, but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe and other parts of the world. Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lights. Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex, but also more reliable and easier to operate. These include rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment. Most cars in use in the 2010s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels. Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy than gasoline cars before 2025. The transition from fossil fuels to electric cars features prominently in most climate change mitigation scenarios. There are costs and benefits to car use. The costs to the individual include acquiring the vehicle, interest payments (if the car is financed), repairs and maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance. The costs to society include maintaining roads, land use, road congestion, air pollution, public health, healthcare, and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life. Traffic collisions are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide. The personal benefits include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience. The societal benefits include economic benefits, such as job and wealth creation from the automotive industry, transportation provision, societal well-being from leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation from the taxes. People's ability to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies. There are around 1 billion cars in use worldwide. The numbers are increasing rapidly, especially in China, India and other newly industrialized countries. Etymology The English word car is believed to originate from Latin / \\"wheeled vehicle\\" or (via Old North French) Middle English carre \\"two- wheeled cart,\\" both of which in turn derive from Gaulish karros \\"chariot.\\" It originally referred to any wheeled horse-drawn vehicle, such as a cart, carriage, or wagon. \\"Motor car,\\" attested from 1895, is the usual formal term in British English. \\"Autocar,\\" a variant likewise attested from 1895 and literally meaning \\"self-propelled car,\\" is now considered archaic. \\"Horseless carriage\\" is attested from 1895. \\"Automobile,\\" a classical compound derived from Ancient Greek aut√≥s (Œ±·ΩêœÑœåœÇ) \\"self\\" and Latin mobilis \\"movable,\\" entered English from French and was first adopted by the Automobile Club of Great Britain in 1897. It fell out of favour in Britain and is now used chiefly in North America, where the abbreviated form \\"auto\\" commonly appears as an adjective in compound formations like \\"auto industry\\" and \\"auto mechanic\\". Both forms are still used in everyday Dutch (auto/automobiel) and German (Auto/Automobil). History Steam Machine Of Verbiest, In 1678. (Ferdinand Verbiest) The first working steam-powered vehicle was designed‚Äîand quite possibly built‚Äîby Ferdinand Verbiest, a Flemish member of a Jesuit mission in China around 1672. It was a -long scale-model toy for the Kangxi Emperor that was unable to carry a driver or a passenger. ‚Äì Note that the vehicle pictured is the 20th century diecast model made by Brumm, of a later vehicle, not a model based on Verbiest's plans. It is not known with certainty if Verbiest's model was successfully built or run. Cugnot's 1771 fardier √† vapeur, as preserved at the Mus√©e des Arts et M√©tiers, Paris, France Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot is widely credited with building the first full-scale, self-propelled mechanical vehicle or car in about 1769; he created a steam-powered tricycle.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica He also constructed two steam tractors for the French Army, one of which is preserved in the French National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica His inventions were, however, handicapped by problems with water supply and maintaining steam pressure. In 1801, Richard Trevithick built and demonstrated his Puffing Devil road locomotive, believed by many to be the first demonstration of a steam-powered road vehicle. It was unable to maintain sufficient steam pressure for long periods and was of little practical use. The development of external combustion engines is detailed as part of the history of the car but often treated separately from the development of true cars. A variety of steam- powered road vehicles were used during the first part of the 19th century, including steam cars, steam buses, phaetons, and steam rollers. Sentiment against them led to the Locomotive Acts of 1865. In 1807, Nic√©phore Ni√©pce and his brother Claude created what was probably the world's first internal combustion engine (which they called a Pyr√©olophore), but they chose to install it in a boat on the river Saone in France. Coincidentally, in 1807 the Swiss inventor Fran√ßois Isaac de Rivaz designed his own 'de Rivaz internal combustion engine' and used it to develop the world's first vehicle to be powered by such an engine. The Ni√©pces' Pyr√©olophore was fuelled by a mixture of Lycopodium powder (dried spores of the Lycopodium plant), finely crushed coal dust and resin that were mixed with oil, whereas de Rivaz used a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen. Neither design was very successful, as was the case with others, such as Samuel Brown, Samuel Morey, and Etienne Lenoir with his hippomobile, who each produced vehicles (usually adapted carriages or carts) powered by internal combustion engines. Gustave Trouv√©'s tricycle, the first ever electric automobile to be shown in public Karl Benz, the inventor of the modern car In November 1881, French inventor Gustave Trouv√© demonstrated the first working (three-wheeled) car powered by electricity at the International Exposition of Electricity, Paris. Although several other German engineers (including Gottlieb Daimler, Wilhelm Maybach, and Siegfried Marcus) were working on the problem at about the same time, Karl Benz generally is acknowledged as the inventor of the modern car. The original Benz Patent- Motorwagen, first built in 1885 and awarded the patent for the concept In 1879, Benz was granted a patent for his first engine, which had been designed in 1878. Many of his other inventions made the use of the internal combustion engine feasible for powering a vehicle. His first Motorwagen was built in 1885 in Mannheim, Germany. He was awarded the patent for its invention as of his application on 29 January 1886 (under the auspices of his major company, Benz & Cie., which was founded in 1883). Benz began promotion of the vehicle on 3 July 1886, and about 25 Benz vehicles were sold between 1888 and 1893, when his first four-wheeler was introduced along with a cheaper model. They also were powered with four-stroke engines of his own design. Emile Roger of France, already producing Benz engines under license, now added the Benz car to his line of products. Because France was more open to the early cars, initially more were built and sold in France through Roger than Benz sold in Germany. In August 1888 Bertha Benz, the wife of Karl Benz, undertook the first road trip by car, to prove the road-worthiness of her husband's invention. Bertha Benz, the first long distance driver In 1896, Benz designed and patented the first internal-combustion flat engine, called boxermotor. During the last years of the nineteenth century, Benz was the largest car company in the world with 572 units produced in 1899 and, because of its size, Benz & Cie., became a joint-stock company. The first motor car in central Europe and one of the first factory-made cars in the world, was produced by Czech company Nesselsdorfer Wagenbau (later renamed to Tatra) in 1897, the Pr√§sident automobil. Daimler and Maybach founded Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (DMG) in Cannstatt in 1890, and sold their first car in 1892 under the brand name Daimler. It was a horse-drawn stagecoach built by another manufacturer, which they retrofitted with an engine of their design. By 1895 about 30 vehicles had been built by Daimler and Maybach, either at the Daimler works or in the Hotel Hermann, where they set up shop after disputes with their backers. Benz, Maybach and the Daimler team seem to have been unaware of each other's early work. They never worked together; by the time of the merger of the two companies, Daimler and Maybach were no longer part of DMG. Daimler died in 1900 and later that year, Maybach designed an engine named Daimler- Mercedes that was placed in a specially ordered model built to specifications set by Emil Jellinek. This was a production of a small number of vehicles for Jellinek to race and market in his country. Two years later, in 1902, a new model DMG car was produced and the model was named Mercedes after the Maybach engine, which generated 35 hp. Maybach quit DMG shortly thereafter and opened a business of his own. Rights to the Daimler brand name were sold to other manufacturers. Karl Benz proposed co-operation between DMG and Benz & Cie. when economic conditions began to deteriorate in Germany following the First World War, but the directors of DMG refused to consider it initially. Negotiations between the two companies resumed several years later when these conditions worsened and, in 1924 they signed an Agreement of Mutual Interest, valid until the year 2000. Both enterprises standardized design, production, purchasing, and sales and they advertised or marketed their car models jointly, although keeping their respective brands. On 28 June 1926, Benz & Cie. and DMG finally merged as the Daimler-Benz company, baptizing all of its cars Mercedes Benz, as a brand honoring the most important model of the DMG cars, the Maybach design later referred to as the 1902 Mercedes-35 hp, along with the Benz name. Karl Benz remained a member of the board of directors of Daimler-Benz until his death in 1929, and at times, his two sons also participated in the management of the company. √âmile Levassor Armand Peugeot In 1890, √âmile Levassor and Armand Peugeot of France began producing vehicles with Daimler engines, and so laid the foundation of the automotive industry in France. In 1891, Auguste Doriot and his Peugeot colleague Louis Rigoulot completed the longest trip by a gasoline-powered vehicle when their self- designed and built Daimler powered Peugeot Type 3 completed from Valentigney to Paris and Brest and back again. They were attached to the first Paris‚ÄìBrest‚ÄìParis bicycle race, but finished 6 days after the winning cyclist, Charles Terront. The first design for an American car with a gasoline internal combustion engine was made in 1877 by George Selden of Rochester, New York. Selden applied for a patent for a car in 1879, but the patent application expired because the vehicle was never built. After a delay of sixteen years and a series of attachments to his application, on 5 November 1895, Selden was granted a United States patent () for a two-stroke car engine, which hindered, more than encouraged, development of cars in the United States. His patent was challenged by Henry Ford and others, and overturned in 1911. In 1893, the first running, gasoline-powered American car was built and road-tested by the Duryea brothers of Springfield, Massachusetts. The first public run of the Duryea Motor Wagon took place on 21 September 1893, on Taylor Street in Metro Center Springfield. The Studebaker Automobile Company, subsidiary of a long- established wagon and coach manufacturer, started to build cars in 1897 and commenced sales of electric vehicles in 1902 and gasoline vehicles in 1904.Clymer, Floyd. Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877‚Äì1925 (New York: Bonanza Books, 1950), p.178. In Britain, there had been several attempts to build steam cars with varying degrees of success, with Thomas Rickett even attempting a production run in 1860. Santler from Malvern is recognized by the Veteran Car Club of Great Britain as having made the first gasoline-powered car in the country in 1894, followed by Frederick William Lanchester in 1895, but these were both one-offs. The first production vehicles in Great Britain came from the Daimler Company, a company founded by Harry J. Lawson in 1896, after purchasing the right to use the name of the engines. Lawson's company made its first car in 1897, and they bore the name Daimler. In 1892, German engineer Rudolf Diesel was granted a patent for a \\"New Rational Combustion Engine\\". In 1897, he built the first diesel engine. Steam-, electric-, and gasoline-powered vehicles competed for decades, with gasoline internal combustion engines achieving dominance in the 1910s. Although various pistonless rotary engine designs have attempted to compete with the conventional piston and crankshaft design, only Mazda's version of the Wankel engine has had more than very limited success. All in all, it is estimated that over 100,000 patents created the modern automobile and motorcycle. Mass production Ransom E. Olds founded Olds Motor Vehicle Company (Oldsmobile) in 1897 Henry Ford founded Ford Motor Company in 1903 1927 Ford Model T Kiichiro Toyoda, president of the Toyota Motor Corporation 1941‚Äì1950 Mass production at a Toyota plant in the 1950s Large-scale, production-line manufacturing of affordable cars was started by Ransom Olds in 1901 at his Oldsmobile factory in Lansing, Michigan and based upon stationary assembly line techniques pioneered by Marc Isambard Brunel at the Portsmouth Block Mills, England, in 1802. The assembly line style of mass production and interchangeable parts had been pioneered in the U.S. by Thomas Blanchard in 1821, at the Springfield Armory in Springfield, Massachusetts. This concept was greatly expanded by Henry Ford, beginning in 1913 with the world's first moving assembly line for cars at the Highland Park Ford Plant. As a result, Ford's cars came off the line in fifteen-minute intervals, much faster than previous methods, increasing productivity eightfold, while using less manpower (from 12.5-man- hours to 1 hour 33 minutes). It was so successful, paint became a bottleneck. Only Japan black would dry fast enough, forcing the company to drop the variety of colors available before 1913, until fast-drying Duco lacquer was developed in 1926. This is the source of Ford's apocryphal remark, \\"any color as long as it's black\\". In 1914, an assembly line worker could buy a Model T with four months' pay. Ford's complex safety procedures‚Äîespecially assigning each worker to a specific location instead of allowing them to roam about‚Äîdramatically reduced the rate of injury. The combination of high wages and high efficiency is called \\"Fordism,\\" and was copied by most major industries. The efficiency gains from the assembly line also coincided with the economic rise of the United States. The assembly line forced workers to work at a certain pace with very repetitive motions which led to more output per worker while other countries were using less productive methods. In the automotive industry, its success was dominating, and quickly spread worldwide seeing the founding of Ford France and Ford Britain in 1911, Ford Denmark 1923, Ford Germany 1925; in 1921, Citroen was the first native European manufacturer to adopt the production method. Soon, companies had to have assembly lines, or risk going broke; by 1930, 250 companies which did not, had disappeared. Development of automotive technology was rapid, due in part to the hundreds of small manufacturers competing to gain the world's attention. Key developments included electric ignition and the electric self-starter (both by Charles Kettering, for the Cadillac Motor Company in 1910‚Äì1911), independent suspension, and four-wheel brakes. Since the 1920s, nearly all cars have been mass-produced to meet market needs, so marketing plans often have heavily influenced car design. It was Alfred P. Sloan who established the idea of different makes of cars produced by one company, called the General Motors Companion Make Program, so that buyers could \\"move up\\" as their fortunes improved. Reflecting the rapid pace of change, makes shared parts with one another so larger production volume resulted in lower costs for each price range. For example, in the 1930s, LaSalles, sold by Cadillac, used cheaper mechanical parts made by Oldsmobile; in the 1950s, Chevrolet shared hood, doors, roof, and windows with Pontiac; by the 1990s, corporate powertrains and shared platforms (with interchangeable brakes, suspension, and other parts) were common. Even so, only major makers could afford high costs, and even companies with decades of production, such as Apperson, Cole, Dorris, Haynes, or Premier, could not manage: of some two hundred American car makers in existence in 1920, only 43 survived in 1930, and with the Great Depression, by 1940, only 17 of those were left. In Europe, much the same would happen. Morris set up its production line at Cowley in 1924, and soon outsold Ford, while beginning in 1923 to follow Ford's practice of vertical integration, buying Hotchkiss (engines), Wrigley (gearboxes), and Osberton (radiators), for instance, as well as competitors, such as Wolseley: in 1925, Morris had 41% of total British car production. Most British small-car assemblers, from Abbey to Xtra, had gone under. Citroen did the same in France, coming to cars in 1919; between them and other cheap cars in reply such as Renault's 10CV and Peugeot's 5CV, they produced 550,000 cars in 1925, and Mors, Hurtu, and others could not compete. Germany's first mass-manufactured car, the Opel 4PS Laubfrosch (Tree Frog), came off the line at Russelsheim in 1924, soon making Opel the top car builder in Germany, with 37.5% of the market. In Japan, car production was very limited before World War II. Only a handful of companies were producing vehicles in limited numbers, and these were small, three- wheeled for commercial uses, like Daihatsu, or were the result of partnering with European companies, like Isuzu building the Wolseley A-9 in 1922. Mitsubishi was also partnered with Fiat and built the Mitsubishi Model A based on a Fiat vehicle. Toyota, Nissan, Suzuki, Mazda, and Honda began as companies producing non-automotive products before the war, switching to car production during the 1950s. Kiichiro Toyoda's decision to take Toyoda Loom Works into automobile manufacturing would create what would eventually become Toyota Motor Corporation, the largest automobile manufacturer in the world. Subaru, meanwhile, was formed from a conglomerate of six companies who banded together as Fuji Heavy Industries, as a result of having been broken up under keiretsu legislation. Fuel and propulsion technologies The Nissan Leaf is an all- electric car launched in December 2010 According to the European Environment Agency, the transport sector is a major contributor to air pollution, noise pollution and climate change. Most cars in use in the 2010s run on gasoline burnt in an internal combustion engine (ICE). The International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers says that, in countries that mandate low sulfur gasoline, gasoline-fuelled cars built to late 2010s standards (such as Euro-6) emit very little local air pollution. Some cities ban older gasoline-fuelled cars and some countries plan to ban sales in future. However some environmental groups say this phase-out of fossil fuel vehicles must be brought forward to limit climate change. Production of gasoline fueled cars peaked in 2017. Other hydrocarbon fossil fuels also burnt by deflagration (rather than detonation) in ICE cars include diesel, Autogas and CNG. Removal of fossil fuel subsidies, concerns about oil dependence, tightening environmental laws and restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions are propelling work on alternative power systems for cars. This includes hybrid vehicles, plug-in electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicles. 2.1 million light electric vehicles (of all types but mainly cars) were sold in 2018, over half in China: this was an increase of 64% on the previous year, giving a global total on the road of 5.4 million. Vehicles using alternative fuels such as ethanol flexible-fuel vehicles and natural gas vehicles are also gaining popularity in some countries. Cars for racing or speed records have sometimes employed jet or rocket engines, but these are impractical for common use. Oil consumption has increased rapidly in the 20th and 21st centuries because there are more cars; the 1985‚Äì2003 oil glut even fuelled the sales of low-economy vehicles in OECD countries. The BRIC countries are adding to this consumption. User interface In the Ford Model T the left-side hand lever sets the rear wheel parking brakes and puts the transmission in neutral. The lever to the right controls the throttle. The lever on the left of the steering column is for ignition timing. The left foot pedal changes the two forward gears while the centre pedal controls reverse. The right pedal is the brake. Cars are equipped with controls used for driving, passenger comfort and safety, normally operated by a combination of the use of feet and hands, and occasionally by voice on 21st century cars. These controls include a steering wheel, pedals for operating the brakes and controlling the car's speed (and, in a manual transmission car, a clutch pedal), a shift lever or stick for changing gears, and a number of buttons and dials for turning on lights, ventilation and other functions. Modern cars' controls are now standardized, such as the location for the accelerator and brake, but this was not always the case. Controls are evolving in response to new technologies, for example the electric car and the integration of mobile communications. Some of the original controls are no longer required. For example, all cars once had controls for the choke valve, clutch, ignition timing, and a crank instead of an electric starter. However new controls have also been added to vehicles, making them more complex. These include air conditioning, navigation systems, and in car entertainment. Another trend is the replacement of physical knobs and switches by secondary controls with touchscreen controls such as BMW's iDrive and Ford's MyFord Touch. Another change is that while early cars' pedals were physically linked to the brake mechanism and throttle, in the 2010s, cars have increasingly replaced these physical linkages with electronic controls. Lighting LED daytime running lights on an Audi A4 Cars are typically fitted with multiple types of lights. These include headlights, which are used to illuminate the way ahead and make the car visible to other users, so that the vehicle can be used at night; in some jurisdictions, daytime running lights; red brake lights to indicate when the brakes are applied; amber turn signal lights to indicate the turn intentions of the driver; white-colored reverse lights to illuminate the area behind the car (and indicate that the driver will be or is reversing); and on some vehicles, additional lights (e.g., side marker lights) to increase the visibility of the car. Interior lights on the ceiling of the car are usually fitted for the driver and passengers. Some vehicles also have a trunk light and, more rarely, an engine compartment light. Weight The Smart Fortwo car from 1998‚Äì2002, weighing A Chevrolet Suburban extended-length SUV weighs (gross weight) During the late 20th and early 21st century cars increased in weight due to batteries, modern steel safety cages, anti-lock brakes, airbags, and \\"more-powerful‚Äîif more-efficient‚Äîengines\\" and, , typically weigh between 1 and 3 tonnes. Heavier cars are safer for the driver from a crash perspective, but more dangerous for other vehicles and road users. The weight of a car influences fuel consumption and performance, with more weight resulting in increased fuel consumption and decreased performance. The SmartFortwo, a small city car, weighs . Heavier cars include full-size cars, SUVs and extended-length SUVs like the Suburban. According to research conducted by Julian Allwood of the University of Cambridge, global energy use could be greatly reduced by using lighter cars, and an average weight of has been said to be well achievable. In some competitions such as the Shell Eco Marathon, average car weights of have also been achieved. These cars are only single-seaters (still falling within the definition of a car, although 4-seater cars are more common), but they nevertheless demonstrate the amount by which car weights could still be reduced, and the subsequent lower fuel use (i.e. up to a fuel use of 2560 km/l). Seating and body style Most cars are designed to carry multiple occupants, often with four or five seats. Cars with five seats typically seat two passengers in the front and three in the rear. Full-size cars and large sport utility vehicles can often carry six, seven, or more occupants depending on the arrangement of the seats. On the other hand, sports cars are most often designed with only two seats. The differing needs for passenger capacity and their luggage or cargo space has resulted in the availability of a large variety of body styles to meet individual consumer requirements that include, among others, the sedan/saloon, hatchback, station wagon/estate, and minivan. Safety Result of a serious car collision Traffic collisions are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide. Mary Ward became one of the first documented car fatalities in 1869 in Parsonstown, Ireland, and Henry Bliss one of the United States' first pedestrian car casualties in 1899 in New York City. There are now standard tests for safety in new cars, such as the EuroNCAP and the US NCAP tests, and insurance-industry-backed tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). Costs and benefits Road congestion is an issue in many major cities. (pictured is Chang'an Avenue in Beijing)Fran Tonkiss. Space, the city and social theory: social relations and urban forms. Polity, 2005 The costs of car usage, which may include the cost of: acquiring the vehicle, repairs and auto maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance, are weighed against the cost of the alternatives, and the value of the benefits ‚Äì perceived and real ‚Äì of vehicle usage. The benefits may include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence and convenience. During the 1920s, cars had another benefit: \\"[c]ouples finally had a way to head off on unchaperoned dates, plus they had a private space to snuggle up close at the end of the night.\\" Similarly the costs to society of car use may include; maintaining roads, land use, air pollution, road congestion, public health, health care, and of disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life; and can be balanced against the value of the benefits to society that car use generates. Societal benefits may include: economy benefits, such as job and wealth creation, of car production and maintenance, transportation provision, society wellbeing derived from leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation from the tax opportunities. The ability of humans to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies. Environmental impact Vehicles in use per country from 2001 to 2007. It shows the significant growth in BRIC. Cars are a major cause of urban air pollution, with all types of cars producing dust from brakes, tyres and road wear. the average diesel car has a worse effect on air quality than the average gasoline car But both gasoline and diesel cars pollute more than electric cars. While there are different ways to power cars most rely on gasoline or diesel, and they consume almost a quarter of world oil production . In 2018 passenger road vehicles emitted 3.6 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide. , due to greenhouse gases emitted during battery production, electric cars must be driven tens of thousands of kilometers before their lifecycle carbon emissions are less than fossil fuel cars: but this is expected to improve in future due to longer lasting batteries being produced in larger factories, and lower carbon electricity. Many governments are using fiscal policies, such as road tax, to discourage the purchase and use of more polluting cars; and many cities are doing the same with low-emission zones. Fuel taxes may act as an incentive for the production of more efficient, hence less polluting, car designs (e.g. hybrid vehicles) and the development of alternative fuels. High fuel taxes or cultural change may provide a strong incentive for consumers to purchase lighter, smaller, more fuel-efficient cars, or to not drive. The lifetime of a car built in the 2020s is expected to be about 16 years, or about 2 million kilometres (1.2 million miles) if driven a lot. According to the International Energy Agency fuel economy improved 0.7% in 2017, but an annual improvement of 3.7% is needed to meet the Global Fuel Economy Initiative 2030 target. The increase in sales of SUVs is bad for fuel economy. Many cities in Europe, have banned older fossil fuel cars and all fossil fuel vehicles will be banned in Amsterdam from 2030. Many Chinese cities limit licensing of fossil fuel cars, and many countries plan to stop selling them between 2025 and 2050. The manufacture of vehicles is resource intensive, and many manufacturers now report on the environmental performance of their factories, including energy usage, waste and water consumption. Manufacturing each kWh of battery emits a similar amount of carbon as burning through one full tank of gasoline. The growth in popularity of the car allowed cities to sprawl, therefore encouraging more travel by car resulting in inactivity and obesity, which in turn can lead to increased risk of a variety of diseases. Animals and plants are often negatively impacted by cars via habitat destruction and pollution. Over the lifetime of the average car the \\"loss of habitat potential\\" may be over based on primary production correlations. Animals are also killed every year on roads by cars, referred to as roadkill. More recent road developments are including significant environmental mitigation in their designs, such as green bridges (designed to allow wildlife crossings) and creating wildlife corridors. Growth in the popularity of vehicles and commuting has led to traffic congestion. Moscow, Istanbul, Bogota, Mexico City and Sao Paulo were the world's most congested cities in 2018 according to INRIX, a data analytics company. Emerging car technologies Although intensive development of conventional battery electric vehicles is continuing into the 2020s, other car propulsion technologies that are under development include wheel hub motors, wireless charging, hydrogen cars, and hydrogen/electric hybrids. Research into alternative forms of power includes using ammonia instead of hydrogen in fuel cells. New materials which may replace steel car bodies include duralumin, fiberglass, carbon fiber, biocomposites, and carbon nanotubes. Telematics technology is allowing more and more people to share cars, on a pay-as-you-go basis, through car share and carpool schemes. Communication is also evolving due to connected car systems. =Autonomous car= A robotic Volkswagen Passat shown at Stanford University is a driverless car Fully autonomous vehicles, also known as driverless cars, already exist in prototype (such as the Google driverless car), but have a long way to go before they are in general use. =Open source development= There have been several projects aiming to develop a car on the principles of open design, an approach to designing in which the plans for the machinery and systems are publicly shared, often without monetary compensation. The projects include OScar, Riversimple (through 40fires.org) and c,mm,n. None of the projects have reached significant success in terms of developing a car as a whole both from hardware and software perspective and no mass production ready open-source based design have been introduced as of late 2009. Some car hacking through on-board diagnostics (OBD) has been done so far. =Car sharing= Car-share arrangements and carpooling are also increasingly popular, in the US and Europe. For example, in the US, some car-sharing services have experienced double-digit growth in revenue and membership growth between 2006 and 2007. Services like car sharing offering a residents to \\"share\\" a vehicle rather than own a car in already congested neighborhoods. Industry A car being assembled in a factory The automotive industry designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and sells the world's motor vehicles, more than three-quarters of which are cars. In 2018 there were 70 million cars manufactured worldwide, down 2 million from the previous year. The automotive industry in China produces by far the most (24 million in 2018), followed by Japan (8 million), Germany (5 million) and India (4 million). The largest market is China, followed by the USA. Around the world there are about a billion cars on the road; they burn over a trillion liters of gasoline and diesel fuel yearly, consuming about 50 EJ (nearly 300 terawatt-hours) of energy. The numbers of cars are increasing rapidly in China and India. In the opinion of some, urban transport systems based around the car have proved unsustainable, consuming excessive energy, affecting the health of populations, and delivering a declining level of service despite increasing investment. Many of these negative impacts fall disproportionately on those social groups who are also least likely to own and drive cars. The sustainable transport movement focuses on solutions to these problems. The car industry is also facing increasing competition from the public transport sector, as some people re-evaluate their private vehicle usage. Alternatives The V√©lib' in Paris, France is the largest bikesharing system outside China Established alternatives for some aspects of car use include public transport such as buses, trolleybuses, trains, subways, tramways, light rail, cycling, and walking. Bicycle sharing systems have been established in China and many European cities, including Copenhagen and Amsterdam. Similar programs have been developed in large US cities. Additional individual modes of transport, such as personal rapid transit could serve as an alternative to cars if they prove to be socially accepted. Other meanings The term motorcar was formerly also used in the context of electrified rail systems to denote a car which functions as a small locomotive but also provides space for passengers and baggage. These locomotive cars were often used on suburban routes by both interurban and intercity railroad systems.

The Amalgamated Lithographers of America (ALA) is a labor union formed in 1915 to conduct collective bargaining on behalf of workers in the craft of lithography. The ALA was established through the amalgamation of several small unions already existing in the lithographic industry, one of which dated back to 1886. The union remained in independent existence for nearly half a century as part of the American Federation of Labor and its successor federation, the AFL-CIO, until combining with the International Photo-Engravers Union (IPEU) to establish the Lithographers and Photoengravers International Union (LPIU) in 1964. After a series of subsequent organizational mergers, the core of the ALA remains in existence in the 21st Century as Local One-L of the Graphic Communications Conference of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Headquarters of the organization are located in New York City.  History  =Background= A lithographic stone and a sheet of paper printed from the image chemically etched in the rock. Traditional lithography is a form of artistic reproduction using techniques first developed around the turn of the 19th Century.S. Edwin Earle, \\"The Lithographers' International Protective and Beneficial Association of the United States and Canada,\\" Journal of Political Economy, vol. 19 (Dec. 1911), pg. 866. A drawing is adhered to a smooth stone by means of an oily crayon or ink, with nitric acid applied to the stone and repelled by the oil, instead working on the unmarked areas and leaving the drawing in relief. The process is both labor-intensive and difficult, and therefore costly, although the reproduction of colors by lithographic means frequently results in a brilliance and precision unequaled by other forms of mass reproduction. Prior to the American Civil War, lithographers began to establish local trade unions in many of the larger cities of the United States of America.\\"Lithographers and Photoengravers International Union (LPIU),\\" in Gary M. Fink (ed.), Labor Unions. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1977; pg. 185. Many of these local organizations were destroyed by the economic chaos and unemployment associated with the Panic of 1857 and did not revive until after the conclusion of the war in 1865. It would not be until 1886 that a permanent national trade union of lithographers was formed. This organization, the Lithographers' International Protective and Beneficial Association of the United States and Canada (LIPBA) was formed as an adjunct of the Knights of Labor, a predecessor and rival to the fledgling American Federation of Labor which favored an industrial form of organization. LIPBA consequently included a wide range of skilled workers among its ranks, including artists, engravers, transferrers, and skilled press operators. Most of the artists and engravers withdrew from LIPBA in 1890 to form their own organization, the cumbersomely named International Lithographic Artists' and Engravers' Insurance and Protective Association of the United States and Canada (ILAE). Originally conceived as a mutual benefit society, the ILAE rapidly moved into collective bargaining, attempting to use its clout to establish a minimum wage for artistic workers in the industry and to abolish the use of piece work. This agenda lead it into conflict with employers, culminating in a major strike in New York City in 1896 after negotiations with the employers' association of lithographic firms was unsuccessful. The strike was ultimately ended by the use of arbitration, with the final result going far to meet most of the union's demands over wages and working conditions. Since neither LIPBA (transferrers and press operators) nor ILAE (artists and engravers) would admit the lesser skilled press feeders into their organizations, in 1898 there was a third union formed in the lithographic industry, the International Protective Association of Lithographic Apprentices and Press Feeders of the United States and Canada.Fink, \\"Lithographers and Photoengravers International Union (LPIU),\\" pp. 185-186. In addition, no fewer than three other unions were established in the next two years, each a craft union attempting to carve out a specific niche. These included the Poster Artists' Association of America (PAAA, established 1899), the Paper Cutters Union (established 1900), and the International Association of Stone and Plate Preparers of the United States and Canada (established 1900).Fink, \\"Lithographers and Photoengravers International Union (LPIU),\\" pg. 186. If the workers in the lithographic industry, largely concentrated in New York City, found themselves splintered into six tiny organizations, the major employers in the industry were not. The Lithographers' Association of the Metropolitan District coordinated wages and working hours among lithographic employers in New York City and attempted to hold down costs to enhance the profitability of its members. On March 15, 1904, this employers' association announced a lock out of all union employees, winning ground for the employers in a compromise settlement reached that April. This battle was extended in 1906 by an even larger organization, the National Association of Employing Lithographers, which eliminated two decades of collective bargaining in the industry by successfully establishing an open shop. The Amalgamated Lithographers of America was the entity formed in response to this growing disparity in power between centrally organized employers and the fragmented and largely impotent small unions of their workers. =Establishment= Official organ of the ALA during the early 20th Century was the monthly magazine Lithographers Journal. The Amalgamated Lithographers of America (ALA) was established in 1915 through a merger of 4 of the 6 unions then operating in the lithographic industry ‚Äî the LIPBA (established 1886), the ILAE (1890), the Paper Cutters (1900), and the Stone and Plate Preparers (1900). The Press Feeders and the Poster Artists' Association initially stood aloof from the new organization, joining only in 1918 and 1942, respectively. The ALA attempted to affiliate with the American Federation of Labor (AF of L), an umbrella organization joining dozens of craft unions into one entity, but the Federation refused to recognize the new amalgamated union. Instead, the AF of L continued to recognize the LIPBA, which had affiliated with the Federation in 1904 but which no longer existed as an independent entity following the 1915 merger. The next year, the AF of L ordered the new Amalgamated union to join either the International Photo- Engravers Union (IPEU) or the International Printing Pressmen and Assistants' Union (IPPAU), a demand resisted by the ALA. =From federation to independence (1946-1958)= An uneasy truce followed the refusal of the ALA to merge with the IPEU, during which the Amalgamated was affiliated with the AF of L but sympathies at the Federation's national headquarters lay elsewhere, the two unions staking out their respective membership turf. Discord erupted in 1946 when the AF of L intervened on behalf of the Printing Pressmen in a jurisdictional dispute with the ALA in Atlanta. In retaliation, the ALA withdrew from AF of L membership and joined the rival Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). The 1955 merger of the AF of L and the CIO to form the AFL-CIO brought the ALA within the large federation tent once again, but it soon found its old jurisdictional battles with the IPPAU once again renewed. The majority of voting delegates at conventions of the AFL-CIO sided repeatedly sided with the IPPAU over the ALA whenever jurisdictional battles were brought forward to be adjudicated and in frustration the ALA withdrew once again. This time the ALA abandoned national federation to stake out its course as an independent union ‚Äî a status it retained until a 1964 merger with the IPEU. =1964 merger with IPEU= From 1966 through 1975, the union's Local One in New York City under the leadership of Edward Swayduck (1911-1987) published 39 issues of the quarterly Lithopinion, intended as a showcase of the graphic arts.New York Times obituary of Edward Swayduck =Subsequent mergers= The LPIU was subsequently merged away as part of a 1972 unification with the International Brotherhood of Bookbinders (IBB) to establish the Graphic Arts International Union (GAIU). The GAIU was itself amalgamated with the International Printing and Graphic Communications Union (IPGCU) to form the Graphic Communications International Union (GCIU) in 1983. This organization ultimately became part of the Graphic Communications Conference of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (GCC-IBT) effective January 1, 2005. Despite this series of organizational changes, the core of the Amalgamated Lithographers of America continues to have organizational form today as Local One-L of the GCC-IBT. =Official organ= The official organ of the Amalgamated Lithographers of America was the magazine Lithographers' Journal. The publication was launched in June 1915 and terminated in the summer of 1964.\\"Lithographers' Journal,\\" Online Catalog, Center for Research Libraries, catalog.crl.edu/ At the time of the 1964 merger with the IPEU, Lithographers' Journal and the IPEU's organ, American Photo Engraver, were similarly joined to form a new publication, Graphic Arts Unionist.

Her speech \\"How the Sisters Are Hindered from Helping,\\" at the 1900 National Baptist Convention in Virginia, instantly won her fame and recognition. In 1909, she founded the National Training School for Women and Girls in Washington, DC. Burroughs' objective was at the point of intersection between race and gender. She fought both for equal rights in races as well as furthered opportunities for women beyond the simple duties of domestic housework.Battle, Ursula V. \\"Nannie Burroughs Fought for Rights of Women\\", Afro-American Red Star, February 3, 1996. She continued to work there until her death in 1961. In 1964, it was renamed the Nannie Helen Burroughs School in her honor and began operating as a co-ed elementary school. Constructed in 1927‚Äì1928, its Trades Hall has a National Historic Landmark designation. Early life and education Nannie H. Burroughs born on May 2, 1879, in Orange, Virginia. She is considered to be the eldest of the daughters of John and Jennie Burroughs. Around the time she was five years old, Nannie's youngest sisters died in utero and her father, who was a farmer and Baptist preacher, died a few years later. John and Jennie Burroughs were both former slaves.\\"Nannie Helen Burroughs (U.S. National Park Service)\\". National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior, March 19, 2019, www.nps.gov/people/nannie-helen-burroughs.htm. Nannie's parents had skills and capacities that enabled them to start toward prosperity by the time the war ended and freed them. She had a grandfather known as Lija the carpenter, during the slave era, who was capable of buying his way out to freedom. By 1883, Burroughs and her mother relocated to D.C. and stayed with Cordelia Mercer, Nannie Burroughs' aunt and older sister of Jennie Burroughs. In D.C., there were better opportunities for employment and education. Burroughs attended M Street High School. It was here she organized the Harriet Beecher Stowe Literary Society, and studied business and domestic science. There she met her role models Anna J. Cooper and Mary Church Terrell, who were active in the suffrage movement and civil rights. Upon graduating from M Street High School with honors in 1896, Burroughs sought work as a domestic-science teacher in the District of Columbia Public Schools, but was unable to find a position.\\"Burroughs, Nannie Helen (C. 1878‚Äì1961)\\". Women in World History: A Biographical Encyclopedia. Detroit: Gale, 2002. Retrieved via Encyclopedia.com, March 19, 2019. Though it is not documented that she was explicitly told, Burroughs was refused the position with the implication that her skin was too dark ‚Äî they preferred lighter-complexioned black teachers. Her skin color and social status had thwarted her for the appointment she was chosen for. Burroughs said that \\"the die was cast [to] beat and ignore both until death.\\" This zeal opened a door to the profession for low-income and social status black women. This is what led Burroughs to establish a training school for women and girls.  Career  Burroughs holding Woman's National Baptist Convention banner. From 1898 to 1909, Burroughs was employed in Louisville, Kentucky, as an editorial secretary and bookkeeper of the Foreign Mission Board of the National Baptist Convention. In her time in Louisville, the Women's Industrial Club had formed. Here they held domestic science and management courses. One of the founders of the Women's Convention was Nannie Burroughs, providing additional help to the National Baptist Convention and serving from 1900 to 1947: nearly half a century. She was president for 13 years in the Women's Convention. This convention had the largest form [attendance?] of African Americans ever seen, and help from this convention was highly important for black religious groups, thanks to the National Association of Colored Women (NACW) which formed in 1896, the largest of three and including more than 100 local women's clubs. Because of her contribution to the NACW, the National Association of Wage Earners was founded to draw the public's attention to the dilemma of African-American women. Burroughs was president, with other well-known club women such as vice president Mary McLeod Bethune and treasurer Maggie Lena Walker. These women placed more emphasis on public interest educational forums than trade-union activities. Burroughs' other memberships included Ladies' Union Band, Saint Lukes, Saturday Evening, and Daughters of the Round Table Clubs. Burroughs' also actively participated in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). By 1928 Burroughs was working in the system. She was appointed to committee chairwoman by the administration of Herbert Hoover, which was associated with Negro housing, for the White House Conference of 1931 Home Building and Ownership, straight from the stock market crash of 1929 just as the Great Depression began. Burroughs spoke at the Virginia Women's Missionary Union at Richmond with the address \\"How White and Colored Women Can Cooperate in Building a Christian Civilization.\\" in 1933 Burroughs was also a published playwright. In the 1920s, she wrote The Slabtown District Convention and Where is My Wandering Boy Tonight?, both one-act plays for amateur church theatrical groups. The popularity of the comedic, satiric Slabtown necessitated multiple printings through the succeeding century, although sometimes the wording is updated as needed by successive productions.  Training school and racial uplift  Burroughs opened the National Training School in 1908. In the first few years of being open, the school provided evening classes for women who had no other means for education. The classes were taught by Burroughs herself. There were 31 students who regularly attended her classes, however, after time, and due to the high level of teaching, the school began attracting more students.Aaseng, Nathan. \\"Burroughs, Nannie Helen\\" African-American Religious Leaders, Rev. edn. Facts on File, 2011, pp. 30‚Äì32. The school was founded in a small farmhouse that eventually attracted women from all over the nation. During the first 40 years of the 20th century, young African-American women were being prepared by the National Training School to \\"uplift the race\\" and obtain a livelihood. The emphasis of the school was \\"the three B's: the Bible, the bath, and the broom\\". Burroughs created her own history course that was dedicated to informing women about society influencing Negroes in history. Since this was not a topic that was discussed in regular historical curriculum, Burroughs found it necessary to teach African American women to be proud of their race. With the incorporation of industrial education into training in morality, religion, and cleanliness, Nannie Helen Burroughs and her staff needed to resolve a conflict central to many African-American women. \\"Wage laborer\\" was their main role of the service occupations of the ghetto, as well as their biggest role model as guardians for \\"the race\\" of the community. The dominant culture of African Americans' immoral image had to be challenged by the National Training School, training African-American women from a young age to become efficient wage workers as well as community activists, reinforcing the ideal of respectability, as extremely important to \\"racial uplift.\\" Racial pride, respectability, and work ethic were all key factors in training being offered by the National Training School and racial uplift ideology. These qualities were seen as extremely important for African- American women's success as fund-raisers, wage workers, and \\"race women\\". All these gathered from the school would bring African-American women into the labor of public sphere including politics, uplifting racial aid, and the domestic sphere expanded. By understanding the uplift ideology of its grassroots nature, Burroughs had used it to promote her school. Many disagreed with Burroughs teaching women skills that did not directly apply to domestic housework. None the less, students continued coming and the school carried on. Death and legacy Nannie Burroughs, 1913. On May 20, 1961, she was found dead in Washington D.C. of natural causes. She had died alone; she never married because she had dedicated her life to the National Trade and Professional School. She was buried at the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church where she was a member. Three years after her death the institution was renamed the Nannie Burroughs School and has remained that way since. Even though more than 50 years has passed since her death, her history and legacy continue to motivate modern African-American women.

If a rocket has pitch or yaw motion then the exhaust must be accelerated laterally as it flows down the exhaust tube and nozzle. Once the exhaust leaves the nozzle this lateral momentum is lost to the vehicle and thus serves to damp the lateral oscillations. The jet damping is stabilizing as long as the distance from the instantaneous spacecraft center of mass to the nozzle exit plane exceeds the instantaneous transverse radius of gyration. Most rocket or missile configurations meet this criteria and the jet damping has a dynamic stabilizing effect. The jet damping torque rotates at nutation frequency in the spacecraft frame. The jet damping contributes to the pitch and yaw damping coefficients, Cm_q and Cn_r, where Cm_q is the rate of change of pitching moment with respect to pitch rate and Cn_r is the rate of change of the yawing moment with respect to yaw rate. For jet airplanes in cruise, the contribution of jet damping is usually negligible because the external aerodynamic damping is large relative to the jet damping. Rockets at lift-off, however, have practically zero external aerodynamic damping and the jet damping becomes significant.

Childhood  Cochet was born in Rosario, Argentina, in 1894. His mother was of mestizo heritage, and his father was French, a teacher in a rural elementary school located between Esperanza and San Jer√≥nimo Norte, in the province of Santa Fe, Argentina. Cochet spent his first years in elementary school in the countryside, and his father was then transferred to Carlos Pellegrini and then to Maciel, both small towns in Santa Fe. In Maciel, Cochet began to work an apprentice telegraphist, and in 1912 he moved to Rosario to dedicate himself to painting while working as a telegraphist in the postal office. He studied with the painter C√©sar Caggiano, and met other contemporary painters in Buenos Aires. In 1915, he traveled to Barcelona, and by 1917 he had been strongly influenced by the prevailing vanguard movement in art. Cochet was given his first personal exhibition at the Galeries Dalmau in Barcelona, in 1919. He relocated to Paris the following year, where he met and married Francisca Alfonso. He enlisted in the French Army for a year in 1921, after which his first son was born. At his first Paris exhibition in 1923, he first gained acclaim among local art critics, and became a regular contributor to the city's many art galleries and festivals. Cochet became more politically involved afterwards, and from 1935 participated in the Iberian Anarchist Federation, speaking and reflecting on the rights of artists in what he considered an era of revolution. He returned to Argentina in 1939, and was named Professor of Painting at a new school in the city of Santa Fe, where he lived and taught until 1946. That year, he published Entre el llano y la sierra (Between the flatlands and the mountains). He died in Funes, Santa Fe, in 1979.

Al-Warraq challenged the notion of revealed religion.

Background Born in Pincher Creek, Alberta, Darley was a truck driver who lived in Pincher Creek his entire life. Arrest On October 2, 1999, he had just finished a long day at work and headed to a local pub where he was to meet his sister. After several hours of drinking, Varley had become intoxicated. At the same time, RCMP Constable Michael Ferguson had just finished taking two prospective officers for an extensive ride in his police car, showing them the ins-and-outs of the area. He dropped them off just an hour before the pubs closed at 3 a.m., according to the Crown. Ferguson received a call from the RCMP dispatcher based in Red Deer about an intoxicated complainant, Darren Varley, reporting a missing person. Varley phoned from the local hospital where he was checking on his friend, Tuckey, who had been just beaten up in a fight in which both men had been involved in with two other men. The fight had occurred in the pub parking lot as a result of Varley knocking down one of the men's wife. The drunken Varley had given the RCMP dispatcher the first statement on what he incorrectly believed to be a missing woman, Chandelle. Constable Ferguson decided to arrest Darren Varley for public drunkenness and bring him to the local police detachment. After placing Varley in the police car, Constable Ferguson returned to the hospital to investigate the missing persons report. Within minutes Varley had kicked out the police car window and attempted to slide out of the vehicle. Death While at the police department, and booking Varley into the last jail cell, Constable Ferguson stated that Varley had pulled his bulletproof vest over his head and gained momentary control of his pistol through what experts testified was a little-known defect in the holster design. An altercation occurred at which time Ferguson regained enough control of the gun to fire two quick shots. One grazed the side of Varley's abdomen and the other shot pierced his skull just behind the ear. Varley, now breathing with severe difficulty, lay wounded on the cell floor while Constable Ferguson called the ambulance, which attended moments later. Varley was airlifted to a Calgary hospital where he was pronounced dead.  Court verdict  After two attempts by the Crown which both ended in mistrials from hung juries to try Michael Ferguson for the killing of Darren Varley, a third attempt was made to try him for manslaughter.

Another book, the sGra-sbyor bam-po gnyis-pa, or 'Word-Combination', a two-part work, definitely produced during the reign of Sadnalegs, clearly describes in its opening words how the dictionary was produced: :\\"The Western scholars, the teachers Jinamitra, Surendrabodhi, ≈öƒ´lendrabodhi, DƒÅna≈õƒ´la and Bodhimitra together with the Tibetan scholars, Ratnarak·π£ita and DharmatƒÅ≈õƒ´la and others, having made translations from the Sanskrit of both MahƒÅyƒÅna and Hƒ´nayƒÅna into Tibetan, made an index of the words they had used. The order was given that one should never translate apart from that criterion and that everyone should become familiar with it. Out of the many terms used previously in the time of my Father, Offspring of the Gods, by the teacher Bodhisattva (≈öƒÅntarak·π£ita), J√±ƒÅnendra, Z·∏•ang-blon Nyen- nya-bzang, Blon Khri-bzher Sang-shi, together with the translators J√±ƒÅnadevako·π£a, lTse Khyi-'brug and the Brahman ƒÄnanda and others, in the translation of a religious language which had not been promulgated in Tibet, there are some that failed to accord with religious criteria or with grammatical usage. Thus those that were unacceptable in their unrevised state, were revised. The linguistic terms which required elucidation were accumulated and then depending on their usage in basic MahƒÅyƒÅna and Hƒ´nayƒÅna texts, also upon their usage by the great masters of former times such as NƒÅgƒÅrjuna and Vasubandhu and the meaning that was to be extracted in accordance with grammatical usage, those that were difficult to understand were separated into their parts and then prescribed as a rule with the clear meaning given. Simple terms that did not require elucidation and that might be suitable translated according to their ordinary meaning (literally; just as they sounded) were prescribed as terms with these fixed meanings. As for some words, which had to be fixed in accordance with an interpretation, they were prescribed as terms with these firm interpretations.\\"Snellgrove, David. 1987. Indo-Tibetan Buddhism: Indian Buddhists and Their Tibetan Successors. 2 Vols. Shambhala, Boston, Vol. II, p. 442. The sGra-sbyor bam-po gnyis-pa then goes on to give the royal orders on how the texts were to be translated from Sanskrit to Tibetan, and also explains that, because the tantras \\"are to be secret by regulation\\" ... \\"henceforth with regard to dhƒÅra·πáƒ´s, mantras and tantras, unless permission for translation is given, tantras and mantra expressions are not permitted to be collected and translated.\\"Snellgrove, David. 1987.

President is a steamboat that currently lies dismantled in Effingham, Illinois. Originally named Cincinnati, it was built in 1924 and is the only remaining \\"Western Rivers\\" style sidewheel river excursion steamboat in the United States. She was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and declared a National Historic Landmark in 1989, although these designations were revoked in 2011. Her home ports have been Cincinnati, Ohio; New Orleans, Louisiana; Vicksburg, Mississippi; St. Louis, Missouri; and Davenport, Iowa. History Built in 1924 by the Midland Barge Company for John W. Hubbard of Pittsburgh and then known as Cincinnati, she was originally planned as an overnight packet boat which carried passengers and freight from Cincinnati, Ohio, to Louisville, Kentucky during the summer. Once the hull was in Cincinnati, the owners expanded the passenger capacity by building two cabin-decks. The operators, Louisville & Cincinnati Packet Company, ran excursions, making its maiden voyage downstream to New Orleans for Mardi Gras in 1924. They operated Mardi Gras excursions for consecutive years through 1930. Sometimes Cincinnati cruised upriver into the Pittsburgh area. Streckfus Steamers acquired the Cincinnati in 1933 and stripped it down to its hull. They refitted the hull with 24 watertight compartments, then built five decks encased within an all- steel superstructure. The company moved her to her new home port of St. Louis, Missouri, where she served the upscale excursion market. Renamed as President, the newly renovated 285-foot sidewheeler could accommodate 3,000 passengers and the ballroom could host 1,000 dancers. The cabins were built with an open design and the lido was built without a Texas deck. Newly converted and newly named, she opened for business in 1934. Streckfus advertised her as \\"the New 5 Deck Luxury Super Steamer, Biggest and Finest On The Upper Mississippi\\". She continued tramping (having no fixed schedule or published ports of call) until 1941. (In 1940, she was displaced from her position as flagship of the Streckfus line by the S.S. Admiral.) The President in New Orleans, 1977 In 1941, she switched her home port to New Orleans. Because fuel oil was restricted and many of the young crewmen joined the armed forces with the nation's entry into World War II, tramping was discontinued, and the cruises stayed close to home. After the war, President remained in New Orleans for many years as a popular music venue, featuring concerts by national acts such as U2, Cyndi Lauper, Men at Work, The Little River Band, and The Producers, and performances by New Orleans artists like Dr. John, The Neville Brothers, and The Cold.Doug McCash,\\"Remembering the Riverboat President music club\\", Times-Picayune, November 15, 2009. She was also seen in the 1958 Elvis Presley film, King Creole, featured prominently during the opening credits but with the larger displayed name repainted near the sidewheel to read SS New Orleans, as well as in the final scenes of the 1973 Sergio Leone western \\"My Name is Nobody\\" cruising up river. Because the wind made maneuvering the big boat difficult, she had her two side wheels removed and replaced by diesel engines in 1978. She was sold and returned to St. Louis sometime after October 1987 as her new home port. While there, she was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and designated a National Historic Landmark on Dec. 20, 1989. On July 27, 2011, the Department of the Interior issued a press release that included the following line; \\"Finally, President, a steamboat in St. Elmo, Illinois, had its designation as a National Historic Landmark withdrawn because of a loss of historic integrity.\\" The ship was also removed from the National Register entirely. Casino In 1990, President sailed her last dinner and dancing cruise before undergoing a ten million dollar renovation and conversion into a floating casino. She was purchased by what is now known as Isle of Capri Casinos. In 1991, Iowa legalized riverboat gambling and the President opened in Davenport, Iowa, with of gaming space.Gambit Weekly's BestofNewOrleans.com October 20, 2003 article She was the second riverboat casino in the United States in modern times (opening 30 minutes after the first riverboat casino the M/V Diamond Lady opened in Bettendorf, Iowa, which was owned by Bernie Goldstein). Current status President retired from service in 1999 and was reported, in 2004, to be located on the Yazoo River in Mississippi. At that time, she was for sale by Isle of Capri Casinos. She was also located for a time at Treasure Island in Lake McKellar at Memphis, Tennessee. In January 2009, President was located in Alton, Illinois, where she had been listed by the National Park Service as of November 2007. She was disassembled and moved in pieces to St. Elmo, Illinois, near Effingham. Although local businesspeople hope to re-assemble her as a non-floating tourist attraction and hotel, financing has yet to be secured.

He was drafted in the third round of the 1976 NFL Draft out of San Diego State University. Early years Fergerson was raised by his single mother in Merced, California and attended Merced High School where he was a three-sport athlete. As a track runner, he recorded the second fastest low hurdle time in the history of high school track during his senior year. He was even more successful as a football player, but dyslexia prevented him from earning a student-athlete scholarship. Even though he earned a diploma, his combined SAT score of 580 essentially qualified him as a functional illiterate at graduation. College career To address his academic deficits, he enrolled at Merced College and made such progress in two years that Stanford, Washington State, UCLA, Duke, and the University of Alabama all offered him full athletic scholarships. He chose Washington State University to play college football and majored in Political Science with a minor in US History. After his junior year where he had 10 receptions for 123 yards and one touchdown, he transferred to San Diego State University where his brother Nate was a wide receiver and because he felt the passing offense gave him a better chance at a professional career. As a senior, he caught 57 passes for 886 yards and 4 touchdowns. Finishing as the NCAA's third leading wide receiver in receptions. He was selected to participate in the Senior Bowl, where he scored two touchdowns for the North squad. He also practice track and ran a 9.4 seconds 100-yard dash. Professional career =Dallas Cowboys= Fergerson was selected in the third round (73rd overall) of the 1976 NFL Draft by the Dallas Cowboys. As a rookie, he tore a tendon in his right ring finger and was placed on the injured reserve list. The next year, he was traded to the Seattle Seahawks in exchange for a second-round draft choice (#54-Glenn Carano). =Seattle Seahawks= He started 8 games in 1977, but his career with the Seattle Seahawks was spent playing mostly on special teams. He was released on September 26, 1979. =Buffalo Bills= On September 2, 1980, he signed with the Buffalo Bills after a tryout. He scored 2 preseason touchdowns in his first season. He was cut on August 23, 1981. =Los Angeles Rams= In 1983, he signed with the Los Angeles Rams and was released on August 29. Personal life After football, he began working for Farmers Insurance Group. He then moved on to work for Professional Asset Securities, whose primary line of business was to advise and manage excess liquidity for banks, foodservices companies, trusts and pension funds. In 1986, Fergerson worked as a Ward Coordinator, political fundraiser and get-out-the‚Äìvote organizer for Joseph Patrick Kennedy II's first congressional run for political office. When Fergerson first began, he was assigned a district that had been strongly Democratic for many years, but in which Kennedy was only polling at 18 percent, the lowest ever for a Kennedy in Massachusetts. He was tasked with raising Kennedy's visibility by organizing rallies, leaflet drops, outreach to the many black churches in the area and fundraisers, including a highly successful Dizzy Gillespie concert. By election day, Kennedy went from 18% (third place) to 34.7%, winning the district by 2 votes. For the next 10 years, Fergerson would be mentored by Pulitzer Prize winning author Doris Kearns-Goodwin and her husband Richard, the former Presidential speechwriter for the late John F. Kennedy, the late New York Senator Robert F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Fergerson then entered Harvard Business School to earn an MBA in 1987. In the summer between June and September 1988, Fergerson worked for Congressional majority Whip Tony Coelho. In January 1988, Fergerson was awarded the Learner of the Month citation for overcoming illiteracy. On November 15, 1988, Fergerson was invited to Washington, DC to receive a citation from Governors William Jefferson Clinton and George Kean. Before beginning his second year at Harvard, Fergerson was diagnosed with dyslexia and asked to withdraw from the MBA program. He then began working with the late film producer Harold Schneider. Upon Harold's death, he returned to the financial services industry to make a living, but continued to learn the film business. In 1994, Fergerson joined the Al Checchi for Governor Campaign. Fergerson spent the next year and a half as one of Al's ‚Äòkitchen cabinet‚Äô advisers, a group that provided statewide advice for the campaign. He was campaign director for Orange County, San Diego County and Northern Mexico, a strategic trading partner for the State of California. After Checchi's defeat, in conjunction with the Staubach Real Estate Company, Fergerson worked to develop living wage opportunities for residents of Harlem. When Fergerson discovered that Harlem had not had high school football for 62 years, he called all 13 Harlem-based principals and devised and presented a plan to the Chancellor of the NYCDOE that would unite them all into one community high school football team. The plan, which is currently used by the New York School system, is the blueprint by which the schools organize on all levels so that students can participate in combined community sports teams while continuing to attend their individual schools. It was originally believed that the plan would take 5‚Äì6 years to complete, but Fergerson, through his grassroots efforts and diligence within the community and partnership with Columbia University, was able to complete it in 9 months. Chancellor Klein signed the waiver allowing the Harlem Hell-fighters to organize as a scholar/athlete program to serve the needs of the at-risk urban males of color. Within three years of participating in the Public School Athletic League, Fergerson took the 2007 Hellfighters to the city championship game against John Adams High School, losing 58-42. In January 2007, Fergerson became the only New York state high school football coach ever chosen to coach in the prestigious US High School Army All-America Bowl game in San Antonio, Texas. In March 2007, he was given a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Wheeler school in Providence, Rhode Island, and in September 2007, he was chosen by Universal-McCann Erickson and the US Army as a COI: Center of Influence in aiding the Army's urban outreach programs. He was asked to meet with the Secretary of the Army in January 2008 and travel to the Pentagon to meet with Army brass in April 2008.

It was built around 1850. The schoolhouse name is derived from the tendency of the Jansen family to speak often of Pearl Street in what is today Lower Manhattan. The homes of early settlers Thomas and Johannes are within a mile (1.6 km) of each other. Eventually, the whole area they lived in became known as Pearl Street. The building, now a private home, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. It is a single-story three-by-three-bay frame structure on a stone foundation, now parged with concrete. A gabled roof is pierced by a brick chimney. To the west a modern shed-roofed wing on block piers projects. Inside, the single room has been divided into two large spaces. Much of the original woodwork, including the wainscoting, remains. Other signs of the building's use as a school are evident, particularly the coat pegs near the south door, a black spot on the floor where the potbelly stove was and a hole in the wall for its exhaust pipe. The first record of the building is an 1858 atlas describing the building as a store with the school across the street; however this is believed to be in error because of the building's architecture. In 1875 another atlas describes it as Public School No. 11. It remained in use as a school until 1942-43, after which it was sold for use as a private residence. In 1956 the rear wing was added, and it was expanded nine years later, adding two more rooms to the house.

Aung San Oo (, born in 1943) is the elder brother of State Counsellor of Myanmar and Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi; the two are the only surviving children of Burmese independence leader Aung San. Aung San Oo is an engineer. Aung San Oo has been described by the Burmese Lawyers' Council and the National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma as a potential surrogate of the junta in an attempt to humiliate Aung San Suu Kyi and place her in an untenable position. Time magazine reports that, according to Burmese exiles and observers in Rangoon, the junta used the alleged surrogacy of Aung San Oo and his lawsuit as an act of spite against the National League for Democracy leader. Aung San Oo was educated in England and immigrated to the United States in 1973. His wife, Lei Lei Nwe Thein (also spelled Leilei Nwe Thein), is also an American citizen.  The lawsuit  Aung San Oo is estranged from his sister; while Suu Kyi has become the leader of the Burmese National League for Democracy party, Oo is close to the ruling military junta. In 2000, Oo brought legal action against Suu Kyi in the Rangoon High Court demanding a half-share in the family home, where she had been held under intermittent house arrest from 1989 to 2010. There was widespread speculation among observers at the time that Aung San Oo would then sell his half-share to the junta, but the High Court ruled against Oo, much to the surprise of the same observers, who had assumed that it would bring down whatever verdict was preferred by the junta.TIME magazine, \\"Burmese Democracy Leader Faces New Threat\\", November 28, 2000 quote: \\"Talk about spite. First, Burma's military government told pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi that she couldn't leave Rangoon. Then they told her that she couldn't leave her house. Now, they want the house.\\" and: \\"Late last year, former Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto visited Burma and met with the generals. Burma's military is anxious for Japan to resume aid to their country, which it cut off when soldiers gunned down thousands of democracy demonstrators in 1988. Hashimoto gave the generals this advice when it came to dealing with Suu Kyi and her followers: Don't back her into a corner. The generals, it appears, aren't listening.\\" The Burmese Lawyers' Council describes the lawsuit as an attempt by the junta to publicly humiliate the leader of the National League for Democracy.LEGAL ISSUES ON BURMA JOURNAL No. 7, DECEMBER 2000 BURMA LAWYERS' COUNCIL quote: \\"This approach reeks of a sinister attempt to publicly humiliate the leader of the National League for Democracy (NLD), which overwhelmingly won the one and only democratic general election conducted by the military junta.\\" The Burmese Government in exile claims that had Aung San Oo won his case, he would have put Aung San Suu Kyi in an extremely precarious position.NCGUB quote: \\"If he wins the case, U Aung San Oo is expected to turn his share of the house over to the government, a result which would put Daw Aung San Suu Kyi in an extremely precarious position.\\" In the Time article it is also reported that the junta may have used this legal manoeuver to \\"back Aung San Suu Kyi into a corner\\", despite advice to the contrary by the visiting former Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto the year before the lawsuit.  The mansion  Aung San Oo's mansion in Bagan, 2007 Since 2005, Aung San Oo has been constructing a large mansion on a prime location within the exclusive Archaeological Zone in Bagan. Oo himself, as a U.S. citizen, cannot legally hold property in Burma (it was on this basis that the Rangoon High Court dismissed his claim for a half-share in the house in Rangoon), but his wife's family is understood to be acting as proxy on his behalf. His wife, Daw Lei Lei Nwe Thein, is rumoured to harbour political ambitions for Oo through his connections with the junta, although there is no independent source to confirm these rumours.Irrawaddy magazine, \\"Suu Kyi's Brother Builds a Winter Retreat\\", October 12, 2005  References  Category:Burmese emigrants to the United States Category:1943 births Category:Living people Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Engineers from California Category:Burmese engineers Category:People from San Diego Category:American people of Burmese descent Category:Aung San Suu Kyi ","title":"Aung San Oo"},{"id":"13673907","text":"Louis Charles √âmile Lortet Bust of Louis Charles √âmile Lortet Louis Charles √âmile Lortet (22 August 1836 ‚Äì 26 December 1909) was a French physician, botanist, zoologist and Egyptologist who was a native of Oullins.

For the first time, the Australian government accepted an obligation to guarantee full employment and to intervene as necessary to implement that guarantee. The preparation of the paper was ordered by The Australian Labor Party Prime Minister John Curtin and his Employment Minister John Dedman and undertaken by a group of economists headed by H.C. Coombs. The contrasting experiences of the Great Depression and the Second World War convinced the Labor Party that governments could and must intervene to ensure the achievement of full employment. The introduction to the White Paper summed this up: :Despite the need for more houses, food, equipment and every other type of product, before the war not all those available for work were able to find employment or to feel a sense of security in their future. On the average during the twenty years between 1919 and 1939 more than one-tenth of the men and women desiring work were unemployed. In the worst period of the depression well over 25 per cent were left in unproductive idleness. By contrast, during the war no financial or other obstacles have been allowed to prevent the need for extra production being satisfied to the limit of our resources. The basic ideas behind the White Paper were those set out by John Maynard Keynes in his 1936 work, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money. Keynes‚Äô neoclassical contemporaries, argued that the economy was naturally self- correcting. Unless real wages were held above their market level by union action or government regulation, unemployment could only be a short run phenomenon. The neoclassical economists drew the same conclusion as that of the fundamentalists today ‚Äî that government action to reduce unemployment could only make matters worse in the long run. Keynes‚Äô first, and perhaps most important, contribution was to show that the economy could remain at high levels of unemployment for indefinite periods in the absence of government action. As well as demonstrating the possibility of unemployment in equilibrium, Keynes provided an analysis of the causes of periodic unemployment and the basis for a policy response. Keynes argued that recessions and depressions occurred because the economy was destabilised by fluctuations in private demand, and particularly in levels of investment. To simplify, the remedy he advocated was that governments should increase their own demand in periods of depression, particularly through public works. The increase in income generated by public works would then be fed into demand for other goods and services, yielding a stimulus to the private sector. The White Paper also stressed the importance of what is now called the social wage. :In Australia, a significant contribution to living standards has been made in the past, and will continue to be made, by a high level of social services. Some of these are in the form of direct money payments, such as invalid and old-age pensions, child endowment and widows' pensions. Others are services provided directly by governments and public authorities, including education, health and medical services, kindergartens and libraries. (p12) Following the end of the postwar economic boom in the 1970s, the ideas of the White Paper were gradually displaced by the encroach of neoliberal orthodoxies, the result of an activist New Right political intervention in the economy. Subsequent generations of Australian economic policy were determined within a market economy paradigm, and full employment policy was abandoned for the recognition of a Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment (NAIRU), which accepted an unemployment level of 5% to drive down wages through job competition.

Tucker has won numerous air show championship competitions throughout his career and was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 2008. He has led several efforts to assist youth in learning to fly or becoming involved in general aviation, and currently serves as co-chairman of the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA)'s Young Eagles program.  Career  Tucker performing at the Cleveland National Air Show in 1999 USAF Lockheed C-5 Galaxy Tucker flying under ribbons at EAA AirVenture Oshkosh in 2013 Sean Tucker, a native of Eagle Rock, California, earned his Private Pilot certificate at age 17. His father, William, was an aviation industry lawyer who had learned to fly as part of his job.Yakov M. Hirschon, \\"The World's Top Stunt Pilot\\", ZMAN, September 2012, page 90. Tucker started out as a cropduster, eventually starting a cropdusting business in Salinas, California.\\"Stunt Pilot,\\" Boys' Life, April 1994, page 19. In order to overcome his fear of crashing, he took an aerobatics course, through which he \\"found out you could roll an airplane upside down and it wouldn't fall out of the sky.\\" He has been flying airshows worldwide since the mid-1970s and is considered by many to be one of the world‚Äôs premier airshow performers. Tucker's favorite stunt is the \\"triple ribbon cut\\", where he uses his plane to cut three ribbons suspended between poles from three different angles. Despite once having a fear of flying, Tucker has flown more than 1,000 performances at more than 425 airshows, in front of more than 80 million spectators. Tucker's first sponsorship was with Randolph Sunglasses from 1993 through 1995, then in 1996 he transitioned to MCI under the 1-800-COLLECT and 10-10-220 brands until his start with Oracle in 2001. Tucker has been named one of the Living Legends of Aviation, is the recipient of the Crystal Eagle Award, was an inductee at the 2001 USAF Gathering of Eagles, and in 2003 was named one of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum's 25 Living Legends of Flight. To endure the extreme physical demands of his acrobatic flying routine, Tucker maintains a rigorous physical training schedule, working out more than 340 days per year in a routine of jogging and weightlifting on alternating days. His other physical activities include mountain climbing, heli-skiing, cave SCUBA diving, and golfing. When asked about flying airshows, Tucker has said, \\"I like to think that I bring the fans dreams of flying into the plane with me and there's nowhere I‚Äôd rather be than in the cockpit. That‚Äôs why I train so hard to keep a finely tuned edge.\\" Tucker‚Äôs self-proclaimed goal is to \\"share the magic of flight with Team Oracle‚Äôs guests by inspiring and thrilling them. I want them to go away saying that the airshow was one of the most engaging days of their lives.\\" He is one of only a handful of civilian performers who have been allowed to fly close formation with the Blue Angels and the Thunderbirds. In 2013, Tucker was appointed Chairman of the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) program Young Eagles, which introduces and educates children aged 8 to 17 about aviation. It has given flights to over 2 million children around the world. Tucker is an annual fixture at the EAA AirVenture Oshkosh airshow each summer. At the 2016 event, Tucker was joined by past EAA Young Eagles chairmen Harrison Ford, Chesley Sullenberger and Jeff Skiles as they flew the 2 millionth Young Eagle. In July 2018, NFL player Jimmy Graham became co-chairman of the program, with Tucker. On October 21, 2018 he flew his last solo performance at the Wings Over Houston Airshow over Ellington Field in Houston, Texas. In 2019, Tucker lead an aerobatic demo team with Jessy Panzer. On May 13, 2020, Tucker announced that he will be flying a new formation aerobatic act featuring Cristian Bolton, Bill Stein, and Jessy Panzer. The team will perform aerial demonstrations in the Game Composites GB1 GameBird.  Tucker‚Äôs airplane  Oracle-sponsored Challenger II biplane Tucker's airplane, the Oracle Challenger III biplane, is claimed to produce more than 400 horsepower, and weighs only 1,200 pounds. The Challenger III is equipped with a unique set of wings that use 8 ailerons instead of 4. The tail on the airplane is modeled after the tail used on high-performance radio control airplanes. Smithsonian‚Äôs National Air and Space Museum will receive the Oracle Challenger III which will be displayed at the entrance to the ‚ÄúThomas W. Haas We All Fly‚Äù gallery opening in 2021.  Bob Hoover Academy  In 2013, Tucker and his son Eric founded the nonprofit organization Every Kid Can Fly, which in 2017 led to the Bob Hoover Academy, a program that aims to create opportunities in aviation that inspire at-risk and low-income teens in the Salinas area. In partnership with the Monterey County Office of Education, teens take classes focused on core STEM principles. As they progress in the program, the students take aviation ground school and flight lessons leading to an eventual solo flight. Rather than producing professional pilots, Tucker's goal is for the teens to develop the skills and confidence necessary to improve their lives using education and the experience of flight as the motivator. The school district provides the teachers and classroom curriculum while Tucker provides the aviation resources - including a dedicated flight instructor, aircraft, fuel and hangar facilities. The Academy was named after famed aviator Bob Hoover - a World War II pilot, airshow pilot and mentor to Tucker. In 2018, both Harrison Ford and Redbird Flight Simulations donated substantial resources to the Academy. Accidents Tucker's first accident occurred in 1979, when he had to parachute out of his disabled aerobatic airplane. In 1993, as he was climbing out of the parked stunt plane he used at the time, a Pitts S-2S biplane, a runaway aircraft on the ground collided with his aircraft. Tucker escaped unscathed, but damage to the wings on one side of his aircraft took ten days to repair. In 2006, the elevator (pitch control) system in Tucker's aerobatic aircraft broke during a practice aerobatic flight, forcing him to bail out over an empty farm field in Coushatta, Louisiana. He was uninjured, but the aircraft he was flying was destroyed.  Tutima Academy  In 1997, Tucker started the Sean D. Tucker School of Aerobatic Flight, with the stated aim of setting and spreading the standard for aviation safety in aerobatics and aviation at large. In 2004, through a partnership with the Tutima Watch Company, the school became the Tutima Academy of Aviation Safety. The Academy, located in King City, California, offers a variety of courses including stall/spin recognition and recovery training, aerobatic proficiency training, a low-level aerobatic mentorship program, and formation aerobatic flight training.  Popular culture  In 2009, Tucker was featured on The Oprah Winfrey Show. The segment featured an interview with Oprah Winfrey and a video segment where Tucker took a 29-year- old woman on an aerobatic flight to conquer her fear of flying. In 2014, he and Harrison Ford starred in and framed Flying the Feathered Edge: The Bob Hoover Project, an independent aviation documentary detailing the life of aerobatic legend Bob Hoover.FilmStew.com, Harrison Ford Frames Documentary About Beloved Aviation Pioneer, July 30, 2014 In 2015, CNN featured Tucker in a story titled \\"Does this man have the most dangerous job in America?\\".

It was the first Italian periodical to make a regular feature of publishing comic strips. Publication history Corriere dei Piccoli was established in 1908. The first issue (24 pages, 80,000 copies) was published on 27 December 1908, with Silvio Spaventa Filippi as editor-in- chief. It was founded by Luigi Albertini. The magazine was formally a supplement for children of Corriere della Sera, but it was also sold separately for 0.10 lira Its upmarket rival Il giornalino della Domenica, founded in 1906, sold for two and a half times the price. At its acme, the magazine sold 700,000 copies. By 1970 the magazine started having financial difficulties due to rising costs and competition by other magazines and comics books. Feeling that the quaint name was partly to blame, on 1 January 1972 the publisher renamed the bulk of the magazine Corriere dei Ragazzi, which hopefully would be more appealing to teenagers. The name Corriere dei Piccoli survived as the title of a thin supplement of the publication, aimed at the younger readers. The last issue was dated 15 August 1995. Contents The cover of the 11 July 1911 edition carries a cartoon strip in the Italian style without speech bubbles. Throughout its history, the Corrierino published material in many genres: stories in comic strip format, illustrated tales and novels (usually in half-page to two-page weekly installments), educational material, feature columns, humor, news, reviews, readers' letters, puzzles, board games, and more. Although comic strips had been published before in Italian children‚Äôs magazines‚ÄîIl novellino had published American examples including, in 1904, a Yellow Kid cartoon‚Äîthe Corriere was the first to make them a regular feature and the first to commission original Italian artwork as well as using American strips.Encyclopedia of Italian Literary Studies, ed. by Gaetana Marrone and others, (New York; London: Routledge, 2007), , p. 787. . A typically Italian comic strip format was introduced by the Corrierino from its first issue. The full page was divided into six equal panels, in three rows. Instead of text balloons (which were already used in the US, but were considered educationally regressive by the Italian editors), the narrative and dialogue were provided by octosyllabic rhymed couplets underneath each panel, e.g.: { - align=left  style=\\"padding-left:2em\\"  Qui comincia l'avventura  style=\\"padding-left:2em\\"  \\"Here begins the adventure - align=left  style=\\"padding-left:2em\\"  Del Signor Bonaventura ...  style=\\"padding- left:2em\\"  of Mr. Bonaventura ... \\" } In time this format gave way to balloon-captioned comics, which, besides being the universal norm outside Italy, made for more lively action and dialogue, and gave more freedom to the artists in the choice of panel size and layout.

The de-manufacturing and value recovery business is a provider of services and solutions to industrial and commercial users of electronic components. History Envela Corporation, formerly known as DGSE Companies, Inc., announced their name change in 2019. Originally known as American Pacific Mint Inc., they incorporated in Nevada in September 1965, and later moved to Azusa, California. They purchased Dallas Gold and Silver Exchange in September 1987 for an undisclosed amount. Dallas Gold and Silver Exchange continued operating as a subsidiary of American Pacific Mint. In January 1992, after seeing that subsidiary achieve record results and a 19% jump in profits, American Pacific Mint announced their plan to move their headquarters to Dallas and rename the entire company as Dallas Gold and Silver Exchange. Shareholders approved the plan in July that year. In July 2001, they began to use their present name. DGSE was one of the earliest coin and bullion dealers to begin doing business on the internet; they set up a website to auction jewelry from their stores in 1995, and later launched two further websites for auctioning watches and to allow jewelry manufactures and vendors to sell to each other and directly to the public. They also set up a website to provide real-time price quotes for precious metals. Their revenues from their internet business began to show dramatic growth in 1999; revenue to March 15 of that year was five times the revenue for their 1998 fiscal year. Their acquisition of Superior Galleries, and the success of Superior's first auction under DGSE ownership, drove their share price up 33% to $4.06 in August 2007. In April 2012 DGSE Announces Halt in Trading of its public stock on AMEX In June 2012, DGSE closes its Superior Gold and Silver Exchange store in Woodland Hills.

Nelson Cavaquinho (October 29, 1911 ‚Äì February 18, 1986, birth name Nelson Ant√¥nio da Silva) was one of the most important singer/composers of samba. He is usually seen as a representative of the tragic aspects of samba thematics, with many songs about death and hopelessness. He was a prominent figure of samba school Esta√ß√£o Primeira de Mangueira. Biography Nelson was born in Rio de Janeiro. Coming from a poor family, he quit school at a young age to seek employment in a factory. He showed a musical talent at a young age playing a home-made guitar made of a cigar box and wires. When he could, he would borrow a cavaquinho and try and copy the techniques of professional cavaquinho players. He demonstrated a great ability to play the instrument and composed a choro (\\"Caminhando\\") which gained him notoriety as a musician (due in part to an uncommon modulation which made it hard for other instrumentalists to harmonize it). He was finally given a cavaquinho and having demonstrated a unique playing style on the instrument was given the nickname \\"Nelson Cavaquinho\\". He demonstrated a unique style of playing with only two fingers. As a young man he became acquainted with famous samba players like Cartola, Carlos Cacha√ßa and Z√© da Zilda. He went on to compose over 600 compositions. His main partner was Guilherme de Brito. Some of his better known works are: \\"A Flor e o Espinho\\", \\"Folhas Secas\\", \\"O Bem e o Mal\\" and \\"Ju√≠zo Final\\". He died of emphysema on February 18, 1986, at the age of 74, in Rio de Janeiro.

Multiple varieties of such an oath have been proposed. Joseph Rotblat has suggested that an oath would help make new scientists aware of their social and moral responsibilities; opponents, however, have pointed to the \\"very serious risks for the scientific community\\" posed by an oath, particularly the possibility that it might be used to shut down certain avenues of research, such as stem cells. Development The idea of an oath has been proposed by various prominent members of the scientific community, including Karl Popper, Joseph Rotblat and John Sulston. Research by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) identified sixteen different oaths for scientists or engineers proposed during the 20th century, most after 1970. Popper, Rotblat and Sulston were all primarily concerned with the ethical implications of scientific advances, in particular for Popper and Rotblat the development of the atomic bomb, and believed that scientist, like medics, should have an oath that compelled them to \\"first do no harm\\". Popper said: \\"Formerly the pure scientist or the pure scholar had only one responsibility beyond those which everybody has; that is, to search for the truth. ‚Ä¶ This happy situation belongs to the past.\\" Rotblat similarly stated: \\"Scientists can no longer claim that their work has nothing to do with the welfare of the individual or with state policies.\\" He also attacked the attitude that the only obligation of a scientist is to make their results known, the use made of these results being the public's business, saying: \\"This amoral attitude is in my opinion actually immoral, because it eschews personal responsibility for the likely consequences of one's actions.\\" Sulston was more concerned with rising public distrust of scientists and conflicts of interest brought about by the exploitation of research for profit. The started intention of his oath was \\"both to require qualified scientists to cause no harm and to be wholly truthful in their public pronouncements, and also to protect them from discrimination by employers who might prefer them to be economical with the truth.\\" The concept of an oath, rather than a more detailed code of conduct, has been opposed by Ray Spier, Professor of Science and Engineering Ethics at the University of Surrey, UK, who stated that \\"Oaths are not the way ahead\\". Other objections raised at a AAAS meeting on the topic in 2000 included that an oath would simply make scientists look good without changing behaviour, that an oath could be used to suppress research, that some scientists would refuse to swear any oath as a matter of principle, that an oath would be ineffective, that creation of knowledge is separate from how it is used, and that the scientific community could never agree on the content of an oath. The meeting concluded that: \\"There was a broadly shared consensus that a tolerant (but not patronizing) attitude should be taken towards those developing oaths, but that an oath posed very serious risks for the scientific community which could not be ignored.\\" Nobel laureate Jean-Marie Lehn has said \\"The first aim of scientific research is to increase knowledge for understanding. Knowledge is then available to mankind for use, namely to progress as well as to help prevent disease and suffering. Any knowledge can be misused. I do not see the need for an oath\\". Some of the propositions are outlined below. = Karl Popper = In 1968, the philosopher Karl Popper gave a talk on \\"The Moral Responsibility of the Scientist\\" at the International Congress on Philosophy in Vienna, in which he suggested \\"an undertaking analogous to the Hippocratic oath\\". In his analysis he noted that the original oath had three sections: the apprentice's obligation to their teacher; the obligation to carry on the high tradition of their art, preserve its high standards, and pass these standards on to their own students; and the obligation to help the suffering and preserve their confidentiality. He also noted that it was an apprentice's oath, as distinct from a graduation oath. Based on this, he proposed a three- section oath for students, rearranged from the Hippocratic oath to give professional responsibility to further the growth of knowledge; the student, who owes respect to others engaged in science and loyalty to teachers; and the overriding loyalty owed to humanity as a whole. = Joseph Rotblat = The idea of a Hippocratic Oath for scientists was raised again by Joseph Rotblat in his acceptance speech for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1995, who later expanded on the idea, endorsing the formulation of the Student Pugwash Group: = John Sulston = In 2001, in the scientific journal Biochemical Journal, Nobel laureate John Sulston proposed that \\"For individual scientists, it may be helpful to have a clear professional code of conduct ‚Äì a Hippocratic oath as it were\\". This path would enable scientists to declare their intention \\"to cause no harm and to be wholly truthful in their public pronouncements\\", and would also serve to protect them from unethical employers. The concept of an oath was opposed by Ray Spiers of the University of Surrey, an expert on scientific ethics who was preparing a 20-point code of conduct at the time. = David King = In 2007, the UK government's chief scientific advisor, David King, presented a \\"Universal Ethical Code for Scientists\\" at the British Association's Festival of Science in York. Despite being a code rather than an oath, this was widely reported as a Hippocratic oath for scientists. In contrast to the earlier oaths, King's code was not only intended to meet the public demand that \\"scientific developments are ethical and serve the wider public good\\" but also to address public confidence in the integrity of science, which had been shaken by the disgrace of cloning pioneer Hwang Woo- suk and by other research-fraud scandals. Work on the code started in 2005, following a meeting of G8 science ministers and advisors. It was supported by the Royal Society in its response to a public consultation on the draft code in 2006, where they said it would help whistleblowers and the promotion of science in schools. The code has seven principles, divided into three sections: See also * Archimedean Oath ‚Äì a similar oath for engineers and technicians proposed in 1990 by students at the √âcole polytechnique f√©d√©rale de Lausanne. * Code of conduct * Code of ethics * Universal code (ethics) References External links *Transcript of a Conversation with Sir David King, 2007; *Institute of Medical Science, Toronto, 2008; Category:Ethics of science and technology ","title":"Hippocratic Oath for scientists"},{"id":"13674111","text":"San Martino is a Renaissance Roman Catholic church in the sestiere of Castello of Venice, northern Italy.
