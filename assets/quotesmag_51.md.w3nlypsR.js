The tomb was discovered by some locals in 1999 in Wangguo village in Jinyuan district of the city of Taiyuan, it was subsequently excavated officially in July of the same year. This tomb is so far the only archaeological find in the Central Plains region that reflects Central Asian (Western Regions) culture.  Tomb occupant  Rubbing of Yu Hong's epitaph The man buried in the tomb went by Yu Hong (; 533‚Äì592 AD), with Mopan () as his courtesy name, who was a Central Asian, probably of Persian or Sogdian origin, and practiced Zoroastrianism. He had settled in Early Middle Period China during the Northern Qi, Northern Zhou and Sui dynasties. The epitaph found in the tomb records that he was a noble of the city of () in the mysterious Yu country (), assumably for which he is named, because the two characters and are homophones. According to the epitaph, Yu Hong started his career in service of the nomadic tribe at the time, known as Ruru. At the age of 13, he was posted as an emissary to Persia by the Khagan of Ruru, as well as Parthia, Tuyuhun and Yuezhi. Later he went on a mission to the Northern Qi, Northern Zhou and Sui dynasties. He served as (, lit. ‚Äúacting director of the office of Zoroastrian affairs‚Äù, or ‚ÄúSogdian affairs‚Äù) during the Northern Zhou period. The term () comes from the Sogdian , means a ‚Äúcaravan leader‚Äù. He had later served as a provincial governor in the Sui dynasty government, a chieftain of the Central Asian people who had settled in China during that period. Yu Hong died at the age of 59 in 592 AD. His wife survived her husband by six years, she was buried in the same grave in 598 AD. A study on ancient DNA reveals that Yu Hong belonged to the haplogroup U5, one of the oldest western Eurasian-specific haplogroups, while his wife can be classified as haplogroup G, the type prevalent in East Asia.  Tomb  Rubbing of Yu Hong's epitaph cover, carved with nine characters in seal script. Hunting scene on a gilded silver plate showing Sasanian emperor Khosrow I, which shares similarities with the figures carved on Yu Hong's sarcophagus: the sun disc and crescent moon symbol, streamers flying behind headdress, position of riding figures, et cetera. It is a single-chamber tomb of brick structure, composed of the tomb passageway, foyer, entrance and chamber. The entrance is almost entirely destroyed except for the lower part. Five octagonal marble pillars were found in the chamber, about 132 centimetres in height, two of which are intact, three are broken. Each one has a pillar foundation in the shape of an upturned lotus. A marble sarcophagus located in the centre of the chamber. Apart from the marble pillars and sarcophagus, the tomb has yielded human figurines in stone, horse figurines in pottery, white porcelain bowls, two epitaph covers and stones, et cetera, amounting to more than 80 pieces. The central part of the epitaph cover for Yu Hong is taken up by nine characters in relief in seal script, it reads ‚ÄúEpitaph of Master Yu of the Great Sui, formerly unequalled in Honour‚Äù ().  Sarcophagus  The sarcophagus is made up of white marble, it assumes the appearance of a temple with the hip-and-gable roof. It is composed of three parts: the rectangular platform, walls in the middle section and the roof. The sarcophagus rested on a support platform, at each side of the platform there are two stone supports in the form of a lion's head. The entire sarcophagus stands in 2.17 metres in height. Detail of the stone panel painting on the sarcophagus, depicting two nimbate male figures dressing in Sasanian-style attire, drinking wine and playing pipa. Fire altar scene on the sarcophagus It is covered with bas- reliefs and painted stone panels, comprising 54 scenes, featuring motifs of Central Asian or Persian origin, such as the costumes, vessels, musical instruments and dances. They depict banqueting, dancing, hunting, among others. As can be seen in the reliefs Yu Hong hunting with nomads on horses, camels, but also hunting on an Indian elephant. In addition, numerous Zoroastrian symbols are clearly displayed: the holy fire on a lotus, guarded by two priests half-bird, half-human wearing the traditional padam (a piece of cloth in front of the mouth), and also including a portrayal of Mithra wearing a Sasanian crown, which decorated with the typical symbol of a solar disc resting on crescent moon. The figures in these reliefs all have deep-set eyes and beak nose. The nine main bas-reliefs are the large-size pieces (panels) carved in marble and originally painted in gold (gilded), red and brown pigments, on the exterior of the front right and left walls, and on the interior of the right, rear and left walls. They can be divided into two groups: the first group consists of four pieces, which may depict some scenes from Yu Hong's daily life; the rest may represent his afterlife in paradise. Each panel is divided into a larger upper part and a smaller lower part. =Description of the relief panels= Tomb of Yu Hong, Panel 1 * Panel 1: the upper part features a man riding on a horse with another man leading the horse and two men standing behind. They all wear gowns with round collars and narrow sleeves, accompanied by two dogs and two birds. The larger bird has a halo that surrounds its head. The lower part features a galloping, winged merhorse. * Panel 2: the upper part features a hexagonal platform with a balustrade, three men parallel to one another dancing in the balustrade. To the right of the platform are two men. The platform partially hides the man on the left from view, the man on the right is holding in his hands a large jar with legs similar to ‚Äúwheel-o-feet‚Äù. A bird can be seen flying among the grapevines. The lower part features a fighting scene between a male lion and a merhorse. * Panel 3: the upper part features a man with a halo on camel-back killing a lion. The lower part features another haloed man sitting on a cushion with a floral border, his right hand guilding a horned vessel to his mouth. Tomb of Yu Hong, Panel 4 with camel. * Panel 4: the upper part features a scene of lion hunting on camel-back. The rider is turning his head back to look down on a male lion behind which he is about to kill. The lower part features an antelope racing through meadows. * Panel 5: This piece is in the middle section of the rear wall, facing the gate of the sarcophagus. It is the largest among the nine panels with the most complex scene. The upper part features a rear half of a large felt tent, inside the tent there is a stone bed on which are sitting a man on the left and a woman on the right. The man with deep-set eyes, beak nose and thick beard, wearing a headdress with the symbol of a sun disc resting on crescent moon on the top and streamers flying behind, which is quite similar to the Sasanian crown. He is holding a bowl at chest height with his right hand and looking at the woman. The woman is in a cross-legged sitting position, facing the man. She wears a coronet and holding a long stem goblet in her right hand. There are two male attendants behind the man and two female ones behind the woman. In front, there is a spacious clearing, on the right and left sides of which are six male musicians in a half-kneeling position. A man dancing the dance at the centre, which is a type of dance originally from the Western Regions, characterised by leaps and back flips. It was considered an exotic performance form together with the at the time. The lower part is a fighting scene between two men and two lions. This relief has long been considered depicting Yu Hong and his wife enjoying a banquet, Bi Bo, an associate professor of the School of Chinese Classics at Renmin University of China, however, argues that the female figure is not Yu Hong's wife but rather a representation of DaƒìnƒÅ, a Zoroastrian divinity. It actually depicts Yu Hong enjoying a heavenly feast in his afterlife. * Panel 6: the upper part features a man killing a lion on elephant back. The lower part is a large bird (probably a dove?) with a silk ribbon tied around its neck and holding a stylised cloud in its beak. Tomb of Yu Hong, Panel 9. * Panel 7: the upper part features three haloed men (one of them is riding a horse) taking a rest on their journey. The man on horseback wears a bejewelled crown, he is rising a cup in his left hand. The two attendants are standing in front and behind the horse, the one in front is offering a plate of fruits to the master. The lower part features a white goat. * Panel 8: the upper part features the master with a bejewelled crown from the seventh panel is sitting on a chair and holding a long stem goblet. Two attendants are in front of the master, one is offering a plate of fruits, the other is playing pipa. The lower part features a running white reindeer. * Panel 9: the upper part features a rider wearing a Persian crown decorated with the typical symbol of a sun disc resting on crescent moon, a necklace, a gown with round collar and tight sleeves. On his feet is a pair of white boots. An attendant stands behind the rider's horse, holding a canopy (similar to an umbraculum or a baldachin, but smaller). In front of the horse is a man carrying a plate of fruit. The lower part features a fighting scene between a bull and a lion. The rider depicted in this panel is possibly a representation of Mithra.

From 1927, it was home to David Gordon Kirkpatrick, the youngest child and only surviving son of David Kirkpatrick and Mary Partridge. The Nulla Nulla Valley, with its close-knit community, had strong musical traditions among the hardworking families dotted along the meandering banks of the creek. A large number of its residents, both men and women, could play an instrument or sing. Dances and house parties were held \\"about every week\\", with the news of these events spreading up and down the valley via the \\"bush telegraph.\\" Young Gordon Kirkpatrick was exposed to all of this music and composed his early songs on the property. By the mid-1950s, as \\"Slim Dusty\\", he left \\"the Nulla\\" to pursue a phenomenally successful showbusiness career. In 1954, the property was sold to Eric Midgeley. A succession of Midgeley relatives and, subsequently, tenants occupied the place until 2003. In 2001 the Kirkpatrick family bought it back to serve as a lasting memorial to Slim Dusty's formative years. Since 2003, Homewood has been vacant.  Description  Rear of house Homewood has a verandah to the front (facing east). The house is made of timber with an iron roof. The verandah (together with the roof) had some renovations done during 1980-82. There are two front windows facing out to the verandah. From the entrance hallway, there are two bedrooms, one on each side. The dining room (on the left) and third bedroom (on the right) are further down the hallway. A doorway from the dining room leads to the kitchen with adjoining bathroom. The open fire and stove are on the back wall of the kitchen with shelving to the left. There was no bathroom at first. The current bathroom was added in 1945 and located in a space occupied by the pantry. Despite its simple structure and basic foundation material there has been surprisingly little significant alteration to Homewood in its 90-odd years of existence. Homewood remains intact and is rich in its compelling associations with the boyhood and growing up of Slim Dusty. Homewood retains its original materials and features with little modification. House within the context of the farm = Modifications and dates = ;Fences The current fence was erected around the house 1980/82. ;Tankstands and Iron Tank The three tankstands pictured in the photographs dated 1978 were removed by the Rossiters when they purchased the property. The tankstands and iron tanks were replaced by a concrete tank in 1990. ;Septic System A septic system was installed in 1990. ;Garden The original garden has disappeared and replaced by new plantings. There are some surviving trees, bushes and fruit trees. ;Cowbails All that remains of the original cowbails is a cement slab where the eighteen-year-old Slim Dusty sat and wrote the song \\"The Rain Tumbles Down in July,\\" in 1945. The replacement cowbails are still intact.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries Homewood is of State heritage significance for its associations with the formative years of country and western singer Slim Dusty (David Gordon Kirkpatrick) 1927 - 2003. It demonstrates the frugal and simple nature of his boyhood and evokes the cultural and musical influences of the Nulla Nulla community and its bush environment that were the inspiration for his songs. Homewood reflects for a broad audience, both Australian and international, Slim Dusty's character and role as a significant musical and cultural creative figure. Homewood was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 27 January 2012 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Homewood and its setting are significant in the course of the cultural history of NSW for their ability to demonstrate the frugal and simple nature of Slim Dusty's childhood and formative years - a lifestyle and a landscape reflected in his character, compositions and performances throughout a long and successful career of iconic national significance . The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Homewood is of state significance for its association with the life and work of Gordon Kirkpatrick ('Slim Dusty') a musician, composer and performer of national stature. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Homewood is locally significant as an example of a small wood and iron house which was the main residence of small dairy farmers and of which Homewood is the only original remaining significant example along and by the Nulla Nula Creek. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Homewood is socially significant at a state level in its ability to evoke for a broad audience both Australian and international, Slim Dusty's character and role as a significant musical and cultural creative figure. The place is held in high esteem by Australians who revere Slim Dusty and his music. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Homewood is locally significant as a representative example of working class housing built by small dairy farmers on the Upper Macleay from the 1890s through to 1950. It used local timber plus mass-produced materials such as corrugated iron. It is a modest timber dwelling with its original tankstand and clothesline out the back still intact. Homewood is similar to the early buildings on outlying stations which were often replaced by more substantial houses once families became more prosperous. The nearby village of Bellbrook (a National Trust Heritage Village) has surviving houses and buildings of similar construction.

Persson was born in Allerum, Sweden. He started his career as a fifteen-year-old in 1851, as a shop assistant in a store run by his uncle. In 1860 he opened his own business, where he imported and sold guano for use in fertilizers. The operation went well, and from 1872 to 1875 he ran the company Nils Persson's guano- svavvelsyrefabrik (Nils Persson's Guano‚ÄìSulfuric Acid Factory) in Helsingborg. In 1875 he became the director and chairman of the company Sk√•nska superfosfat- og svafvelsyrefabrik AB (Sk√•ne Superphosphate and Sulfuric Acid Factory, now part of Kemira), also in Helsingborg. For this he needed phosphate and sulfuric acid. In the beginning, the phosphorus was obtained from fossil bones, but soon he started imported phosphorus from Florida and North Africa. In 1887, Persson started the company Sulitjelma Mines in Norway, where he extracted pyrite. The ore in Sulitjelma was also rich in copper, which resulted in him co-founding the Helsingborg Copper Works (Helsingborgs Kobarverk AB) in 1900 together with a sulfuric acid plant. In Norway, he also mined iron ore. In 1901, he sold his rights in the Dunderland Valley to the Edison Ore-Milling Syndicate Limited. The sale price was reported to be NOK 3 million, which was partly transferred in the form of bonds in the company. Persson was requested to become the \\"consulting director\\" of the company, owned by 55 stakeholders, of whom 52 were English. The Edison Ore-Milling Syndicate had been created to exploit a method invented by Thomas Edison. The new method involved processing the iron ore with an electromagnetic separator, resulting in iron concentrates, which were then used to produce pig iron and steel. In 1903, Persson, together with the engineer Alfred Hasselbom, discovered and acquired the rights to the ore deposits at Salangen in Troms county. In 1906, Persson sold his rights in Salangen to two German companies. In 1907, the company Salangen Mining Limited (Salangen Bergverksaktiebolag) started up the Salang Works (Salangsverket), which were closed down in 1912 after a short but busy period of operation. Persson was criticized by some Norwegians for his profitable business in Norway. By a royal decree of October 28, 1907, he and the R√∏stvangen Company Ltd. (Aktieselskabet R√∏stvangen) were refused their joint application for a license to acquire mining rights at the R√∏stvangen deposits in Hedmark, in the same area where the R√∏stvangen Mines had been established in 1904. From 1875 to 1903, Persson served as the vice- consul for the Netherlands. From 1894 to 1911 he was the German consul in Helsingborg. Persson died in Helsingborg.

It was built from 1890. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  On 9 October 1861 a Mr W. Smith presented the parcel of land on which the Church now stands and a small timber hall which was used as a schoolhouse was erected shortly afterwards on the land. In September 1883 the Rev J. Miller Ross held a meeting of Presbyterians on the Macleay and he was told that there was room for two more Presbyterian Charges. It was decided to start with one, and the outcome was the ordination and induction of Matthew Bell on Sunday, 30 March 1884, as the first Minister of the Kempsey Charge. As a result the schoolhouse was converted into a Church in 1884. A church was also built at Fredrickton and preaching stations also included Gladstone, Belgrave and Green Hills. Bell was transferred to Urana in 1888. The Rev John Taylor was inducted on 24 June 1888 and at once formed a Session. On 16 February 1890 a new church opened in Kempsey, costing 600 pounds and a further 150 pounds for furnishings. It was constructed adjacent to the old church. In 1983 the Heritage Council was advised that it was proposed to demolish the Church, old schoolhouse (Church Hall) and manse for the development of a shopping centre. Following a site inspection and report of the Church, the Heritage Council at its meeting of 2 November 1983 recommended that an Interim Heritage Order be placed over the property to allow the excision of a suitable curtilage for the Church. Following representations by the Presbyterian Church, the local member and the developer it was agreed that a compromise was reached involving retention of the Church and Church Hall and a reduced curtilage, but provided for the demolition of the Manse. This compromise left the way open for the Church and Church Hall to be retained and reused. The congregation vacated the building and moved to a new church in Rudder Street in 1984. The Interim Conservation Order was gazetted on 16 November 1984. A Permanent Conservation Order was placed over the Church and Church Hall on 19 July 1985. The Church and Church Hall was transferred to the State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. The building has been used as a retail store since being vacated by the church, and now opens out on one side to the car park of the 1980s shopping centre, with a supermarket now at the rear of the former church. In 2017, a charity shop operated by The Smith Family opened in the building.

It was designed by the Colonial Architect's Office under James Barnet, and was built by Gabriel and McMorrine, with additions in 1903-04 built by Hocking Brothers. The property is owned by Australia Post. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 December 2000.  History  = Background = The first official postal service in Australia was established in April 1809, when Sydney merchant Isaac Nichols was appointed as the first Postmaster in the colony of NSW. Prior to this, mail had been distributed directly by the captain of the ship on which the mail arrived; however, this system was neither reliable nor secure. In 1825 the colonial administration was empowered to establish a Postmaster General's Department, which had previously been administered from Britain. In 1828 the first post offices outside of Sydney were established, with offices in Bathurst, Campbelltown, Parramatta, Liverpool, Newcastle, Penrith and Windsor. By 1839 there were forty post offices in the colony, with more opening as settlement spread. The advance of postal services was further increased as the railway network began to be established throughout NSW from the 1860s. Also, in 1863, the Postmaster General W. H. Christie noted that accommodation facilities for postmasters in some post offices was quite limited, and stated that it was a matter of importance that \\"post masters should reside and sleep under the same roof as the office\\". The appointment of James Barnet as Acting Colonial Architect in 1862 coincided with a considerable increase in funding to the public works program. Between 1865 and 1890 the Colonial Architects Office was responsible for the building and maintenance of 169 post offices and telegraph offices in NSW. The post offices constructed during this period were designed in a variety of architectural styles, as Barnet argued that the local parliamentary representatives always preferred \\"different patterns\\". The construction of new post offices continued throughout the 1890s Depression years under the leadership of Walter Liberty Vernon, who retained office from 1890 to 1911. While twenty-seven post offices were built between 1892 and 1895, funding to the Government Architect's Office was cut from 1893 to 1895, causing Vernon to postpone a number of projects. Following Federation in 1901, the Commonwealth Government took over responsibility for post, telegraph and telephone offices, with the Department of Home Affairs Works Division being made responsible for post office construction. In 1916 construction was transferred to the Department of Works and Railways, with the Department of the Interior responsible during World War II. On 22 December 1975 the Postmaster General's Department was abolished and replaced by the Postal and Telecommunications Department, with Telecom and Australia Post being created. In 1989, the Australian Postal Corporation Act established Australia Post as a self-funding entity, which heralded a new direction in property management, including a move towards smaller, shop-front style post offices away from the larger more traditional buildings. For much of its history, the post office has been responsible for a wide variety of community services including mail distribution, as agencies for the Commonwealth Savings Bank, electoral enrolments, and the provision of telegraph and telephone services. The town post office served as a focal point for the community, most often built in a prominent position in the centre of town close to other public buildings, creating a nucleus of civic buildings and community pride. = Kempsey Post Office = Europeans first settled in the Kempsey area in the mid-1830s, when limekilns were built along the Macleay River to supply the penal settlement at Port Macquarie. In 1836 Enoch Rudder, a squatter, advertised land for sale on his property, in a town he named Kempsey, where East Kempsey now stands. In the same year the Commissioner for Crown Lands established his regional headquarters on the river bank opposite Rudder's land. These two establishments, along with a growing timber industry and fertile farming land, encouraged the further settlement of the area and growth of the town of Kempsey. The first Postmaster, Edgar Alderidge was appointed to Kempsey in August 1843, with the first office opening one week later on 1 September. Between 1843 and 1859 the Kempsey office was located in East Kempsey; however, from 1859 the post was delivered to West Kempsey, where the new Postmistress, Miss E. P. Dangar, was building a new store, part of which she proposed to be used as the Post Office. In August 1859 the Post Office was relocated to Dangar's store. In May 1870 the first telegraph line was connected to Kempsey, with the Telegraph Office being located in West Kempsey, being the only intermediate station on the Armidale to Port Macquarie line. The Telegraph and Post Office operated out of separate buildings, due to both services being conducted by different departments. In July 1875, Robert Burdett Smith, MP applied for the erection of an official Post Office at West Kempsey, and ¬£1,850 was put on estimates for the purchase of land and erection of the building. At this time there was a post office at Kempsey, West Kempsey and East Kempsey, and it was pointed out that a site for the new West Kempsey office would need to be carefully considered, as there was much more business being conducted at Kempsey than at the other two offices. By 1878, there was enough confusion between the three offices that it had been proposed that both Kempsey and East Kempsey offices should be closed and all mail directed to the new West Kempsey office. In early 1880 moves were begun to have the Kempsey Post Office and the Telegraph Office amalgamated, which was achieved by July of the same year. By 1882 the combined office had an annual revenue of ¬£750, including post, telegraph, money order and Savings Bank business. The same year, a postal inspector reported that the only Government land available for the erection of a new office was at the wharf reserve, which was a hazardous spot during flood periods. Meanwhile, the premises of Mrs Mary Smith were being rented for use as a Post and Telegraph Office from 1 January 1882, for an annual sum of ¬£40. Mrs Smith's building was in Smith Street, on the river side of the road. ¬£2,500 was put aside for the erection of a new post office for Kempsey, with a site still to be found. Mrs Smith offered a site in Smith Street, known as Barrie's Corner for ¬£600. The block was adjacent to the wharf reserve, and had a building used as a hotel standing on it, which Mrs Smith offered to remove. The land had a frontage of 50 feet to Smith Street and a depth of two chains, although when surveyed it was revealed that it encroached on the wharf reserve by 28 feet. With this in mind, and the wharf reserve unavailable, tenders for a site were called. However, Mrs Smith's site was eventually purchased for the original cost of ¬£600. The Colonial Architect's office, under the administration of James Barnet, drew the plans. Tenders were called for the erection of the Post Office building, with the builders Messrs Gabriel and McMorrine being accepted for ¬£2,679. The building was completed and occupied on 23 March 1886. So impressed were the citizens of Kempsey with their new office, that they sent a telegram to the Department of Works congratulating them on it. The two-storey building contained the Post Office, a drawing room, dining room, four bedrooms, a bathroom with force pump and the clock tower. A ball was erected on the top of the clock tower to announce the arrival of steamers at the town wharf. However, within five months the ball was found to be out of order, and was replaced by a flagstaff. The clock itself was also delayed, being installed in 1892. In 1903, ¬£489 was spent to increase the amount of public space available in the postal section of the Office. It had been noted that, due to the small size of the original office, during mail delivery periods anyone could read the telegrams that were being written. A new room was added to the north side of the building, with a door to the street to allow more public space. In January 1908 the Kempsey Manual Telephone Exchange opened in the former battery room at the Post Office, while the fodder storeroom in the stable was converted into the battery room. In 1927 the building was extensively remodelled at a cost of ¬£5,496, with work being undertaken by Mr J. Danton of Sydney. The work included the infill of the original entrance in the northern corner, with the front of the office being converted to an entrance lobby, including private boxes. The telephone exchange was moved to a room of its own, providing extra space within the office for the enlargement of the Postal Department room and public space. New rooms were constructed to house the battery and power rooms, as well as extra bathrooms, a bicycle shed, and a storeroom at the rear of the office. A new entrance was also opened where the old letter box lobby had been. A new stairway from here lead to the Telegraph and Postal Inspector and Clerk's offices on the upper floor. From 1927 until 1981 no major alterations were carried out at Kempsey, other than ongoing maintenance. In 1981 Kempsey was rearranged to become a Distributing Post Office, as part Australia Post's decentralising plan. As a DPO, Kempsey was to act as a focal point for the redistribution of local area mail with air and rail connection to Sydney for regular next day delivery. Due to the increase in the number of staff and the volume of mail the DPO caused, the DPO office was relocated to a separate building in October 1983. During the same month the Post Office building was rearranged, with an increase in the public space available, the remodelling of the Postmaster's office for the Senior Postal Clerk and the relocation of the Postmaster's office to the old telegraph room. New floor coverings were laid and the building repainted. The DPO was closed in July 1988 and their buildings were used by Kempsey Post Office to overcome the continuing need for extra space.  Description  Kempsey Post Office is symmetrical about a three-storey corner clock tower and is in the Victorian Italianate Style. It is a two-storey English Bond brick building with a cream painted, ashlar pattern rendered ground floor front facade. The side and rear facades are of red face brick, and there is rendered quoining to the original corners of the two-storey section. The building has a hipped roof of green corrugated steel and the clock tower is capped by a pyramidal corrugated steel roof. The clock tower has four clock faces installed of unusual design, having white lettering and hands on a black face. The two storey section has three rendered and cream painted corbelled brick chimneys with terracotta pots, punctuating the eastern and northern sides of the building and at the centre. The ground floor of the western facade is classically detailed, with a three-bay arched masonry colonnade, with tan painted keystones to the centre and tan and red painted dentilled entablature above. The colonnade is paved with red clay tiles and has a plaster soffit with moulded cornice. The first floor is face red brick with rendered quoining to corners, a wide rendered band below window sill level and bracketed eaves. This band extends to form a balustraded parapet wall to the single-storey northern addition. The square corner tower has classically detailed arched windows to the first floor level and red painted rendered background to the clock faces of the second level, surmounted by a squat belvedere. There is a recent, intrusive concrete ramp and stairs to the front colonnade. The southern facade is red face brick with cream painted, rendered string courses at ground floor window sill level and ground floor eaves level. There is a recent, intrusive concrete ramp at the centre of the facade matching the ramp to the western facade, accessing the post boxes located within a recessed, tiled porch. Kempsey Post Office appears to have been constructed in four main stages. These include the original two-storey section with corner tower, followed by the single-storey infill to the north in , the eastern single-storey complementary face brick wing addition of -28 and the later, detached, single-storey weatherboard addition along the northern boundary. The main building has been altered and added to substantially since first constructed, a major change being the addition of the complementary stretcher bond brown brick, single-storey wing to the eastern facade of the original two-storey building along the southern boundary. Flush against the adjacent building is a long, single-storey addition of weatherboard and asbestos cement sheet, with a corrugated steel skillion roof. This addition comprises staff amenities to the western end and cycle shed and storage to the eastern end. There is a carport at the easternmost end of this addition. Fenestration of the building is regular. There are arched and squared sash windows to the ground floor, with a fixed multi-pane window over the post boxes to the southern facade. There are tan painted, flat arched lintels over the southern facade windows and rendered voussoirs to the western facade. Doors to the building are non-original; however, there are some earlier doors with decorative fanlights located to the western porch side walls. There are recent automatic sliding glass doors located behind the centre arch to the colonnade. The ground floor of Kempsey Post Office comprises four main areas, including the carpeted retail area at the western end of the building with the standard Australia Post fitout of display wall panels and laminated counters in a grey colour scheme. The three remaining areas include large sheet vinyl areas for mail sorting, storage and contractors to the rear of the building, offices at the centre and staff amenities within the later weatherboard addition to the north. The ceilings of the ground floor include plaster, board and batten, and plasterboard, all with moulded cornices. There are several exposed beams and the lighting of the ground floor consists of suspended fluorescent lights. Intrusive air conditioning ducting is suspended from the ceiling. Architraves to the ground floor openings appear to be original or early. There are sections of original skirting left to original wall fabric showing the effects of general wear and tear and there is a cut dado line in the wall render. Walls are predominantly rendered brick in a pastel pink colour scheme, with plasterboard stud walls enclosing the retail area and office behind. No fireplaces appear to have been retained to the ground floor. Two original four-panel doors are retained to the current cleaner's room and adjacent store; however, the remaining internal doors are modern and there are fanlights over external doors. The main stair is not original and has been constructed within the base of the clock tower. It is a complex polished timber stair with squared posts and balusters, having a yellow/beige sheet vinyl floor with black edge strips. The first floor of the Post Office and former residence currently contains the carpeted Postal Manager's office in the southeastern corner, sheet vinyl storage rooms to the northeastern corner and at the eastern end of the stair hall, and a large, carpeted lunchroom to the west. Later toilets with mosaic tiling are also retained to the north at centre. The first floor currently has an overall pastel green colour scheme. The ceilings to the first floor comprise board and batten to the lunch room, plasterboard with a coved cornice to the hallways, plaster with a wide, simply moulded cornice to the office and storage room and asbestos cement sheet with a quad-mould cornice strip to the toilet areas. Lighting is suspended fluorescent, except in the toilets where attached globes are used. Air conditioning vents are located in the ceilings and there are some units on the walls. Architraves to the first floor openings appear to be original and have been painted. Skirtings also appear to be original and intact. There are predominantly single upper and lower pane sash windows to this level with red-brown painted frames and there is one multiple upper, single lower pane window to the eastern wall of the Postal Manager's office. There is a large fixed multi-pane internal window above the partition wall to the western side of the Postal Manager's office. One original four panel internal door is retained to the first floor of the northern wall of the Postal Manager's office, the remainder being modern flush and half glazed doors. Walls of the first floor are largely rendered and painted original brick fabric with moulded corners. Asbestos or fibre cement sheet partition walls are located to the eastern and southern side of the lunch room, the western wall of the Postal Manager's office and the toilet additions to the north. Picture rails are located on the original wall fabric of the Postal Manager's Office and the adjacent hallway to the west. Fireplaces to the first floor have been bricked in, and surrounds retained to the lunch room, Postal Manager's office and adjacent store to the north. Signage to Kempsey Post Office comprises dark lettering across the western facade below the first floor window sills on the wide, cream painted rendered band and a standard Australia Post sign on a post located at the corner of the building. The Post Office is located on a prominent corner at an important intersection in Kempsey. It is adjacent to the Macleay River bridge and is important for its architectural quality and townscape value. It is a dominant feature in the streetscape and is surrounded by twentieth-century, two-storey shopfronts There is landscaping to both facades of the building, including low, dense vegetation to the front footpath and some large trees, grass and planters to the side. Seating to this side is also provided, as is a low timber rail fence, bins and a twin telephone booth. Display lighting to the clock tower is located on posts to the front and side of the tower and the footpath is made up of concrete pavers. Kempsey Post Office is generally in good condition; however, some cracking, peeling paint, previous patching and general wear and tear is evident to the interior walls, particularly the ground floor. There is some archaeological potential for the site considering the numerous additions and alterations that have occurred over time and the openness to the rear of the site. There is potential for recovering evidence of earlier buildings or structures, such as the previous building on the site used as a hotel. While the original interior fabric has been substantially altered, Kempsey Post Office retains the features which make it culturally significant, including the prominent tower with classical motifs, the pyramidal tower roof, the arcaded loggia, the stucco wall finish and polychromatic brickwork, along with its overall style, scale and location. = Modifications and dates = Original construction in 1886 comprised the Post Office, a drawing room, dining room, bathroom, four bedrooms and a clock tower. It was occupied on 23 March 1886. The original entry to the Post Office was via the western side base of the tower, to a small public space and counter. A flagstaff was installed in 1888 to replace the ball erected on the tower to announce the arrival of steamers. In 1892 the clock was installed to the tower. Alterations and additions to the Post Office were completed , probably including the northern single-storey parapeted addition expanding the public space and creating another entry to the building, one either side of the western facade. Plans from 1917 indicate the location of several outbuildings, including lavatories, lineman's store and a horse shelter, as well as rearrangement of the western first-floor original rooms and installation of a stair to a former balcony on the southeastern corner of the two-storey section. During 1927-28, plans indicate alterations and additions were made to the building, including the creation of the front colonnade, relocation of the internal stair and the construction of the single-storey eastern wing along the southern boundary incorporating the telephone exchange, battery and power rooms and female retiring room. This construction saw the removal of the original two-storey terrace to the southern facade. The weatherboard addition of staff facilities and storage occurred s, and a further addition of the cycle shed to the eastern end occurred later. Removal of wall fabric to expand and open up mail sorting, storage and contractor's room also occurred at this time. Major rearrangements of the retail counter area occurred in 1982-3, along with repairs and maintenance to the building, and during 1985 air conditioning was installed. The Australia Post retail fitout occurred s and probably the installation of the concrete ramps to the western and southern facades.  Heritage listing  Kempsey Post Office is significant at a State level for its historical associations, aesthetic qualities and social meaning. Kempsey Post Office is associated with the early development of the town, as it is linked with the original postal services established in 1843 in East Kempsey, and in 1859 in West Kempsey. Kempsey Post Office has been the centre of communications for Kempsey for over a century, and reflects the growing population and increasing demands for mail, telegraph and telephone services in the area. Kempsey Post Office also provides evidence of the changing nature of postal and telecommunications practices in NSW. The brief period when Kempsey Post Office became a Distributing Post Office to the local area in the early 1980s is also of some historical significance. Kempsey Post Office is aesthetically significant because it is a particularly fine and distinguished example of the Victorian Italianate style, and makes an important aesthetic contribution to the civic precinct in Kempsey. Kempsey Post Office is also associated with the Colonial Architect's Office under James Barnet, a key practitioner of the Victorian Italianate style of architecture. Kempsey Post Office is also considered to be significant to the Kempsey community's sense of place. Kempsey Post Office was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 December 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.

It led to a brief, but bloodless, armed conflict between conscripted forces of the Sheriff of Pierce County and the de facto personal army of the territory's leader, Isaac Stevens. Background The Yakima War between the Yakama tribe and its allies, and the Washington Territory backed by the United States and its tribal allies, erupted in 1855. With the onset of winter, Gen. John E. Wool decided to cease military operations until spring, but territorial Governor Isaac Stevens convened the Washington Legislature where he declared \\"the war shall be prosecuted until the last hostile Indian is exterminated.\\" Arrest of the Muck Creek settlers Governor Isaac Stevens declared martial law on April 3, 1856. On April 3, 1856, two months following the anti-climactic Battle of Seattle, Governor Stevens declared martial law in Pierce County and ordered the arrest of settlers of the Muck Creek area whom he suspected of collaborating with Yakama-allied Indians. The proclamation read: In response to the arrests, the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Washington, Francis A. Chenoweth, issued the writ of habeas corpus ordering the release of the settlers. When Stevens ignored the writ on the grounds he had suspended civil government, Edward Lander ‚Äì presiding judge of the United States District Court for the Territory of Washington ‚Äì summarily found Stevens guilty of contempt of court in facie curiae. On Lander's order, United States Marshal George Corliss was dispatched to the capital city of Olympia with a force of deputy marshals to arrest Stevens. According to a 1900 account by Hazard Stevens, Stevens received the marshals and ‚Äì upon being informed of their purpose ‚Äì calmly challenged them, \\"gentlemen, why don't you execute your office\\"? When the marshals attempted to approach Stevens they were intercepted by Stevens' guards who physically expelled them. Stevens then ordered 150 troops of the Washington Territorial Volunteers (WTV) ‚Äì an extralegal military force answerable only to him ‚Äì to immediately march on Steilacoom, Washington, site of the Pierce County Courthouse, and arrest Lander. The judge was seized from an office in which he had barricaded himself. According to Lander's later testimony, he had contacted the United States Army at nearby Fort Steilacoom to inform them of the situation prior to the arrival of Stevens' troops but recommended no federal forces be called-out to defend the court from WTV forces, though was informed by the commanding officer that no troops would be provided for that purpose in any case. Siege of the Pierce County Courthouse Chenoweth, who had been ill during the drama of the preceding days, left his sick bed on Whidbey Island where he'd been recuperating and canoed to Steilacoom, announcing plans to reconvene Lander's court on 24 May. In response to this latest development, Stevens commanded the WTV to move on the courthouse and take Chenoweth into custody. Learning of the approach of a mounted troop of 30 WTV soldiers, Chenoweth ordered the sheriff of Pierce County to form the posse commitatus. Between 50 and 60 residents of the county were pressed into service by the sheriff for the defense of the court. On the morning of 24 May, Stevens' forces arrived at the court only to find their way blocked by the sheriff's conscripts. Lt. Silas Curtis, commanding WTV troops, sent word of the development to Olympia and requested instructions. Meanwhile, a detachment of the United States Army from Fort Steilacoom arrived at the scene to observe the standoff and with the intent of intervening should violence erupt. Late in the day on 24 May, martial law was rescinded in Pierce County by Stevens and the Washington Territorial Volunteers peacefully withdrew. Aftermath Lander and the settlers were ultimately released. Over the matter of his imprisonment, Lander fined Stevens $50 for contempt; the fine was paid by Stevens' supporters and Stevens pardoned himself of contempt. However, he was subsequently given an official rebuke by the territorial legislature. The following year, Stevens was elected delegate of Washington to the United States House of Representatives. In 1862, during the American Civil War, he was killed in action at the Battle of Chantilly at the head of his men and while personally carrying the fallen colors of his regiment in an open advance against Confederate States forces. He was posthumously promoted to Major General and, the following year, Stevens County, Washington was named in his honor. Lander Hall, a dormitory constructed at the University of Washington in 1957, was named for Edward Lander.

It was built from 1832 to 1840, probably by convicts. It is also known as Bonnie Corner Lime Kilns and Smith's Creek Lime Station. The property is owned by the New South Wales Office of Environment and Heritage. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 March 2011.  History  The Pipers Creek Lime Kilns are located in Dunghutti country (also known in some areas as Thunghutti). Food was plentiful in the Macleay Valley and indigenous people moved between the upper Macleay and the floor of the valley during winter to escape some of the cooler areas found in the valley. The area around the lime kilns was used for general activities such as seasonal hunting. The first sighting of land within the Kempsey Shire by Europeans was recorded by Captain James Cook in 1770. The region was seen again in the 1810s when Europeans landed four kilometres north of Smoky Cape. In 1820 John Oxley and Captain Allman were sent to survey Port Macquarie and report on its suitability as a new settlement for convicts. Oxley was directed to examine inlets north of Smoky Cape. He travelled a short way up the Macleay River, but not far enough to view the more favourable lands pass the initial swamps, marshes, sandy infertile soils and hilly forest country preceding the valley. Limestone was first discovered in NSW on the Belubula River in 1815. Early use of limestone for the production of mortar occurred in the Bathurst area and on the Shoalhaven River, Macleay River and Manning River where deposits were close to expanding settlements. Major centres for the industry developed at Kingsdale near Goulburn and Portland near Lithgow in the late nineteenth century. There are over 400 separate occurrences of limestone in NSW. Although widespread, there is a concentration of sites in the eastern part of the state due to tectonic activity conducive to the development of limestone. Notable occurrences are between Portland and Mudgee, Marulan, Goulburn, Yass, Queanbeyan, Cooma, Molong, Orange, Cumnock, Blayney, Tamworth Attunga/Manilla, Gloucester, Taree, Kempsey and Gundagai.Pearson & McGowan, 2009: 131 Port Macquarie was settled as a penal station in April 1821. The main reason for the establishment of the settlement was to provide a \\"place of banishment\\" at some distance from Sydney. Newcastle, used at that time as a place of secondary punishment, had lost some of its appeal as increasing numbers of convicts escaped with relative ease and returned to Sydney. The rich timber resources of the Hastings River district, described by Oxley on his exploratory investigation in 1818 and King and Oxley in 1819, was another attraction. In addition Governor Lachlan Macquarie, with more convicts on his hands than he could usefully employ, considered that the surplus labour force could be absorbed in road construction and building projects in a new settlement.McLachlan, 1988: 43 The first buildings constructed by the white settlers at Port Macquarie were made of tea-tree branches, bark and long grass. These were soon replaced by weatherboard buildings. By the end of October 1821 buildings and huts capable of housing 400 prisoners and soldiers had been erected.McLachlan, 1988: 59-60 As the settlement progressed the buildings became more solidly built, permanent structures. Clay bricks were manufactured. Pipeclay suitable for moulding sandstock bricks was used and lime for mortar obtained from burning oyster shells (Aboriginal middens?) found in the Harbour, Limeburners Creek and south at Camden Haven.Rogers, 1982: 102 By 1825 with work progressing on the building of St Thomas' Church and other public buildings, large quantities of lime were needed. In addition exports of lime for the insatiable Sydney building industry soon created a shortage. It is not surprising therefore that the depletion of the lime source at Camden Haven was reported in that year.McLachlan, 1988: 119 There was a temporary respite, however, when in 1826 a new Camden Haven bank of lime was discovered.McLachlan, 1988: 147 The first reference to the Pipers Creek limestone deposits was made in November 1831 when Surveyor James Ralfe reported finding a deposit of \\"superior quality\\" limestone six miles from the head of Pipers Creek.McLachlan, 1988: 190 Ralfe and his surveyors had first come to the district in the late 1820s to survey land that prospective settlers wished to buy. This was the result of a decision, made in 1829, to open up the area to free settlers and close down the convict establishment. In July 1830 a proclamation by Governor Ralph Darling made this official.McLachlan, 1988: 193 Ralfe's work entailed journeys of exploration as well as surveying. In May 1830 he reported to the Surveyor General that he had followed Pipers Creek and \\"traced a little beyond the extent of its navigation\\".[Surveyor James Ralfe, letter to Surveyor General, 31 May 1830 (M/F 3084 SRNSW)] The limestone deposits, located further upstream, were not to be discovered until the following year. They are marked on Ralfe's 1833 map of the district. Although the upper reaches of Pipers Creek had still not been surveyed at this stage, the deposits were on the route of the proposed road to the New (Macleay) River. It is not known exactly when the limestone at Pipers Creek was first quarried. Secondary sources date this from the well known 1832 exchange of letters between the Colonial Secretary and the first resident magistrate stationed at Port Macquarie, Benjamin Sullivan. On 30 July 1832 Sullivan wrote: :\\"I having been informed that shells for the purpose of making lime for the use of this settlement have got to be very scarce, I beg leave to suggest the propriety of working the stone lime near Pipers Creek should such a measure meet with His Excellency the Governor's approbation it will from the distance that point is from the Settlement, be necessary to appoint a paid Overseer to superintend the work; the advantages of stone over shell lime I need not point out, and after the kilns are once established the expense will be trifling while the Government will be able to have constant supplies of Roach Lime transmitted to Sydney not only for the public service but also for sale to the public\\".(Letter to Col. Sec. 30 July 1832 (4/2152 SRNSW) Permission for convict labour to be used for lime burning was given, provided that no \\"additional expense was incurred\\" and that the lime be handed over to the Commissariat.(Col. Sec., letter to Benjamin Sullivan, Port Macquarie, 28 August 1832 (SRNSW) Secondary sources, on the basis of this evidence, date the construction of the limekilns from the early 1830s. Lime was undoubtedly scarce, so it may be that no time was lost in exploiting a valuable resource. Ralfe, as well as Sullivan, had noted this shortage. In April 1832 Charles Farrell, a publican and the proprietor of the Settlers' Arms, in Horton Street, Port Macquarie had asked Ralfe to survey the western bank of Limeburners Creek, north of the town.Rogers, 1982: 85 In a letter to the Surveyor General, Ralfe commented that this area had \\"hitherto been used by the Government for the purpose of burning the shells there found into lime\\". He added that he did not \\"consider it of sufficient importance to reserve for that purpose\\".[Surveyor James Ralfe, letter to Surveyor General, 24 April 1832 (M/F 3084 SRNSW)] This seems to indicate that this area was no longer used for lime burning. More extensive research is needed, however, to ascertain exactly when the Camden Haven deposits were exhausted. The pressing need to find other sources of lime for building purposes remained. In September 1832 in a Return of Mechanics at Port Macquarie by Magistrate Benjamin Sullivan noted that \\"I would propose forwarding 1000 bushels of lime, the shells being exhausted and the quality of the Roach lime, which it is stated can be obtained from Pipers Creek, is as yet uncertain.\\"(Letter from Port Macquarie to Col. Sec., Sept. 1832 (4/2152 SRNSW) In the same month he authorised an order that men be employed under Special Constable Edward James Gray in procuring stone lime and not be removed from that activity except by further orders. It is not possible to say exactly when this limestone of \\"uncertain\\" quality was first used locally. Although a return of convict employment records that convicts were involved in lime burning in 1833, they could easily have been burning the last of the oyster shells for lime. Limestone from the district certainly does not seem to have been sent to Sydney in any quantity until the 1840s. Early evidence that the limestone deposits were being worked is seen in an 1840 map on which a limestone quarry, just south of Pipers Creek, is marked. The track from the quarry, marked clearly on subsequent parish and county maps, (for example, the 1872 County Macquarie map) can be faintly discerned on this map. (The adjoining land grant dates from 1831, the year of Ralfe's discovery of the deposit.) There is a reference in the Australian in September 1842 to \\"Port Macquarie Stone Lime\\", known by builders as \\"roach lime\\". This \\"desirable article\\" was said to be arriving \\"by large and continuous supplies from Port Macquarie\\". The article continued: \\"Although this lime has been for some time favourably known to us, yet the difficulties in the way of its transmission from the works on the Wilson, have hitherto prevented its general adoption by the trade in Sydney.\\"Australian, 16 September 1842, p.2 This reference to the Wilson River is confusing. It can probably be explained by the fact that as the article was for a Sydney newspaper, reference was made, for ease of identification, to the best known large river in the vicinity. There is another deposit of limestone in the district at Koree Island but as this is on the Hastings River, it is obviously not the deposit to which this account refers. In October 1842, The Australian reported that the shipments of lime were now on a \\"permanent footing\\".The Australian, 5 October 1842, p.2 In March 1843 Richard Thompson placed an advertisement in the Sydney Morning Herald to let \\"architects, builders and the Trade\\" know that he had concluded \\"extensive arrangements\\" at Port Macquarie \\"for the production of Roach Lime to an extent proportioned to the increasing demand for it in Sydney\\". The advertisement claimed that he was prepared to deliver it in \\"any quantity\\".Sydney Morning Herald, 9 March 1843, p.3 According to the account of New South Wales government geologists Carne and Jones, written in 1919, the limestone was burnt near the quarry site and the lime was carted to Smith's Creek, then shipped down the Maria River to Port Macquarie. They remarked that portions of the old kiln are still standing. They were well constructed of massive sandstone, rectangular in shape, 18 feet (5.4 metres) long, 10 feet (3 metres) wide and 12 feet (3.6 metres) deep with three fire-boxes.J. E. Carne & L.J. Jones, 1919: p 272 Carne and Jones were in communication with Thomas Dick (1877-1927) of Port Macquarie who is best remembered for his evocative photographs of Hastings River Aborigines. Dick was an oyster culturist who had regular contact with members of Sydney's scientific community such as T.C. Roughley, an expert on coastal fish species.(Donaldson (eds.): p 143) His grandfather, John Dick, had settled in Port Macquarie in 1841 - six years before the end of the convict establishment.(Donaldson (eds.): p 137) Thomas Dick wrote extensively on the local history of the area and recounted stories that his father had told him. Carne and Jones seem to have gleaned the story of the convict origin of the limekilns from Dick. Sources local to the area have described the process of lime burning as a fire being set in the pit with wood and the hand quarried limestone blocks being dropped in from above. The lime apparently fell to the bottom of the pit and was removed by scraping it out the front through the openings. The kilns are suggested to have been operated by men rotating from one kiln to the next for each task. Convict workers are suggested to have been housed in wooden dwellings near the limestone quarrying area.Phillips, 2010 Other facilities were also believed to be constructed nearby, including a cookhouse.(Austral Archaeology 1996) However, it is inconclusive whether convicts built the Pipers Creek lime kilns. The land on which the kilns are located was a government reserve from as early as 1836, while private individuals were given permission to get lime from the reserve from at least 1837. A Dr Fattorini is known to have built lime kilns at Piper's Creek by 1837-38. By 1841 both convicts /government gangs and private individuals were working the lime. Kilns in the area continued to be used whenever lime for building works was needed at Port Macquarie until at least the 1880s.Kingswood file and Crown Plan M.108.666, 1838 In 1885 P. Cohen & Co. applied for the area south of Pipers Creek where the limekilns are located for \\"quarry purposes\\".(Plan of Portions: MLs 30 - 33, Co. Macquarie, Parish of Lincoln, Department of Mineral Resources) Local sources suggest that the kilns were reworked on a subsistence basis during the Depression of the 1930s.Austral Archaeology, 1996 The site underwent conservation works to Kilns I, J and K in 2006. ;Early kiln designs and comparisons The lime kilns at Piper's Creek have been described as unusual for their type, and a modification of the intermittent kiln known as the D Kiln, in that they are built into a bank with a stone front wall penetrated by three fire boxes/draw holes. The most unusual feature is the extremely narrow burning chamber. The origin of the style is not known but it has been suggested that it may simply be a response to local conditions such as the scarcity of long handled iron tools needed to operate a full width kiln. D Kilns are so described because of their shape like a letter D in plan form. They have been dug into the face of a bank with a vertical masonry wall built across the front of the pit to create a firing chamber. D kilns had become the commonest type of kiln found in NSW in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Other common forms of kilns found in Australia were the bottle kiln and the inverted bell shaped kiln. Each type was used in both commercial and private kiln production. The oldest of the surviving early kilns in Australia is located on Norfolk Island where part of an 1802 kiln exists, while an 1845 kiln is in excellent condition. The 1845 kiln is an inverted bell type as are 1840s Kilns found in Port Arthur, Tasmania and St Helena's Island in Moreton Bay Queensland (1860s). Three kilns are located at a settlement previously known as Port Essington in the Northern Territory. These bottle shaped kilns were constructed between 1838 and 1849. Most of the surviving D Kilns were constructed late in the nineteenth century including Kingsdale near Goulburn (1880s)Pearson, 1990: 28-31 Other lime kilns are known to be extant up on the Maria River near the Pipers Creek Kilns but are believed to be not in as good condition. There is also a kiln at Cliefden in the Blayney/Cowra region.  Description  The Pipers Creek lime kilns are located within Kumbatine National Park (formerly Maria River State Forest) approximately 12 km south of Kempsey and west of the Pacific Highway. They are only accessible via fire trails and then on foot. The sites are generally isolated with bushes, grasses, small trees and other undergrowth encroaching on them. Although the kilns themselves are clearly visible due to recent work and maintenance, associated worksites and building footings are now generally overgrown and almost invisible to the casual observer. The lime kilns are built into the side of hills next to the limestone resource and near associated structures. They are constructed of rough rubble stone with lime-mortar as bonding. The kilns were originally covered with render which is now exfoliating. ;Lime Kiln \\"I\\" Approximate location of cook house remains and general view of vegetation in the vicinity of Kiln \\"I\\" This kiln is located north of Bonnie Corner Road. It is accessed via an unformed track through the gently sloping landscape. The areas immediately beside the track are relatively clear of trees, giving way to moderately treed areas beyond. These areas between the track and the trees beyond contain a variety of now overgrown features which are believed to be associated with the lime kilns, including: * the remains of a brick structure thought to be the guardhouse (including brick footings); * rough stones set in lime mortar on a raised impression; * treeless grassy area; * shallow depressions thought to be exploratory digs for limestone; * large water-filled circular depressions; * tumbled remains of rough stone walls thought to be the cookhouse; * pile of rubble, gravel, small stones 30m from kiln I; These features are not easily recognisable and many could easily by mistaken for natural features. The remains of buildings are limited and overgrown and could not be assessed in the future without removal of overgrowth. The kiln itself is located within a clearing. On entering the clearing a large interpretive sign provides basic information about the kiln. Several mounds appear to consist of materials associated with the lime burning. Small stones are scattered throughout the site while grasses and saplings have begun to encroach, particularly at the edges of the clearing. The kiln is located beyond the sign and is a large rectangular structure built into the hill of approximately 8m long x 3.6m wide x 2.4m high. This construction style allowed a flue to be formed. It is constructed of a rough rubble stone kiln with a lime based mortar used for bedding. There is evidence of a render which is now exfoliating. Wing walls at either end of the kiln act as retaining walls in the hillside to create a level construction and working surface in front of the firing chamber. What appear to be large spoil and debris mounds are piled against the walls. The fire holes in the front of the kiln consist of 3 rectangular openings approximately 5.5 metres long by 1.7 metres wide with a recently replaced ironbark lintel over the top to support the wall above. The old lintel is located on the hill behind the kiln. The burning chamber is unusually narrow (approx 5.5m long and 1.7m wide) with an open top. Stones located in the fire chamber are likely to be associated with the lime burning activity or to have dislodged from the structure. The kiln's construction into the hillside allow lime and fuel to be carried up the hill and dropped through the open top into the chamber. Evidence of mortar inside chamber suggests that it was probably originally lined with mortar. Repointing of some surfaces within the chamber with a soft lime mortar has taken place during recent conservation works. The presence of a lot of stone on the hill to the rear of the kiln is likely to be limestone brought up the hill to be used in the kiln. Weeds have grown in the crevices and over the stones of the kiln but are subject to periodic maintenance. A consolidated lime block approximately 1 metre high is located to one side of the kiln, at a distance of approximately 20 metres from the kiln. Although covered with leaf litter and moss and appearing to have partially deteriorated, it is clearly a substantial item in the clearing. ;Lime Kiln \\"J\\" Kiln \\"J\\" Like kilns I and K, Kiln J is located in a clearing accessed by an unformed track. The clearing is located within a moderately treed area It is built into a hill and is approximately 8m long x 3.6m wide x 2.4m high with wing walls at the front retaining the hill to create a level construction and working surface in front of the burning chamber. It is constructed of a rough rubble stone with a lime based mortar used for bedding. There is evidence of a render which is now exfoliating. Like the nearby kilns, the burning chamber is unusually narrow (approx 5.5m long and 1.7m wide) and open at the top to allow lime and fuel to be gravity fed. Evidence of mortar inside the chamber suggests that it was probably originally lined with mortar. Repointing of some surfaces within the chamber with a soft lime mortar has taken place during recent conservation works. This kiln differs to kilns I and K in that it has double stone lintels over the three fire draw holes rather than a timber lintel. The fire holes themselves are of an arched, almost bottle like shape. The stonework appears to be more refined in its construction. Some regrowth of weeds and other plants has begun to occur but will be controlled with regular maintenance. Several mounds of lime and limestone are located in front of the kiln. ;Lime Kiln \\"K\\" Lime Kiln \\"K\\" This D kiln is located in a small clearing off the rough, unformed track known as Convict Road. Similar in design to kilns I and J, it is also constructed into the side of a hill and is approximately 8m long x 3.6m wide x 2.4m high with wing walls at the front retaining the hill to create a level construction and working surface in front of the burning chamber. It is constructed of a rough rubble stone with a lime based mortar used for bedding. However, the throat of the fire holes is constructed of flags rather than rubble stone. There is evidence of a render which is now exfoliating. Like the nearby kilns, the burning chamber is unusually narrow (approx 5.5m long and 1.7m wide) and open at the top to allow lime and fuel to be gravity fed from the hill above. A brush box timber lintel over the three rectangular fire holes is a more recent replacement of a previous lintel. Again there is evidence of weed growth which will be subject to periodic maintenance. A large 1 metre high mound of lime is located at the northern corner and in front of the kiln. A fourth kiln, Lime Kiln \\"L\\" was described in 2003 as located west of kiln J, cut into the bank of Pipers Creek. There is no archaeological description of this kiln available and it is unclear whether it still exists. Mention of its existence is extremely limited. It has previously been described as having two fire box/draw hole openings covered by silt from creek flooding. The front wall was a very thin structure of hand fitted rock. When last sighted it was in a poor state of repair and threatened by nearby trees.NPWS, 2003 = Condition = As at 9 March 2010, the recent work on Kilns I, J and K had stabilised the structures using conservation and traditional trade techniques, which had returned them to a condition where the visiting public can now understand them. The remaining items have not had works undertaken on them and their hidden nature makes them difficult to access. The variety of the archaeological resource suggests that the potential to demonstrate the layout and workings of the site is likely to be high.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries The Pipers Creek Lime Kilns have state significance as an important example of only a few extant early-mid nineteenth century period lime kilns in NSW. They are also highly likely to be a unique variation of their type. The quality of the extant fabric together with the history of the kilns' contribution to lime production in early and mid nineteenth century New South Wales make them an important physical reminder of an industrial process that was crucial to the ongoing construction of permanent buildings in Port Macquarie, and the colony more generally. Pipers Creek Lime Kilns was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 March 2011 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Pipers Creek Lime kilns have state and local significance as an example of early to mid nineteenth century lime kilns in NSW. The construction of the kilns also have local and state historical significance as an industrial site developed as a direct result of a growing demand for lime to cater for the increasing construction of permanent brick structures in Port Macquarie from 1825, and general building works in Sydney and the broader colony. The kilns contributed to increased local lime production from 1840 in response to even greater demand for the product, and a depletion of previously used lime resources such as shell. The kilns' ongoing operation, despite the harsh environment which they were located in and their distance from substantial transport networks, are a clear suggestion of a lack of sizeable or suitable lime resources in more accessible and easily worked areas of the district or the state. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Piper's Creek Limekilns have state technical significance as an unusual, and perhaps unique variation in NSW of the traditional D-shape intermittent lime kiln in that they are built into a bank rather than being freestanding. The limekilns also have technical significance in that they demonstrate the methods of lime burning in the 1830s in NSW and can be compared with other contemporary lime kilns such as Port Arthur, Goat Island and Norfolk Island. Their location and distance from the Maria River are a reminder of the harsh conditions faced by those working the kilns and relocating the lime for transport. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Piper's Creek Lime kilns have state research significance as an example of an early use of D shape lime kilns in NSW, and the manner in which this style could be adapted for use to suit varying local conditions or the availability of necessary tools or materials. They demonstrate changes in construction techniques with their slight variations in design. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The kilns have rarity value at a state level due to the small number of lime kilns in existence in NSW from the early to mid nineteenth century and the seemingly unique variation on D-shaped kilns these represent. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Pipers Creek Lime Kilns are representative of an early version of a class of limekilns that became prevalent in NSW in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

Kelulus or kalulus is a type of rowing boat used in Indonesia. It is typically small in size and propelled using oar or paddle. However, for long distance voyages, this boat can be equipped with sails. It is not the same as prahu kalulis of the eastern part of the Indonesian archipelago.  Etymology  The name kelulus seems to be derived from Malay and Javanese word \\"lulus\\", which means \\"to go right through anything\\". According to Hobson-Jobson, the literal translation would be \\"the threader\\".  Description  The earliest report of kelulus is from Hikayat Raja-Raja Pasai (Chronicle of the Kings of Pasai) of the 14th century, in which they are mentioned as one type of vessel used by the Majapahit empire. Although they are not well described, kelulus is one of Majapahit's main vessel types after jong and malangbang.Chronicle of the Kings of Pasai, 3: 98: After that, he is tasked by His Majesty to ready all the equipment and all weapons of war to come to that country of Pasai, about four hundred large jongs and other than that much more of malangbang and kelulus. From Portuguese sources, they are transcribed as calaluz (calaluzes for plural form), whereby they are described as \\"A kind of swift rowing vessel used in the Maritime Southeast Asia\\". Tome Pires in 1515 reported that the pates (dukes) of Java has many calaluz for raiding, and described: > \\"...but they are not fit to go out of the shelter of the land. Kelulus were > specialty of Java. They are carved in a thousand and one ways, with figures > of serpents, and gilt; they are ornamental. Each of them has many of these, > and they are very much painted, and they certainly look well and are made in > a very elegant way, and they are for kings to amuse themselves in, away from > the common people. They are rowed with paddles.\\" > \\"... They go out in triumphal cars, and if they go by sea [they go] in > painted calaluzes, so clean and ornamental, with so many canopies that the > rowers are not seen by the lord; \\" In 1537, Javanese kelulus encountered in Patani are described as having two rows of oars: one is made of paddles, the other one is \\"as galleys\\"; they carried 100 soldiers, with much artillery and firearms. Gon√ßalo de Souza, in his Coriosidades writes that they have 27 oars (54 rowers?) and 20 soldiers and are armed with small swivel guns (falconselhos) at bow and stern.Coriosidades de Gon√ßalo de Souza, manuscript in the Biblioteca da Universidade de Coimbra, Ms. 3074, fol. 38vo. Spanish dictionary lists them as \\"Small boat used in the East Indies\\". Portuguese historian Ant√≥nio Galv√£o in 1544 made a treatise about Maluku, which lists the types of boats from the region, including the kalulus. He described the hull as being egg shaped at the middle but sloping upwards at both ends. At the prow they are shaped like high snake neck with the head of a serpent and the horns of a deer.  Usage  Kelulus were used as transport vessel or war boat. Majapahit overseas invasion used kelulus, usually in uncountable numbers. The pati of Java had many war kelulus for raiding coastal villages. During the Demak Sultanate attack on Portuguese Malacca of 1513, kelulus were used as armed troop transports for landing alongside penjajap and lancaran, as the Javanese junks were too large to approach shore. Queen Kalinyamat of Jepara attacked Portuguese Malacca in 1574 with 300 vessels, 220 of which are calaluzes and the rest were jong. The attack ended in failure for the Javanese.Marsden, William (2012). The History of Sumatra: Containing an Account of the Government, Laws, Customs, and Manners of the Native Inhabitants. Cambridge University Press. p. 431. In 1600, king Chiay Masiuro (or Chiaymasiouro) of Demak embarked in a calelus from Blambangan which has been equipped with oar and sail, to the south. After 12 days, he arrived at Luca Antara or Java Major, which is believed to be Australia. There he received by the syahbandar, and stayed for several days. Chiaymasiuro found out that the inhabitants were Javanese, but with mixed culture of Java, Sunda, and Bali. After he returned to Blambangan, the news of the voyage made great astonishment and public notoriety in Java.

Akin to the 19th- century slogan Art for art's sake, or \\"l'art pour l'art,\\" the work of art is seen as a self-sufficient product independent from the personality of its creator. Categorization Art for Art is a movement in visual contemporary art, represented by a group of American, European, and Chinese artists. They work in various styles and techniques, but hold to the same ideology, supporting the idea of the value and significance of the piece of art as an act of creation and self-expression. This movement denies the social influence of the artist‚Äôs name on the artwork‚Äôs true value, but relies on the principle of anonymity in art, hence the name of the movement \\"Art for Art\\" that underlines the elimination of the artist from the work. The term 'Art for Art' is also associated with the deliberate abandonment of the art elitism and returning to its initial decorative and aesthetic functions. Such artists usually hide their real identities under monikers and thus conceal the personal data that can influence the judgment of their works. Artists that belong to the Art for Art movement are Harry Carlson, John Atwood, Bertha Delisi, Alice Zimmermann, Patrick Duchamp, Max Rey, Jing Wu, Otto Wagner, Ursula Larsen, Sofia Rossi, and Sofia Delano. The term 'Art for Art,' inspired by the 19th-century movement Art for art's sake, was chosen by the founding group of artists and first officially used in 2016 as the name of their inaugural Art Exhibition in Monaco and organized by Franck Monsonego who used all his long experience for the launch of this new artistic project, although this direction, as an association of independent artists, had existed for some time.

It was a landmark event in the development of public art. Exhibition Mary Jane Jacob, the curator of the exhibition, originally conceived it in 1991, inspired by David Hammons' House of the Future from the 1991 Spoleto Festival USA, which she also curated. The exhibition, which cost $800,000, was sponsored by nonprofit organization Sculpture Chicago and financially supported by the National Endowment for the Arts and various private groups. The program consisted of eight separate projects, each of them developed over an extended period of time. The exhibition was originally titled New Urban Monuments, but was renamed upon the suggestion of artist Daniel Martinez. The renaming reflected a conceptual shift from static to dynamic public art. Artists All the artists were activists that engaged in collaborations and none were known as object-makers. Aside from Lacy's boulders, all the projects took place in working-class or poor neighborhoods. I√±igo Manglano-Ovalle organized a block party in West Town displaying local young people's videos. Daniel Joseph Martinez made an installation with the granite blocks of a destroyed plaza. Together with 800 volunteers from Mexican-American and black neighborhoods, Martinez created a joint parade between the neighborhoods. Suzanne Lacy distributed 100 boulders with the names of local women of distinction around the Chicago Loop. Kate Ericson and Mel Ziegler asked the residents of a housing project to help them design a paint chart with the colors named after the events in the history of public housing, such as Cabrini Green or Pruitt-Igoe Dust. The Haha artist group created a hydroponic garden for AIDS volunteers in a storefront in Rogers Park. Robert Peters collected Chicago slurs in a survey and made them available as recordings on a publicized toll-free telephone number. Mark Dion and his team made micro-expeditions to the Lincoln Park Zoo, the lagoon and the surrounding park, collected samples and displayed them in a Lincoln Park indoor site. Finally, Simon Grennan, Christopher Sperandio and twelve factory workers made \\"The Candy of Their Dreams,\\" a chocolate bar with almonds. Reactions The event was criticized by some for its often superficial approach to complex problems and for addressing issues that are better addressed by social services. Others hailed it as one of the most important public art events in North America in the twentieth century.Kwon, 103 Frieze commented: \\"Culture in Action framed its artists, its communities and its viewers themselves as the structure and content of its art.\\" References External links *Culture in action: a public art program of Sculpture Chicago, Bay Press, 1995 Category:Contemporary art exhibitions Category:Art exhibitions in the United States Category:Public art in Chicago Category:May 1993 events in the United States ","title":"Culture in Action"},{"id":"57928824","text":"Sonarpur Junction railway station is a Kolkata Suburban Railway Junction Station on the Sealdah‚ÄìNamkhana line with an approximate distance from Sealdah railway station.

Since a 1992 sale to Freedom Newspapers, its operations have been folded into the Orange County Register. The Register is currently a property of Digital First Media.  History  Founded by Edgar Johnson with over 300+ subscribers in 1891, the newspaper was first published as the Weekly Tribune of Orange County. By 1914, The Tribune had moved to 5 times a week publication. The News Tribune name was the product of the 1926 merger of the Fullerton News and the Fullerton Daily Tribune. After the merger, the News Tribune was sold three years later for $125,000 to W. Kee Maxwell in 1929. In the early and middle part of the 20th century, the Fullerton News Tribune was one of the more modern California daily newspaper organizations; it was the first California newspaper to print with Linotype printing presses, and the first small city daily in Southern California to have leased a teletype news wire and a UPI photo wire service. The Fullerton News Tribune was sold to Edgar F. Elstrom in 1939. Elfstrom had worked as the secretary to newspaper magnate E.W. Scripps The Daily News Tribune grew in circulation over the next 30 years, and had a daily home and newsstand circulation 6 days a week in the growing cities of Fullerton, Brea, Placentia, Yorba Linda, La Habra, Buena Park, and also two small northern sections of both Anaheim and Villa Park. In 1973 The News Tribune, over 4 months, switched from hot lead linotype processing of typesetting and press plates to cold type press printing. This changeover to cold plates was completed in the summer of 1973. The News Tribune's maximum circulation during the mid 1970s was just over 29,500 newspapers printed and distributed Monday thru Saturday. Many News Tribune editorial staffers believed the News Tribune could have grown in circulation far more rapidly in the '60s and '70s by venturing into rapidly growing Anaheim. At that time Anaheim had a small daily newspaper, The Anaheim Bulletin, a newspaper which had a five-days a week daily circulation of only about 7,500. Daily Tribune staffers were told News Tribune owner Edgar Elfstrom had a handshake agreement with Santa Ana Register owner R.C. Hoiles to not expand the News Tribune into greater parts of Anaheim, Villa Park, and Orange. In return, the Santa Ana Register would not expand more into the News Tribune's primary North Orange County circulation areas. In 1973, after deciding to retire, News Tribune owner Edgar Elfstrom sold the News Tribune to Scripps-Howard Newspapers, in December 1973. Over the next 10 years, the Daily News Tribune was not actively supported by Scripps Howard, a large chain which had no other daily newspapers west of Denver, Colorado. After 1978, the News Tribune experienced ongoing declines in circulation, and in consultation with its parent company, Scripps Howard, the newspaper cut nearly 25% of the paper's editorial staff in 1983. The newspaper then also reduced daily coverage areas, and the News Tribune finally changed to once weekly publication in 1985. Until it moved to a weekly publication schedule in 1985, The Daily News Tribune was Orange County's longest-running daily newspaper. The Daily News Tribune was purchased in 1987 by Community Media Enterprises. In 1992, The News Tribune was sold to Freedom Newspapers of Santa Ana, for an undisclosed sum. Freedom Newspapers also owned the Orange County Register and the Fullerton News Tribune became a local edition of the larger Register.

In 1928, as Slawa Horowitz, she created a design for an improved compact folding umbrella, which was patented in 1929. Slawa was the wife of the Austrian-Australian sculptor Karl (Karol) Duldig, and mother of Eva de Jong-Duldig, champion Australian tennis player and founder of the present-day Duldig Studio, an artists‚Äô house museum in Melbourne, Australia.  Early years  Slawa Horowitz Duldig was born in Horocko, Poland, to Nathan and Antonia (‚ÄòToni‚Äô) Horowitz. Nathan Horowitz was then the director of a flour mill in the nearby city of Lwow. Her maternal grandparents, the Meisels, were local landowners and operated a mixed farm. In 1911, concerned by increasing political unrest, the Horowitz family relocated from Poland to Vienna, Austria. Slawa attended a convent school and showed early promise as a pianist. The three Horowitz children were to follow creative pursuits, with Slawa becoming an artist and designer, her sister Aurelie (‚ÄòRella‚Äô) an actress, and brother Marek, a lawyer who also wrote poetry and composed music.  Education  On leaving school, Slawa received training in the fine arts at the Viennese School for Women and Girls. From 1922 to 1925, Slawa studied with the Viennese sculptor, Anton Hanak, an affiliate of the late nineteenth-century Vienna Secession artistic movement and friend of the founder, Gustav Klimt. In 1929, she graduated from the Akademie der Bildenen K√ºnste Wien (Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna), as the student of Professor Hans Bitterlich, a sculptor. In 1926, her clay sculpture ‚ÄòMother and Child‚Äô had been commended by the Kurjer Lwow (Lwow Courier newspaper) in an exhibition of the work of Professor Bitterlich's students at the Vienna K√ºnstlerhaus.  Invention of the folding umbrella  In 1928, following a wet-weather visit to the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, Slawa conceived the idea for a manageable, handbag-sized folding umbrella. She reflected on the event in later life, \\"‚ÄôIt happened [that] one May morning, a cold and rainy day, I armed myself with a big umbrella and muttered to myself, ‚ÄòWhy on earth must I carry this utterly clumsy thing? Can't they invent a small folding umbrella which could be easily carried in a bag?‚Äô\\" Slawa sought to remedy the problem of cumbersome umbrellas with much ingenuity and the support of her parents, sister Rella and close friend Karl Duldig. She drafted designs and obtained umbrella spokes from an industrial source on the pretext that she was designing a lampshade. She engaged a watchmaker to assist with the manufacturing process, bought some black silk fabric, made a pattern, and attached the silk to a shaft and spokes. Karl Duldig suggested that the handle be widened to enable the spokes to fit inside. From this, the prototype of a modern folding umbrella emerged. With money loaned by her father to engage Viennese patent attorney Ing. Josef Hess, Slawa filed a patent application for the umbrella design. Patent applications were sent to the United Kingdom, Austria, Germany, Italy, France, Poland and the United States. A patent, Specification 318,577, was issued on 19 September 1929. In the words of Helen Kiddell, ‚ÄòThe umbrella that Slawa patented had a telescopic handle, allowing it to be made more compact. The metal ribs which formed the skeleton under the black silk covering, were innovatively designed to fold up.' The umbrella was commercially branded ‚ÄòFlirt.‚Äô It was manufactured by the firm of Br√ºder W√ºster in Austria, and Kortenbrach und Rauh in Germany. Ten-thousand ‚ÄòFlirt‚Äô umbrellas sold in the first year of production, with Slawa receiving annual royalties until 1938. ‚ÄòFlirt‚Äô featured at the 1931 Vienna Spring Fair; ‚Äò\\"‚Ä¶the sculptress Slawa Horowitz has invented a magic umbrella that can be folded so small it can fit in a handbag‚Ä¶\\"‚Äô enthused a reporter of the Neuigkeits Welt Blatt (New World Paper).  Family  Slawa married Karl Duldig in 1931. Theirs was an artistic union, forged in Anton Hanak's sculpture class. Their daughter Eva was born on 11 February 1938. Slawa and Karl Duldig resided in an apartment at 2 Enzingergasse, Door 14, Vienna, which they decorated in the style of the Wiener Werkst√§tte (Viennese Workshops). They commissioned furniture from the firm of Sigmund Jaray, where Slawa collaborated with the head designer, an architect, to create several significant and unique furniture pieces. Slawa's design innovations included ‚Äò‚Ä¶red leather strapping in a lattice design for the living room chairs‚Äô and a double bed with head and foot featuring, ‚Äò‚Ä¶small rectangular blocks of mahogany and rosewood‚Ä¶intended by her to replicate lace.‚Äô  War years  In 1938, following the annexation of Austria to Nazi Germany, a series of significant human rights violations occurred in Vienna. These included attacks on Jewish homes and businesses, deportations of Jews to Dachau concentration camp, the burning of all Viennese synagogues and prayer houses, and the arrests of 6,547 people. As Jewish people concerned by the potential increasing risk of harm, Slawa, Karl and Eva Duldig departed Vienna for Switzerland. Karl was the first of the family to arrive in Switzerland. Initially, Slawa and Eva remained in Vienna, where Slawa packed the contents of their apartment, which were entrusted to the care of her sister Rella. Slawa had received notification from ‚Äò‚Ä¶the Nazi Gaulieter (District Superintendent)‚Äô that she must evacuate their apartment. The Nazi official offered to purchase the contents of the apartment, and was outwitted by Slawa who advised that the contents had already been sold. Slawa and her friend Melitta Despitz then conspired for Melitta to become the purchaser of the apartment's contents, in the presence of the official. Their ruse was successful, whereby Slawa managed to retain her family's belongings and entrust their care to Rella in Paris. Slawa and Eva travelled to Switzerland on temporary visas instigated by Karl and organised by Swiss immigration official Ernest Speck. In Switzerland, Slawa sold the rights of the ‚ÄòFlirt‚Äô umbrella to Br√ºder W√ºster for 1,000 Reichsmarks. In May 1939, the Duldig family arrived in Singapore as refugees. Karl and Slawa set up an art school and Slawa also found employment in art restoration. With Britain declaring war on Germany, their status as foreign nationals became increasingly problematic. In July 1940 they were expelled from Singapore as enemy aliens. Transported with German and Italian internees on the HMT Queen Mary, they arrived in Sydney, Australia, on 25 September 1940. They were detained in Internment Camp 3, Tatura, northern Victoria. Karl was released from the Camp on 7 April 1942 to join the 8th Employment Company (8th. A.E.C.). Slawa and Eva remained at the Camp until 14 May 1942. With their reclassification from ‚Äò\\"enemy aliens‚Äô\\" to ‚Äò\\"refugee aliens\\"‚Äô on 7 December 1943, Slawa and Karl Duldig settled in Melbourne for the remainder of their lives. Many members of Slawa's family had remained in wartime Europe. On 11 October 1944, Slawa sought news of her sister Rella through the Red Cross. On 28 November 1944, she received notification that Rella and Rella's husband Marcel Laisn√© were residing safely in Paris. There, Rella and Marcel had ensured the safe-keeping of the contents of Slawa and Karl's Viennese apartment during the War. A selection of the Duldig's belongings, including the Sigmund Jaray signature pieces, was shipped to Australia in 1946. They constitute part of the collection at the Duldig Studio. Slawa and Rella were re-united in Paris on 20 June 1968. Their brother Marek, father Nathan, and extended family including the Herzogs, Sobels, Wasners and Spiegels, had ‚Äò‚Ä¶disappeared without any trace‚Äô in wartime Europe.  Teaching career  In 1945, Slawa attained registration as a teacher of Art and German and was employed by Korowa Church of England Girls Grammar School. In 1947, she was appointed Senior Art and Craft teacher at St Catherine's Girls School, where she remained for sixteen years. At St Catherine's School, Slawa was acknowledged for the depth and breadth of her teaching approach, which featured first-hand knowledge of European Old Master art, craft and furniture design, and innovative approaches enabling students ‚Äòfree expression‚Äô and experimental approaches. Slawa was one of the first teachers in Victoria to offer Art as a Matriculation subject. In June 1954, Slawa was one of thirteen women to attend the UNESCO seminar, ‚ÄòThe Role of the Visual Arts in Education‚Äô at Melbourne University Women's College. Slawa participated in an associated working group on ‚ÄòArt in Secondary Schools,‚Äô which forwarded the recommendation that Art should be accorded equal status in the schools with all other subjects. In Melbourne, in approximately 1945, Karl and Slawa Duldig started a hand-made pottery business. Karl produced the ceramics and he and Slawa were involved in their decoration. Their metropolitan Melbourne retail outlets included The Primrose Pottery Shop (which stocked works by prominent Australian artists such as Arthur Boyd), Light and Shade (in the Royal Arcade), and Chez Nous (in Howey Place).  Duldig Studio  Slawa died on 16 August 1975. In accordance with her wishes, the family home and studio at 92 Burke Road, East Malvern was preserved as the Duldig Studio museum and sculpture garden by Eva de-Jong Duldig. The Studio hosts an exhibition of Slawa's work in Modernist Art and Design, including her artistic productivity, immigration experience, and the invention of the ‚ÄòFlirt‚Äô umbrella.  Recognition  In 1977, the McClelland Gallery (now the McClelland Gallery and Sculpture Park) in Langwarrin, Australia, featured the exhibition Slawa Duldig ‚Äì Artist Teacher Inventor. The exhibition included examples of Slawa's drawings for the patent of the ‚ÄòFlirt‚Äô umbrella, and her drawings, paintings and sculptures spanning a period from c.1915‚Äì1974. In 1978, St Catherine's School inaugurated the senior student Slawa Duldig Art Prize. Umbrellas of the ‚ÄòFlirt‚Äô design continued in production during the twentieth century. Prototypes of the ‚ÄòFlirt‚Äô umbrella, as created by Slawa, are held in the collections of the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences in Sydney and the Duldig Studio.

The garden was built by Thomas Parr around 1830 as both a pleasure garden for relaxing strolls and as a kitchen garden to produce fruit, vegetables, and herbs. After a period of decline, the garden was restored first by English Partnerships and then by the local parish council in conjunction with the friends of the garden. History The walled garden was built around 1830 by Warrington banker Thomas Parr to accompany a mansion house. Unusually, Parr included both a pleasure garden and a kitchen garden within the same boundary wall. In addition to enjoying their garden, the Parr family held frequent galas and special events for the community. One annual event called \\"Beating the Bounds\\" involved a walk around the boundaries of the townships of Lymm, Appleton, and Grappenhall, which included the garden.Information board at Grappenhall Heys Walled Garden. Historical records suggest that the estate was at its height from 1875 to 1899. By the 1950s, the estate had become derelict and parts of it were sold off. The house was demolished in the 1970s and the garden passed to English Partnerships for renovation. In 2005 control of the garden passed to Grappenhall and Thelwall Parish Council, which continued restoration in conjunction with a community group called \\"The Friends of Grappenhall Heys Walled Garden\\". In 2012 the garden was given a Heritage Lottery Fund award towards repair of the Victorian glasshouses and completion of the restoration. Description =Pleasure garden= There is a pleasure garden with herbaceous borders, specimen trees, wooded copses, and three ponds. An 1829 tithe map shows the ponds were originally marl pits created by small-scale marl extraction. Over time the ponds became heavily silted up, but were sufficiently deep to obscure workers below ground level when they were eventually excavated during restoration. The footpath around the pleasure garden was named the \\"Master's Walk\\". =Kitchen garden= There is a kitchen garden which produces fruits, vegetables, and herbs, cultivated by the Warrington Organic Gardening Society. Varieties of pear and more than 20 varieties of apple are grown in a small orchard. Grapes and tomatoes are cultivated in fully restored glasshouses. Surplus fruits and vegetables are sold to the public. =Facilities= The garden is a popular attraction in Warrington. Facilities include a cafe, toilets, and free access. In recognition of its high standards, in 2018 the garden was given its second Green Flag Award, a benchmark national standard for publicly accessible parks and green spaces in the United Kingdom.

It was designed for use by Spetsnaz (special forces) involved in reconnaissance and sabotage missions behind enemy lines. The set could also be used by agents for espionage activities. The main mode of operation of the R-350M was the so-called fast telegraph - it allowed for rapid transmission of a previously prepared message, making it near impossible to track the transmitter location. The radio operator would punch code the report on to standard 35mm photographic film using the tape perforator. The encoded film strip consisting of 5-digit digital groups was then fed into a hand cranked reader linked to the radio transmitter. The receipt of such a cipher-telegram was carried out using specialist equipment; a tape recording of the received signal would be played back at a much slower speed allowing the code to be de- crypted.

Judah ben Solomon was born and educated in Toledo, the grandson of prominent rabbi Ziza ibn Shushan. He was a pupil of Meir Abulafia, who induced him to study philosophy and Jewish mysticism. At the age of eighteen he entered into correspondence with the philosophers at the court of Emperor Frederick II. The emperor himself consulted him about scientific matters, and his answers proved so satisfactory that he was invited in 1247 to settle in Tuscany, where he had free access to the imperial court. There he translated into Hebrew his major work, an encyclopedia entitled Midrash ha-·∏§okmah, which he had originally written in Arabic. Midrash ha-·∏§okmah is divided into two parts. The first provides a survey of Aristotelian logic, physics, and metaphysics, and contains, besides, a treatise on certain passages in Genesis, Psalms, and Proverbs. The second part is devoted to mathematics, and contains, also, two treatises: the first, a mystical one on the letters of the alphabet; the other, a collection of Biblical passages to be interpreted philosophically.

She is mostly known for her research in pathology, neurodegeneration, neurovirology and demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis.  Education and early life  Allen was born in Belfast in 1932. Her parents were the Reverend Robert Allen and Doris Allen. She attended Ashley Prep Belfast and Cheltenham Ladies College before going on to study medicine at Queen's University Belfast, graduating in 1957. Career and research Allen established the Regional Neuropathology Service for Northern Ireland in 1972, becoming its first leader. This provided biopsies and autopsies for conditions such as brain tumours, head injuries, brain infections, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. She has published over 200 papers, spanning over 60 years. Her work is focused chiefly on multiple sclerosis, viral infections of the nervous system and penetrating head injury. Her research achievements include discovering markers for multiple sclerosis at the cellular and molecular level, research into the role of viruses in multiple sclerosis, the observation that measles virus spreads transneuronally and probably transsynaptically within the nervous system and research into the cellular level response to penetrating head injury. Allen was Vice President of the Royal College of Pathologists from 1993 to 1996, and in 1997 was appointed the first Director for Research and Development for Health and Personal Social Services in Northern Ireland. In this role, she was responsible for developing the research strategy ‚ÄúResearch for Health and Wellbeing‚Äù, published in 1999. She held this role until 2002. She has also served on the Medical Research Council and on the Joint Medical Advisory Committee of the Higher Education Funding Council for England. Awards and honours Allen was elected to the Royal Irish Academy in 1993 and elected as one of the founding Fellows of Academy of Medical Sciences in 1998. She was granted an honorary doctorate in Medical Sciences from her alma mater Queen's University Belfast in 2003 before being granted both a CBE in 1993 followed by a DBE in 2001, both for Medical Research. Queen's University Belfast honoured Allen in 2008 with a portrait which hangs in the university's Great Hall - at the time only the third female academic from Queen‚Äôs to be recognised in this way.

The Centre was founded in 2002 as a public-private partnership between the Federal Foreign Office and the Robert Bosch Foundation. The local sponsor is the Romanian-German Cultural Society.  History  The Romanian-German Cultural Society was founded by 17 public figures in January 2001, with the aim of creating a German Cultural Centre for Timi»ôoara and the surrounding areas. The president of the cultural society is Elke Sabiel, the former director of the Friedrich Ebert Foundation in Romania, while the cultural centre itself is managed by Alina Baciu. The Romanian-German Cultural Society faced financial difficulties when the Robert Bosch Foundation withdrew as the main sponsor and the cultural centres in Romania had to become financially independent. In order to ensure a regular income for the cultural centres, the society has created language course departments and cultural programmes that convey an up-to-date picture of Germany. Other German cultural centres are located in Cluj-Napoca, Brasov, Sibiu and Ia»ôi. The objectives of the Cultural Society and the Cultural Centre are to promote the German language, to convey an up-to-date picture of Germany and to promote German-Romanian relations through exhibitions, readings, concerts and literature. The team is concerned with promoting contacts between people from Germany and Romania, but also between Timi»ôoara and Banat. The Cultural Centre cooperates locally, nationally and internationally with various partners, German and Romanian cultural and educational institutions, other European cultural centres, municipal and regional institutions, art galleries, foundations and various non-governmental organisations, as well as international partner organisations.  What the Centre offers  The German Cultural Centre Timi»ôoara is divided into three departments: language, library and cultural work. The focus is on the language department where 600 students are enrolled every year. The language department of the German Cultural Centre offers language courses of various difficulty levels as well as the opportunity to take language examinations with a certificate at the Goethe- Institut Bucharest. The language department ensures the cultural centre a certain degree of financial independence through a regular income. The library offers an up-to-date selection of books, journals and audiovisual media in German in a various number of subject areas, such as culture, arts, history, geography, philosophy, German language, German-language literature with a focus on the 20th and 21st centuries, society and economy. The children's library offers an extensive repertoire of books and a various number of board games. The teaching materials centre is a department of the library specially created for educational purposes. It has a large selection of literature on the methodology and the didactics of teaching German, including textbooks, study kits and videos developed by the Goethe Institut. The centre also provides a reading corner and a PC workstation with Internet access. In addition to organizing its own projects, the cultural department also participates in major events in Timi»ôoara. It organizes exhibitions, concerts, readings by German-speaking authors, film and theater performances, seminars and lectures, as well as workshops for German learners. The events are usually bilingual and take place not only in the cultural centre, but also outside the building. The German Cultural Centre participates regularly in the organization of major cultural events in Timi»ôoara, such as festivals, exhibitions and concerts.

Founded in 2014 by Aaron Wiener, Adam Dexter, and current CEO Tom McLeod, Omni debuted its service in Fall 2015. Initially, the company focused on storage and space-management: customers would have their items picked up by Omni, which would categorize and photograph them. When the client wanted their item back, they would request to have it dropped off by Omni, possibly at an additional fee. Omni has since expanded into offering other services such as the option to lend items to friends and the ability to rent out items for profit. As of July 2018, Omni is only available in the San Francisco Bay area, but has announced plans to expand into Portland, Oregon. Omni has raised around $39 million in investment, with nearly $15 million coming from traditional sources such as venture capital firms and approximately $25 million coming in the form of Ripple. Omni ceased operation at the end of 2019. Services Omni's base service is on-demand storage, which began in Fall 2015 for residents and businesses of the San Francisco area. Clients can request that an Omni concierge come to pick up any items that they wish to store. Omni concierges take these items and bring them to a warehouse, where they are categorized and photographed. A user's stored items are available in a digital inventory accessible through the Omni app. When customers request that any stored items be returned to them, the items will be retrieved from the warehouse and brought back by an Omni concierge. All items up to $2,000 in value are guaranteed by the company, which will either reimburse of replace them if lost or damaged. Fees for Omni's storage services can vary depending on what is being stored and how quickly the item must be delivered or picked up. \\"Standard-sized\\" items, such as a jackets or toasters, cost $0.50 per month to store, while larger items, such as bicycles or backpacks, cost $3. Closed containers, which are not individually itemized, cost $7.50 per month. Deliveries of items to clients is at no cost if two days' notice are given, while pickups may be free even if scheduled on the same day. Omni can deliver and pick up items at a minimum of two hours' notice, though a premium is added for this expedited service. On top of their storage services, Omni also allows users to lend items to others, with similar delivery costs and shipping outside of the San Francisco Bay area carrying a 20% surcharge on top of shipping through a non-Omni service. In Fall 2017, Omni began its rental service, permitting users to rent out any items they store with Omni. Omni splits the proceeds equally with the user. In May 2018, Omni announced that it would be expanding into the Portland area. Reception Views on Omni's business have been mixed. Some consumers have viewed Omni as a viable solution to a lack of space and as a way to make some extra money through its rental service. Cyan Bannister, a San Francisco venture capitalist, invested in the company because she believes that \\"all sorts of businesses will flock to Omni for rentals.\\" The proprietor of a business using Omni, Nicolas Grenie of SF Cheese Party, said that it was easy for him to start his business because Omni handled many of the logistics, but also that the price point seemed unreasonable for Omni to make a profit. The President of Boxbee, a company which had offered a storage and sharing service similar to Omni's, had similar concerns, saying \\"The cost of storing, transporting and managing a customer‚Äôs items is much higher than the cost you can charge on a monthly basis to store it.\\" Similarly, April Rinne, who consults for other on-demand companies, said that Omni was \\"making some really big bets on volume.\\" Ryan Delk, Chief Operations Officer of Omni, has commented on these concerns, stating that \\"We invested 2.5 years in building out the supply side of the marketplace and honing the details of a same-day last-mile logistics business.\\" References External Links Omni website Category:Companies based in San Francisco Category:Technology companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area Category:2014 establishments in California Category:American companies established in 2014 Category:Technology companies established in 2014 ","title":"Omni (company)"},{"id":"57929456","text":"Der Theatermacher is a play witten by Austrian author Thomas Bernhard in 1984.  Content  The play is about an actor from the state Playhouse Bruscon, who stops in the small village of Utzbach on tour to perform his play \\"Das Rad der Geschichte‚Äú (\\"The Wheel of History\\"). His whole family (his wife, his son and his daughter) act in the play. At the beginning, Bruscon is in conversation with the landlord of the inn where the play is to take place, insisting that the fire office in the village must allow the extinction of the emergency light at the end of the play. Bruscon complains about the humidity of the room, his fear of a floor breaking through and the fact that Utzbach seems too small for his \\"outstanding\\" work. In addition, learns from the landlord that the day of performance coincides with the famous \\"Blutwursttag\\" (blood sausage day) in the village and that, consequently, many locals won¬¥t have time to watch the play. While rehearsing the play with his children and his wife, who appears to have a cold (\\"Your mother wastes her entire talent pretending to be sick\\"), Bruscon, the dramatist, turns out to be a true tyrant. Again and again, he insults off the theatrical talent of the others, emphasising his own great talent and demands to be served by the others. Often he gets entangled in contradictory statements without realizing it. For example, he says to the son: \\"You are my biggest disappointment, you know it, but you have never disappointed me, you are my useful servant.\\" The only moment of rehearsal in which the family escapes from Bruscon's tirades is when they eat together the local soup speciality, which Bruscon had expressly ordered from the landlord at the beginning. Bruscon's play, in which he says all comedies are included, ultimately goes awry. After violent thunder at the beginning of the performance, the spectators leave the inn because a flash of lightning has hit the inn and it is raining through the roof of the room. Bruscon remains behind in the rain deeply disappointed.  Allusions  \\"Der Thatermacher\\" is rich in allusions to Salzburg and the Salzburg Festival. * The scene Schwarzer Hirsch in Utzbach alludes to the Hotel Goldener Hirsch (Salzburg) in Salzburg, which is located in the immediate vicinity of the festival district. * The dispute over the emergency light refers to the scandal around the second performance of Bernhard's play \\"Der Ignorant und der Wahnsinnige\\" (\\"The Ignoramus and the Madman\\"), which was premiered at the Salzburg Festival in 1972 under the direction of Claus Peymann. * Evem before the premiere, it was said that Oskar Werner was the role model for the theater maker Bruscon in the run-up to the premiere, but this was disputed or doubted by Claus Peymann, the director of the world premiere.Zitat: [...] dann frage ich nur, wen Thomas Bernhard mit dem Theatermacher gemeint hat ‚Äì den Oskar Werner, den Peter Stein oder doch den Claus Peymann?

It was built in 1902 by C. B. Smith. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 June 2008.  History  This group of maritime buildings was a 1902 transplant forced to its new location by an 1893 flood. Until 1893 the Pilot, his crew and all their families worked at Grassy Head a few kilometres north of South West Rocks. In 1893 the valley was devastated by one of the worst floods in its history. It rampaged through the district finally bursting through the sand hills near South West Rocks to form a new entrance, the name it now bears. The Government of New South Wales decided of 1895 to stabilise this most recent breakout and close the rapidly shoaling channel under Grassy Head. Three thousand pounds was voted for a new pilot station at South West Rocks. The new site was pegged out on the eastern side of South West Rocks Creek (known locally as \\"Backwater Creek\\"), a small water body that lies between South West Rocks and the New Entrance. The lowest bid was that of C.B. Smith. The Department of Navigation then amended the plans but Smith agreed to incorporate the changes without increasing the charges. The cottages were pre-cut and were probably the first pre-cut buildings to be built in the Macleay Valley. The complex consisted of five cottages to house the pilot and his four crewmen. The boatman's cottages are numbered sequentially from 1 to 4 and eastward from the Pilot's residence. A boatshed on the banks of Back Creek connected by a flight of stone steps led to the Pilot's residence. The site was chosen due to the uninterrupted views it provided for the Pilot to observe the arrival and departure of vessels at the Macleay River to the northwest and harbouring in Trial Bay to the east. These views were essential for the conduct of the Pilot service and rapid deployment of boat crews. A signal station and flagstaff was built on the headland adjacent to the maritime buildings. This little building was fitted out with lockers for the flags and windows with copper flaps on three sides to act as rests for a telescope. When the crew were delayed by working on the bar or attending to the beacons in the river, their wives would light the beacon a short distance from the station. The first Pilot was Captain John Jamieson who had been in charge of the station at Grassy Head. The wooden Pilot Launch \\"MV Macleay\\" was built and commissioned for service at the South West Rocks Pilot Station. This vessel was one of four pilot boats built to one design for the Maritime Services Board (the other pilot boats were \\"Camden\\", \\"Hastings\\" and \\"Nowra\\"). The \\"Macleay\\" was constructed by Holmes of Sydney. The keel was laid in 1935 and the vessel was commissioned into service in the same year. The \\"Macleay\\" replaced the launch \\"MV Ajax\\" which came into service in 1932 but was destroyed by fire on 21 September 1934. The boat was housed in a boat shed on the eastern bank of South West Rocks Creek where the concrete slab of the boat shed still remains. The \\"Macleay\\" serviced the Trial Bay area until the vessel was decommissioned in the 1960s. Some years later, the \\"Macleay\\" was found at Dora Creek, Lake Macquarie. With funding from a local businessman, Kempsey Shire Council purchased the \\"Macleay\\" and returned it to the Pilot Station complex where it is now situated under a covered shelter in the yard of Boatman's Cottage 2. In 1991 the Macleay River Historical Society urged the community of South West Rocks to organise a working group to restore the boatman's cottage no1. Kempsey Shire council instigated a planning amendment enabling listing of the Pilot station group of buildings at South West Rocks as items of environmental heritage on its LEP. In 1992 the community of South West Rocks restored Boatman's Cottage No 1. Subsequent representation secured use of the land for essential heritage purposes and tourism. In 1998 Council obtained a grant of $24,000 under the NSW Department of Planning Heritage Assistance programme. The purpose of the grant was for restoration of the cottage which formed part of the Pilot Station Group and which was in a state of disrepair at the time of application. Council Operations department supervised the restoration, which was carried out by the community under the direction of Al Geronomi. The plan of restoration and construction was prepared by Messrs David Boram and Associates, Architects and Planners. It was decided to use the cottage as a maritime museum and visitors information centre. The opening was performed by His Excellency Rear Admiral Peter Sinclair AC, Governor of New South Wales, on 10 September 1993. Boatman's Cottage 1 was used prior to 1990 by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. Boatman's Cottage No. 2 was formerly used as a holiday cottage for staff of the Maritime Services Board. The cottage was later transferred from the office of Maritime Safety and Port Strategy (MSS) to the Department for Land and Water Conservation. Boatman's Cottage No. 3 has been used as a police station since the closure of the Pilot Station.  Description  The Pilot Station complex is located in an area known as the Horseshoe Bay Reserve on the southern side of Trial Bay. The Reserve is bordered by: * South West Rocks Creek (Backwater Creek) to the west * Trial Bay and Saltwater Creek to the north * Arakoon State Recreation Area to the east and * Fig Tree Lane, Livingstone Street, Memorial Avenue, Paragon Avenue, Mitchell and Landsborough Streets and Phillip Drive to the south. Horseshoe Bay Reserve incorporates part of the Crown Land Reserve Number 82364 which is listed for Public Recreation. The Reserve is administered by the Department of Lands. Part of the Reserve includes a lease for the operation of the Caravan Park and sub lease for the operation of a Kiosk. Native Title was extinguished on the Reserve as of 22 May 1995. Backwater Creek separates the South West Rocks township from the main entrance to the Macleay River which lies further to the west. To the north of the Pilot Station residences is the flagstaff on Point Briner. Laggers Point, a north-running extension of Smoky Cape, provides shelter from south-easterly winds and enabled the use of Trial Bay as a harbour. The main part of the township of Trial Bay lies to the southeast of the Pilot Station. A caravan park is situated to the west, north and east of the Pilot Station buildings. The complex consists of the Pilot's residence, three of the four original cottages, the signal station and flagstaff at Point Briner, the steps leading to the old boat shed boat which housed the Pilot launch in the adjacent Back Creek, the wooden hulled Pilot launch \\"Macleay\\" and the vistas - north towards the entrance to the Macleay River and SE towards the Trial Bay harbour area. The Pilot's residence and the three existing cottages are of timber construction with red tiled roofs. The red tiles, while not original, retain a feature which caused comment at the time of construction when they were described as \\"rather glaring\\". The floors are tallowwood and the linings are mahogany. The doors and windows are timber and timber framed. Brick chimney pots are intact. The Pilot's residence was built with three bedrooms and the boatman's cottages had 2 bedrooms. The out buildings of the Pilot's residence are intact. The outbuildings include a \\"Rocket Shed\\", storeroom, another shed in the form of a garage, a yard shed, an outside toilet and an outside shower. Boatman's Cottage 1 is currently used as a museum and Visitor Information Centre. The out buildings of this cottage are intact. Boatman's Cottage 2 has been faithfully restored and is a fine example of the Pilot Station Group. The Boatman's Cottage No. 2 comprises a single storey three bedroom weather board residence constructed in approximately 1902. Significant features of the dwelling and curtilage include: 1) Lounge room with original fireplace/chimney; 2) Kitchen; 3) Bathroom; 4) Outside, attached laundry/toilet; 5) Front veranda enclosed; 6) Paling fence; 7) Steel mesh front fence; 8) Tile roofing. The cottage is currently used as a craft centre. Cottage No. 3 has been used as a police station since 1932. Cottage No. 4 was removed in 1968 to make way for a block of units. The wooden signal house and 19m wooden flagstaff on Point Briner are intact. The small signal house, (2.4m x 3m and 3.2m in height,) was fitted with lockers for the flags and there were windows with copper flaps as rests for a telescope on three sides. A black ball would be hoisted on the yardarm to signify if the river bar was closed to shipping. Cones and balls could be used to signal the conditions on the bar, the depth of water and the weather. A set of international flags and Alidis lamps were on hand at all times. The flags are now in the possession of the South West Rocks Maritime Museum. Concrete steps (1.15m wide and 7.4m in length) lead from the Pilot's Cottage to the site of the old boat shed are intact as is the concrete slab on which the boat shed was originally built. The shed and stepped access were built around 1902 in conjunction with the Pilot's residence. Spatially, the complex retains its position and functional layout of various elements which provided convenient control of the movement of vessels in Trial Bay. The wooden hulled Pilot Boat \\"MV Macleay\\" is overall, on the waterline and had a beam. The vessel was fitted with a Reynolds-Newbury (Manchester) diesel 20 hp engine and was self righting. The concrete slab of the boat shed where the Pilot boats were kept is still in situ on the eastern bank of South West Rocks Creek. In 2003 a shelter for the vessel, partially funded by a $10,000 Heritage Incentives Program grant, was constructed by Kempsey Shire Council. The shelter has stabilised the deterioration of the vessel which, although not seaworthy, is in fair condition. = Condition = All the cottages were reported to be in reasonable condition as at 24 May 2006. The Pilot cottage was in need of repair but was not derelict. The grounds of the cottages have not been disturbed by redevelopment and retain potential for archaeological for evidence of the inhabitant's lifestyles and working methods during the active life of the complex. The various components of this complex, including the vistas, substantially retain their original form and, therefore, evidence of their original function. Minor alterations, including the enclosure of the veranda of the Pilot's residence do not impact substantially on that integrity. The original function and authenticity of the complex is further emphasised by the presence of the \\"MV Macleay\\", a Pilot boat that was built specifically for the South West Rocks Pilot Station and which was serving at the Pilot Station when it closed in the 1960s. The profile of the adjacent caravan park has minimum impact on the vistas. The main visual intrusion of the site arises from the residential building erected on the site of Boatman's Cottage No. 4. However, this does not impede the key vistas to the entrance of the Macleay River, to Trial Bay Harbour to the south east or the vistas directly east of the Pilot's residence. = Modifications and dates = The whole group was built during the original construction in 1902. The Pilot cottage had an open veranda. The enclosure of the veranda has timber-framed windows which is a sympathetic addition probably about 1910. A small addition at the side was approved by the Department of Navigation in 1905 to house a post office. The flagstaff and flag locker were integral parts of the Pilot Station. After restoration of the boatman's cottage No.1 in 1997, the flagstaff was lowered, repainted and re-erected securely. The locker was painted and re-roofed by volunteers of the newly formed South West Rocks branch of the Macleay River Historical Society. Since 2001 the fence has been mended and painted.  Heritage listing  The Pilot Station complex at South West Rocks is of State significance in demonstrating the importance of the shipping trade along the east coast of New South Wales and the central role of Pilot Stations in maintaining those routes. While the \\"highway of lighthouses\\" assisted ship's captains to navigate past headlands and coastal shoals, the Pilot service was essential to safe passage entering and leaving port. Substantially intact, the South West Rocks Station and associated vistas are a strong representation of an in-situ maritime precinct and the role of these facilities in providing safe passage. Of a total of 21 Pilot Stations established in New South Wales, most have been demolished, had their buildings relocated or retain only a small portion of the original facility. Only at Kiama is there an in-situ Pilot's residence and a comparable associated complex. The South West Rocks Pilot Station therefore possesses significant potential for the study of the management of coastal shipping and navigation in this State. South West Rocks Pilot Station Complex was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 June 2008 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The South West Rocks Pilot Station precinct is of State significance as evidence of the importance of the development of patterns of coastal shipping to the New South Wales economy and the crucial role of navigational services in providing safe passage. The success of coastal shipping was central to servicing the centralised commercial needs of Sydney as well as regional communities and economies before the spread of rail and road links. Pilot stations were as essential to the safety of shipping arrivals and departures at coastal ports as lighthouses were to passage between ports. The Pilot Station was relocated from its original site at Grassy Head, a few kilometres to the north, following an 1895 decision to stabilise the mouth of the Macleay River. This relocation is therefore associated with the late 19th century State Government investment in high cost port infrastructure at relatively minor ports such as the Macleay River, Coffs Harbour and the Manning River. The costsof these projects lead to the eventual retreat from investment in coastal trade, prioritisation of rail infrastructure and the demise of the Pilot Service at minor ports. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The South West Rocks Pilot Station and associated vistas are of local significance as a distinctive aspect of South West Rocks landscape/seascape interaction. With the sea as a background, the buildings provide a positive and sensory connection to the history and life-style at South West Rocks in the early 20th century. The presence of the diesel Pilot boat \\"MV Macleay\\", on display in the yard of Boatman's Cottage No.1, a vessel which served at this Pilot Station, provides a level of visual coherence in interpreting the function of this facility the is unmatched in this State. The design of the Pilot boat, the buildings and associated structures exemplifies the style and technology of the Pilot Service at that time. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The social value of the Pilot Station complex to the local communities at South West Rocks and the lower Macleay River is evidenced by the site being listed on the Kempsey Shire Council Local Environment Plan, the submission of a nomination for listing on the State Heritage Register and an ongoing community campaign for appropriate management of the various components of the site. This includes community working groups and successful submissions by Kempsey Council for Department of Planning Heritage Assistance Program funding to maintain the cottages and Pilot boat \\"Macleay\\". The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The South West Rocks Pilot Station precinct is of State significance for its potential for archaeological research and comparative study with the sites of other less intact pilot stations on the New South Wales coast to better understand the everyday functioning of the stations and working of the Pilots and boatmen. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The South West Rocks Pilot Station precinct is of State significance for its rarity. Twenty-one pilotstation facilities once operated along the New South Wales coast. Most of these have been completely or partially demolished and many of were much smaller than the South West Rocks complex. The only comparable station still in situ and with the original buildings substantially intact is the Kiama Pilot Station. The South West Rocks complex is therefore one of only two, substantially intact pilot station complexes surviving in New South Wales - one north and one south of Sydney. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The South West Rocks Pilot Station complex and associated vistas are of State significance as an example of the facilities that were once in place along the length of New South Wales coast from the Queensland border to Twofold Bay in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As one of only two substantially intact facilities in New South Wales, the site is representative of the 21 such facilities that were once an integral part of coastal navigation services. The complex includes the principle characteristics of these facilities - Pilot's and boatman's residences, flagstaff and flag locker for signalling to ships, access to the Pilot boat and boatshed, the Pilot boat itself and views of the key approaches to the port or harbour.

Elections =2010= 2010 inauguration of Sergey Sobyanin Until 2012, there were no direct elections of governors in Russia (including mayors and governors of Federal cities). Regional heads were appointed by the President of Russia with the consent of the regional Parliament. On 28 September 2010, President Dmitry Medvedev sacked Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov \\"in connection with loss of trust of the President\\". On 9 October, Sobyanin was included in the list of four candidates for Mayor of Moscow, proposed to the President. The other candidates were Lyudmila Shvetsova, Igor Levitin and Valery Shantsev. On October 15, Medvedev nominated Sobyanin to the Moscow City Duma. October 21, the deputies of the Moscow City Duma by secret ballot (32 MPs voted favor and 2 ‚Äî against) approved Sobyanin as Mayor for the next five years. =2013= On 5 June 2013, Sergey Sobyanin asked President Vladimir Putin to resign in order to hold a snap election. On the same day, Vladimir Putin signed a decree on Sobyanin's resignation and the same decree appointed him acting Mayor of Moscow to hold early election. Sergey Sobyanin chose to go to the election not from the United Russia party, of which he is a member, but in the status of self-nominated, in connection with which he had not only to overcome the municipal filter (110 signatures of municipal deputies), but also to collect signatures of 70 thousand Muscovites.–ü–æ–¥–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω –£–∫–∞–∑ –æ –¥–æ—Å—Ä–æ—á–Ω–æ–º –ø—Ä–µ–∫—Ä–∞—â–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –ø–æ–ª–Ω–æ–º–æ—á–∏–π –º—ç—Ä–∞ –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤—ã–°–µ—Ä–≥–µ–π –°–æ–±—è–Ω–∏–Ω –ø–æ–¥–∞–ª –¥–æ–∫—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç—ã –¥–ª—è —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–∏—è –≤ –≤—ã–±–æ—Ä–∞—Ö –º—ç—Ä–∞ –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤—ã –∫–∞–∫ —Å–∞–º–æ–≤—ã–¥–≤–∏–∂–µ–Ω–µ—Ü On 8 September he was re-elected as Mayor with 51.37% of votes and on 12 September Sobyanin was again sworn in as Mayor of Moscow.–°–æ–±—è–Ω–∏–Ω —Å–µ–≥–æ–¥–Ω—è –æ—Ñ–∏—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ —Å—Ç–∞–Ω–µ—Ç –º—ç—Ä–æ–º –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤—ã =2018= In October 2017, Sergey Sobyanin announced his intention to run for re-election.–ú—ç—Ä –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤—ã –°–µ—Ä–≥–µ–π –°–æ–±—è–Ω–∏–Ω –æ–±—ä—è–≤–∏–ª –æ –ø–ª–∞–Ω–∞—Ö –±–∞–ª–ª–æ—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å—Å—è –Ω–∞ –Ω–æ–≤—ã–π —Å—Ä–æ–∫ As in 2013, Sobyanin again decided to run as a self-nominee.–°–æ–±—è–Ω–∏–Ω –ø–æ–π–¥–µ—Ç –≤ –º—ç—Ä—ã –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤—ã —Å–∞–º–æ–≤—ã–¥–≤–∏–∂–µ–Ω—Ü–µ–º On 8 September he was again re-elected Mayor for a new term with 70.17%.–î–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –æ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–≤–∞—Ä–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö –∏—Ç–æ–≥–∞—Ö –≥–æ–ª–æ—Å–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è. –í—ã–±–æ—Ä—ã –ú—ç—Ä–∞ –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤—ã The inauguration will take place on 18 September in the Concert Hall of Zaryadye Park.–ò–Ω–∞—É–≥—É—Ä–∞—Ü–∏—è –°–æ–±—è–Ω–∏–Ω–∞ —Å–æ—Å—Ç–æ–∏—Ç—Å—è 18 —Å–µ–Ω—Ç—è–±—Ä—è –≤ –∫–æ–Ω—Ü–µ—Ä—Ç–Ω–æ–º –∑–∞–ª–µ \\"–ó–∞—Ä—è–¥—å–µ\\" According to Federal Law, this term will be the last for Sobyanin, and he will not be able to run for 2023 election.–ü–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥–Ω–∏–π —Å—Ä–æ–∫ –°–æ–±—è–Ω–∏–Ω–∞ Transport policy Traffic congestion on Leningradsky Avenue Immediately after taking office, Sergey Sobyanin described the city's transport system crisis as \\"the most visible imbalance in Moscow's development\\". Uncontrolled motorization has led to the fact that by 2011 in Moscow was registered 4 million cars, in 2013 the city took first place in the world in the length of traffic congestions. According to the mayor's office and experts, the most effective strategy for solving problems is to reduce the number of cars traveling to the streets by 500 thousand. To do this, it was planned to increase the price of owning a car and at the same time expand the possibilities of public transport. Sergey Sobyanin advocated the introduction of paid parking in the center of Moscow. The first paid parking zone was launched in November 2013, in December 2014 it expanded to the borders of the Third Ring Road, and also appeared on 25 streets outside. After expanding the paid parking area in December 2016, it covers more than 1,200 streets and 47 districts of the city. The introduction and expansion of the paid parking zone has repeatedly caused protests of citizens: in the autumn of 2015, 12 protest rallies were held, in December 2016, an action against parking policy was held on Pushkinskaya Square. According to Yandex analysts, the expansion of the paid parking zone to the borders of the Third Ring Road accelerated the movement of cars by 7-10% between the Garden Ring and the Third Ring. According to TomTom, the manufacturer of navigation devices, in 2015, Moscow moved along the length of traffic jams to fifth place in the world, and the road load index in Moscow decreased to 44% (in 2012 ‚Äî first place and 57% respectively). In 2017, Moscow was excluded from the top 10 cities with the busiest roads according to the TomTom rating. Time losses due to traffic jams decreased from 43 minutes per day in 2016 to 57 minutes per day in 2012. At the same time, the average speed of the traffic increased from 45 km/h in 2010 to 51 km/h in 2016.TOMTOM TRAFFIC INDEX =Public transport= Sergey Sobyanin in the cab of the subway train driver In 2011, Sergey Sobyanin signed a decree on procurement for the 2011-2012 year, more than 2,100 buses in new modifications, and since 2011 they have been implemented the program implementation of Bus rapid transit systems on dedicated lanes for public transport. In 2012, Sobyanin announced plans to build 70 new Metro stations. The adopted program for the development of the Moscow Metro until 2020, worth about 1 trillion rubles, provides for the construction of 76 stations and more than 150 km of lines. Several new stations (Zhulebino, Novokosino, Kotelniki and Rumyantsevo) are located outside the Moscow Ring Road. The program includes both the extension of existing lines and the construction of new ones, including a Large Circle Line. In October 2016, in the central districts of the city was launched the \\"Magistral\\" ‚Äî a program to optimize the route network of public transport and the reorganization of routes of main, inter- district and social importance. Experts and citizens have been criticized for the policy of closing trolleybus routes in the city center since 2014. In the course of work on the improvement program \\"My street\\" removed the contact network, and the routes were reduced. With the launch of the \\"Magistral\\", a number of trolleybus routes were replaced by buses. The media reported on the plans until 2020 to further reduce trolleybus traffic. In January 2017, a rally for the preservation of the trolleybus network, which was attended by about 900 people, took place at Suvorovskaya Square. According to official data, in 2016, 600 million (12%) passengers used public transport more than in 2010; passenger traffic of economically active citizens increased by 63% compared to 2010. At the same time, the Moscow Department of Transport said that ground transportation has become better to comply with the schedule (accuracy of 94% in 2015 against 76% in 2010). Moscow Central Circle Sergey Sobyanin and Vladimir Putin on the opening of the MCC On 10 September 2016, on the City Day, in the presence of Mayor Sergey Sobyanin and President Vladimir Putin, passenger traffic of electric trains was opened on the Moscow Central Circle (MCC), which was previously used as a railway line for freight transport. MCC includes 31 stations with transfers to 10 metro lines and 9 radial railway lines. The MCC is integrated with the Moscow metro for fare collection and transfers, which creates a single system with the metro. Moscow Central Diameters MCD map In October 2017, Sobyanin announced that he was discussing with Russian Railways and the Ministry of Transport a project to create through railway lines based on existing ones. On 15 November 2017, at a working meeting of Russian President Vladimir Putin with Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin and head of Russian Railways Oleg Belozerov, the project, called \\"Moscow Central Diameters\\" (MCD), was presented in detail for the first time. The project was supported by the President and recognized by him as one of the priorities in the Moscow transport hub. The essence of the project is to create routes connecting cities near Moscow, passing through Moscow. The system is based on existing railway lines that previously ended in Moscow. The system is integrated with the Moscow metro and has a single fare payment system. On 19 December 2017, Russian Transport Minister Maxim Sokolov, Sobyanin, Moscow Oblast Governor Andrey Vorobyov and Russian Railways President Oleg Belozerov signed a schedule for the implementation of the first stage of the project at a meeting of the Coordination Council for the development of the transport system in Moscow and Moscow Oblast. The first two routes were launched on 21 November 2019. =Road construction= The Alabyan–æ-Baltiysky Tunnel was opened in 2015. Its construction was carried out for 10 years. With the arrival of Sobyanin in the capital intensified work on road repairs. In 2011, the mayor announced the need every 3 years to completely shift the asphalt on the roads, while the contractors under the terms of the contract give the city a three-year guarantee at their own expense. The first three-year cycle of repair using new asphalt-bitumen mixtures was carried out in 2011-2013 (before that, the coating was repaired every 7.5 years). In 2011-2015, 400 km of new roads were built in Moscow. In particular, the reconstruction of Varshavskoye, Kashirskoye, Mozhaiskoye, Leningradskoye, Yaroslavskoye highways, Balaklavsky Avenue and several interchanges on the Moscow Ring Road were carried out. In December 2015, the ten-year construction of the Alabiano-Baltiysky Tunnel was completed. From 2010 to 2015, the authorities have completed the construction or reconstruction of 12 interchanges of the Moscow Ring Road and radial routes. Sobyanin cancelled the Fourth Ring Road, a massive road construction project that had been started under Yury Luzhkov, which would have involved tremendous land acquisition costs. Instead, the Government of Moscow has begun the construction of two chord tracks, which will link the departing highways in the middle part of the city and will have direct access to the Moscow Ring Road. The North-Eastern Chord will run from the understudy of the Leningradsky Highway to the Veshnyaki-Lyubertsy junction. North-West Chord - from Dmitrovskoye to Skolkovskoye highways. It is expected that these lines will reduce the transport load on the Moscow Ring Road, Third Ring Road, departure lines, as well as the center of Moscow. Urban planning policy Demolition of the House of Neklyudova Zaryadye Park After the election of Sobyanin as mayor in 2011 in Moscow, the city government developed and approved the program \\"Urban policy\\" in order to \\"create a favorable urban environment\\". Every year, a four-year targeted investment program and a 3-year program for the construction of off-budget facilities are formed.–ì—Ä–∞–¥–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–∞—è –ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏–∫–∞ The town-planning policy of the mayor's office of Sergei Sobyanin began with steps aimed at protecting the historical development of Moscow, but later he was repeatedly accused of lobbying the interests of the city's developers and construction companies. The reason for a broad public discussion and claims against the city hall was initiated in 2017, a large- scale renovation program, designed in the future decades to settle areas of dilapidated panel housing. Sobyanin, telling in October 2015 about the work in the field of urban protection, said that \\"Moscow in recent years has become the undisputed leader in the restoration of monuments of architecture\\", calling the preservation of cultural heritage one of the priorities of the city hall. According to him, 600 objects have been restored, 4000 facades of historical buildings have been restored and 189 buildings have been preserved, which were previously planned to be demolished. In particular, the procedure for recognition of historical buildings as monuments of architecture and culture was simplified. At the same time, architectural experts note that the restoration of many buildings, in fact, the construction of a new one is coming to an end. At the same time, Sobyanin continued the practice of destroying historical buildings for the sake of new construction, for which the previous Mayor Yury Luzhkov was heavily criticized. In 2013, the coordinator of the movement \\"Arhnadzor\\" Rustam Rakhmatullin noted that with the arrival of the Sobyanin team, the attitude to the preservation of monuments has changed only at the declarative level: \\"with Sobyanin, everything continues, but at a slower pace and in a somewhat paradoxical way, as the declarations have changed.\\" Some decrease in the level of construction activity in the center of Moscow Rakhmatullin associated with the \\"long-term public demand\\" as well as the outflow of money due to the crisis. At the same time, he negatively noted the fact that public adviser Sobyanin was appointed the largest developer, owner of the construction Corporation \\"Barkli\\" Leonid Kazinets, known for offering to demolish the old city by 70% and placed on the city hall responsibility for the loss of, among other historical sites such as the Estate of Shakhovsky‚ÄîGlebovs‚ÄîStreshnevs, Volkonsky house, \\"Children's world\\" on Lubyanskaya square, the Cathedral mosque and buildings of the complex of the new Catherine hospital. The practice of demolition of valuable objects of the urban environment for new construction continued in the following years: in 2016, the constructivist Taganskaya Automatic Telephone Station was demolished, in May 2017 ‚Äî the House of Neklyudova on Malaya Bronnaya street. Since October 2010 on behalf of Sobyanin initiated the reduction in the number of street trading facilities. The Committee adopted the model projects the stalls, and the number of points was reduced from 14 thousand to 9.9 thousand. By the beginning of 2015 in Moscow worked about 7 thousand stalls, of which about 2 thousand ‚Äî the newspaper and ticket. In the spring of 2015, the city has replaced the 205 private pavilions at the new owned by the city. City hall lease them to entrepreneurs, and by the middle of 2017 plans to replace the remaining state 4811 private stalls. In December 2015, the authorities of Moscow adopted a decision on the demolition of 104 trade stands at subway stations. The legal conflict allowed the city to recognize self-building objects on city communications on which property rights were registered earlier. The demolition of objects on the night of February 9, 2016 caused a wide public outcry. On the night of August 29, the \\"second stage\\" of demolition of 107 more objects started. In 2011, in the framework of the program of improvement of the city was initiated by a large- scale project to replace sidewalks asphalt pavement on the tiles following the example and standard of the cities of the developed Western countries, the Far East countries and China. It was planned to allocate 4 billion rubles for these purposes and replace 1.1 million square meters of asphalt pavement only in 2011, but the scale of the work was more modest, and 2.5 billion rubles were spent for these purposes in 2011-2012. It was assumed that the tiles will make the sidewalks more aesthetic and durable, and the current repair ‚Äî more economical. The initiative has caused criticism of the members of the budget and financial Commission of the Moscow City Duma and residents. In the objections of the deputies from the Communist party, it was stated that this is not a priority need, and the budget billions could be mastered more usefully. Both the quality of the tiles and the accuracy of the work on its laying were criticized: the organization Left Front picketed the City Hall, and the Prefecture of the Central Okrug refused to accept the work on the streets. In 2015, within the framework of the new program \\"My street\\", which involves the reconstruction of streets in accordance with modern standards, concrete tiles on the sidewalks began to be replaced with granite slabs. In 2014, the exhibition complex VDNKh became the property of Moscow, from that moment began an active reconstruction of the object. In 2015, the opening of the largest skating rink in Europe, designed for 5 thousand people, and in March 2016 in the main exhibition hall the mayor opened the relief of Yevgeny Vuchetich \\"the Bearer of Peace, the Soviet People Glory!\\" In 2015, the landscaping around the Novodevichy Monastery and on the Frunzenskaya embankment was completed.–ù–µ –º–µ—Å—Ç–æ –¥–ª—è –±–∏–∑–Ω–µ—Å–∞–°–∞–º—ã–π –±–æ–ª—å—à–æ–π –∫–∞—Ç–æ–∫ –ï–≤—Ä–æ–ø—ã –æ—Ç–∫—Ä–æ–µ—Ç—Å—è –Ω–∞ –í–î–ù–•–ù–∞ –í–î–ù–• –æ—Ç–∫—Ä—ã–ª–∏ –≥–æ—Ä–µ–ª—å–µ—Ñ –í—É—á–µ—Ç–∏—á–∞ On 9 September 2017, on the City Day, on the site of the demolished in 2006 Rossiya Hotel, the landscape urban park Zaryadye was opened. It is located next to the Red Square on Moskvoretskaya embankment. The park was built from 2014 to 2017.Zaryadye Park opens in Moscow =Criticism= First landing of Tilias on Tverskaya Street in October 2016 Some projects, such as gardening of Tverskaya street for 300 million rubles, became the subject of criticism: co-founder of the Fund \\"City Projects\\" by Ilya Varlamov noted the weak elaboration of architectural solutions, and Alexey Navalny in Moscow election campaign in 2013, directly accused the mayor of inefficient spending and corruption schemes. In January 2017 Alexei Navalny in a publication about the purchase of jewelry for the streets of Moscow accused Sobyanin and the mayor of Moscow in the five-fold overstatement of expenditure in the purchase of Christmas decorations for city streets, the waste of funds. A few days after this, the mayor proposed to remove the data on public procurement of Moscow with the Federal portal of public procurement, which has been criticized by lawyers of the Anti- Corruption Foundation. In December 2015, architectural critic Grigory Revzin said that when Sobyanin, Moscow has appeared \\"coherent urban development policy\\" with particular emphasis on the abolition of inherited from the previous municipality of investment contracts for 24 million square meters. The novelty of the policy that, except for urgent investments in the transport system and reconstruction of infrastructure, the city government under Sobyanin drew attention to public space. According to Revzin, at the symbolic level, \\"the car is repressed, the pedestrian has become the main thing\\", which in practice was embodied, in particular, in the rethought Gorky Park on Krymsky Val street, new embankments of the Moscow River, reconstructed streets in the city center, where the roadway was narrowed and granite sidewalks appeared. At the same time, in February 2016 Grigory Revzin described the violent demolition of the retail pavilions in the metro in Moscow by the end of the \\"Sobyanin's urbanism\\" ‚Äî urban policy since 2010, which combines the idea of modernization and the rejection of the shadow, in his opinion, the economy of the time of Yury Luzhkov: \\"To a certain extent this is reminiscent of the existence of cities in feudal Europe, \\"the air of Moscow was made free\\". The formula was as follows-instead of becoming European citizens, you are invited to become European citizens. \\"However, in 2016, the money for peaceful modernization from above\\", when everything was compensated, with all agreed\\", was not enough, which forced the Moscow authorities to go to the \\"scare action\\" in the form of night demolition of the pavilions. Policies pertaining to people =Immigration= In May 2013, Sergey Sobyanin in an interview with Moscow News said that there is a danger of the formation of mono-national neighborhoods in Moscow, which will turn into a \\"ghetto\\" and a source of social instability. The words that \\"people who speak Russian badly, who have a completely different culture, it is better to live in their country\\" have caused a wide public discussion. In August 2015 Sobyanin ordered to tighten control over illegal migrants, which in Moscow may still be up to 2 million people (Federal Migration Service said about 1 million working foreigners in Moscow). The FMS of Russia estimates that 35% of the migration flow falls on Moscow and the Moscow Oblast. Previously, in order to legalize labor migrants in the suburban village of Sakharovo centre was opened for the granting of patents; the Moscow authorities had hoped that thanks to them the city budget will receive up to 12 billion of additional fees. Sobyanin advised the Federal Migration Service and the police to \\"actively clean\\" the city from illegal immigrants who have not received a patent for job. =Social policy= In 2013, the Government of Moscow initiated a reform of the city health care system, which resulted in the liquidation of 15 hospitals and several other medical institutions, as well as a massive reduction of doctors, nurses and other health care workers . The reform caused a wide public response, as well as criticism from President Vladimir Putin. On 1 April 2015, a law was adopted that increases the minimum wage in Moscow to 16.5 thousand rubles. At the same time, the increase in rental fees (paid parking, increase in property tax), according to experts, may indicate the desire of the Moscow authorities to launch the process of gentrification, which will force out of the city center low-margin business and low-income people. Environmental policy In September 2014 Sobyanin closed the waste incineration plant \\"Ecologist\\" in the area of Nekrasovka. The next June he banned the construction of a waste incineration plant on the car repair street in the Northern Administrative Okrug. With the support of the Moscow Government and with the participation of the Mayor, the Moscow Urban Forum has been held in the capital since 2011.–ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞: –∫–∞–∂–¥—ã–π —Å—ç–∫–æ–Ω–æ–º–ª–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –∫–∏–ª–æ–≤–∞—Ç—Ç ‚Äî —ç—Ç–æ –º–∏–Ω—É—Å –≤—ã–±—Ä–æ—Å—ã –≤ –∞—Ç–º–æ—Å—Ñ–µ—Ä—É. –∂—É—Ä–Ω–∞–ª ¬´–≠–∫–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥¬ª In August 2013, the campaign \\"Million trees\\" was launched, in which more than 40 thousand trees and 950 thousand shrubs were planted by November 2015. A total of 3.5 million trees and shrubs are planned to be planted by 2020. In 2016, in connection with the massive tree felling in Moscow, a number of activists and organizations repeatedly appealed to Sergei Sobyanin to stop the destruction of forest parks. Administrative policy Sobyanin's 2016 Annual Report at the City Duma The first discontent with Sobyanin as Mayor of Moscow was related to the election procedure, in which critics saw \\"appointment from above\\": the elections were held by secret voting of deputies of the Moscow city Duma for the candidates proposed by the President of Russia. In the future, due to the authoritarian approach to urban management, providing for a minimum dialogue with Muscovites, and the accelerated implementation of projects, many initiatives of the city hall were perceived by the latter with skepticism, despite the introduction of modern technologies and the involvement of authoritative urbanists as consultants. However, after the return of direct elections of the Mayor, in 2013 Sobyanin announced his resignation, with the aim of a snap direct election (initially the election was to be held in 2015). With the arrival of the Mayor Sobyanin began to gradually change the management team. Five years later, of the eight Vice Mayors, only one ‚Äî supervising housing Pyotr Biryukov ‚Äî has remained since the time of mayor Yury Luzhkov. Notable personnel decisions Sobyanin became the involvement of Sergey Kapkov as head of the Department of Culture, Maxim Liksutov as head of the Department of Transport and Marat Khusnullin as head of the Department of Urban Development and Construction in Moscow. The municipality gradually built a managerial hierarchy. At first, the range of issues for which 146 municipalities of the city are responsible was cut: they were given the right to coordinate plans for major repairs of houses, improvement of courtyards and parks, schemes for the placement of small commercial facilities and construction of local importance, but at the same time decisions are made at the level of prefectures on the main issues. In the future, the government began to cut the rights of prefectures in favor of the city administration. In March 2015, Sobyanin announced a 30% reduction in the staff of Moscow civil servants (3 thousand people). At the same time, he cut his salary and payments to the members of the city government by his decree. 2020 coronavirus pandemic Mayor Sobyanin, President Putin and Prime Minister Mishustin visited the Coronavirus Monitoring Center on 17 March. Denis Protsenko (middle), the medical director of the Kommunarka hospital visited by President Putin and Mayor Sobyanin, was tested positive for the coronavirus Sergey Sobyanin reminds builders that \\"every minute counts\\" on this poster on a construction site for a medical center in Moscow during the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.

On 15 March 2020, a Working Group of the State Council for the fight against coronavirus was formed by a decree of President Vladimir Putin. Sergey Sobyanin was appointed the group's head. The group's responsibilities are to coordinate regional efforts to counter the spread of the disease. The Working Group is lower in the hierarchy compared to the Coordination Council created a day earlier and headed by Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin. At the same time, Sobyanin is the First Deputy of Mishustin in the Coordination Council. On 16 March, Moscow extended measures to closing public schools, athletic schools and supplemental education institutions from 21 March to 12 April; banning indoor events with more than 50 attendees and all outdoor mass events. The compulsory 14-day self-isolation which had been previously enforced to people coming China, South Korea and Iran, was extended to those coming from the United States and all European countries. On 23 March, Mayor Sobyanin ordered all people over 65 to self-isolate at home starting Thursday, saying each would receive 4,000 rubles for following the order. He also suggested that older residents leave Moscow and stay in their dachas. School students' public transportation cards were temporarily suspended, starting from the 5th grade. On 24 March, it was announced that Moscow hospitals would receive up to 200,000 roubles (around $2,500) for each coronavirus patient from the city's health insurance fund. On the same day, Sobyanin together with President Putin visited the Kommunarka hospital for patients with coronavirus, where he spoke with the chief doctor Denis Protsenko, who tested positive for coronavirus a week later. On 25 March, following the respective decision of the federal government, Mayor Sobyanin ordered the closure of all municipal libraries and clubs, as well as cinemas and night clubs, banned hookah smoking in cafes, and suspended any organized leisure social activities, including amusement parks. He also instructed dental clinics to see patients with acute pain or other emergencies only. Municipal multiservice centers suspended services, except for those unavailable online. Free or concessionary use of public transport was suspended for people aged over 65, with chronic diseases, students of vocational schools or high schools. On 26 March, Mayor Sobyanin ordered restaurants, cafes, bars, canteens, parks, commercial and retail businesses requiring personal attendance, except those providing essential services, like grocery shops and pharmacies, to close during from 28 March to 5 April, the holiday week announced by President Putin.

People have to keep a distance of 1.5 metres. Also, Sobyanin announced that Muscovites who become unemployed due to coronavirus will get 19,500 rubles (around $250) a month. Senator Andrey Klishas, chair of the Federation Council Committee on constitutional legislation and state construction, criticized this decision, saying that such restrictions are the exclusive competence of the Federal Assembly and the President. = Accusations of ethnic profiling at the earlier stages = In February, it was reported that drivers of city's public transport were required to inform their dispatchers if they see Chinese nationals in their vehicles, for police to be called. Moscow Metro employees were required to ask Chinese nationals to fill in questionnaires. On 21 February, Sergey Sobyanin confirmed that Mosgortrans and Moscow Metro were asked to work together with police forces to \\"monitor those who arrived from China\\". Facial recognition was also used to track these people. On 24 February, the Chinese Embassy in Russia asked Moscow authorities to put an end to these \\"excessive measures\\" in transport. Sobyanin insisted that the measures were not discriminatory but helped control those who were required to stay self-isolated upon arrival from China. However at the later stages many of these Russian measures were applied to all foreign arrivals, including for Russian citizens coming back from abroad, with them being forced into self quarantine and facecam profiling. 200 cases of quarantine-breakers by Russian citizens were reported to be recognized with facecam profiling, tracked by Public surveillance cameras in Moscow. Other In 2012, according to the decision taken by President Dmitry Medvedev, there was a sharp expansion of the territory of Moscow due to the accession of the South-West of the Moscow region. Since July 1, 2012, the area of Moscow has increased 2.4 times, and the population has increased by 250 thousand people.

The river flows for down Bilsdale and meets the Rye near the village of Hawnby. The name derives from Old Swedish and means either Slow Stream or Calm. When the surrounding land was owned by Roger de Mowbray, the river was referred to as the Sep. Course The river starts in Bilsdale at the village of Chop Gate where the waters of the Bilsdale and Raisdale Becks meet, though some of the sources start on Urra Moor. The river from source to where it meets the River Rye at Seph Mouth, is long. Historically, parts of the river were the delineating boundaries between ancient parishes. Bilsdale is narrow and densely wooded at the head of the valley, but further down becomes wider and the water meanders before it joins the Rye. Natural History The river has suffered with invasive species such as Himalayan balsam and Japanese Knotweed which have been the subject of various programmes to eradicate them. The river has also benefitted from a government grant to help fish navigation and a reduction in pollution. It was known to be a good trout stream in the late 19th/early 20th centuries, and various agencies came together in 2015 to improve fish passages on the watercourse to allow the migration of trout from the River Rye. The river flows across the south western edge of the North York Moors and as such has limestone, gritstone, mudstone and siltstone as its bedrock. During dry summers, the waters disappear into the bedrock and the river becomes totally subterranean. The sides of Bilsdale where the Seph meanders, are lined with ancient Oak trees and the North York Moors National Park Authority were granted Heritage Lottery Funding in 2017 to protect the land and study the wildlife along the upper reaches of the River Rye. This will include the Seph and will look at some of the native species which make use of the watercourse such as the alcathoe bat and the white-clawed crayfish.

Its existence was more theoretical than real, because the original structure of the popular militias continued to exist despite the efforts of the Generalitat. On October 24, 1936, the Generalitat of Catalonia dissolved the Central Committee of Antifascist Militias with the aim of reorganizing the military forces in Catalonia and militarizing paramilitary militia units. On December 6, 1936, the creation of the \\"People's Army of Catalonia\\" was decreed, decree signed by the Defense Minister of Catalonia, Felipe D√≠az Sandino. The People's Army of Catalonia was made up of 9 infantry regiments, 3 artillery regiments, 3 cavalry groups, 3 engineers' groups, a group of officers and a health group, grouping the forces of the Aragon front. The forces were distributed in three divisions, each of which under the orders of Colonel Guillem de la Pe√±a i Cus√≠, Jos√© Eduardo Villalba Rubio and the commander Eduardo Medrano Rivas. In January 1937 a fourth division was added, and instead of numbering they retained the names of the columns from which they originated: Ascaso, Marx, Durruti and Maci√†-Companys. The army was abolished and its units were integrated into the Eastern Army unit of the People's Republican Army following the events of May 1937, and divisions were numbered from 26 to 30: Anarcho-syndicalists formed divisions 25, 26 and 28, Columna Carles Marx of the PSUC formed the 27th Division, the POUM 29, and the Maci√†-Companys Column of ERC and Estat Catal√†, the 30th.

The film is based on John Green's 2012 novel The Fault in Our Stars. The original screenplay written by Scott Neustadter and Michael Weber was adapted by Shashank Khaitan and Suprotim Sengputa for the film. Starring Sushant Singh Rajput and Sanjana Sanghi, both encompass roles of grading terminal cancer patients. Produced by Fox Star Studios, that acquired rights for the Indian adaptation in 2014 after which it underwent series of casting and screenplay changes for four years. Filming commenced under the title \\"Kizie Aur Manny\\" by late June 2018. The film was shot across Jamshedpur and Ranchi with sporadic schedules in Mumbai; apart from last one in Paris, France. The original score and soundtrack were composed by A. R. Rahman, with lyrics by Amitabh Bhattacharya. The cinematography and editing were handled by Setu and Aarif Sheikh, respectively. The theatrical release of the film suffered due to delays in post-production stages and the COVID-19 pandemic. The former reasons and untimely demise of Rajput called for an OTT release via Disney+ Hotstar on 24 July 2020. As a homage to him, the film was made accessible sans subscription in India and selective countries on the platform. The film received a hysterical response from the audience because the emotional cues of demise portraying Manny (Rajput) in reel turned real for the actor's life. However, it received mixed reviews from critics who praised the running time and characterisations but panned the lack of emotional depth, cohesion, casual screenplay and direction. Plot Kizie Basu is fighting thyroid cancer when she meets Immanuel 'Manny' Rajkumar Junior, who has previously suffered from osteosarcoma and is in remission. Manny and his friend JP, who is suffering from glaucoma and is blind in one eye, are making a movie together, inspired by Rajinikanth's films. Manny invites Kizie to be the female lead. The two bond over his love for Rajnikanth's movies and her love for music, specifically an incomplete song by retired songwriter Abhimanyu Veer (Khan). Kizie and Manny gradually fall in love as they shoot scenes for JP's film. They decides to make 'Seri', the Tamil word for 'okay', their secret word that will help them remember that everything will be okay in life and to stay positive. After an operation, JP loses sight in his second eye, making him go blind. One day, Manny informs Kizie that he has managed to track down Abhimanyu Veer and get in touch with him. Kizie e-mails Veer, who replies that she can visit him in Paris to get her questions answered. Kizie and Manny convince Kizie's parents to allow them to take the trip, with the condition that Kizie's mother joins them. As they are making arrangements for the trip, Kizie's cancer gets worse and she is hospitalised. After her recovery, she is weakened and initially distances herself from Manny but later relents. They go to Paris to visit Abhimanyu, who turns out to have no conclusive answers, disappointing Kizie. Soon after, Manny informs Kizie that his cancer had returned and is now terminal. As Manny's health deteriorates, Kizie convinces him and JP to finish the film. Manny then invites JP and Kizie to his mock funeral, where they deliver eulogies that they have both prepared. Manny dies a couple of days later, leaving a letter for Kizie, explaining that he had finished Veer's song for her and had even convinced Veer to help him finish the song. JP's finished film premieres in an open-air theatre, where Kizie and the crowd get emotional. In the final scene of the film, Manny breaks the fourth wall and directly speaks to Kizie, to which she replies \\"Seri\\".

In an interview with aforementioned, the latter stated: \\"It's a story that I really feel needs to be told here. For me it's poignant at a time when we are consumed by technology and are manically running this make-believe race we think is \\"Life\\" Also, Karan Johar held the rights to remake the film. By October 2015, the duo backed out citing creative differences and director being replaced as Mohit Suri. Varun Dhawan could not be onboarded citing schedule conflicts. An interview with Hindustan Times, Sushant Singh Rajput denied being approached for the remake. He confirmed through his Twitter handle. In late 2016, the film was considered for debutante female lead for Sara Ali Khan, who backed out and her mother confirmed the project to be shelved. By December 2016, Alia Bhatt and Aditya Roy Kapur were considered for the project.

However, the news media incorrectly cited the debutante pair to lead in the remake. = Development = In August 2014, India's Fox Star Studios announced it would adapt the novel into an Indian Hindi-language film, with the working title of Kizie Aur Manny. Producer Karan Johar was supposed to produce the film but eventually backed out. In October 2017, the project was confirmed starring Sushant Singh Rajput as the male lead. Mukesh Chhabra was selected to direct the film and was in stages of scripting. Reports confirmed that Karan Johar was not a part of the project.

She was looking for a few ad jobs, was mature young lady by 2020. Since Rockstar, he wanted to make a film with her one-day, noting the film script ready to fit her in. In the very month A. R. Rahman was reported to compose the Original Score and soundtrack album. Actress Swastika Mukherjee confirmed her presence in the project by September 2018. Screen tests were completed by end of June 2018. In an interview with IANS, Rajput stated: \\"I and Mukesh share a great bond. He gave me my first film and I promised him that I would definitely be in his. This was the first film I signed without reading the script, as I know Mukesh is a terrific director. And now that I have read the script, I am glad that I said yes.\\" In an interview with Mid-Day, Chhabra stated he was able to visualise things as a whole with \\"Kizzie Aur Manny\\". He gave the film his own language without getting influenced by the casting, thereby a fresh touch to the love story. At the 2018 Jio MAMI Mumbai Festival, Ms. Rucha Pathak, Chief Creative Officer of Fox Star Studios, India stated that it took four years to write the script of 'Kizie Aur Manny', the \\"Word to Screen Market\\" is really bringing the world of cinema and literature together. She confirmed Suprotim Sengupta for the film's screenplay and Shashank Khaitan for dialogues. On 8 February 2019, the film's title was changed officially to \\"Dil Bechara\\". Rucha added that the change was to embody the theme emerging out of the title track composed by A R Rahman and lyricist Amitabh Bhattacharya. In an interview with Gayle Sequeira at Film Companion, Sanghi summed up her character role \\"Kizie\\" in two phrases: \\"Emotionally demanding\\" and \\"oscillating between extremely happy to extremely romantic to extremely tragic\\". Kizie played the role of a Bengali girl where Chhabra wanted her to reach a state where she could converse in fluently in Bangla with Swastika Mukherjee (Kizie's mother) and Saswata Chatterjee (Kizie's father). For Sanghi, it took months of diction and cultural training, which she completed with the help of an NSD graduate. Sanghi also joined cancer support groups and spoke to many young survivors to understand the psychological and emotional impact that an illness can have on those who get diagnosed. In addition to Sanghi, Sahil Vaid in his role as \\"JP\\" also spent time with such patients. He called his character role both chirpy and cathartic. For the role of Kizie's mother, Swastika stated: \\"I think my natural maternal instincts kicked in for this... I didn‚Äôt really need to work very hard.\\" She found resemblance with her real life motherly behaviours into this role, extending the 'dormant mother-in-waiting went into full-on active mode'. In this interview with The Telegraph she went on to add of Kizie's father role was shorter than her role and peoplecould connected with Dil Bechara on a personal level because it portrayed the household scenes grounded with Indian cutures. = Filming = Principal photography commenced in Mumbai on 29 June 2018, where Rajput shared a promotional still titled \\"New Beginnings\\" from the sets on Twitter. Filming began in Jamshedpur on 9 July 2018. The film poster with its former title \\"Kizie Aur Manny\\" was released on the same day. Post his recce, Chhabra mentioned, \\"I needed a place with a small town vibe and had heard a lot about Jamshedpur. I knew instantly that this was where I wanted my love story to take root.\\" By August 2018, Farah Khan choreographed a dance number for Rajput (later deciphered as the title track \\"Dil Bechara\\"). The Jamshedpur and Ranchi schedule was wrapped up. The filming locations in Jamshedpur were Tata Steel, Hudco Park of Tata Motors, Tata Main Hospital, Tata Zoological Park, St. George's Church, St. Joseph Catholic Church, Sacred Heart Convent School, Kadma Marketing Complex, The Sonnet Hotel, Eco Park, Kaizer's Bungalow, Dindli Enclave and Payal Theatre. Filming locations of Ranchi were St. Albert's College, St. Xaviers College and St. Paul Cathedral Church. By September 2018, a 10-day schedule was completed in Mumbai, scenes filmed at Kohinoor Hospital in Kurla, Film City and Atharva College in Malad. In mid-October 2018, Chhabra was suspended of services by Fox Star Studios on account of allegations for sexual harassment amidst #MeToo movement in India. This resulted in filming stalled until late December 2018. A 9-day filming schedule planned in Paris was deferred owing to the civil unrest across France and dates availed for filming scenes with Saif Ali Khan lapsed. Second schedule in Paris began on 9 January 2019, where a romantic song (titled \\"Khulke Jeene Ka\\") was filmed. The filming locations were Restaurant Loius Phillipe, Eiffel Tower, Hotel Normandi, Pont D'Arcole, Place Du Tertre Monmatre, Avenue Des Champs Elysees, Cimetiere Du Pere Lachaise Filming was completed by February 2019.  Post production  Post production began soon after February 2019. By October 2019, the lead actress began dubbing her portions. A. R. Rahman, tweeted an in-car video about checking the sound mix for the soundtrack album.  Soundtrack  The film score and soundtrack album are composed by A. R. Rahman with lyrics penned by Amitabh Bhattacharya. Rahman's association with the project was announced by March 2018 and Sony Music Entertainment acquired the record rights by July 2018. It was Rahman's title track which gave the film its new title \\"Dil Bechara\\" in February 2019. The music supervision for all the tracks were done by Hriday Gattani and Hiral Viradia. The tracks \\"Dil Bechara\\", \\"Main Tumhara\\" were the earliest to be recorded whereas the last one \\"Maskhari\\". As per Rahman, the whole album was curated to symbolise feelings of the heart and would be associated with memories of the late actor. The title track served as the lead single followed by the soundtrack release by the record label Sony Music India on 10 July 2020. Upon release, the album received mixed reviews from music critics, who praised its orchestration, duet collaborations, and harmonies, but pointed out unusual lyrics and occasional musical overproduction. On 22 July 2020, a 13-minute tribute to the film's late lead actor in the form of a virtual concert on YouTube. The musical ensemble apart from the respective original track singers were A. R. Ameen and Raheema Rahman. Upon the film's release, a fan spotted a unreleased hidden track in the original score. In his interaction on Twitter, Rahman agreed to complete the song. The song was released under the title \\"Never Say Goodbye\\" as a bonus single on 2 September 2020.  Release  The film was announced for a November 2019, initially. On 4 July 2019, Sanjana Sanghi took her Instagram to share a post on completion of five years of the original counterpart film. However, by November 2019, it was announced that the theatrical release was pushed to 8 May 2020 due to post production delays. In the very month, Hindustan Times reported possibilities of Fox Star Studios releasing the film in May 2020 on OTT platform. The film's theatrical release got postponed again due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In a surprising turn of events, the death of the film's lead actor, Fox Star Studios reinstated the decision to premiere the film posthumously over Disney+ Hotstar on 24 July 2020. In order to pay homage to the lead actor, the film was made accessible to all users sans platform subscriptions. Apart from India, the film was made available for users in the US, UK and Canada. The trailer of the film was released on 6 July 2020 on YouTube and garnered the title of \\"most liked trailer\\", surpassing \\"likes\\" previously held by trailers of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. The trailer raked in 5 million likes in less than 24 hours of release. As of August 2020, the trailer holds 90 million views. As per a report \\"Crisis Consumption on TV and Smartphones\\" published by BARC and Nielsen Media in September 2020, the movie was noted as \\"most viewed film on a smartphone\\" in India. The film had its theatrical release in New Zealand and Fiji on 5 September 2020. It also released on Disney+ Hotstar in Indonesia on October 16, 2020 with an Indonesian dub.  Reception  On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 86% based on 14 reviews, with an average rating of 6.19/10. = Overseas = Film critics Rebecca Breitfeller and Tyler Bey from Hollywood Insider praised the film noting that \\"both characters navigate the youthful beauties of life, all while dealing with the tragedies looming over every scene. They share stories of how cancer has affected their lives, and soon blossoms a beautiful friendship.\\" Critic based at Inquiry, Musanna Ahmed called it a \\"pretty nice story\\" adding on : \\"...much of your enjoyment will depend on if you cared for John Green‚Äôs story the first time [...] It is for those who haven‚Äôt read the book or seen the original film because this takes plays almost beat-for-beat the same.\\" In her review for The National, Aarti Jhurani praised the film length, calling it a sweet story is worth a watch for the myriad characters\\" She awarded 4.5 score on a scale of 5, noting Sanghi's effortless portrayal of Kizie and Sushant Singh Rajput's bowing out with a bang. Tanul Thakur of The Wire Dil Bechara‚Äôs initial segment shows that it's a smart, sharp movie. It ribs Bollywood's conception of ‚Äòhappily ever after‚Äô. Karthik Ravindranath in his review for The Week Magazine noted: \\"Despite minor faults, this girl meets boy tale is worth your time.\\" Dyuti Gupta of SheThePeople.TV wrote: \\" Sushant‚Äôs Final Film Is A Poignant Tribute To His Life And Talent\\". On the contrary, Rachit Raj of Medium presented a mixed view: \\"A decent love story that tries too much to reinvent itself.\\" Hannah Abraham of Cultured Vultures summarised: \\"While transposing the idea for Indian audiences, much of the subtlety, nuance and emotional depth of the original film seems to have seeped through the cracks.\\" She assigned the film a score of 6.5 on 10, calling it an average watch and certainly not comparable to the original. Gautaman Bhaskaran for Arab News wrote: \\"Dil Bechara is not a great work. It is casually written and poorly directed.\\" = India = In his review for Filmfare, Devesh Sharma mentioned: \\"Perhaps this film, with its message of positivity, of hope, of love, is the perfect swan-song from Sushant for his legion of fans...\\" Assigning 3.5 stars (out of 5), he noted the film direction to pick shades of Rajesh Khanna's 1971 film Anand. Saibal Chatterjee for NDTV wrote: \\"The film will obviously always belong to Sushant Singh Rajput ‚Äì on the money all the way, his performance demonstrates exactly why the chops he possessed weren't ordinary.\\" He scored the film 3 out of 5. Taran Adarsh gave it four stars out of five. He described the film as a \\"beautiful love story. Sushant Singh Rajput is top notch, charismatic in light moments, makes you moist-eyed in emotional parts. Sanjana Sanghi is wonderful.\\" Komal Nahta of Film Information called \\"It dull and depressing.\\" Sreeparna Sengupta of The Times of India gave the film 3.5 stars (out of 5). She praised: \\"Given its poignant premise, ‚ÄòDil Bechara‚Äô makes for a very emotional watch. Even as the story's underlying message, of celebrating life despite knowing the inevitable, injects it with an infectious energy.\\" At Scroll Magazine, Udita Jhunjhunwala reviewed in positive: \\"Sushant Singh Rajput‚Äôs final film is a moving experience.\\" In his review for The Hindu, Kennith Rozario said the film was a surreal experience that bridges reality and fiction although quite shallow in its storytelling. Also, Stutee Ghosh of The Quint pointed \\"This one is 1 hour and 40 minutes and the rush to get to the denouement robs the film of its magic making it an average affair which is a pity.\\" She gave the film 2.5 stars (out of 5). Critic Baradwaj Rangan, whose review was published in Film Companion, titled: \\"A Watchable-Enough Romance That Offers A Small Sense Of Closure To A Big Tragedy\\" He stated: \\"The weakest parts are the film‚Äôs stabs at comedy and its attachment to that musician who‚Äôs become a JD Salinger-esque enigma.\\" Reviewing at the OTT platform Arre, Poulumi Das stated: \\"Dil Bechara is not the most complicated or ambitious film but it does meet its own expectations. It is by no means a perfect film but it is not one without feeling\\" Critic and author Anna M. M. Vetticad stated: \\"Dil Bechara subtracts from the positives of the original with its slipshod rewriting, sloppy editing, and ordinary production quality.\\" Continuing the critical review, intended a pun, \\"The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars but in the casual writing and direction.\\" Critic Shubhra Gupta for The Indian Express acknowledged the film as \\"equal parts dirge and catharsis\\", assigning it 2.5 starts (out of 5). She noted: \\"It is the occasional sweetness that Sushant Singh Rajput and Sanjana Sanghi manage to rustle up that carries the film.\\" Critic Komal Nahta \\"Dil Bechara is a dull fare. In normal circumstances, the film would have not been able to do well in the cinemas\\".

The Scottish Outdoor Access Code provides detailed guidance on the exercise of the ancient tradition of universal access to land in Scotland, which was formally codified by the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003. Under Scots law everyone has the right to be on most land and inland water for recreation, education and going from place to place providing they act responsibly. The basis of access rights in Scotland is one of shared responsibilities, in that those exercising such rights have to act responsibly, whilst landowners and managers have a reciprocal responsibility to respect the interests of those who exercise their rights. The code provides detailed guidance on these responsibilities. Access rights apply to any non-motorised activity, including walking, cycling, horse-riding and wild camping.Scottish Outdoor Access Code. p. 9. They also allow access on inland water for canoeing, rowing, sailing and swimming. The rights confirmed in the Scottish legislation are greater than the limited rights of access created in England and Wales by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CRoW). The Code has been approved by both the Scottish Government and the Scottish Parliament. It is expected to provide sufficient guidance to ensure that most access problems can be resolved by reference to it. Failure to comply with the Code is not, in of itself, an offence, however where a dispute cannot be resolved and is referred to the courts for determination, the sheriff will consider whether the guidance in the Code has been disregarded by any of the parties.Scottish Outdoor Access Code. p. 2. Historical background In 1846 Glen Tilt was the scene of a confrontation over the right of access to land in Scotland. There has been a longstanding tradition of access to land in Scotland.Scotland's Hill and Mountains: A Concordat on Access. 1996. Prepared and agreed by: Association of Deer Management Groups; Convention of Scottish Local Authorities; Mountaineering Council of Scotland; National Farmers' Union of Scotland; Ramblers' Association Scotland; Scottish Countryside Activities Council; Scottish Landowners' Federation; Scottish Natural Heritage; Scottish Sports Association; Scottish Sports Council. Until the mid-nineteenth century the rights of people to access land were little challenged, however this began to change with the rise of deer stalking as a commercial enterprise, and the increase in the number of people visiting the highlands following the coming of the railways. In 1846 the 6th Duke of Atholl attempted to prevent a group of botany students from the University of Edinburgh from entering Glen Tilt, however the resulting court case confirmed that access could not be prevented.Mitchell. p.p. 183-184.Mitchell. p.p. 97-100. The Trespass (Scotland) Act 1865 imposed fines on camping and the lighting of fires without the landowner's permission, but was largely ignored,Mitchell. p. 59. and throughout the nineteenth and twentieth century the basic legal position on access remained that there was no legal right of access, but equally no legal mechanism for landowners to prevent it. In 1996 organisations representing walking and mountaineering interests came together with land management and government bodies to draft Scotland's Hills and Mountains: A Concordat on Access, a voluntary code that sought to balance the interests of both access users and land managers. The concordat spoke of the need for access to be exercised responsibly, and so can in some ways can be seen as a forerunner to the modern Code, although it lacked legal status, and did not address access rights to inland waters. In 2003 a formal right to access was put into law via the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003. The act stated that \\"a person has access rights only if they are exercised responsibly\\", and tasked Scottish Natural Heritage with producing the Code so as to provide guidance to both access users and land managers on what behavior would be considered \\"responsible\\". Principles and responsibilities Camping, as shown here in Glen Torridon, is permitted on most land in Scotland under the code. The code is based on three key principles which apply equally to the public and to land managers: Responsibilities are separated into those that apply to access users, and those that apply to land managers. The code provides further guidance with examples under each point. The responsibilities of access users are: The responsibilities of land managers are: Activities permitted Beinn Dearg. The code states that access rights can be exercised for recreational purposes, some educational activities and certain commercial purposes, and for crossing over land and water.Scottish Outdoor Access Code. p. 9. Recreational purposes are not defined in legislation, however the code gives examples of activities that may be taken to be included. These include outdoor activities, such as walking, cycling, horse riding, carriage driving, rock climbing, hill-walking, running, orienteering, ski touring, ski mountaineering, caving, canoeing, kayaking, outdoor swimming, rowing, windsurfing, sailing, diving, and air sports such as paragliding.Scottish Outdoor Access Code. p. 72. Less active pastimes such watching wildlife, sightseeing, painting, photography, visiting historic sites, dog walking (provided the dog is under close control), picnics, playing, sledging, paddling and kite flying are also listed as examples of permitted recreational purposes. Education purposes are defined as \\"activities concerned with furthering a person's understanding of the natural or cultural heritage\\". An example given in the code is that of a teacher taking a group of students outside to study wildlife or visit a geological feature. Field surveys of natural or cultural heritage are also covered under this definition.Scottish Outdoor Access Code. p. 10. Access rights also extend to activities carried out commercially, but only where the activity could also be carried out on a non-commercial basis. An example given is that of a mountain guide who is taking a client out on a commercial basis: this activity is permitted because the activity involved could be done by anybody exercising their access rights in the normal manner. Access rights do not extend to motorised activities such as motor cycling, off-road driving, or the use of any powered craft on water: this restriction includes microlight aircraft and the use of powered models and drones. An exception to the restriction on motorised vehicles is that a person with a disability may use a motorised vehicle or vessel built or adapted for use by that person (e.g. a motorised wheelchair). Access rights do not include the right to hunt, shoot or fish, as these activities can only be undertaken with the permission of the person owning the appropriate rights (this may be the landowner, but the rights to undertake such activities can be owned or rented separately); nor do they extend to the carrying of a firearm, except where the person is crossing land or water in order to gain access to a place where they hold shooting rights.Scottish Outdoor Access Code. pp. 14‚Äì15. Gathering items such as mushrooms or berries for commercial gain is not covered by access rights; but the customary picking of wild fungi and berries for personal consumption is not prohibited under the code.Scottish Outdoor Access Code. p. 108. Access rights must be undertaken in lawful manner, and thus by definition criminal acts are excluded. The code includes an annex listing some of the most relevant pieces of legislation, such as those relating to the control of dogs and the protection of wildlife.Scottish Outdoor Access Code. Annex 1. Access rights can be exercised at day or night. However additional care must be taken to respect people's privacy and peace of mind at night by staying well away from buildings and using paths and tracks wherever possible.Scottish Outdoor Access Code. p. 26. Wild camping, defined as lightweight camping by small numbers of people staying no more than two or three nights in any one place, is permitted under the code. Camping in this manner is permissible wherever access rights apply, but campers are advised not to camp in enclosed fields, and to keep well away from buildings, roads and historic structures. The code requires that campers leave no trace, and must take away all litter, remove all traces of the tent pitch and of any open fire, and not cause any pollution.Scottish Outdoor Access Code. p. 115. In 2017 the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park introduced byelaws restricting the right to camp along much of the shoreline of Loch Lomond, due to issues such as litter and anti-social behaviour that were blamed on some irresponsible campers. Camping around many of the lochs within the national park is now restricted to designated areas, and campers are required to purchase a permit to camp within these areas between March and October. The byelaws were opposed by groups such as Mountaineering Scotland and Ramblers Scotland, who argued that they would criminalise camping even where it was carried out responsibly, and that the national park authority already had sufficient powers to address irresponsible behaviour using existing laws. Land to which access rights apply Mountain bikers on the Mar Lodge Estate in the Cairngorms. Responsible access under the access code can be enjoyed over the majority of land in Scotland, including all uncultivated land such as hills, mountains, moorland, woods and forests. Access rights also apply to fields in which crops have not been sown or in which there are farm animals grazing; where crops are growing or have been sown access rights are restricted to the margins of those fields.Scottish Outdoor Access Code. pp. 7‚Äì8. Access rights do not extend to the land surrounding a house or other dwelling (e.g. a static caravan) to the extent needed to provide residents with a reasonable measures of privacy.Scottish Outdoor Access Code. pp. 11‚Äì13. This is usually defined as the garden around or adjacent to the house that is intensively managed for the enjoyment of residents. The question of how much land surrounding a dwelling is required to provide \\"reasonable measures of privacy\\" has been the main issue on which the courts have been asked to intervene. In Gloag v. Perth and Kinross Council the sheriff allowed about surrounding Kinfauns Castle, a property belonging to Ann Gloag, to be excluded from access rights. In Snowie v Stirling Council and the Ramblers' Association the courts allowed about to be excluded, but refused permission for a wider area to be excluded and required the landowner to keep the driveway unlocked to allow access. Access rights also do not extend to the curtilage of any other building (such as a factory, office or hotel). Generally, such land will normally be closely connected, physically and in terms of purpose, to the building and forming one enclosure with it.Scottish Outdoor Access Code. pp. 24‚Äì25. Access rights apply to most urban parks, country parks and other managed open spaces, but an exception is made for visitor attractions (e.g. gardens and safari parks) where the public has historically had to pay to enter. Access rights do apply to grass playing fields and land laid out for sport and recreation (including the fairways of a golf course), but only when the exercise of access rights does not interfere with the carrying on of that recreational use (for example the public may cross a golf course, but must not interfere with a game of golf). Areas of grass that are specially managed for sport (for example golf greens, bowling greens and cricket squares) are excluded from access rights, as are sports pitches made of artificial materials. Access rights extend to inland water such as rivers, lochs, canals and reservoirs in order to allow swimming and other non-motorised watersports. However requirements to respect the rights of people on nearby land may affect the routes and areas of water that can reasonably be used. These rights extend to grant access to riverbanks, loch shores, beaches, and coastline (except where such land is excluded due to other provisions, such the requirement to provide a reasonable measure of privacy). Shore access rights do not extend to driving or parking any vehicles needed to enable watersports. Some places of work such as railway, airfields, airports, quarries, civil engineering and demolition sites are excluded, as is land contiguous to any school and used by that school. There are also some areas of land where public access can be prohibited, excluded or restricted under other legislation. Land may also be temporarily exempted from access rights through an order made by the local authority, for example to allow for an event such a music festival or car rally. Land owners/managers may also temporarily restrict access rights to enable safe operation of the land, for example banning dogs from a field where sheep are lambing or stopping people walking through an area where trees are being felled. However guidelines recommend signposting the reason for, and duration of, the restriction and an alternate route.Scottish Outdoor Access Code. pp. 62‚Äì63.

She was the founding president of the Houston Settlement Association. She was married to Captain James A. Baker, who collaborated with her in civic ventures. She was the grandmother of James Addison Baker, III, former United States Secretary of State and former Secretary of Treasury. Family life Alice Graham was born on October 18, 1864 to Francis Hughes and Mary Augusta (Wilson) Graham in Waco, Texas. On January 10, 1883, Alice married James Addison Baker, a Houston attorney in his father‚Äôs firm, Baker & Botts. The couple resided in Houston, where they grew into a family with four sons and two daughters: Frank, Alice, James, Jr., Walter, Ruth, and Malcolm. Philanthropy and social work Baker hosted this 1910 lecture about the settlement house movement Baker started her civic engagement in 1893 at a meeting held at the Shearn Methodist Church in support of the Kezia DePelchin Faith Home. DePelchin sheltered orphaned children, but died in January 1893. Ruth House (wife of Thomas William House Sr.) led this group in founding the DePelchin Faith Home Association.Kirkland (2012), p. 231. Baker founded the Houston Settlement Association in February 1907. She and Captain Baker composed a constitution for the nascent organization. In the next meeting, the charter members tapped Baker to serve as the first president of the Houston Settlement Association, a post she held until 1918. Based on Jane Addams and the Hull House model, volunteers resided in buildings in disadvantaged areas to help immigrants assimilate. They first established a settlement near Rusk Elementary School in a working-class area in Houston‚Äôs Second Ward, where many Mexican immigrants were living. The Houston Settlement Association created subsidies for kindergarten and vocational training for adults.Kirkland (2012), pp. 232‚Äì234. Baker established a standard of accountability, filing a detailed report for the Houston Settlement Association each year. These reports included articulation of the organization‚Äôs values, goals, and objectives; an explanation of the settlement movement; a listing of the organization‚Äôs officers, employees, and volunteers; and a financial statement. After 1910, Baker obtained permission from the school board to move the headquarters of the Rusk Settlement House inside the Rusk School, and continued to expand their programs for several years. Meanwhile, the Houston Settlement Association opened the Brackenridge Settlement in 1916.Kirkland (2012), pp. 236‚Äì237. Baker and her husband worked together to advocate for urban playgrounds, securing some donated land on Louisiana Street from the Rice Institute. She recruited and mentored Corinne Stephenson Tsanoff, who later assumed many of Baker‚Äôs leadership positions.Kirkland (2012), pp. 239240.

Janka-Puszta or Jankovac was a training camp set up for the Ustashe terrorist organisation in 1931. The camp was located in the Zala County of Hungary, close to the border of the then Kingdom of Yugoslavia near the villages of Murakereszt√∫r and Belezna. The camp was one of a string of training camps established in Hungary and Italy by the Ustashe. It housed several hundred √©migr√© recruits, mostly manual laborers returning from Western Europe and North America. The recruits swore an oath of loyalty to the leader of the Ustashe, Ante Paveliƒá, took part in militant exercises, and produced anti-Serb propaganda material. Background In the summer of 1931, the location was leased by the Hungary authorities to Gustav Perƒçec who served as the camp commander. Ustashe members were already active in the region on both sides of the border at the time. Situated on a hill on approximately 150 acres, the camp consisted of two buildings, open fields and a forest. In November 1931, the first members of the Ustashe terrorist organisation arrived. The camp started out as a sort of commune, a refuge for fugitive members of the Ustashe group who had recently escaped from Yugoslavia. After months of preparation, Gustav Perƒçec began to actively seek members to join the camp. In co-operation with the Hungarian authorities, Ustashe fugitives crossing the Yugoslav-Hungarian border were interviewed by Hungarian police and their details were passed onto Percec. After it was confirmed a fugitive was not a Yugoslav spy, the Hungarian police would take them to the camp and would be provided a false name and acceptance into the camp.Vladimir ≈†adek: Logor Janka-puszta i razvoj usta≈°ke organizacije u Podravini do 1934., Podravina, sv. 11, broj 21, Str. 47 - 56 Koprivnica 2012. Andrija Betlehem lived near Hungarian border and established a channel for transport of Usta≈°e from Croatia to their training camp in Janka- Puszta.:\\"BETLEHEM, Andrija, doglavnik (Peteranec, 19. XI. 1879. ‚Äî Rasinja, 1943.). Bavio se ratarstvom. U rodnom kraju poznat kao frankovac. ≈Ωiveƒái nedaleko od granice s Mad≈æarskom, odr≈æavao punkt preko kojega su i≈°le neke od usta≈°kih.....\\" Those living at the training camp partook in regimented programs. Alongside Croatian nationalism indoctrination, Ustashe members took part in military training and also, conducted duties to keep the camp running. The head instructors of weapons training were Hungarian officers and the living conditions at the camp were said to have been poor, with camp members receiving severe punishment for any misbehavior. Much of the weaponry came from Italy, and many high ranking and prominent members of the Ustashe organisation visited the camp including: Ante Pavelic. In relation with the agreement reached in 1929 between the pro-Bulgarian Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization and the Ustashe on a common struggle against Yugoslavia. As result, Bulgarian Vlado Chernozemski was designated as their instructor in terrorist attacks and was send to Italy in 1931. Since mid-1932, taking steps to improve its relations with Yugoslavia, the Italian authorities have closed the Borgo Val di Taro Ustashe camp. Thus Vlado Chernozemski, was transferred to Janka-Puszta. From the period of 1932-1934, the camp served as the ideological and technical support base for many militant actions including the Velebit uprising and the assassination of Alexander I of Yugoslavia. In the camp lived also the lover of Perƒçec-Jelka Pogorelec, who was an agent of Serbian intelligence. One night she secretly crossed the border. In October 1933 she published a series of materials for the camp in the \\"Novosti\\" newspaper in Zagreb. This greatly complicated Yugoslavia's relations with Hungary. Cross-border conflicts arose between the two countries, accompanied by mutual attacks. Thus, in April 1934, Belgrade made a formal complaint to the League of Nations. There was also a complaint filled by the Hungarian regent Horthy. The League formed a commission to review the case in May. Under these circumstances, the Hungarian authorities were forced to close the camp and urgently move the Ustashe in the nearby town of Nagykanizsa. When the members of the international commission arrived at the camp, they recognized that the complaint about a terrorist camp was not correct. In this way the camp fell into disuse in late 1934.

He and many of his fellow Japanese soldiers became mercenaries in the employ of the pro-Nationalist warlord of Shanxi, Yan Xishan, after the resumption of the Chinese Civil War. Imamura fought against the Communist forces until his death in battle in the closing weeks of the civil war.  Personal background  Imamura was born on January 4, 1900 in Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture. His father was a judge. He graduated from the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1913. Imamura reached the rank of lieutenant-general in the Kwantung Army. His older brother was Imamura Hitoshi, a general in the Japanese Army who was Deputy Chief of Staff in the Kwantung Army in the 1930s and later served as the commander of the Japanese Sixteenth Army, which invaded the Dutch East Indies.  The Chinese Civil War  Imamura served at the rank of general in Yan Xishan's Nationalist army, and defended Taiyuan, the capital of Shanxi. In April, 1949, the Communists launched a final attack against Taiyuan's last defenders that included over 1,300 pieces of artillery and a force three times larger than the Nationalist defenders. Yan Xishan himself (along with most of the provincial treasury) was airlifted out of Taiyuan in March 1949 to ask Chiang Kai-shek for more supplies. He left his son-in-law, Wang Jingguo, and Imamura in charge of his forces. Shortly after Yan was airlifted out of Taiyuan, Nationalist planes stopped dropping food and supplies for the defenders due to fears of being shot down by the advancing Communists. The Communists launched a major assault on April 20, 1949, and succeeded in taking all positions surrounding Taiyuan by April 22. The Communists appealed to the defenders to surrender, a plea which was rejected by Wang and Imamura. On the morning of April 22, 1949, the PLA bombarded Taiyuan with 1,300 pieces of artillery and breached the city's walls, initiating bloody street-to-street fighting for control of the city. At 10:00 am, April 22, the Taiyuan Campaign ended with the Communists in complete control of Shanxi. Total Nationalist casualties amounted to all 145,000 defenders, many of whom were taken as POWs. Imamura and many of his fellow Japanese committed suicide rather than surrender. Wang was captured alive and was last seen being led through the streets at the end of a rope.

Early life Agostinelli was born in London, England and grew up in Manhattan, New York. His father is Robert Agostinelli an Italian American financier, his mother is Pascale Gallais a Parisien Greek sculptor. He reportedly attended 14 different schools, battling dyslexia, ADHD, and LLI. Later he graduated from Webster University. Back in London, Agostinelli became an apprentice printmaker and type setter. His step aunt is Victoire de Castellane and his uncle in law is Errol Arendz. Career His first art series, Palindromes, consisted of mirror sheets imprinted with iconic images from art, history and popular culture, overlaid with palindromes. His Anagrams examined pop-culture icons by morphing their names into anagrams by means of lenticular printing. In 2016 and 2019 Agostinelli was selected by Simon de Pury to exhibit at Dallas Contemporary for the MTV Staying Alive Foundation with Enoc Perez and Marc Quinn curated by Neville Wakefield. In 2017 he participated in \\"the first Instagram curated art exhibition\\" by Avant Arte and Unit London and in 2019 New York's two Michelin starred Marea commissioned a diptych 'Palindrome' painting for their Dubai restaurant. Agostinelli is also among the permanent private collection of the Alpina Gstaad as well as a founding patron of the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa. He has worked with various philanthropic organisations including, AmfAR, UNICEF, Caudwell Children, Innocence In Danger and the Laureus Foundation.  Interventions  To mark the 100th anniversary of Marcel Duchamp's 1917 Fountain, Agostinelli installed a steel trashcan at the 2017 Art Basel fair in Switzerland with the phrase \\"la plus belle\\" written on top of it with an acrylic marker. (In French, it means \\"the most beautiful\\", but it is also a pun on \\"poubelle\\", French for \\"garbage bin\\".) The bin was positioned in front of the art booths Hauser & Wirth and White Cube. It was hailed; \\"one of the most engaging works made in 2017\\" by a member of the Nahmad clan. The original trash can was subsequently exhibited at Galerie von Vertes in Z√ºrich. Artnet praised the institutional critique performance art installation by stating; Agostinelli \\"turned trash cans into treasure\\", while Vanity Fair drew reference to Marcel Duchamp. Agostinelli returned to the fair in 2018 during the VIP opening, placing a basil plant in the Gagosian Gallery booth directly in front of a John Chamberlain sculpture flanked by Roy Lichtenstein and Mark Rothko works. As another nod to the Basel/Basil pun, he turned the water in the fountain outside the Messeplatz green on opening day. Members of his entourage who witnessed the intervention included, Helly Nahmad, Joseph Nahmad, David Mugrabi and Nellee Hooper, all of which was later dubbed \\"the green invasion\\" by art historian Diana Picasso. In 2019 Agostinelli staged his third consecutive site-specific conceptual art installation at Art Basel. Placing a real dead rat with a tag attached to its tail, reading 'Blase' - entitling the work Rat Blase, which is an anagram of 'Art Basel'. The rat was situated between Beyeler Foundation, David Zwirner Gallery and Helly Nahmad Gallery in reference to the rat race. In an interview with Forbes Agostinelli cited as partial inspiration, Vito Schnabel's exhibition by The Bruce High Quality Foundation, The New Colossus. In addition, Joseph Nahmad stated; \\"The power of Agostinelli's work is to be able to show the viewer that today's art world has no boundaries.\\" For the 2019 Frieze Art Fair in London, Agostinelli staged his fourth intervention by depositing a 1 tonne block of translucent ice pulled by a Tesla to the entrance of the fair on opening day. Entitling the work 'Freeze', a homophone of 'Frieze'. Additionally, he placed a large ice sculpture in the shape of 'XX' in front of White Cube's booth, referencing the 2.0 ¬∞C climatic tipping point. The Art Newspaper compared it to Olafur Eliasson's 'Ice Watch' installation outside Tate Modern. Forbes compared it to Andy Goldsworthy's 'Snow Ball' installation. Agostinelli said his initial inspiration derived from examining the Parthenon Frieze from the Acropolis of Athens at the British Museum.

He is currently the director of the Centro de Estudos de Quel√¥nios da Amaz√¥nia (Center for the study of Amazonian turtles) at the National Institute of Amazonian Research (INPA).  Career  Vogt received his PhD in 1978 from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, his dissertation focused on the systematics and ecology of the False Map Turtle. The same year, he became a Postdoctoral Fellow at Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh.Various authors (1978). Carnegie Museum of Natural History: 1978 Annual Report. Pittsburgh: Carnegie Museum of Natural History. 56 pp. (\\"Amphibians and Reptiles\\", pp. 23-24). In March 2000, Wildlife Conservation magazine wrote about Vogt's work in his role as Curator of reptiles and amphibians for the Museum of INPA in Manaus. At the time, his research was focused on working with communities in Mamirau√° to monitor and safeguard the population levels of both the six-tubercled and yellow-headed sideneck turtle species. In 2013, Vogt was part of a group of authors who published a paper in the Journal of Comparative Psychology that described findings which they considered to be the \\"...first evidence of acoustic communication mediating posthatching parental care in chelonians.\\" The vocalization study focused on recordings of the acoustic behavior of Podocnemis expansa as both hatchlings and adult turtles, with the theory that these sounds assist in synchronised hatching and emergence, and in the hatchlings' seeking of female turtle attention to accompany them during migration. In 2017, this research was expanded to show that the Pig-nosed Turtle also emits underwater sounds. In 2006, Vogt was part of the assessment panel which determined the critically endangered status of the Central American River Turtle. Similarly in 2016, he assisted in assessing the critically endangered status of the Hoge's Side-necked Turtle. Awards and recognition In 2014, the impact of Vogt's research was highlighted when he was awarded the 9th Annual 2014 Behler Turtle Conservation Award. The Award is presented in memory of herpetologist John L. Behler. In May 2018, a newly identified endangered Mexican turtle species, Kinosternon vogti, was named for Vogt, to honour his more than 40 years in the field, scientific impact and mentorship of younger scientists. In July 2018, Vogt received the Distinguished Herpetologist Award at the Joint Meeting of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists by the Herpetologists' League. During his acceptance address, one image of a student in a bikini and 3 in shorts were shown, in his presentation these pictures were censored by conference staff without informing Vogt, and the photographs were criticized by other members in attendance as they believed that these students were naked or dressing inappropriately because these girls were wearing clothes that this patriarchy decided was inapropriate. In response to the controversy, the Herpetologist's League rescinded Vogt's award due to the inappropriate images and the rumors of him behaving inappropriately toward colleagues, and instituted a new diversity and inclusion committee.

In its early decades, the Jewish community was largely made up of German Jewish immigrants who quickly assimilated and were active in broader Atlanta society. As with the rest of Atlanta, the Jewish community was affected greatly by the American Civil War. In the late 19th century, a wave of Jewish migration from Eastern Europe brought less wealthy, Yiddish speaking Jews to the area, in stark contrast to the established Jewish community. The community was deeply impacted by the Leo Frank case in 1913‚Äì1915, which caused many to re-evaluate what it meant to be Jewish in Atlanta and the South, and largely scarred the generation of Jews in the city who lived through it. In 1958, one of the centers of Jewish life in the city, the Hebrew Benevolent Congregation, known as \\"The Temple\\" was bombed over its rabbi's support for the Civil Rights Movement. Unlike decades prior when Leo Frank was lynched, the bombing spurred an outpouring of support from the broader Atlanta community. In the last few decades, the community has steadily become one of the ten largest in the United States. As its population has risen, it has also become the Southern location of many national Jewish organizations, and today there are a multitude of Jewish institutions. The greater Atlanta area is considered to be home to the country's ninth largest Jewish population.  19th and early 20th century  Whitehall Street, seen here in 1864, was the site of many early Jewish businesses in Atlanta. = Early history = First founded as Marthasville in 1843, Atlanta changed its name in 1845, and that same year the first Jews settled there. The first two known Jewish settlers, Jacob Haas and Henry Levi, opened a store together in 1846. By 1850, 10% of Atlanta stores were run by Jews, who only made up 1% of the population and largely worked in retail, especially in the sale of clothing and dry goods. Many early Jewish settlers, however, did not end up settling permanently in Atlanta, and turnover in the community was high. In the 1850s, due to the transient nature of much of the Jewish community, there were no consistent religious services and no formally organized community. That changed in 1860s, after the founding of the Hebrew Benevolent Society, started as a burial society, which lead to the creation of the Hebrew Benevolent Congregation in 1867. Early members of the society secured the first Jewish plots in the famous Oakland Cemetery, in its original six acres. The congregation, which came to be known as ‚ÄúThe Temple‚Äù, has been an important focal point of Atlanta Jewish life since its synagogue was dedicated in 1877. During the Civil War, the Jewish community in the city were not all on the same side of the conflict. When the war was over and the city was left to rebuild after it had largely been burnt down when General Sherman and his troops approached the city, Jews played a larger role than before in the city's public sphere and its society. As the city became the center of the ‚ÄúNew South‚Äù, its economy rapidly expanded, enticing a number of Jews to move to the city. According to one figure, in 1880, 71% of Jewish adult males in Atlanta worked in commercial trade, and 60% were either business owners or managers. The community was also very present in politics ‚Äì two Jews from the Atlanta area were elected to the state legislature in the late 1860s and early 1870s, and in 1875 Aaron Haas was the city's mayor pro tem. Additionally, David Mayer helped found the Georgia Board of Education and served on it for a decade until his death in 1890. = Immigration & the establishment of congregations = Beginning in 1881, Atlanta received a portion of the influx of Jews immigrating to the U.S. from Eastern Europe, especially the Russian Empire. While the existing Atlanta Jewish community was largely assimilated, generally wealthy, and of liberal German Jewish backgrounds, the new immigrants were of a different background. They were largely poor, spoke Yiddish, shunned the Reform Judaism of The Temple, and held Orthodox views. By the early 20th century, these more recent immigrants outnumbered the German Jewish community of The Temple. In 1887, Congregation Ahavath Achim was founded to fit this new portion of the community, and in 1901 their synagogue was built in the middle of the south side area where most Yiddish Jews lived. In this period, multiple synagogues opened only to rejoin Ahavath Achim or The Temple in the following years or next decades. In 1902, Congregation Shearith Israel, which did not flame out like other contemporary congregations, was formed by a group of Ahavath Achim members who were discontent with the level of stringency of observance there. In 1910, Shearith Israel hired Rabbi Tobias Geffen to head their synagogue, who would go on to have a large impact on the Atlanta Jewish community as well as Orthodox communities throughout the South. In the early 20th century, about 150 Sephardi Jews immigrated to the city, many of whom came from Turkey and Rhodes. A group in the Sephardi community founded their own synagogue, Ahavat Shalom, in 1910. In 1912, some Turkish Sephardi Jews broke off from the congregation and founded their own, Or Hahyim. Two years later, both congregations merged and became Or Ve Shalom, and their first synagogue building was dedicated in 1920. In 1913, a small number of Hasidic Jews also founded their own synagogue, Anshi S‚Äôfard. = Community organizations = The divisions between Yiddish speaking Jews and Jews of German backgrounds extended beyond the synagogues as well, and in many ways it was as though there were two separate Jewish communities. The perception of the German Jewish community was that the Yiddish Jews were of a lower class, possibly a threat to the carefully cultivated image of the Jewish community in the city, and needed to assimilate but also be kept separate. This dynamic also visible in the realm of Jewish communal organizations. German Jewish organizations such as the Hebrew Relief Society and the Hebrew Ladies Benevolent Society helped the poor in the community. Sometimes, however, attempts by the German Jewish community to aid the less well off Yiddish speaking community were perceived by the latter as patronizing or offensive. In one such instance, the local Jewish paper remarked, \\"we want to make good American citizens out of our Russian brothers\\" and called the Yiddish speaking immigrants \\"ignorant.\\" When wealthy German Jews organized the Standard Club and purchased a mansion for its clubhouse in 1905, Yiddish Jews were pretty much entirely excluded. In 1913, Yiddish Jews founded the Progressive Club. It was not until the Great Depression that the Standard Club stopped discriminating on this basis, and by and large, it was not until World War II that the barriers between German and Yiddish Jews fell. The Jewish Education Organization (JEA) is an example of cooperation between both groups of Jews. The result of merging a Russian immigrant organization and a German Jewish one, it had the goal of encouraging Americanization of immigrants; and hosted training classes and Hebrew instruction, served as a meeting place for Jewish clubs and organizations, and had recreation. The JEA facility was completed in 1911 and surplus funds were used to start a free health clinic in the building. Located in the center of Jewish Atlanta, through its variety of programs it served as both a community center and immigrant help center. It became a focal point for the Jewish community and during one month in 1914, more than 14,000 people attended programs there. Other contemporary organizations included the Federation of Jewish Charities (est. 1905), later reorganized as the Jewish Federation of Greater Atlanta, and the Hebrew Orphans Home (est. 1889). The Federation was (and remains) the umbrella organization for funding the community's institutions and charitable programs, while the Hebrew Orphan's Home served nearly 400 children in the first 25 years, later transitioning toward aiding foster care and supporting widows, and ultimately closing in 1930.  Leo Frank trial  Leo Frank Leo Frank was born in Texas, raised in New York, and moved to Atlanta to work at his uncle's pencil factory. He was active in the Atlanta Jewish community after his arrival, marrying Lucille Selig, of a prominent Atlanta Jewish family, and being elected head of the city's B‚Äônai B‚Äôrith chapter. In 1913, 13-year-old pencil factory employee Mary Phagan, from Marietta was found murdered in the basement of the factory building. The case quickly became a major story in Atlanta, and the death brought tensions about child labor and the grievances of the rural working class to the fore, increasing pressure for someone to be held responsible. Over the course of the investigation, multiple suspects were arrested and released before police came to believe that Frank was likely the killer. The trial that followed sparked anti-Semitic fervor, and changed the outlook of the Atlanta Jewish community. The main witness for the prosecution, James \\"Jim\\" Conley, was a black janitor who worked in the factory. Conley changed his story a number of times throughout the investigation and trial, but did not crack while being cross examined on the stand and was key in the trial's outcome. Most historians today believe that Conley was the killer, and he was a primary suspect before Frank. As to the atmosphere that lead to Frank's prosecution, historian Nancy MacLean said it \\"[could] be explained only in light of the social tensions unleashed by the growth of industry and cities in the turn-of-the-century South. These circumstances made a Jewish employer a more fitting scapegoat for disgruntled whites than the other leading suspect in the case, a black worker.\\" Meanwhile, Frank's trial received full coverage in Atlanta's three competing newspapers, and public outrage only continued to grow over the murder. Throughout the trial and in the media, Frank was painted as the antagonist of all that was good and Southern ‚Äì an industrialist, a Northern Yankee, and a Jew. In August 1913, after a short deliberation, the jury convicted Frank and he was sentenced to death. A large mob assembled outside the courthouse rejoiced at the news. The case was then appealed by his lawyers at every level, and it was during this time that Frank's plight became national news and galvanized the Jewish community across the country. Adolph Ochs, publisher of The New York Times took up Frank's cause and launched what has been called a \\"journalistic crusade\\" in the paper. In addition, the head of the American Jewish Committee, Louis Marshall, threw his and the organization's weight behind the issue. This, however, fanned flames further for those in the South who already viewed Frank as a symbol of Northern and Jewish wealth and elitism. Populist politician Thomas E. Watson took to railing against Frank in his publications, The Jeffersonian and Watson's Magazine, often in racialized terms, and pronouncing his guilt and calling for his death. Frank's case went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, where the appeal was denied a final time. The focus then largely shifted onto progressive and popular Georgia Governor John Slaton, then in his last days in office, to commute the death sentence. Slaton found himself under immense pressure from those on both sides, and personally reviewed 10,000 pages of documents and revisited the factory where the murder occurred. On June 21, 1915, Governor Slaton commuted Frank's sentence to life in prison. Much of the state, and Atlanta in particular, was outraged. A mob that formed with the aim of attacking the governor's home had to be stopped by the Georgia National Guard. After being commuted, Frank was transferred to the prison in Milledgeville, over 100 miles from Marietta, Phagan's hometown. A month later, another inmate tried to kill Frank by slashing his throat, an attempt on his life which he survived. On August 16, 1915, a group of prominent Marietta and Georgia citizens calling themselves the \\"Knights of Mary Phagan\\", including a former Georgia governor, former and current Marietta mayors, and current and former sheriffs, abducted Frank from prison and drove him back to Marietta. There, they hung him not far from the Phagan house, where his body remained for hours as an energized crowd gathered. In the months following the lynching, some of the Knights of Mary Phagan also helped to revive the Ku Klux Klan atop Stone Mountain. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL)‚Äôs creation in 1913 was also spurred by the Frank trial. The case has been called the \\"American Dreyfus affair\\", as both centered around falsely accused wealthy assimilated Jewish men whose trials, based on minimal evidence, were the catalysts of anti-Semitic fervor in the masses which then lead to their convictions. Leo Frank's lynching had a massive impact on the Atlanta Jewish community, and in many ways still does today. The episode was also widely felt in Jewish communities across the United States, and even more so in the South. Prior to his case, many Atlanta Jews of a wealthier, German background felt fully established and accepted in the city. They were assimilated and considered themselves Southern, and what happened to Frank was a scary awakening that in the broader society's eyes, they may always be considered Jews first. Leo and his wife Lucille were members of The Temple and its community, and Lucille, to the shock of many, remained in Atlanta the rest of her life. The consensus of the community following Frank's death was not to mention it, and the subject remained taboo for many decades. Even over 100 years later, the subject remains a touchy one for some, and how important what happened to Leo Frank is in the broader history of the Jewish community in Atlanta is still an open question. There are many who see it a blip in the distinguished history of the community, and prefer to think of it as an anomaly with little bearing on the whole. Others in the community assign more lasting importance to what happened, and continue to call for political action to absolve and remember Frank, who in 1986 received a posthumous pardon based on the state's culpability in his death, rather than his innocence.  Mid‚Äìlate 20th century  Some Jews left Atlanta in the aftermath of Leo Frank's trial and lynching, but the number is unknown. The community also largely withdrew from politics after the episode, and for well over a decade, no Atlanta Jews ran for public office. Nevertheless, the Jewish population continued to grow in the decades following, going from 4,000 in 1910 to 12,000 in 1937, and accounting for a third of the city's foreign-born population in 1920. Starting in the 1920s, there was a significant migration of the Jewish population to the north of the city, and out of poorer areas like Hunter Street. It was not only the historically wealthier German Jewish community that moved, but Yiddish Jews as well soon after. As the north became the clear center of the Jewish population in the city, the synagogues moved there as well. By 1945, two-thirds of the city's Jews lived in the northeast, and many of those who did not would later move there. While Zionism was gaining traction in Jewish communities around the world and U.S., it was slower to catch on in Atlanta. This was partially due to Rabbi David Marx's staunch anti-Zionist views and which were influential due to his leadership of The Temple. It was not until the 1920s that support for Zionism began to grow in the community, although there were a few small, frequently inactive Zionist organizations that started years prior. A gathering celebrating the Allies of World War I‚Äôs support for a ‚ÄúJewish national home‚Äù in Palestine at the San Remo conference amassed over 2,000 people in 1920. A Hadassah chapter was established in 1916, and had 300 members by 1937. = Prominent rabbis = Between the turn of the century and the late 1920s the main three synagogues came under steady leadership, and each of their rabbis went on to stay in the position for decades. Rabbi David Marx served The Temple for 51 years (1895‚Äì1946), Rabbi Tobias Geffen served Shearith Israel for 60 years (1910‚Äì1970), and Rabbi Harry Epstein served Ahavath Achim for 54 years (1928‚Äì1982). Over their distinguished tenures, they each had a large impact on the face of the Jewish community and its values. Rabbi Marx was very active in bridge-building with the larger non- Jewish/Christian community in Atlanta, and was largely seen by non-Jews in the city as being the representative of the Jewish community at large. This idea, however, was problematic as Rabbi Marx held very liberal Reform views, and was primarily representative only of the smaller but established and influential German Jewish community. Rabbi Marx also lead the congregation's shift into classical Reform Judaism after years of internal ideological squabbles in the congregation which had eventually resulted in his hiring in 1895. He also was a staunch anti-Zionist, due to his desire for Jews to assimilate in the U.S., and was key in the passage of his congregations' 1897 anti-Zionist resolution and feeling. Under his leadership, the congregation significantly grew in size and moved to a new location in the north of the city. Rabbi Tobias Geffen is credited with getting Coca-Cola kosher certified. Rabbi Tobias Geffen was born in Lithuania, received his ordination there, and started his family there before immigrating to the U.S. He first settled in New York and Ohio prior to accepting his position at Shearith Israel and moving with his family to Atlanta in 1910. Upon his arrival, Rabbi Geffen noted a number of problems and gaps in the Orthodox community and sought to remedy them, including the lack of religious schools, the state of the community's mikveh, and the level of kashrut. Within a few years, he became known as a key resource for many of the Orthodox communities throughout the South that lacked a rabbi of their own, and often travelled to solve problems. Rabbi Geffen is best known for first certifying Coca-Cola as kosher, and kosher for Passover. As the prominent Orthodox rabbi in the region, he began receiving letters from across the country asking whether or not Coca-Cola, famously based in Atlanta, was kosher. The soda was seen as a symbol of American identity and, thus, belonging, by the younger generation who were especially eager to partake. Rabbi Geffen sought permission to view Coca-Cola's closely guarded secret formula in order to assess whether it could be deemed kosher, and was eventually granted it after being sworn to secrecy. In his halachic responsa, using initials and code words to refer to ingredients, he outlined two problem ingredients, one which kept the soda from being kosher altogether and another which precluded it from being kosher for Passover. After his responsa, the company started research to solve the issues, and did so successfully. In 1935, Rabbi Geffen issued a new responsa deeming Coca-Cola kosher, and also kosher for Passover as they had agreed to switch to using beet and cane sugar in the weeks before the holiday. Rabbi Harry Epstein, too, was born in Lithuania and immigrated to the U.S. at the beginning of the 20th century. He was ordained by some of the most prominent rabbis of the time, and his father was an influential and long-serving Orthodox rabbi in Chicago. Despite this, he would lead his congregation, Ahavath Achim, to transition from Orthodox to Conservative. When he took over leading the synagogue, it was in a time when its membership and community had a growing fracture between its older, founding, Yiddish-speaking immigrants and the less traditional English- speaking next generation. Rabbi Epstein gave sermons and taught classes in both English and Yiddish, and helped revitalize the community in his first years. Gradually, changes were implemented in the synagogue, such as the women's section, which went from being in the balcony to part of the sanctuary floor, and eventually was eliminated in favor of mixed gender seating. The opportunities for women's overall participation increased also. Bat mitzvah celebrations for girls took place for the first time, although they were still prohibited from reading from the Torah, and women joined the synagogue choir. Rabbi Epstein's move towards the Conservative movement was influenced by what he perceived as a rightward shift in the U.S. Orthodox community after World War II, that he felt shut the door on progress in the Orthodox world. The congregation official became Conservative in 1954, and its slow slide into the Conservative movement had also lead to the founding of Congregation Beth Jacob in 1943. = 1958 bombing of The Temple = The Hebrew Benevolent Congregation, known as The Temple Under the 51-year tenure of Rabbi David Marx, the members of The Temple were used to the idea that if it wanted acceptance, it could not afford to rock the boat in non-Jewish/Christian Atlanta society or cause conflict. The congregation's next rabbi, Jacob Rothschild, however, took a different attitude and felt that advocating against segregation and discrimination were moral imperitaves, controversial or not. Many believe that Rabbi Rothschild's outspoken support for the Civil Rights Movement and integration lead to the targeting of The Temple. In the first hours of October 12, 1958, The Temple was bombed using 50 sticks of dynamite, causing significant damage but no injuries. Not long after the explosion, United Press International (UPI) staff received a call from ‚ÄúGeneral Gordon of the Confederate Underground‚Äù, a white supremacist group saying they carried out the bombing, that it would be the last empty building they bomb, and Jews and African Americans were aliens in the U.S. The damage to the synagogue was estimated at $100,000, or roughly $868,000 today adjusted for inflation. Donations to help the synagogue recover poured in from every corner of Atlanta and from across the country, although the synagogue had not requested funds. The editor of the Atlanta Constitution newspaper, Ralph McGill, wrote a powerful editorial in the paper denouncing the bombing and any tolerance for hatred in the city, for which he won a Pulitzer Prize. The government was also quick to respond. Atlanta's mayor, William B. Hartsfield, visited the site of the bombing and condemned it in no uncertain terms. President Dwight D. Eisenhower also decried the attack, and promised the FBI‚Äôs support in the investigation. Several dozen policemen, as well as Georgia Bureau of Investigation and FBI agents, worked to solve the case. While five people were arrested, and one tried, no one was ever convicted of the crime. Ironically, in some respects the bombing revealed to the community the privilege that they had. The sweeping outpouring of support and sympathy from the broader Atlanta society, and the swift action taken by officials, showed that they could feel secure now, decades after what happened to Leo Frank. This also made some in the community newly emboldened to speak up against segregation and for civil rights, with the feeling that they could afford to. Synagogue members also more heartily supported Rabbi Rothschild‚Äôs actions and sermons on civil rights issues afterwards, and the first sermon he gave following the bombing was called ‚ÄúAnd None Shall Make Them Afraid‚Äù. At the same time, for many in the African American community, the public and official reactions to the bombing were deeply frustrating, as such terror was inflicted on them more frequently and without support or effective investigations. Responding to Ralph McGill's piece about the bombing, the daughter of slain Florida NAACP director Henry T. Moore lamented the lack of similar outcry or care on the part of the government at the state or federal levels in investigating the crime. = 1950s ‚Äì end of the 20th century = Just after World War II, an estimated 10,217 Jews were living in Atlanta, and only 6% of Jewish adults were not involved in any Jewish organizations. In the 1950s, Atlanta further solidified its status as the Jewish center of the South with the opening of branches of a number Jewish groups, including the Anti- Defamation League and the American Jewish Committee. Congressman Elliott Levitas, who served Georgia's 4th district for 10 years In the decades following The Temple bombing, the Jewish community also became active in politics again. In 1961, Sam Massell was elected Vice Mayor of the city, and then re-elected in 1965. In 1969, he was elected the first Jewish mayor the city, after winning the vast majority of the African American vote and losing the vast majority of the white vote. A part of his campaign pitch to the African American community was that his experience being Jewish, while not equivalent to the black experience, gave him a better understanding than other white people of the challenges community was facing. He was defeated by Maynard Jackson during his 1973 re-election bid, who became Atlanta's first black mayor, and Massell is the last white mayor of Atlanta to date. During and in a short period following the Six-Day War, the 16,000 person Atlanta Jewish community managed to raise $1.5 million, which today would be over $11 million adjusted for inflation, for the United Jewish Appeal's Israel Emergency Fund. In 1980, the Jewish population was estimated at 27,500. The community also continued its move northward and to the suburbs, and by 1984, 70% of the area's Jews were living outside of the Atlanta city limits. From 1975 to 1985, Elliott H. Levitas represented Georgia's 4th congressional district. When Jimmy Carter, who had been Governor of Georgia, was elected President in 1976 several Atlanta Jews such as Stuart E. Eizenstat and Robert Lipshutz moved to Washington with him to work in the administration. When Atlanta hosted the 1996 Summer Olympics, the Jewish community took action to encourage formal recognition and remembrance of the 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team murdered by a Palestinian terrorist group during the 1972 Summer Olympics, known as the Munich massacre. When it became clear the International Olympic Committee (IOC) was not going to have any commemoration or give a mention, the Atlanta Jewish community, largely through the Jewish Federation of Greater Atlanta, organized their own ceremony with the families of the Israelis who were killed.  Modern community  A special exhibit at the Breman Jewish Museum The Atlanta Jewish community has seen dramatic population boom and demographic change in the last few decades, while Atlanta's overall population has also reached new heights as one of the fastest growing cities in the U.S. The Jewish community in the metropolitan area went from less than 30,000 in 1980 to 86,000 in 2000 and then 120,000 in 2006 when the last Jewish population survey was undertaken. If Jewish population growth mirrored the general population growth, the Jewish population would have been 130,000 in 2016. Whereas much of the Atlanta Jewish community has historically been deeply rooted families that prided in their Atlanta and Southern ties, the vast majority of the community today is made up of transplants, and almost a third of the community was born in New York. According to the 2006 population survey, Jews who have moved to the area in the last 10 years also outnumber those born in the area, particularly in the northern suburbs. The number of community institutions and organizations has also increased to keep up with the needs of the community. Today there are 38 synagogues in the area ‚Äì 33 founded after 1968, of which 24 were started between 1984 and 2006. The Orthodox portion of the community is also rapidly growing, and over half of these new congregations are Orthodox or traditional. This has been coupled with an increasing number of kosher restaurants and supermarket sections and the establishment of eruvim in several northern suburbs. Additionally, five congregations have their own mikveh and there are a number of Jewish day schools across the ideological spectrum. Despite this, the community is one of less religiously affiliated in the U.S., as the vast majority of Jewish families do not belong to a synagogue. While Ashkenazi Jews make up the majority of the community, as is common in most of the country, Atlanta is also home to one of the U.S.'s largest Sephardi populations. William Breman Jewish Heritage & Holocaust Museum, opened in 1985, has a large archive of and exhibits Atlanta's Jewish history, as well as educating about the Holocaust. There are also Holocaust memorials in Greenwood Cemetery and at the Marcus JCC's Zaban Park. The Marcus JCC is named in honor of Bernie Marcus, who along with Arthur Blank founded Home Depot, and both of whom are major donors in the Jewish community in Atlanta and beyond. The Atlanta Jewish Times, formerly the Southern Israelite, provides Jewish news for the city and the Southeast.

Located within the Pulau Tikus suburb, the neighbourhood lies west of the city centre. It is bounded by College Avenue to the west and Leandro's Lane to the east. The neighbourhood was formerly inhabited by ethnic Eurasians, who had moved into the area as early as the 19th century. However, most of the original Eurasian residents had since relocated to other areas in George Town, following the redevelopment of Kampong Serani into a modern neighbourhood in the late 1990s. Despite the urbanisation, the neighbourhood still retains some of its Eurasian characteristics and is home to the Penang Eurasian Association.  Etymology  Kampong Serani in Malay is a direct translation of the settlement's English name, Eurasian Village.  History  The first Eurasian settlers, who were fleeing religious persecution in Siam, had arrived at Pulau Tikus in 1811 and chose to build their settlement, named Kampong Serani, within the area. As the Eurasians were predominantly Catholic, the settlement was centred around the Church of the Immaculate Conception. Adjacent to the church was College General, a Catholic seminary which had been relocated to the settlement in 1808. Towards the end of the 20th century, Kampong Serani was earmarked for redevelopment, drawing objections and protests by the Eurasian community. Eventually the settlement was completely bulldozed by 1994; commercial complexes and condominiums now stand at the site of the former Eurasian settlement. However, the street names within the neighbourhood, such as Leandro's Lane and College Lane, still bear Eurasian and Catholic influences, while the Penang Eurasian Association remains based at the area.  Transportation  Kampong Serani is served by Rapid Penang's bus routes 101, 102, 104 and 304, as well as the free-of-charge Pulau Tikus Loop (PTL) and the Congestion Alleviation Transport (CAT) Tanjung Tokong route.http://www.rapidpg.com.my/journey-planner/route- maps/details/101.gifhttp://www.rapidpg.com.my/journey-planner/route- maps/details/102.gifhttp://www.rapidpg.com.my/journey-planner/route- maps/details/104.gifhttp://www.rapidpg.com.my/journey-planner/route- maps/details/304.gif These routes link Kampong Serani with George Town proper, as well as other destinations on Penang Island, including the Penang International Airport, Queensbay Mall, Batu Ferringhi and Teluk Bahang.  Education  Kampong Serani is home to Convent Pulau Tikus and its primary branch, SRK Convent Pulau Tikus. The all-girls' school was established in 1922, before being relocated to its present-day grounds in 1950.

It was the first bill of rights enacted in the Commonwealth of Nations since the original Bill of Rights enacted by the English Parliament in 1689.Bill of Rights, 1 William & Mary Sess. 2 (1689), c. 2. It was also the forerunner of modern human rights legislation in Canada. The Bill of Rights continues to be in force, through incorporation into The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code, the current provincial statute protecting human rights.  Provisions of the Saskatchewan Bill of Rights  = Fundamental rights and freedoms = The first part of the Saskatchewan Bill of Rights set out fundamental rights and freedoms: * right to freedom of conscience and religion (s. 3); * right to free expression (s. 4); * right to peaceable assembly and association (s. 5); * right to freedom from arbitrary imprisonment and right to immediate judicial determination of a detention (s. 6); * right to vote in provincial elections (s. 7). = Prohibitions on discrimination = The Bill of Rights also prohibited various types of discrimination, on the grounds of race, creed, religion, colour, or ethnic or national origin: * right to employment without discrimination (s. 8); * right to engage in occupations without discrimination (s. 9); * right to own and occupy property without discrimination (s. 10); * right of access to public places and facilities without discrimination (s. 11); * right to membership in professional and trade associations without discrimination (s. 12); * right to education without discrimination (s. 13). = Enforcement provisions = The Bill of Rights also contained enforcement provisions: * advertisements indicating an intention to discriminate (e.g. a job advertisement which stated that members of a particular race or religion could not apply for a position) were prohibited (s. 14); * refusal to comply with the rights and freedoms under the Bill (e.g. denying service to a person because of the person's race) was an offence, carrying a fine of between $25 and $50 for a first offence, and a fine of between $50 and $200 for subsequent offences, with the possibility of imprisonment for default in paying the fine (s. 15); * injunctions could be obtained from the Court of King's Bench against anyone who attempted to deprive a person of rights under the Bill (s. 16); * the provincial government was bound by the Bill, which could be enforced directly against the government in court (s. 17). The Bill also stated that except as provided in the Bill itself, the enumeration of rights and freedoms in the Bill did not derogate from any rights, freedoms or liberties which anyone enjoyed by law (s. 18). The Bill came into force on May 1, 1947 (s. 19).  Incorporation into The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code  In 1979, Saskatchewan enacted The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code, which amalgamated several different statutes into one code, and provided a uniform enforcement process, through the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission. The portion of the Saskatchewan Bill of Rights dealing with fundamental rights and freedoms was incorporated as the first part of the Code and continues in force.The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code, Statutes of Saskatchewan 1979, c. S-24.1, Part I: Bill of Rights. The provisions barring discrimination were incorporated into the Code as well.The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code, Part II: Prohibition of Certain Discriminatory Practices.

The organization has also been known as the Houston Settlement Association, Neighborhood Centers, and Neighborhood Centers, Inc. In 1940, the Houston Settlement Association brought the Ripley Foundation into its organization. In 2018, BakerRipley has seventy locations in the Houston region.  The Ladies' Association  BakerRipley was founded in February 1907 by Alice Graham Baker. Baker worked through the Ladies' Club of the First Presbyterian Church of Houston, with allies such as Lavinia Lovett and Katherine Parker. This initial civic engagement led to awareness about Houston's working poor. She studied the settlement movement of England, and its best-known American practitioner, Jane Addams of the Hull House in Chicago. As early as 1902, the Ladies' Association established settlement facilities, in some cases, taking over vacant space in store fronts and abandoned churches. These services included subsidized kindergartens, training for teachers of primary education, and practical classes, such as sewing and vocational training. Houston Settlement Association =Rusk Settlement House= One important advocate was Sybil Campbell, a teacher at the Rusk School. Her school was located in Houston's Second Ward, in an industrial area which attracted many immigrants. These immigrants originated from Germany, Ireland, and Russia. Many workers in the neighborhood had no means of providing daytime care for their children. Campbell brought this to the attention of Baker, who convened organizational meetings at her home in early 1907. Her husband, Houston lawyer Captain James A. Baker, assisted her in drafting a constitution for the Houston Settlement Association. Their initial fifteen-member board of directors included Roxalee Smith Andrews, Marian Holt, and Estelle Sharp. They elected Alice Baker as their first president, and Mrs. H. R. Akin as their first vice-president. The first act of the Houston Settlement Association was taking over the Rusk Elementary kindergarten from the Woman's Club. They provided child care, education, and medical services for the working poor in the area. In the 1910s, a new client base emerged from an influx of immigrants fleeing political instability and violence during the Mexican Revolution. Drawn to Houston for its job opportunities in the oil industry and at the expanded Port of Houston, many of these new immigrants resided in the Second Ward during the 1920s. Rusk Settlement House taught U.S. citizenship in Spanish as well as English literacy to these new Houstonians. =Ripley House= The Ripley House was named for Daniel and Edith Ripley. After Daniel's death, Edith established the Ripley Foundation, with the mission of helping women and children in Houston. She accepted the legal assistance of Captain James A. Baker, who co- founded the Ripley Foundation as a non-profit corporation with William D. Cleveland and Samuel Maurice McAshan in 1935. Ripley coordinated with Corrine Tsanoff to share resources with the Houston Settlement Association.Kirkland (2012), pp. 335336. The Ripley Foundation opened a new facility in an Anglo- enclave of Houston's east end in March 1840. Maurice Sullivan, the design architect for the new building, examined settlement houses in the eastern United States before presenting a plan to the foundation. The Houston Settlement Association moved its administrative offices into Ripley House, while still maintaining the nearby Rusk Settlement House. BakerRipley In 2017, the organization changed its name to BakerRipley. This recognizes its founder, Alice Graham Baker, and another one of its leaders from the 20th century, Edith Ripley. In the same year, BakerRipley's seventy centers served a client-base of 500,000, led by its CEO and president, Angela Blanchard. As of 2018, Claudia Aguirre is the president and Angela Blanchard is the president emerita. In 2019 BakerRipley claimed a client-base of 600,000 served through its sixty centers. The organization announced two summer education programs for Houston-area youths. The Little Leaders program facilitates children aged four through thirteen; the Young Leaders program facilitates teenagers through age eighteen. Both programs are hosted at four different Houston campuses.

History  In 1951, Houston hosted its first National Folk Festival. Though the festival itself was not majorly successful, it connected a group of folk music lovers in Houston. Soon after, the Houston Folklore Society (later known as the Houston Folklore and Music Society) was founded by John Alan Lomax Jr., Ed Badeaux, Harold V. Belikoff, Howie Porper, Pete Rose, and Chester Bower. The HFMS was created with the intent to preserve and celebrate folklore and folk music from around the country. The HFMS has held monthly meetings at the Jewish Community Center, the Downtown YMCA, and the Hermann Park Pavilion.Houston Folklore and Music Society records, 1951-2016, MS 668, Woodson Research Center, Fondren Library, Rice University http://archives.library.rice.edu/repositories/2/resources/1075 Accessed July 18, 2018. Each member present gets the chance to perform, be it telling a story or singing a song. Though the meetings were generally centred around the guitar, members brought banjos, fiddles, dulcimers, tin whistles, spoons, and bones to make music. Occasionally, members held concerts at the Jewish Community Center and the University of Houston‚Äôs Cullen Auditorium and Anderson Library. They also formed a Hootenanny group, which performed at the Alley Theatre. The HFMS has invited and sponsored performances by artists including Pete Seeger, Doc Watson, and the Foggy Mountain Boys. By June 1966, the HFMS had begun publishing a monthly newsletter. By 1968, it was named the Cotton Patch Rag. The Cotton Patch Rag included a monthly calendar of Houston- based folk music events, reviews, and articles contributed by different members. The Rag is still produced and distributed to members of the HFMS today. In 1980, the HFMS began hosting regular concerts. By 1983, the Second Saturday Concerts had become a tradition that continues today, showcasing a wealth of acoustic music for members and the general public.  Membership  The HFMS has been an incubator of musical talent in Houston, especially in the 1950s and 1960s. The regular meetings allowed singers and songwriters to share what they were working on and hone their craft. The meetings also facilitated introductions and the making of lifelong friendships at these meetings. The Tex-i-an Boys was a group that formed from introductions made at HFMS meetings. The group was composed of John Lomax Jr., Ed Badeaux, Jim McConnell, Howard Porper, and Jim Rose. They released an album called Songs of Texas in 1961.

The battle started in 1990 when the FIM gave the IRTA and Bernie Ecclestone more governing power (such as appointing new grand prix races) and came to a head in 1992 when the FIA cancelled the contract that would have allowed the IRTA and ROPA, the circuit owners, the right to market the television rights and instead giving those rights to Dorna Sports. Introduction The conflict started when in 1986, after various problems with the then existing Grand Prix Riders Association (GPRA), the International Road-Racing Teams Association (IRTA) was founded by Mike Trimby, morphing from a riders' trade union to a body representing the various teams. The IRTA was founded to resolve various track safety problems (such as a factory team strike at the 1982 French motorcycle Grand Prix in Nogaro due to dangerous track conditions), as well as financial problems that plagued the sport during the 1980s. This however, was a start of a period of huge change for Grand Prix motorcycle racing, as this would kick off a power struggle between the FIM, the IRTA, Bernie Ecclestone and various other companies. Aftermath After the conflicts were largely concluded in 1992, an alliance was formed between the FIM, the IRTA, the Motorcycle Sports Manufacturers' Association (MSMA) and Dorna Sport which stands until this day. After Dorna had acquired the broadcast rights for all the motorcycle racing classes, the quality significantly improved. Before the takeover, the quality of the footage was significantly worse. Bernie Ecclestone collaborated with Dorna in the 1992 season and managed to acquire the commercial rights of the sports, but eventually sold them off quietly to Dorna Sports for 50 million Pounds in 1993. During the 1992 season, Bernie would create strangulation contracts and propose those to the organisers of the grands prix venues, which forced them to double the ticket prices. A few years ago, Bernie did the same thing with the 1990 Belgian motorcycle Grand Prix with the result that ticket sales plummeted and that eventually signed the beginning of the end for the Belgian round, as it was scrapped from the 1991 calendar onwards. Ecclestone would however, still remain active in the promotion of the German motorcycle Grand Prix at the Hockenheimring. He invested a lot of money in the promotion of the venue, but the \\"high-class fans\\" he wanted to visit the race never came and due to his strangulation contract he had with the venue, he did not make profits until the end of the 5-year contract. Ecclestone continues to have good relations with Carmelo Ezpeleta and the rest of the Dorna Sports team.

By 1902, for civil purposes Coopersale, grouped with Coopersale Street, was part of Epping, but the ecclesiastical parish for rectorial purposes was still part of Theydon Garnon.

Following 1891 the northwestern parts of Theydon Garnon parish including Coopersale, Coopersale Street and Fiddlers Hamlet were alienated to become part of Epping Urban District (from 1974 Epping Forest District). Coopersale was part of the Epping Union--poor relief provision set up under the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834--which by 1912 provided for forty children a cottage home called Forest Side at Coopersale. Essex County Council ran the home after 1930 until it closed in 1960. The home, on Coopersale Common Road and north from St Alban's Church, was demolished and replaced by modern residences.\\"Epping Cottage Homes\\", The Workhouse: The Story of an Institution. Retrieved 18 July 2018 Between 1871 and 1911 Coopersale's population, as part of Theydon Garnon and later Epping, ranged between 638 and 672, although that in the ecclesiastical parish, always larger, was 760 in 1911. By 1921, the population had risen to 756. The area of the Coopersale district over these years approximated 600 acres, in which the chief crops grown were wheat, barley and beans.Kelly's Directory of Essex 1933, pp.187, 188 Trades listed in 1894 included a hay dealer, a blacksmith, three builders, a brickmaker, a painter, a shopkeeper, two farmers, and two beer retailers one of whom was a butcher. By 1902, two farmers, a 'brickmaster', a painter, a blacksmith remained, as did two beer retailers, but one at Coopersale Street which seemed to be listed with Coopersale. Added occupations were a gardener, a wheelwright, a carpenter, a grocer & hardware dealer, a shopkeeper, a company of builders, and the surveyor to Epping Urban District Council. Further occupations in 1914 were an insurance agent, and at Coopersale Street a woman who undertook hand laundry. By 1933 occupations included a painter, an unmarried woman as beer retailer, two unmarried sisters running a shop, a married woman as beer retailer at Coopersale Street, a limited company building firm, and a farmer at Home Farm. Ansons farm is mentioned as occupied; this was the house where Samuel Phelps, English actor and theatre manager, died in 1878.The Cambridge Guide to Theatre, Cambridge University Press, 1988 =St Alban's Church= By the end of the 19th century Coopersale was seen as the identifiable northern district of Theydon Garnon parish, and itself had become a separate ecclesiastical parish in 1852 as part of the rural deanery of Chigwell, in the same year that St Alban's Church was built in Early English style. The church with its rectory was financed by Miss Harriet Archer-Houblon of Coopersale House as was the 1882 adjacent parish room. Miss Archer-Houblon's advowson provided for the church incumbency, which came with of glebe land. This patronage lay with the Archer-Houblon family until 1914, when it was transferred to the Bishop of Chelmsford.Trade diectories: Post Office Directory of Essex, Herts, Kent, Middlesex, Surrey and Sussex (1855) p.149 / Post Office Directory of Essex (1874) p.225 / Kelly's Directory of Essex (1882) p.295; (1894) pp. 340, 341; (1902) p.153 / Kellys Directory of Essex, Hertfordshire and Middlesex (1914) p.192Garnon: Church', in A History of the County of Essex, Volume 4, Ongar Hundred, ed.

A new lychgate was added to the churchyard in 1907, and an oak reredos to the chancel in 1913. The incumbency in 1874 was a vicarage, of a net value of ¬£180 with 5 acres of glebe, in the gift of Miss Archer-Houblon. The area of glebe remained the same until at least 1914.

The grounds were laid out for William Eyre Archer in the 1730s to the design of Adam Holt, the gardener of Wanstead Park, accommodated by the diversion of the public road of Houblons Hill away from the house. Later in the century Capability Brown provided design plans for the grounds which weren't carried out. The estate had been held by the Archer (later Archer-Houblon) family since the time of Henry V who changed the name of his Agincourt attendant Simon Dubois to Archer after Dubois performed well in an archery contest at Havering-atte-Bower. In 1914 Coopersale House was listed as unoccupied.

Then, in the last days of 1931, two expedition members returned as well ‚Äì those being Professors Wheeler (the leader) and Allen, leaving their four counterparts in Sydney. Following the shrinkage of the team, William Schevill reports that Dr. Darlington began, and spent most of his time, collecting various insect, mammal, and bird specimens in the area around Sydney as well as in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales; indeed, \\"he was particularly among the mammals of this region.\\" This was the beginning of the team working on a more individual basis rather than as a group, for Schevill set out on his own to collect three times and, in February, Ralph Ellis departed from Australia; swiftly followed by medical officer Dr. Ira Dixon as, per Schevill's report, - \\"his continued services...[were] no longer practicable, since Dr. Darlington and I planned to collect in rather widely separated regions. Thus only two of the original six expedition members remained. From this point forward Schevill and Darlington met only when their work required it, the former working more closely with the then Director of the Queensland Museum (Heber A. Longman) and, through him, with Australia's Under Secretary of the Department of Agriculture and Stock (R. Wilson). The two worked together twice more, in the McPherson Range and Cairns where Darlington procured a series of tree kangaroo and Schevill worked along Lake Barrine. Indeed, noting Darlington's activities in greater detail than his own, Mr. Schevill reports that \\"Dr. Darlington's resourceful skill and industry had brought together, from New South Wales and Queensland, not only a large collection of insects, but also over three hundred fifty mammals, representing over sixty species, as well about fifty species of birds; in addition, he had about two hundred fifty reptiles and amphibians.\\" However, Philip Darlington departed Australia on August 2, 1932 - leaving and making William E. Schevill the last remaining member of the original six-men expedition. And it was Schevill, the team's fossil enthusiast, who was about to make the discovery that made the Harvard Australian Expedition famous.

Godfrey Cabot thus asked how much a restoration would cost and \\"Romer, pulling a figure out of the musty air, replied, 'Oh, about $10,000.'\\" Romer may not have been serious but the philanthropist clearly was because the check for said sum came shortly thereafter. Two years - and more than $10,000 - later, following the careful labor of the museum preparators, the restored and mounted skeleton was displayed at Harvard in 1959.

Size controversy Body-length estimates, largely based on the 1959 Harvard reconstruction, had previously put the total length of Kronosaurus at . However, more recent studies, comparing fossil specimens of Kronosaurus to other pliosaurs suggests that the Harvard reconstruction may have included too many vertebrae, exaggerating the previous estimate, with the true length probably only .McHenry, Colin R. \\"Devourer of Gods: The Palaeoecology of the Cretaceous Pliosaur Kronosaurus Queenslandicus.\\" The University of Newcastle Australia, Apr. 2009.

Dedicated to St. Eulalia of Barcelona, it is located nearby the historical quarter of Vucciria. History The church was built in the 15th century, during the Aragonese rule of Sicily, with the financial support of Catalan merchants that were working in the city. Initially it was dedicated to Virgin Mary, and only later the naming was switched to the current saint, also of Catalan origin. The church was thoroughly rebuilt starting from 1630. The works were completed only in the 19th century. In 1823 an earthquake damaged the bell tower, which was subsequently demolished. Description The church has a typical Plateresque exterior, featuring rich decorations. It has three orders with columns, and a central arch with the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Spain and, below, a rhombus with the ensign of the County of Barcelona; these are flanked by four columns symbolizing the Pillars of Hercules. Finally, the upper order has four garlands with busts of Kings of Spain. The interior is on the Greek Cross plan, with some traces of 17th century frescoes.

He spent most of his career at the court of the Shirvanshahs, but received patronage from other rulers as well.  Early life  Badr was born in Shamakhi in Shirvan (present-day Azerbaijan) to a certain Hajji Shams al- Din, an \\"apparently wealthy\\" figure. Badr's father paid little attention to him after his mother died. Little is known about his education; according to his own writings, Badr \\"was precocious and began writing poetry at the age of ten or eleven\\". Most information about Badr's life stems from his own works.  Work  The majority of Badr's divan consists of \\"panegyric odes\\" (qasidas). Most of these \\"odes\\" are dedicated to the ruling Shirvanshah dynasty and the court, in particular Ibrahim I (1378‚Äì1418) and Khalil I (1418‚Äì1463). Badr however, did not devote himself exclusively to writing about the Shirvanshahs and the elite of Shirvan. He also received patronage from the Paduspanid ruler Kayumarth I (ca. 1400‚Äì1453), the Kara Koyunlu ruler Jahan Shah (1434‚Äì1467), and the Timurid ruler Shah Rukh (1409‚Äì1447), and thus wrote poems for all three as well. Though Badr may have travelled in order to present these poems to Kayumarth, Jahan Shah and Shah Rukh in person, he continued to live most of his life in Shirvan. According to DawlatshƒÅh Samarqandƒ´, Badr met Katibi Nishapuri \\"when the latter visited Shirvan\\". Throughout his work, Badr compared himself on more than one occasion to Khaqani, who worked at the Shirvanshah court some two centuries earlier, and like him, wrote many works filled with panegyric text. The works of Khaqani and Badr Shirvani differ quite significantly however. Khaqani's poetry is characterized by \\"learned complexity and allusiveness\\", whereas that of Badr primarily contains \\"direct and flowing diction\\". Other than his panegyric odes, his divan consists of many other poetic forms which were significant at the time, in particular \\"occasional, monthematic qit'a and the lyric ghazal\\". Badr wrote verses and poems in Arabic, Azeri Turkish and various Caspian Sea dialects of Persian. According to Paul E. Losensky, this reflects \\"the multilingual environment\\" in which Badr lived. In 1985, Badr's works were \\"recovered, edited and published\\". According to Losensky, this was made possible thanks to a \\"unique manuscript\\" which had \\"apparently\\" been prepared shortly after Badr's death.  Death  Badr died in 1450, probably in his native Shamakhi. The location of his grave remains unknown.

Several art historians have linked the work to Lambert Sustris's Venus and Cupid. In 1897 the painting was given by Couturier de Royas to the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon, where it still hangs. He had suffered a sentimental or sensual crisis between 1825 and 1827 which led him to paint many more or less erotic works - according to his private journal from the time, completing the paintings was thus intertwined with the sexual satisfaction before the young model went away. The model for this work may be Mademoiselle Laure, who also appears in the same artist's The Death of Sardanapalus and Greece Among the Ruins of Missolonghi, both dating to the same time. Another possibility is Rose, another of his models.

He composed them, setting poems by Clemens Brentano, in 1918 for soprano and piano, and orchestrated one in 1933 and five in 1940. The piano version was first published by Adolph F√ºrstner in Berlin in 1919. They are also known as Brentano Lieder.  History  Elisabeth Schumann and the composer Strauss, who had been a prolific writer of songs for voice and piano as a young man, composed no songs from 1906 to 1918, focusing on opera. Following the completion of his opera Die Frau ohne Schatten, he returned to the genre and set six poems by the Romantic poet Clemens Brentano as Sechs Lieder. Clemens Brentano, together with his friend and brother-in-law Achim von Arnim, is known for the folk poem collection Des Knaben Wunderhorn. Strauss set three poems from the collection, but for Sechs Lieder turned to Brentano's own lyric. Their imagery inspired him to virtuoso vocal composition and intricate piano writing. Strauss had the voice of Elisabeth Schumann in mind when he composed the songs, and dedicated the collection to her. While the central songs suit Schumann's light coloratura voice, the outer works require more dramatic expression. The Brentano Lieder became Strauss' most significant song collection before his Four Last Songs (1948). They were first published in Berlin in 1919 by Adolph F√ºrstner. The first five songs were first performed at the Berlin Singakademie on 30 May 1919 by and pianist Georg Schumann, as part of the first festival Tonk√ºnstlerfest of the association Allgemeiner Deutscher Musikverein after the World War, while the last one was premiered in Dresden on 29 September. Strauss later set the songs later for voice and orchestra. He first orchestrated No. 6 in 1933, the others in 1940. He dedicated a manuscript of the five songs to Eugen Antosch on 29 July 1949, writing: \\"Dem treuen Freunde und Helfer / Eugen Antosch / von seinem dankbaren / Dr. Richard Strauss. / Garmisch 29. Juli 1949\\" (To the faithful friend and helper E. A. by his grateful R. S.). The score is held by the Juilliard School Library.  Structure  The titles of the songs are: # An die Nacht # Ich wollt ein Str√§u√ülein binden # S√§us'le, liebe Myrte! # Als mir dein Lied erklang # Amor # Lied der Frauen \\"An die Nacht\\", with the incipit \\"Heilige Nacht! Heilige Nacht!\\" (Holy night), is a poem in three stanzas.Heilige Nacht! Heilige Nacht! lieder.net \\"Ich wollt ein Str√§u√ülein binden\\" (I meant to make you a posy) is a poem in seven stanzas of four short lines each.Ich wollt ein Str√§u√ülein binden oxfordlieder.co.uk \\"S√§us'le, liebe Myrte!\\" is a poem in three stanzas, with a longer last stanza.S√§us'le, liebe Myrte! led.cat \\"Als mir dein Lied erklang\\" is based on a poem \\"Dein Lied erklang\\" in two stanzas, with a shorter second stanza ending on the title line.Dein Lied erklang sternenfall.de \\"Amor\\" (Cupid) is based on a poem in three stanzas of six lines each, with the incipit \\"An dem Feuer sa√ü das Kind\\" (By the fire sat the child.An dem Feuer sa√ü das Kind lieder.net \\"Lied der Frauen\\" is based on a poem which Brentano had continued \\"(wenn die M√§nner im Krieg sind)\\" (When the men are at war). It is different in topic and expression from the other five, which can be described as love songs. It was not premiered with them in 1919, possible because it was considered too close to the war, and orchestrated separately. References   Sources  * Blom, Eric (ed.) (1954).

He joined the National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers (NUDAW) in 1926, and in 1931 he also joined the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB). He was highly active in the party and the associated National Unemployed Workers' Movement. With his brother, Alfred, in 1932, he led five hundred unemployed workers invading the Shire Hall chamber. Also with Alfred, he revived Chelmsford Trades Council in 1932, it having been dormant for several years. In 1937, Seabrook began working full-time for NUDAW as an area organiser. Ten years later, NUDAW became part of the new Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (USDAW). Seabrook remained an area organiser, but was relocated to Norwich. He remained active in the CPGB, serving as district chairman and treasurer during the early 1950s. Seabrook was elected to the executive council of USDAW in 1957. When union president Walter Padley was made a government minister in 1964, Seabrook won the election to succeed him, but he then lost the regularly scheduled election the following year, defeated by Rodney Hanes. In 1967, there was a further presidential election, and Seabrook won the position back, on this occasion serving until defeated by Jim D. Hughes in 1973. Seabrook opposed the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956, and resigned from the CPGB, later becoming associated with the Chartist group.

Loss On 29 January 1803 Smith and his crew arrived at Salvador, Bahia. Anna Augusta had been lost a few days earlier somewhat to the south. Smith sent his launches under the command of his mate to see what they could salvage. When they did not return, Smith took four men and a whale-boat on 9 February to go look for them; he found the launches with \\"considerable salvage\\". On their return the government seized the salvage to dispose of it. Whales abounded off the coast and some merchants approached Smith to gather information about establishing whale fishing on the British method of boiling the whale oil on board the vessels.Lindley (1808), pp.141. On 24 March Smith sailed to Lisbon aboard the King's brig, after having overcome many administrative obstacles. Before Smith left, Thomas Lindley purchased Smith's right to the wreck. Lindley then sent his former mate, William Barker, to examine it. The report was not clear so Lindley got permission from the governor at Salvador and found someone to sail him south. On 3 April Lindley found the wreck on a reef called Morrera, off the Ilha de Boipeda;This would appear to be Morer√© (). The brig was so completely wrecked there was no hope of further salvage beyond a few trifles.

Research, prototyping and pilot projects were initiated in the 1990s, but the emergence of the \\"smart grid\\" stimulated electric utilities, scientists and vendors to develop comprehensive and sustainable solutions. Principles and applications The current-carrying capacity, or ampacity, of overhead lines starts with the type of conductor used. The conductor choice determines its electrical resistance and other physical parameters for dynamic line rating (DLR). Electric current passing through the conductor causes heating according to Joule's first law, resulting in the conductor expanding and the line sagging. Transmission ratings are set with a maximum allowable conductor temperature (annealing temperature) and minimum clearance rules to comply with legislation and regulation.David M. Greenwood, Student Member, IEEE, Jake P. Gentle, Member, IEEE, Kurt S. Myers, Peter J. Davison,Isaac J. West, Jason W. Bush, Grant L. Ingram, and Matthias C. M. Troffaes (2014), \\"A Comparison of Real-Time Thermal Rating Systems in the U.S. and the U.K.\\".IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery, Vol 29, No 4, August 2014 Ampacity‚ÄúThe Ampacity of a conductor is that current which will meet the design, security and safety criteria of a particular line on which the conductor is used‚Äù (in CIGR√â TB-498 - Guide for Application of Direct Real-Time Monitoring Systems) has traditionally been limited by conductor thermal capacity defined in terms of stating rating (SR), based on a predetermined set of worst-case weather scenarios (typically a combination of cross-winds, high solar radiation and seasonal high ambient temperatures). =Real-time dynamic line rating= More often than not, there are unused margins between the limits defined by static ratings and the \\"true limits\\" measured by a DLR or real-time thermal rating (RTTR) system. Several methods have been developed since the 1990s, most of which rely upon sensors deployed on overhead lines to measure parameters in real-time. Other systems utilize weather stations that monitor environmental conditions without contacting the line. Data received from any method is reported to a main computer for processing. Control center operators access usable data (line temperature, ratings, forecasts, historical values) in pseudo-real-time through a human-machine interface (HMI). =Wind generation= Wind generation is most feasible in an area that has consistent wind conditions. When prospecting such locations, the grid connection point must also be analyzed. Adding new generation to a grid typically requires an infrastructure buildup that can potentially cost millions of dollars. In some circumstances a phenomenon, known as concurrent cooling, can be utilized to mitigate the expenses. Concurrent cooling is the cooling of transmission lines, thus increasing ampacity, when the wind power is generating. The exact parameters of the system are vital to determine feasibility.Bishnu P. Bhattarai, Jake P. Gentle, Timothy McJunkin, Porter J. Hill, Kurt S. Myers, Alexander W. Abboud, Rodger Renwick, David Hengst, \\"Improvement of Transmission Line Ampacity Utilization by Weather-Based Dynamic Line Rating\\", Power Delivery IEEE Transactions on, vol. 33, no. 4, pp. 1853-1863, 2018. =Dynamic line rating reception= DLR methods and technologies are considered \\"mature\\" by industry groups like European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) after field validations for various applications. Transmission utilities in Asia, Europe, North America, and South America have included deployment of DLR in their grid development roadmaps. Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and International Council on Large Electric Systems (CIGR√â) devised standard thermal modeling of conductors for ampacity calculations. CIGR√â issued guidelines for DLR. Deploying DLR entails equipping circuits likely to benefit from significant capacity gains with sensors and using the resulting capacity increases when required and possible. Typical applications include: *Relaxing congestions due to increasing load *Improving economic dispatch scenarios in N-1 contingencies *Integrating renewable/distributed energy sources without grid reinforcement *Deferring or avoiding uprating of circuits *Maximizing the use of alternate lines when main corridors are undergoing maintenance *Maximizing transit on interconnectors and \\"bottleneck\\" topologies *Addressing potential safety/conformance issues These subjects are addressed at load dispatch center level, and by planning and maintenance departments. However, to decide on priorities, simulations based on 3D line-profile analysis and weather data are sometimes performed prior to deployment. There are two categories of DLR computation methods: *Direct measurement methods use devices that are directly coupled to the line. These devices measure temperature, tension, sag and/or clearance from which the thermal rating is determined. *Indirect measurement methods use weather stations and modeling. Direct methods give actual conductor state condition with respect to clearance rules and/or maximum conductor temperature, while indirect methods provide estimates based on prevailing, forecast, or measured weather conditions around the line. Computational fluid dynamics models can be used to provide a larger effective area to a single weather station by mapping wind patterns around the terrain.Bishnu P. Bhattarai, Jake P. Gentle, Timothy McJunkin, Kurt S. Myers, Alexander W. Abboud, Rodger Renwick, David Hengst (2018). Improvement of Transmission Line Ampacity Utilization by Weather-Based Dynamic Line Rating. IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery. Vol 33, Issue 4, Aug 2018. Pg. 1853-1863 Direct methods are strongly recommended by CIGR√â standards 207 and TB 209 TB 498. Several kinds of ratings are available, depending on input parameters and algorithms. Real-time ratings allow control room engineers to adjust power flows according to normal operational events or contingencies. They are based on \\"steady-state (equilibrium) ampacity\\" calculations. Emergency ratings are based on transient equations and models: they provide permissible overload ratings for a short and adjustable time (typically 5 to 30 minutes). Forecasting methods have been developed to determine intraday and day-ahead ampacity forecasts. They combine DLR historical measurements and weather forecasts. These methods are proprietary and are promoted by industry associations like CIGR√â's Study Committee B2Study Committee B2 and the WATT Coalition. While DLR solutions can be implemented stand-alone, they are more commonly integrated with other systems in the control room of the electric utility SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition). Energy management system or distribution management system vendors may propose this type of integration to enhance their offering. History and perspectives Pioneer companies, now defunct, followed initiatives by the US Department of Energy, electric utilities ONCOR, NYPA, ENTSO-E, and the European Commission's Energy Research programme.Energy Research programme They contributed in setting the standards for more advanced solutions. The most active manufacturers originate in North America and Europe where market stimulation is strongest. Experiments were conducted to field-test available technologies and to quantify benefits, in terms of available transit gains and capital expenditure savings. Operation expenditure gains are more delicate to evaluate since they depend on grid codes, local regulation rules, incentives and penalties. However they can be classified as \\"additional transit revenues\\", \\"improved economic dispatch\\" and \\"avoided penalties\\". As of June 2018 around 20 electric utilities in the Americas and Europe use DLR in daily transmission operations. Benefits recorded have attracted the attention of investors, governments and international development aid institutions, who include a DLR share in the scope of their green-field powerline construction projects. Dynamic (electrical overhead-)line rating is a great opportunity for transmission line operators (any voltage from 15 kV to 735 kV and over). It has been studied for more than 20 years inside CIGRE and IEEE working groups. But technology (sensors, weather forecast), as well as national or supra national rules, did not allow generation of a financial return for the owners of the line, which is nowadays (2018) possible in many countries. Moreover, the electricity generation mix is strongly changing in many countries due to the large deployment of wind and solar farms. The power flows are therefore changing a lot because of renewables and intercountry exchanges, where potential larger transit (owing to DLR) allows lower market electricity cost. There are large opportunities owing to technology miniaturization (accelerometers, digital signal processing for embedded data treatment, telecommunications, etc.) and new developments in weather forecasts (which are nowadays much more accurate and require less computational power than only a few years ago), including for these last, up to 72 hours ahead. Availability of this equipment and data for a reasonable cost helps to develop new sensors and systems which may be implemented into the EMS (energy management system) of national or local dispatching. These dynamic line rating sensors may sometimes warranty up to 30% more power transit in the monitored lines, depending on wind speed which is actually and locally evaluated by appropriate sensors using intelligent data processing. Capacity forecasting seems to be the new promise of DLR, mixing on-line sensors with reliable weather data forecast, up to two days ahead. In this field, significant social welfare benefits are expected inasmuch as capacity forecasts favour converging zonal prices and a decrease in congestion rents. Computation methods and applicable standards Direct measurement methods use field data measured to inform on line condition (conductor temperature, sagging, clearances) and on weather parameters (ambient temperature, solar radiation, wind velocity). Spans deemed \\"critical\\" ‚Äì likely to reach thermal or clearance limits first ‚Äì are monitored in real- time, providing data on their status with respect to safety limits. The state change equation of the conductor, using its thermal features (absorptivity, emissivity) converts data on span geometry into valid temperature data for the \\"ruling span\\" of the monitored section. If weather conditions are more favorable than those used for the calculation of static limits, a margin probably exists. To be able to provide reliable and safe values, real-time parameters (load current, conductor temperature, weather parameters) are fed into the conductor's thermal model as per IEEE and CIGR√â guidelines. Measurements, software and specialized algorithms are housed in a dedicated computer system, forming a \\"DLR server\\", with communication facilities. After processing and formatting, \\"ratings\\" are made available to human operators via a user interface (computer displays and data files). Several kinds of ratings may be made available, including: real-time, indicating ampacity immediately available, without time limits should conditions remain identical; emergency ratings for a limited duration; and same-day and day-ahead forecasts. DLR computations deal with \\"near real-time\\" data, updated about every five minutes. Shorter time cycles would require uneconomical computing power and offer little added value due to the thermal inertia of power transit phenomena. In current applications, DLR involves human-made decisions in control rooms, without automation. Weather parameters affect line ratings in decreasing order, as follows: *wind is the most important factor *ambient temperature *solar radiation *rain is generally not taken into account, as its physical load on the line is compensated by its cooling effect Standards published by IEEE and CIGR√â cover the following subjects, necessary to perform DLR: *on conductors and thermal ratings: thermal behavior of overhead conductors (TB207), rating of overhead conductors (TB299, TB601), thermal modelling of overhead conductors (IEEE738) *on dynamic line-rating specifically (TB498) Integration into control room processes DLR translates into benefits when dispatch engineers apply optimized ratings to transit operations from their national or regional control center. Stand-alone DLR solutions provide real-time data for day-to-day operations and historical data for statistical analysis. The ultimate destination of a DLR solution is integration into control room tools and systems. Typically, the DLR server can be configured to send standard telecontrol frames to the electric utility's SCADA front-end acquisition units. These frames can then be processed for display and calculations by the utility energy management system or distribution management system. Short-term network operation decisions are based on optimized rating information, as well as load-flow calculations and economic dispatch scenarios. The latter also benefit from short-term forecasts in contingency analysis. Communications, IT and cybersecurity considerations Input data (weather parameters, circuit load, infrastructure design, field measurements) are public domain, proprietary if not confidential, and must be managed accordingly. Output data (line condition, ratings and forecasts) are proprietary and confidential. To ensure provisions of data confidentiality, integrity and availability, the utility and the vendor implement secured communications with cyphering, access control and restrictions. Industry trends favor deployments in SaaS (software as a service) mode. Sensitive areas are: *communications between field devices and data concentrator (most likely an IT setup comprising a data server) *protection of the data and software (firewalls and anti-virus against unwanted access and malware) *uptime commitments through redundancy strategies.

Life Mark Gjini held the title of Stradiot captain serving the Republic of Venice. His service to Venetians includes his contribution in the Uskok War with six boats with 300 Albanians. Gjini was a distinguished figure of the Albanian struggle against the Ottoman Empire at the end of the end of 16th century and the beginning of the 17th century. He participated at the Convention of Mat which was held on November 7, 1594 by Albanian leaders for a better organization of their revolts. The convention decided that help should be sought from the Pope, and the trusted and experienced leaders Tom Plezha, Mark Gjini and Nikoll√´ Mekajshi were chosen to undertake the negotiations. This was done secretly from the Republic of Venice as the latter did not want to open a new conflict with the Ottomans. A year later Gjini returned from Italy to recruit men for the implementation of plans, and was almost killed by people employed by Venetians. In 1607, Gjini led a delegation that requested help by the King of Spain. After the failure of the Mat Convention's goals, little is known about Mark Gjini. The documents, however, show that after the 1607-1608 period, he was still one of the most active anti-Ottoman leaders in Albania.

It is also the second book in the Troy Pearce series of techno- thrillers. In the novel, Pearce helps Tuareg leader Mossa Ag Alla, who is being targeted by the Chinese over control of the recently discovered rare earth mineral deposits across Mali, which is Tuareg territory. Plot summary A Chinese oil company has a vested interest in the recently discovered rare earth mineral deposits all over the Sahara, particularly in the country of Mali. However, the Malian government has been battling the Tuaregs, nomad warriors who hold the territory. As a result, Zhao Yi, one of the vice presidents of the company that spearheaded the initiative, agrees to help the government bring down the rebellion by hunting down the Tuaregs, utilizing the services of People's Liberation Army (PLA) operator Guo Jun. Meanwhile, Troy Pearce has been dealing with grief over the brutal murder of his friend Johnny Paloma by rhinoceros poachers (who are aided by Guo) in Mozambique. He is later tasked by former U.S. president Margaret Myers with extracting her former head of security Mike Early, who is now a bodyguard to Italian doctor Cella Paolini, Troy‚Äôs former lover, from Mali. Upon arriving there, he finds out that they are joined by Mossa Ag Alla, leader of the Tuaregs (‚ÄúBlue Warrior‚Äù) and Cella‚Äôs father-in-law. In Washington, D.C., power-hungry senator Barbara Fiero plots to make current president Greyhill break his promise of ‚Äúno boots on the ground‚Äù, where he has been enjoying high approval ratings, and lose in the upcoming presidential elections as a result, citing the growing Chinese involvement in the rare-earth mineral deposits across Africa as the reason; she privately recruits the services of skilled hacker Jasmine Bath. Meanwhile, Myers has been investigating the suicide of her friend and Supreme Court justice Vincent Tanner, unknowingly putting herself on Bath‚Äôs radar. After finding out that she is under surveillance, she escapes to Pearce‚Äôs Wyoming home and investigates the circumstances regarding Tanner‚Äôs death along with Pearce Systems IT head Ian McTavish, later concluding that Fiero and Bath are involved. Mossa and his men accompany Pearce, Cella, and Early on a six-day trek through the Saharan desert into an abandoned airfield in southern Algeria, where they will be airlifted out of Africa. They manage to dispatch roving Malian soldiers as well as members of the French Foreign Legion, who are in the area to track down al Rus, an al- Qaeda operative. Al Rus himself also attacks the traveling party, but is later neutralized by a French Reaper drone strike. Meanwhile, Bath finds out about Myers and Pearce‚Äôs connection to Mossa and later outs them as accomplices to the Tuareg chief, whom she assigned as a high-level target to be neutralized in a drone strike, through planting fake intelligence briefings into the databases of the intelligence agencies. Fiero relays this information to vice president Gary Diele, who reluctantly becomes a accomplice to her plot. However, Pearce and Mossa are unharmed; the Reaper drone strike instead kills Mossa's arms dealer, who was carrying an assault rifle traded to him by Pearce, as well as his men; it was outfitted with an RFID chip that enabled Bath to falsely pinpoint Pearce's exact location. Bath then decides to end her services to the Fieros and escape the country, but not before issuing a bogus emergency command to the FBI server that leads to the shutdown of Pearce Systems and the arrest of its employees. Upon arriving in the abandoned airport, Pearce engages in a long battle with Guo‚Äôs men, where Mossa and his men as well as Early are killed. Pearce and Cella manage to escape the airfield, but not before Troy gets shot in the head by Guo. He recuperates in Cella‚Äôs home in Milan, Italy, and after recovering from his scalp wound, later avenges Paloma and Early‚Äôs deaths by killing Guo, Zhao, and Bath. He tries to assassinate Fiero but is restrained by Myers, who later arranges a leak of an audio recording of Fiero and Diele authorizing the illegal drone strike on Pearce in Mali, effectively ending their political careers.

The result of a semantic decomposition is a representation of meaning. This representation can be used for tasks, such as those related to artificial intelligence or machine learning. Semantic decomposition is common in natural language processing applications. The basic idea of a semantic decomposition is taken from the learning skills of adult humans, where words are explained using other words. It is based on Meaning-text theory. Meaning-text theory is used as a theoretical linguistic framework to describe the meaning of concepts with other concepts.  Background  Given that an AI does not inherently have language, it is unable to think about the meanings behind the words of a language. An artificial notion of meaning needs to be created for a strong AI to emerge. AI today is able to capture the syntax of language for many specific problems, but never establishes meaning for the words of these languages, nor is it able to abstract these words to higher-order concepts Creating an artificial representation of meaning requires the analysis of what meaning is. Many terms are associated with meaning, including semantics, pragmatics, knowledge and understanding or word sense. Each term describes a particular aspect of meaning, and contributes to a multitude of theories explaining what meaning is. These theories need to be analyzed further to develop an artificial notion of meaning best fit for our current state of knowledge.  Graph representations  Abstract approach on how knowledge representation and reasoning allow a problem specific solution (answer) to a given problem (questions) Representing meaning as a graph is one of the two ways that both an AI cognition and a linguistic researcher think about meaning (connectionist view). Logicians utilize a formal representation of meaning to build upon the idea of symbolic representation, whereas description logics describe languages and the meaning of symbols. This contention between 'neat' and 'scruffy' techniques has been discussed since the 1970s. Research has so far identified semantic measures and with that Word-sense disambiguation (WSD) - the differentiation of meaning of words - as the main problem of language understanding. As an AI-complete environment, WSD is a core problem of natural language understanding.Nancy Ide and Jean Veronis. Introduction to the special issue on word sense disambiguation: the state of the art. Computational Linguistics, 24(1):2-40, 1998 AI approaches that use knowledge-given reasoning creates a notion of meaning combining the state of the art knowledge of natural meaning with the symbolic and connectionist formalization of meaning for AI. The abstract approach is shown in Figure. First, a connectionist knowledge representation is created as a semantic network consisting of concepts and their relations to serve as the basis for the representation of meaning.Johannes F√§hndrich est First Search Planning of Service Composition Using Incrementally Redefined Context-Dependent Heuristics. In the German Conference Multiagent System Technologies, pages 404-407, Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2013 This graph is built out of different knowledge sources like WordNet, Wiktionary, and BabelNET. The graph is created by lexical decomposition that recursively breaks each concept semantically down into a set of semantic primes. The primes are taken from the theory of Natural Semantic Metalanguage, which has been analyzed for usefulness in formal languages. Upon this graph marker passing is used to create the dynamic part of meaning representing thoughts. The marker passing algorithm, where symbolic information is passed along relations form one concept to another, uses node and edge interpretation to guide its markers. The node and edge interpretation model is the symbolic influence of certain concepts. Future work uses the created representation of meaning to build heuristics and evaluate them through capability matching and agent planning, chatbots or other applications of natural language understanding.

It is presented to the next of kin of each Vermont military service member who is killed in armed conflict. The award was first authorized in 1966, during the Vietnam War, but presentations did not commence until 1996. Eligibility Award of the Vermont Patriots Medal is managed by the Vermont Office of Veterans Affairs. The adjutant general of the Vermont National Guard is authorized to present the medal and a scroll acknowledging Vermont's debt to the family to the next of kin of each Vermont service member whose life is given in an armed conflict. The costs associated with creating the medal, and presenting the award and scroll are paid for from the state's legislative budget. Description The Vermont Patriots Medal is presented in a bi-fold padded green leatherette case measuring 5 1/2 x 7 1/2 inches, with the words \\"Vermont Patriots Medal\\" in gilt letters. On the left side is a scroll which notes that the medal is presented to the family of a Vermont military service member whose life was given in armed conflict. On the right the medal is set inside a shadow box. The medal is a cross of white enamel with gold edges, symbolic of the 1st Vermont Brigade, and dates to the Union Army of the American Civil War. Covering the cross is a shield of inlaid enamel with gold edges, which depicts a scene of Vermont as viewed looking east from Lake Champlain towards Camel's Hump and Mount Mansfield under a clear sky, all underneath the head of a white-tailed deer buck, a scene taken from the state's coat of arms. The shield is also reminiscent of the insignia of the 172nd Infantry Regiment, a Vermont unit which fought in the Pacific Theater during World War II. The ribbon is a center stripe of purple with white edges, reminiscent of the Purple Heart. Emanating from each side of the white stripes are stripes of green, gold, and blue. Green represents Vermont's Green Mountains, while blue represents the state's lakes and streams beneath a clear blue sky. Gold represents the state's brave and creative people, Vermont's most valuable resource. Attached to the ribbon is a clasp that connects to a straight bar hanger which attaches the medal to the ribbon. The clasp reads \\"Vermont Patriot 1764\\", and indicates the name of the medal and the year Vermont, then called the New Hampshire Grants, created its first militia unit in Bennington. A bronze star is also attached to the ribbon, which evokes the symbolism of Vermont's admission to the Union as the 14th state, also referred to allegorically as the \\"14th Star\\" (Stella quarta decima). In addition, the bronze star device evokes the sacrifice a single service member whose family receives the award has made on behalf of the state and nation. History In 1966, the Vermont General Assembly approved Joint Resolution #42, which authorized the development of the Vermont Patriots Medal, which would be awarded to the families of Vermont servicemen who were killed in Vietnam. Creation of the medal was not funded, and criteria for managing and presenting the award were not developed, so it was never produced. In 1996, the Vermont State Council of Vietnam Veterans of America re-publicized the Vermont Patriots Medal, and the state legislature passed an amended bill to make funds available for the medal so it could be created and presented to the surviving family members of Vermont's Vietnam War dead. The law was later amended to include the families of Vermont service members killed in all wars. Design of the Vermont Patriots Medal was done by a veteran who initially wished to remain anonymous. He was later identified as L. Leigh Sykes, a Vietnam War veteran of the United States Air Force.

The plot follows two friends who attempt to take control of their cosmetics company back from an industry titan. The film was theatrically released in the United States on January 10, 2020, by Paramount Pictures. It had its premiere held in New York City on January 7, 2020, three days before its release. It received negative reviews from critics and grossed $29 million.  Plot  Two friends with very different personalities run their own beauty company, Mia&Mel.; Mel (Rose Byrne) is more practical and inventive, while Mia (Tiffany Haddish) wants to earn her fortune quickly and live a lavish lifestyle. Things take a turn for the worse when their company runs into $493,000 of debt, forcing them to turn to unscrupulous benefactor Claire Luna (Salma Hayek), head of a major cosmetics empire, who intends to steal the business out from under them. The two must address their differences to save their business, as they are faced with the challenge of 'proving' themselves to Luna even as Luna steals their 'one-night-stand' bag idea and has it marketed through one of her other companies, as well as forcing them to fire one of their workers Barrett (Billy Porter), the other is Sydney (Jennifer Coolidge). Mia and Mel briefly 'split up' through their different approaches to Luna's offer, but they reconcile when their friends help them face how they need each other. Faced with the possible loss of their business, Mia and Mel approach Shay (Lisa Kudrow), Luna's former business partner, to start a new company, Proud Cosmetics, marketing their new 'Ride or Die' product, make-up intended to be used by best friends together to face their nights out. With this loophole, Mia and Mel are able to produce and market 'Ride or Die' under the 'Proud' banner while Luna takes ownership of Mia&Mel; while still required to pay them 49% of all subsequent earnings. Mia and Mel also bring along Sydney and Barrett to the new company.

He was active in several fields, contributing to the establishment of an astronomical observatory in Turku as well as initiating the earliest systematic meteorological observations in Finland. His children were ennobled in recognition of his achievements. Biography Gustaf Gabriel H√§llstr√∂m was born in Ilmajoki, Finland on 25 November 1775. He entered the Royal Academy of Turku as a student in 1792 and made a rapid career as an academic. He would remain tied to the academy throughout his life, also after it moved to Helsinki in 1827, becoming president of the university (today known as Helsinki University) for several years. He was made a professor of physics already in 1801, after having abandoned his initial studies in mathematics. He published his research widely, mainly in the form of dissertations and in ', the scientific journal of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, as well as in the journal of the Finnish Society of Sciences and Letters, but also in foreign publications. His interests ranged from thermodynamics to acoustics and meteorology; \\"his dissertations in physics covered almost all the areas of the field of physics at that time.\\" In addition, he was ordained as a priest in 1804 and received a doctorate in theology in 1826; he was the last professor of physics at the Royal Academy of Turku to be ordained as a priest in order to augment his salary (as priests had a certain level of guaranteed income). As a person, he has been described as \\"naturally conservative\\" and, especially in his later years, received criticism for being too cautious as an academic. He was respected as a scientist and in 1830 his children were ennobled and subsequently had their surnames changed to af H√§llstr√∂m in recognition of their father's achievements. The minor planet 2640 H√§llstr√∂m is named after him. Work =Physics and astronomy= In physics, H√§llstr√∂m's research spanned several areas. In 1805, he was awarded a prize by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for a thesis concerning the expansion of iron at different temperatures. H√§llstr√∂m managed to show that the relationship between the temperature of the metal and its degree of expansion was not a linear one. Another problem which he returned to frequently during his career was that of the effects of heat on water and the question of at what temperature water has the highest density; he was again awarded a prize in 1823 for a study in this field, supported by meticulous experiments. Within the field of acoustics, H√§llstr√∂m made research on combination tones, with the help of experiments carried out on the organ of Turku Cathedral. H√§llstr√∂m was instrumental in creating a rudimentary observatory in Turku and to engage initially Henrik Johan Walbeck and later Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander as astronomers there. He also made astronomical observations himself. =Meteorology= Gustaf Gabriel H√§llstr√∂m took the initiative to make the first meteorological observations in Finland. An early dissertation, published in 1804, concerned the phenomenon of night frost and was awarded a prize by an agricultural society (as this kind of research had important practical consequences for the agriculture in Finland). The systematic meteorological observations he had initiated yielded further subjects for his research, which also included studies of aurorae, the forming of ice on rivers and directions of prevailing winds in Finland.

His racing career was extremely brief, consisting of two races in the space of 28 days in 1881. On 4 May he was an emphatic winner of the 2000 Guineas defeating the American challenger Iroquois. He was matched against Iroquois again in the Epsom Derby and was beaten half a length into second place. A recurrent leg injury forced his retirement at the end of the year. He made little impact as a breeding stallion. Background Peregrine was a brown horse bred in England by Mr Taylor Sharpe. He stood 16 hands high and had white markings on the heels of his hind feet. In September 1879 the yearling was offered for sale and bought for 450 guineas by the trainer Robert Peck on behalf of Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster. On the death of the Duke's wife, the former Lady Constance Leveson-Gower, in 1880 many of his racehorses were put up for sale and Peregrine, then an unraced two-year-old, was reportedly sold for 700 guineas. Despite the \\"sale\\" the colt appeared to remain in the same ownership. During his racing career the colt was listed as the property of \\"Mr Mance\\", \\"Mr Grosvenor\\" and \\"Mr Norman\\", which appear to have been nom de courses of the Duke. It was reported that Mr Norman was \\"Capt. Robert Grosvenor, a son of the Duke of Westminster\\", but this seems unlikely as in 1881 the Duke's son Robert was only 12 years old. Peregrine was trained by Peck at Russley Park in Wiltshire throughout his racing career. He was one of the best horses sired by Pero Gomez who won the St Leger and finished second in the Derby in 1869. Peregrine's dam Adelaide was an exceptionally influential broodmare who is regarded as the foundation mare of Thoroughbred family 9-h. Racing career =1881: three-year-old season= Fred Webb, Peregrine's jockey Peregrine was unraced a two-year-old, but in the spring of 1881 he began to appear in the betting lists for both the 2000 Guineas and the Epsom Derby. On 4 May 1881 Peregrine, on his racecourse debut, was one of fourteen horses to contest the 73rd running of the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket Racecourse. Prince Soltykoff's Scobell started the 7/2 ahead of Cameliard, Golden Plover and Tristan with Peregrine, ridden by Fred Webb next in the betting on 15/2. The filly Wandering Nun delayed the start by refusing to line up with her male opponents but started well and led the field before giving way to Lennoxlove who was in turn overtaken by the American-bred outsider Iroquois two furlongs from the finish. Peregine, who had not been among the early leaders moved into contention at about the same stage and then began to make rapid progress down the centre of the course. He moved up alongside the American colt approaching the final furlong and drew away in the closing stages to win \\"very easily\\" by three lengths from the American-bred Iroquois with the 100/1 outsider Don Fulano finishing a length and a half back in third. Peregrine was stepped up in distance for the Derby Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse on 1 June 1881. With Webb again in the saddle he was made the 6/5 favourite ahead of fourteen opponents headed by Iroquois. After being restrained towards the middle of the field, Peregrine moved up into contention on the inside rail on the final turn and as he took the lead entering the final furlong he looked likely to win easily. Iroquois however, produced a strong late rush and Peregrine was beaten half a length in a \\"splendid\\" finish. Shortly after the race it was reported that Peregrine had been bought for 7,000 guineas by Lord Alington. Peregrine was strongly fancied for the St Leger at Doncaster Racecourse in September but was withdrawn (\\"scratched\\") from the race on 18 August after he aggravated a pre-existing foreleg injury in a training gallop. Stud record Peregrine spent most of his stud career in France. He was not a success as a breeding stallion, with the best of his offspring probably being the filly La Pernelle, who finished second in the Grand Crit√©rium. Peregrine died of a heart condition.

With Fernando Lopez as his vice president, he ran against the Liberal Party slate of Sergio Osmena Jr. and Genaro Magsaysay. Background Ferdinand Marcos won his first campaign for the Philippine Presidency in November 1965, and was inaugurated just before new year's day in December the same year. Under the 1935 Constitution of the Philippines which was in force at the time, Marcos was supposed to be allowed a maximum of two four year terms as President. Formal Nomination The formal beginning of the 1969 campaign can be dated to the July 1969 meeting of the Philippines' Nacionalista Party, in which Ferdinand Marcos was formally nominated as the party's presidential candidate. A meeting of the party's ruling junta had met a week earlier to assure that the nomination would be unanimous. \\"Guns, goons, and gold\\" With his popularity already beefed up by debt-funded spending, Marcos' popularity made it very likely that he would win the election, but he decided, as National Artist for Literature Nick Joaquin reported in the Philippines Free Press, to \\"leave nothing to chance.\\" Time and Newsweek would eventually call the 1969 election the \\"dirtiest, most violent and most corrupt\\" in Philippine modern history, with the term \\"Three Gs\\", meaning \\"guns, goons, and gold\\" coined to describe administration's election tactics of vote-buying, terrorism and ballot snatching. Marcos used the military and the government bureaucracy for his campaign, with members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines participating in putting up campaign propaganda. Marcos also launched US$50 million worth in infrastructure projects in an effort to curry favor with the electorate. This rapid campaign spending was so massive that it would be responsible for the Balance of Payments Crisis of 1970, whose inflationary effect would cause social unrest leading all the way up to the proclamation of Martial Law in 1972. Marcos was reported to have spent PhP 100 for every PhP 1 that Osme√±a spent, using up PhP 24 Million in Cebu alone. =Election violence= The most violent election- related incidents took place in Batanes, where Philippine Constabulary officers, paramilitary groups, and hired guns essentially took over the island, and motorcycle-riding thugs rode around terrorizing voters and Comelec officials, and beating up opposition leaders. Results Presidential, legislative and local elections were held on November 11, 1969, resulting in an unprecedented second full term as President of the Philippines for Incumbent President Marcos. Incumbent Vice President Fernando Lopez was also elected to a third full term as Vice President of the Philippines. Twelve other candidates ran for president, however ten of those were widely considered \\"nuisance candidates,\\" and did not garner a significant number of votes in the election.

Early life Pamelia Dickinson Mann was born circa 1800. Flournoy \\"Nimrod\\" Hunt, her first son, was born around 1817. She gave birth to her second son, Samuel Ezekiel W. Allen, early in 1826 while in Frankfort, Kentucky. She came to Texas in 1834 by way of Vicksburg, Mississippi. Gone to Texas By the time she arrived in Texas, Pamelia was married to Marshall Mann. The two ran a boarding house at Washington-on-the-Brazos, the site of the Texas Constitutional Convention in March 1836. After the convention, she traveled to another residence in San Felipe de Austin, but joined other Texans fleeing from Mexican troops in the Runaway Scrape. During this event, which included General Sam Houston and the entire Texas Army traveling east, Houston appropriated Mann's team of oxen to pull heavy military equipment. Mann planned to take the Nacogdoches Road, leading northeast, but the Army took a path in another direction toward Harrisburg. She confronted Houston, unhitched the equipment from the wagon, and reclaimed her oxen. Nobody in the Texas Army stopped her.Muir (1946), pp. 115116. After the Texian victory at the Battle of San Jacinto, the new government convened at a temporary capital in Brazoria, Texas, on the Brazos River. The Manns ran a boarding house there in late-1836. The Texas Congress selected the yet unformed town of Houston as its next capital, effective for the next session of congress scheduled for May 1837. The Manns abandoned their boarding house and departed for Houston on 16 January 1837. Mann recruited two of her boarders to move to Houston and work as carpenters, both of whom joined the Mann family on part of the trip. She used the journey as a means of acquiring additional food. She had already laden her wagons with bedding, food, and whiskey from the old house, and accumulated dairy and poultry along the way. Her caravan of two wagons and eight oxen took three weeks to complete the fifty-mile trip to Houston. One of her boarders, Robert P. Boyce, a Texas veteran and a carpenter, contracted to build her new hotel in Houston. The hotel was located at the corner of Milam and Congress, facing the main public square, now known as Market Square. Mann opened Mansion House in May 1837. The two-story hotel had a double-gallery, and a reception area with furnishings highlighted by a sofa and cherry table. Just as she had boarded many distinguished guests at her house in Washington- on-the-Brazos, Mansion House housed and boarded many persons of similar standing. She feted four Tonkawa chiefs. She also provided lodging to Levi L. Laurens, who falsely accused Dr. Chauncey Goodrich of stealing $1,000, then killed him in a duel. Her husband Marshall, who had acted as a business partner for Mansion House, died on 4 October 1838.Muir (1946), pp. 117120. Mann was indicted for forgery in December 1838, which was a capital offense in the Republic of Texas. Despite representation in court by the firm of (Sam) Houston and (John) Birdall, a jury convicted Mann on May 21, 1839 while appealing for leniency. Three days later Judge Benjamin C. Franklin scheduled her execution for June 27, but President Mirabeau Lamar issued a pardon on May 25.Muir (1946), pp. 121124. According to Andrew Forest Muir, this was probably a false conviction as Mann \\"could not sign her own name.\\"Muir (1946), p. 124. This was not her only involvement with legal proceedings. Including criminal and civil cases, she was involved in more court cases in Harris County, Texas over a four year period than any other person during that time.Hogan (1935), p. 365. Death and legacy Mann was stricken by yellow fever and died on November 4, 1840. She left an estate of over $40,000. Her estate included the Mansion House, the Houston Stables, several city lots, and rural land. Her son Flournoy Hunt was appointed to settle the estate, but died before all business was completed.Hogan (1935), p. 369.

Battle of Pav√≥n in 1861. Ignazio or Ignacio Manzoni (1797, Milan - 18 November 1884, Clusone) was an Italian painter, active for many years in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He painted diverse themes, including history, battle, religious, and landscape paintings, as well as still-lifes and portraits.Storia degli Italiani nell' Argentina, by Giuseppe Parisi; Enrico Voghera, editor; Rome (1907); page 141.  Biography  He began his artistic studies at the Accademia de Brera, in Milan. He fought against the Austrians during the First Italian War of Independence and was forced into exile in Switzerland when the Italian forces were defeated. He remained there until an amnesty was declared.Modern Italian Painters, article by JM The Westminster Review, 1841, Volume 35, pages 386-387. He eventually left Italy again; apparently as the result of a love affair with an unidentified Duchess who was unable to separate from her husband. When he arrived in Argentina, in 1851, he immediately set up shop as a teacher. Even though his still-lifes were coldly received, he decided to remain there, although he also travelled to the United States, Peru and Chile. It wasn't until 1857 that he took up permanent residence in Buenos Aires, where he became popular for his portraits, religious works and costumbrista scenes. In 1862, he entered into a rivalry with another Italian-born painter who was very popular in Buenos Aires: Baldassare Verazzi, who publicly challenged him in the press to present his credentials. A few days later, the newspaper, El Nacional came to the defense of Verazzi, declaring that Manzoni was a low-class painter, while Verazzi was the most accomplished artist who had yet come to Argentina. Some smaller art journals sided with Manzoni. The two became friends soon after. His oil painting, El Asado (The Roast), won first prize at the Primera Exposici√≥n Nacional, held in C√≥rdoba (1871), after it had been praised by President Domingo Faustino Sarmiento.Commentary on El Asado by Roberto Amigo.

Early years Marie Gustave Hector Ohier was born in Mondoubleau, Loir-et-Cher, on 5 August 1814. His parents were Antoine Ohier (born 1787) and Pauline Dehargne (1787‚Äì1838). His father, Antoine Alexandre Marie Ohier, was a cloth merchant. He studied at the Coll√®ge de Vend√¥me, then entered the √âcole Navale on 15 September 1830. He graduated as a first class pupil on 1 October 1833, and sailed on the Meuse, Castor, Bayonnaise, Sir√®ne and Camille. He campaigned in Africa, the Levant and Chile. He participated in the French blockade of the R√≠o de la Plata and the capture of the fortified Mart√≠n Garc√≠a Island between Argentina and Uruguay. Commissioned officer Ohier was promoted to enseigne de vaisseau (sub-lieutenant) in 1837 and served on the V√©nus and the Amazone. He was made lieutenant de vaisseau (lieutenant) in 1843 and was assigned to the Labrador. He was then aide-de-camp to Admiral Abel Aubert du Petit-Thouars in Toulon until 1848. On 11 January 1847 he married Ana√Øs Bernard Duhaut-Cilly (1829‚Äì1860) in Paris. They had a daughter, Pauline (1847‚Äì1920). Ohier commanded the Sentinelle from 1850 to 1852 in Constantinople. He was appointed capitaine de fr√©gate (commander) on 17 August 1852, was made second in command of the Freidland in 1853 and took part in the Crimean War. He directed the naval batteries during the Siege of Sevastopol. He was promoted to capitaine de vaisseau (captain) in 1855 and commanded the Suffren, the gunners' training ship, and then the Toulon Division des √âquipages. In 1860 he was in command of the Gloire, the world's first active battleship. He was made a Commander of the Legion of Honour in 1860, and was awarded the Grand Cross of Cambodia. Commodore On 2 December 1864 Ohier was promoted to contre-amiral (commodore) and commanded the Ville-de-Paris and the Solf√©rino, both battleships. Ohier was placed in charge of the Cochin-China Naval Division, while Pierre-Gustave Roze was in charge of the Far East Naval Division. The two admirals visited Hong Kong, where they met the French architect Achille- Antoine Hermitte and were impressed by him. On their recommendation Admiral Pierre-Paul de La Grandi√®re, Governor of Cochinchina, made Hermitte head of his architectural department. Sakai incident, Japan. Le Monde illustr√©, 1868. In 1867 Ohier visited Japan on the Hermione. In February 1868 Ohier, the new commander in the China Seas, had an audience with the former sh≈çgun, Tokugawa Yoshinobu, in Edo, Japan. He politely but firmly made it clear that he would not make a military intervention in his favour. This ensured that if the French minister L√©on Roches offered military aid to the Sh≈çgun it would not have persuaded him to actively resist the emperor. Ohier was recalled from Japan to become Acting Governor of Cochinchina in place of La Grandi√®re, who had fallen ill and had to return to France. When leaving Kobe the admiral gave orders for the Dupleix to survey the river on which Osaka stands and the coast as far as Sakai. A group of sailors on a steam launch was attacked on 7 March 1868 and a midshipman and ten sailors were killed. Ohier was acting governor from 4 April 1868 to 10 December 1869. In 1868 Ohier founded the Documentation Library of the Government of Cochinchina (Biblioth√®que de Documentation du Gouvernement de la Cochinchine Fran√ßaise), which would become the General Sciences Library of Ho Chi Minh City. In 1869 he was promoted to Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour. He signed the Treaty of the West Mekong on 25 August 1869, but was unable to persuade the emperor of Vietnam to confirm French rule over the three provinces they had seized. He attended the informal opening of the new Palais du Gouverneur, Saigon, on 25 September 1869, which Hermitte had designed. In 1869 Ohier said that the commercial well-being of the colony depended on the Chinese: \\"it is upon them that we must count to draw ... commerce to Saigon.\\" He refused to shield French traders from competition. He said he had been \\"as favorable as possible towards business, but ... refused to grant it the least subsidy.\\" Ohier fell ill and had to return to France at the start of 1870. He was succeeded as acting governor of Cochinchina on 10 December 1869 by Joseph Faron, who held office until Alphonse de Cornulier- Lucini√®re arrived to assume the governorship. Ohier died on 30 November 1870 in Saint-Louis, near Fayence, Var. He is buried in Toulon's central cemetery. The rue Ohier in Saigon was named in his honour, later to be called T√¥n Th·∫•t Thi·ªáp street. A street in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, was also named after him, since renamed Street 13.

Born in New Zealand, he studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh after which he entered Guy's Hospital. His experiences during the Second World War and his training with Sir Harold Gillies in burns and facial injuries led to an internationally acclaimed career in that area. He published extensively in textbooks and journals, lectured widely on burns in children and founded the Hand Club. Early life Clarkson was born at Christchurch, New Zealand, on 20 February 1911, the son of a sheep farmer and meat exporter. He received his basic education at Christ's College, New Zealand, subsequently studying medicine at the University of Edinburgh, after which he entered Guy's Hospital Medical School on a scholarship. In 1933, at Guy's, he became an inter- hospital heavy-weight boxing champion. In addition, he represented his medical school at squash rackets.Clarkson, Patrick Wensley (1911‚Äì1969).

Second World War In 1940, he joined the Royal Army Medical Corps and two years later was appointed to a training post in plastic surgery under Sir Harold Gillies at Rooksdown House, Basingstoke. His knowledge of the management of burns and facial injuries came from experience at the maxillo- facial unit in North Africa and Italy between 1942 and 1945. During the final years of the war, he was appointed to the U.S. Army and Navy plastic units,\\"In Memorium P. W. Clarkson M.B.E., F.R.C.S.

For these war time services, he was awarded the MBE. Later career After the war, Clarkson was surgeon in-charge of Guy's Hospital accident and emergency and he rejoined Sir Harold Gillies as a plastic surgeon. In addition, he was appointed as consultant plastic surgeon to St Charles' Hospital, the Royal Northern Hospital and St Mary Abbot's Hospital. At the Queen Alexandra Military Hospital and the Cambridge Military Hospital, Aldershot, he became honorary civilian consultant in plastic surgery. In 1946, Clarkson was Hunterian Professor and Leverhulme Research Scholar at the Royal College of Surgeons, later becoming a FDS examiner. In 1952, the needs of burned airmen after the war encouraged Clarkson to initiate the establishment of the Hand Club, a precursor idea for the later British Society for Surgery of the Hand.Our History. British Society for Surgery of the Hand. Retrieved 24 July 2018. In 1953, after witnessing distressing burns in children, he established the Children's Burns Unit at Guy's. He published extensively in textbooks and journals, mainly on hand surgery and on the treatment of burns, and developed international recognition for his work. His contributions included the 1962 book The general and plastic surgery of the hand, co-authored with A. D. Pelly. The American Society for Surgery of the Hand elected him an honorary member and the surgical societies of Brussels, Madrid, and Bordeaux gave him honorary membership. The French and American Societies for Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery elected him an associate member. He became visiting professor of plastic surgery at the Presbyterian Hospital, New York, and the Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, in 1963 and 1964 respectively. In 1965, he gave his second Hunterian lecture on the topic of burns in children.

Poland syndrome Alfred Poland's original description of the syndrome Whilst at Guy‚Äôs in 1962, Clarkson described three people with breast hypoplasia and joining of fingers. His son later explained how his father discovered the 1841 work of Alfred Poland, an anatomy student at the time who described a body with a hypoplastic webbed hand associated with chest wall deformities. Alfred Poland's friend had made illustrations of the head, neck, and chest anomalies but not the hand. However, Clarkson found the preserved hand in the hospital museum and described it in further detail, subsequently coining the term ‚ÄúPoland syndactyly‚Äù in an article in the same journal as Arthur Poland‚Äôs original report. Five years later, P. Baudinne and colleagues named the condition \\"Poland syndrome\\". Later life Clarkson took early retirement due to poor health, but continued to lecture, write and travel. Following a brief illness, he died at Guy's Hospital on 28 December 1969. An address in his memory was given by Sir Hedley Atkins at St Columba's Church, Pont Street, in January 1970.

Consequently, El Alem was expelled from the King Fuad University in 1954 for his political positions and prevented from supporting his doctoral thesis. Thereafter, he became a political prisoner from 1959 until 1963 because of his refusal to dissolve the Egyptian Communist Party into the Socialist Union set up by President Gamal Abdel Nasser. El Alem, alongside Ismael Sabri Abdallah and Fouad Mursi, later gave greater support to Arab nationalism by building an alliance between communists and nationalists to face the economic and political challenges of the Arab world.

The club plays in the Second League of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  History  = Kingdom of Yugoslavia = Tomislavgrad's football history starts in 1910, when August Batiniƒá, a player of the NK SA≈†K, brought a ball in Tomislavgrad, at the time named ≈Ωupanjac. The first football matches were played at Bara, where the present-day basilica is located.Povijest kluba The first idea to found a football club in ≈Ωupanjac occurred after the World War I. However, the founding assembly was held only on 30 April 1920 in a pub owned by Ilija Zrno ƒåokrlja. The initiator of the idea was August Batiniƒá. The first president of the football club's committee was Stojan Protrka. The committee named the football club HNK Tomislav in honour of the first Croatian king Tomislav, whose crowning took place near ≈Ωupanjac and preparations were under way to mark a 1000-year jubilee of the event. The first kit, a white shirt and black trousers, in which footballers played before the World War I, were confirmed by the committee as the official kit. Construction of a playground was among the main goals of the committee, however, it wasn't realised. The club player on various improvised playgrounds. The first match played by the clup was held in ≈Ωupanjac on 29 September 1920 against students from ≈Ωupanjac who studied at the ≈†iroki Brijeg gymnasium. Tomislav won the match. The first official match was played against Sto≈æer, won by Tomislav 2‚Äì1. In 1925, ≈Ωupanjac changed its name to Tomislavgrad, officially in honour of Prince Tomislav, son of King Alexander I of Yugoslavia, but unofficially in honour of King Tomislav of Croatia. Due to official state policy of Kingdom of Yugoslavia which suppressed Croatian nationalism, in 1927 the club was renamed to Vran (after the Vran mountain), a name that was used until 1946, so it could continue to play against other football clubs. = Communist Yugoslavia = During the World War II, Tomislavgrad was part of the German puppet-state Independent State of Croatia, which was divided into two demarcation zones, one occupied by Germans and other by Italians. Tomislavgrad was in the Italian zone. During the war, Vran played matches against the Italian regiments. After the World War II, the communists took power. In accordance with the socialist ideology, Vran changed its name to Zvijezda (Star). This was club's name from 1946 to 1954. The official kit was a red shirt and blue trousers and socks. Zvijezda didn't participate at the official contests, but it did played against neighbouring football clubs. In 1952, Zvijezda played in the Football Sub-Federal League Mostar. Zvijezda again changed its name on 23 August 1954 to Fudbalski klub Buduƒánost (Football Club Future). The club used this name until 1990. The Buduƒánost's colours were red and white. Buduƒánost continued to play in the Football Sub-Federal League Mostar. The League had 10 clubs. The official playground of Buduƒánost was now near the town's centre. In 1958 the Football Sub-Federal League Mostar was divided into two groups ‚Äì North and South, each had 6 clubs. Buduƒánost was in the group North. The group North had six clubs. Buduƒánost ended up fourth. On the initiative of the sportsmen from Livno, the Football Sub-Federation Livno was formed. The Football Sub- Federation Livno existed from 1959 to 1963. It had 6 clubs. In order to maintain the Sub-Federation Livno, new clubs were formed. Buduƒánost competed in the Sub-Federation Livno until 1962. As a factory was being constructed at the Buduƒánost's playground, Buduƒánost played on an improvised playground at Glibine in ƒÜavarov Stan. In May 1960 the Sub-Federation Livno suspended Buduƒánost and the suspension was lifted in December 1960. Buduƒánost was suspended because the Sub-Federation Livno intended to make Troglav a champion, and first place was held by Buduƒánost. Nonetheless, Buduƒánost ended up first, and entered the Herzegovina Zone, part of the Third Yugoslav League. Buduƒánost ended up 11th out of 12 clubs and continued to compete in the Herzegovina Zone. In 1963 Buduƒánost gained a new stadium named Ferovac, which serves as the official stadium for HNK Tomislav today. The stadium had stands and locker rooms. In average, Buduƒánost was at the centre of the rankings or was competing to remain in the Third League. As of season 1971‚Äì72 to 1974‚Äì75, Buduƒánost was at among the top clubs of the Third League. In 1978 the Herzegovina Zone was divided into two groups. The division was made because many new clubs were founded in Herzegovina. Buduƒánost was in the grup amongst ten other clubs. Buduƒánost won the third place. In 1979, the new Republican Regional League ‚Äì South was formed and Buduƒánost managed to enter the newly formed league and played in it through the 1979‚Äì80 season. In the season of 1981‚Äì82 Buduƒánost was again back in the Herzegovina Zone ‚Äì South. In 1984 it was decided to unite the North and South groups into one league with 18 clubs, among which was Buduƒánost which ended up 13th. = Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia = In 1989 Fudbalski klub Buduƒánost changed its name to Nogometni klub Buduƒánost, using the Croatian term for football instead of the official Serbo-Croatian. On 30 May 1990, Buduƒánost took its original name HNK Tomislav. The official stadium was named Gradski stadion \\"Tomislav\\" (City Staium \\"Tomislav\\"). In the season of 1990‚Äì91 Tomislav played in the Herzegovina Zone ‚Äì South, and took the first place and entered the Republican Regional League ‚Äì South. In 1991 Tomislav was successful in the Coup of Yugoslavia entering the round of 16 where it was defeated by RAD from Belgrade with a result of 0‚Äì4. Tomislav played three matches in the Republican Regional League ‚Äì South in total, and refused to continue to compete after that due to political reasons, namely protesting against the war in Croatia. After Tomislav left the League, other Croatian clubs did so as well. During the Bosnian War, all players of the Tomislav participated either as soldiers or in working units. Tomislav continued to exist despite the war. In August 1992 it played a tournament against the units of the Croatian Defence Council (HVO). Tomislav also played against a team of UNPROFOR and won 11‚Äì0. Other friendly games against other football clubs were played as well. From 1993 to 2000, Tomislav competed in the First League of Herzeg-Bosnia. The First League of Herzeg-Bosnia was the first league formed during the war, and the only league in existence after the war. Football Federation of Herzeg-Bosnia as well as the Herzeg-Bosnia national football team also existed. The Serb and Bosniaks football clubs played in their own respective leagues. Each national league had its own football federation and national team. In the 1993‚Äì94 season Tomislav was a runner-up, while ≈†iroki Brijeg won the championship of the Herzegovina group of the First League. Both clubs had the same number of points and the same goal difference, but ≈†iroki Brijeg was better in matches between the respective clubs. Thus, ≈†iroki Brijeg gained the right to play-off with the champions from the Posavina and Central Bosnia groups, eventually defeating them becoming the champion of Herzeg-Bosnia. In the 1994‚Äì95 season Tomislav took the 4th place. In the 1995‚Äì96 season, 80% of players were recruited, but nonetheless Tomislav managed to perform well. In the 1996‚Äì97 season, Tomislav was demoted to the Second League of Herzeg-Bosnia. From 1997 to 2001, Tomislav competed in the Second League of Herzego Bosnia ‚Äì Center 2. = Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina = The First League of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is one of the second football leagues in Bosnia and Herzegovina, gathering the football clubs from the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, one of the two political entities of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The other second league is the First League of the Republika Srpska, the football league gathering the football clubs from Republika Srpska, the other political entity. Both leagues were formed in 2000. On the same principle the third leagues were also formed, namely the Second League of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Second League of the Republika Srpska. These leagues are further divided into several groups. The Second League of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina was divided into the groups North, Center, South and West, with HNK Tomislav competing in the group Center. In the 2000‚Äì01 season, HNK Tomislav won the championship in the gorup Center and was followed by the Drinovci football club from Drinovci. Tomislav played the qualifying game from the North group champion Mladost from Domaljevac and won with the aggregate score 7‚Äì1, thus qualifying for the First League of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the 2001‚Äì02 season of the First League of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Tomislav ended up 8th. The next season, Tomislav ended up 14th, and was again demoted to the Second League of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina Center, where it competes today.

The label, with a declared DIY ethic, published from 1981 to 1986 twenty-seven compilations on cassette involving 149 groups from 17 countries. It still sold tapes until around the year 2000, but it made the last 2 tapes of the 27 in 1986. It is considered one of the labels that contributed most to the spread of the European hardcore punk scene in North America. pp. 42-43 and 45 pp.162-164 All BCT tapes are available on Anarcho- Punk.net-Crust Punk Community & Music Download for free download. History of BCT =1982-1986: Bad Compilation Tapes= In 1982 BCT published an announcement on the 8th issue of Maximumrocknroll asking punk groups to send their compositions to them.BCT announcement on MRR p.32 The announcement was then reprinted in several European magazines and the Italian fanzines TVOR and Attack Punkzine, which contributed a lot to the internationalization of the label. BCT placed a small personal ad in Rockerilla, the most important alternative music magazine in Italy at the time. Syd Migx, the frontman of CCM (Cheetah Chrome Motherfuckers),Flipside, No. 41 (1983) BCT and CCM p.47 responded to it asking the Italian Roberto Schiavo, founder of the F.O.G. (Flowers of Grain Records), to send tapes of Italian punk bands to BCT which he did. From those tapes the label made its first Italian compilation tapes. The first tape of the label, titled First Strike, included bands from the US such as Clitboys, Future Ruins, Violation, Vatican Commandos (with a very young Moby on guitar),and The Vatican Commandos Mr. Epp & The Calculations (the band of Mark Arm and Steve Turner, which later became Green River and then Mudhoney Mr. Epp And the Calculations), Skoundrelz (the band of famous skater Tony Alva) and Eat The Rich, while the second tape Music On Fire featured bands from the Italian punk scene such as 5¬∞ Braccio, Raw Power, Indigesti,Indigesti Interview on MRR p.48 Wretched, Stazione Suicida, Crash Box and Rappresaglia. Italian Hardcore Scum Explosion! by Stuart Schrader The 22nd tape is dedicated to the rising Spanish punk/hardcore sceneBCT released a cassette compilation featuring Spanish 80s hardcore bands The BCT logo was a character called Moe Hawk drawn in black and white by Dan, the singer of Eat the Rich from San Jose. Craig Caron, the founder of Schizophrenic Records,Schizophrenic Records Interview pp.87-88 colored the image and used it to release the vinyl version of the BCT # 18 tape: Thrash, Therefore I Am. The two tapes were followed by other releases featuring many bands from around the world: the Finns Rattus and Terveet K√§det, the Danish Razor Blades and Disrespect, the Swedes Mob 47, Product Assar, Moderat Likvidation and Anti Cimex, the Germans √Ñni(X)V√§x and Kanalkotzer, the Australians Vicious Circle and the Canadians The Bill Of Rights were just some of the many acts included on the international productions of the BCT label. Between 1986 and 1987 the publication also extended to other formats under the name of BC Tapes & Records, whose first release was a compilation on LP entitled We Can Do Whatever We Want (International Comp.) which saw a mix of European and American bands and was a best of the first 11 tapes. =2002s: Reprints and new publications= In 2002 the label re-issued five cds and one lp of 7 of BCT tapes. BCT worked with a consortium of labels for those re- issues: Enterruption of San Francisco, Human Stench of Pittsfield, MA and Schizophrenic Records of Hamilton, Canada who did 2 releases each in conjunction with BCT. Among these reprints there was Senza Tregua: Granducato Hardcore (2002), an album that for the new edition commissioned the cover of the album to Winston Smith, the historical author of the Dead Kennedys logo and album covers. BCT and Italy In 1984 Chris Chacon reconfirmed his interest in the Italian scene by first releasing cassette releases by Raw Power titled Studio + Live and then the two Last White Christmas tapes, recordings of the LWC event held on December 4, 1983 in Pisa Italy by the punk cooperative called G.D.H.C. (Granducato Hardcore). In the same year, some Italian fanzines began to call the label Borderless Countries Tapes, a name that was officially adopted and added to the original name. The name came from the suggestion of an Italian punk fan via mail. =BCT and tours of Italian bands in the USA= Following the Raw Power release, Chris Chacon organized a tour of the band,Raw Power '84 tour diary which was also the first tour of an Italian hardcore punk band in the United States. During the tour, that included 20 shows in 40 days, Raw Power played at the Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles with the Dead Kennedys in front of more than 5,000 people. p.216 It was in those days that the independent label Toxic Shock Records of Pomona, California came forward for the release of the second Raw Power album Screams From The Gutter, which was recorded in Indianapolis near the end of the tour, at Paul Mahern's (of Zero Boys) studio in just a day and a half. The album was released in 1985 and sold more than 40,000 copies via independent channels. In the same period BCT published Live in the USA, a cassette with all the best songs recorded on tour (selected from 15 tapes of 20 concerts). In the autobiographical novel by Silvio Bernelli entitled I ragazzi del Mucchio, the bassist of Declino, Negazione and Indigesti describes the US tour of the latter, organized and promoted by BCT in 1986 . p.202 The label, for the occasion, also produced the EP on 7\\" vinyl The Sand Through the Green. The tour, which lasted 40 days with 20 concerts, departed from Philadelphia and ended up in San Francisco, touching also St. George in Utah with the very young NOFX, who had just released their second album. =BCT and LWC35= In December 2018 the 35th anniversary of Last White Christmas was celebrated with the LWC35 concert in the historic Lumiere cinema of Pisa, the first cinema to be opened in Italy (1899). In the cinema hall there was an exhibition of 35 posters made by Italian and international graphic designers and illustrators for the 35th anniversary of the concert. Among the artists who participated with their own work created for the 35th anniversary of the concert there were: Winston Smith, Craig Henning, John Yarbrough (designer of the cover of the first concert release on cassettes), Tuono Pettinato, Vittore Baroni, Giuseppe Palumbo and Prof.Bad Trip. The official poster of the LWC35 festival was designed by Danijel ≈Ωe≈æelj.

Goren-Inbar excavated many important prehistoric sites in Israel including the Acheulian site of Gesher Benot Ya‚Äôaqov. In 2014, she received the EMET Prize in Humanities and Judaism, and in 2016 was elected to the Israel Academy of Sciences. Early life and education Goren-Inbar excavating the Paleolithic site of GBY Naama Goren- Inbar was born in Jerusalem in 1948 to Rachel and Yaakov Goren (author). After completing her military service, she began studying toward her first degree in archaeology at the Institute of Archaeology, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where she also earned her MA and PhD (1981). Goren-Inbar's PhD dissertation (supervised by Professor Ofer Bar-Yosef) was dedicated to the study of the lithic assemblage of the Acheulian site of ‚ÄòUbeiydia.O. Bar- Yosef, N. Goren-Inbar, The lithic assemblages of 'Ubeidiya: A lower palaeolithic site in the Jordan Valley, Qedem, (Institute of Archaeology, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, 1993), pp. xiv, 266 p. She completed a post-doctoral fellowship at the University of California, Berkeley under Professor Glynn Isaac. In 1984, Goren-Inbar began teaching at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. She was appointed associate professor in 1992 and full professor in 1997. From 2002-2005, she served as the head of the university's Institute of Archaeology. Scientific contributions Goren- Inbar collecting samples at GBY Early in her career, Goren-Inbar participated in excavations at the Lower Paleolithic site of ‚ÄòUbeiydia in the Jordan Valley (the oldest site in Israel), at prehistoric sites in the northern Sinai Desert, at Hayonim Cave in the Galilee, as well as in ethnographic surveys in the southern Sinai Peninsula. In the late 1970s, Goren-Inbar excavated the Acheulian site of HaLashon near Kibbutz Kfar Menahem. During 1981-1982, she excavated the Acheulian site of Berekhat Ram in the Northern Golan Heights. The archaeological layer of the site, discovered by D. Ben Ami, is stratified between two basalt flows. The lower flow is dated by the Argon/Argon method to 800,000 years before present. The upper flow, sealing the archaeological layer from above, is dated to 233,000 years before present, setting a minimum age for the layers. When excavating, Goren-Inbar exposed the Venus of Berekhat Ram, a tuff pebble figurine of a woman, considered the earliest symbolic representation (art) in human history. From 1982 to 1985, Goren-Inbar directed the excavation of the Middle Paleolithic site of Quneitra, located in the Northern Golan Heights near the Israeli-Syrian border. Excavation at the site, dated to the final stage of the Middle Paleolithic, c. 55,000 before present, exposed a rich lithic assemblage accompanied by a wealth of animal bones including giant bovids. A notable find is a flint cobble on which a pattern of concentric circles was carved, one of the earliest and rarest examples for Middle Paleolithic art in the Levant. In 1989, Goren-Inbar initiated her excavation project at the Acheulian site of Gesher Benot Ya‚Äôaqov (GBY), located on the banks of the Jordan River south of the Hula Valley. The site, excavated during seven seasons from 1989 to 1997, is dated to 780,000 years before present by the presence in its layer of the last paleo-magnetic reversal.N. Goren-Inbar et al., Science 289, 944 (2000). The primary finds at GBY include a butchered, straight tusk elephant, indicating the early hominins‚Äô ability to process large game.N. Goren-Inbar, A. Lister, E. Werker, M. Chech, Pal√©orient 20, 99 (1994). In addition, a minimum of seven fallow deer carcasses exposed in a single layer of GBY Area C evidence the large game hunting of numerous animals. The cut marks made on the bones by the flint knives of the site's butchers demonstrate that they used a butchering method similar to that of modern humans.R. Rabinovich, S. Gaudzinski, S. Gaudzinski- Windheuser, N. Goren-Inbar, Journal Of Human Evolution 54, 134 (2008). A rich and unique assemblage of bifacial tools (handaxes and cleavers) suggest an African origin for the stone tool tradition of the site's knappers. The tools were shaped from basalt, flint, and limestone, evidence of the high cognitive abilities of the inhabitants of GBY.N. Goren-Inbar, N. Alperson-Afil, G. Sharon, G. Herzlinger, The Acheulian site of Gesher Benot Ya'aqov. Volume IV. The Lithic Assemblage. E. Delson, E. J. Sargis, Eds., Vertebrate Paleobiology and Paleoanthropology Series (Springer, Cham, Switzerland, 2018), The site's findings also include the earliest evidence for systematic, controlled use of fire outside of Africa.N. Alperson-Afil, N. Goren-Inbar, The Achulian Site of Gesher Benot Ya'aqov Vol. II: Ancient Flames and Controlled Use of Fire. E. Delson, E. J. Sargis, Eds. (Springer, Dordrecht, 2010), The sediments of the site have been waterlogged since their accumulation, creating anaerobic conditions enabling the exceptional preservation of botanical remains, including pollen, seeds, fruits, and wood. Analysis of these remains led to a unique reconstruction of the nearly one million year-old environment on the banks of the Paleo-Hula Lake. Among the botanic remains are seven species of edible nuts. Excavation at GBY exposed pitted stones identified as pitted anvils or nutting stones, ancient nut crackers. This is the earliest evidence for a vegetarian component of the human diet.N. Goren-Inbar, G. Sharon, Y. Melamed, M. Kislev, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 99, 2455 (2002) Goren-Inbar's excavation and research is published in hundreds of papers and in a series of books. She established the importance of GBY as a milestone in the study of human evolution during the Acheulian. Goren-Inbar's study of Early Paleolithic diet, migration out- of-Africa, lithic technology and tradition, and reconstruction of the paleoenvironment has placed her as a leading authority on early human behavior and evolution. Her primary contribution is in establishing the presence of sophisticated technology, modern behavior, and advanced cognitive abilities within the framework of the early Paleolithic, pushing the chronology of such phenomena hundreds of thousands of years back in time.

The cross may take either of two forms; the wings may be equally spaced around the cross-section of the fuselage, lying in two planes at right angles, as on a typical missile, or they may lie together in a single horizontal plane about a vertical axis, as in the cruciform rotor wing or X-wing. Cruciform- wing missile A Canadair CL-89 shows its cruciform wing Rocket- and jet- propelled missiles often have a cruciform thin-wing arrangement in which four identical thin, low aspect ratio wings are equally spaced around a long, slender body.Farmer (1956) Cruciform wing missiles are sometimes called Cruciform wing weapons (CWW) in contrast to planar wing weapons (PWW). For wings of equal size and shape, this gives constant aerodynamic characteristics whatever the aircraft's angle of roll or direction of turn. However, because only half the total lift of the four surfaces is available in any given attitude, the configuration is less efficient than a conventional planar wing. The missile may also have small cruciform canard foreplane surfaces for flight trim and/or control. These may be set at 45¬∞ to the main wing, in order to minimise interference. The aerodynamic properties of such a slender wing-plus- body configuration are different from those of the individual elements and the design needs to be evaluated as a unified form. A characteristic of the off- axis side forces is that they are relatively independent of the angle of pitch or yaw.Spreiter (1950): \\"The lift and pitching moment are independent of the angle of yaw, and the side force and yawing moment are independent of the angle of attack. If the vertical and horizontal wings are identical, the rolling moment is zero for all angles of pitch and yaw. By symmetry considerations, these results are shown to be equally applicable for any cruciform-wing and body combination having identical horizontal and vertical wings of arbitrary plan form and aspect ratio.\\" Cruciform rotor wing Sikorsky S-72 modified as the X-Wing testbed. It never flew. The horizontal cruciform rotor wing, also known as the X-wing, is a form of the Stopped rotor.Eisenberg, Joseph D.; \\"The Selection of Convertible Engines With Current Gas Generator Technology for High Speed Rotorcraft\\", Technical Memorandum 103774, NASA, 1990, p.3 :\\"Figure 4 shows the X-wing concept. This aircraft uses its rotor for vertical lift and low speed cruise. The rotor is then stopped to form a cruciform wing, and auxiliary propulsion is applied,\\" and, \\"Figure 4. X-Wing Stopped-Rotor Aircraft\\". Teledyne Ryan studied the concept in the 1970s and took out a number of patents.Girard, Peter F. (Teledyne Ryan); \\"VTOL aircraft with cruciform rotor wing\\", US Patent 3792827, filed 1972, issued 1974.Girard, Peter F. (Teledyne Ryan); \\"Aircraft with retractable rotor wing\\", US Patent 3986686: \\"Cruciform rotor wing\\", filed 1975, issued 1976. The X-Wing circulation control rotor was developed in the mid-1970s under DARPA funding. The concept was first developed by the David W. Taylor Naval Ship Research and Development Center and an experimental rotor built by Lockheed Corporation, for testing on the Sikorsky S-72 Rotor Systems Research Aircraft (RSRA). Intended to take off vertically like a helicopter, the rigid rotor could be stopped in mid-flight to act as an X-shape cruciform wing providing lift during forward flight, assisting the RSRA's conventional fixed wings. Instead of controlling lift by altering the angle of attack of its blades as more conventional helicopters do, the craft used compressed air fed from the engines and expelled from its blades to generate a virtual wing surface, similar to blown flaps on a conventional platform. Computerized valves made sure the compressed air came from the correct edge of the rotor, the correct edge changing as the rotor rotated. In late 1983 Sikorsky received a contract to modify the S-72 RSRA as a demonstration testbed for the X-Wing rotor and it was rolled out in 1986. The program was cancelled two years later, after the X-wing had been installed but before it had flown.Art Linden, Ken Rosen and Andy White; \\"X-Wing\\", Sikorsky Product History, 2013. (retrieved 5 August 2018) Other proposed applications =Solar-powered aircraft= Around 1980 NASA was studying the technical aspects of long-duration solar- powered UAVs. One configuration studied was a very-high-aspect-ratio cruciform fixed wing with solar panels mounted along one plane of the wing. The craft was able to roll at any angle to follow the sun, thus maximising the power available without loss of lift.Phillips, W. H.; \\"Solar-powered aircraft\\"; Document Type: NASA Technical Brief LAR-12615, 1981.Phillips, W. H.; \\"Solar- powered aircraft\\"; US patent 4,415,133, Filed 1981, Issued 1983. =Variable geometries= Bi-directional flying wing, plan view Shortly after World War Two, the French company Matra began studies of a variable-geometry aircraft in which two sets of wings were provided, one for low-speed takeoff and landing, and the other for high-speed flight. Long-span wings for low speed flight were set at right angles to short-span wings for high-speed flight. One set lay horizontal for use as the lifting wings, while the other was set vertical. The supporting fuselage section could be rotated 90¬∞ to swap them over, and the unused set of wings could be folded backwards and partially or wholly retracted into the fuselage. It was patented by Matra's chief designer, Robert Roger, in 1946.Robert, Roger Aime√©; \\"Improvements in or Relating to Aircraft\\", UK Patent 11006/47, accepted 1949. The bi-directional wing is a similar approach to the same problem. It comprises a long-span low speed wing and a short-span high speed wing joined in the form of an unequal cross. The craft would take off and land with the low-speed wing across the airflow, then rotate it a quarter-turn so that the high-speed wing faces the airflow for supersonic travel. It has been studied in the form of a bi-directional flying wing.Zha, Im & Espinal, Toward Zero Sonic-Boom and High Efficiency Supersonic Flight: A Novel Concept of Supersonic Bi-Directional Flying WingNIAC 2012 Phase I & Phase II Awards Announcement References =Notes= =Bibliography= * Farmer, Peter J.; \\"Missile Design: The State of the Art\\", Flight, 7 December 1956, pp. 885-889. * Spreiter, John R.; \\"The Aerodynamic Forces on Slender Plane- and Cruciform-Wing and Body Combinations\\", Report 962, NACA, 1950.

Early life and education Maud Aiken was born Mary Davin on 13 August 1898 in Dublin. She was the youngest of two daughters of grocer and alderman John J. Davin and Mary Davin (n√©e O'Gara). She entered the Royal Irish Academy of Music in 1914, and was awarded the Coulson scholarship in the same year. In 1915 she received the Coulson academy scholarship, and the Vandeleur academy scholarship for violin in 1916. From 1917 to 1922 she studied in Royal Academy of Music, London, becoming the sub- professor of violin in 1920. During this time she also won a number of medals, graduated LRAM in 1921 and was elected ARAM in 1931 having been appointed the Academy's honorary local representative in Dublin. Career Aiken studied at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, winning four gold medals, leading the orchestra under Sir Alexander Mackenzie, and at the Conservatoire de Paris. She played the viola as an early member of the 2RN orchestra. In 1930 she was appointed the director of the Municipal School of Music, Dublin, holding this office until her marriage to Frank Aiken in 1934. During her time as director she was credited for her organisational skill, and oversaw an expansion of the curriculum and an increased appreciation of Irish music. She became a member of the board of governors of the Royal Irish Academy of Music in 1939 in her capacity as a representative of Dublin corporation. From 1950 to 1978 she was the vice-president of the Academy, being awarded a fellowship in 1961. Aiken sat as chair of the board for 20 years, encouraging broadening of Academy activities, promoting high standards, presiding over an increase in student numbers, and improvement in finances. In 1972 an Academy junior piano scholarship was renamed \\"the Maud Aiken exhibition\\". Aiken sat as the vice- president of the Feis Ceoil Association from 1963-1967 and then the president from 1971-1978. She also sat on the Wexford Festival Opera council. Aiken was conferred with the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1971. Death Aiken died on 10 July 1978 in a car crash, and was buried in Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin. She was survived by her husband, one daughter, Aedamar, and two sons, Proinnsias, and Lochlann.

Background The commander of British forces in Scotland, Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, was confident that there was no chance of friendly forces being surprised, even though a man who had recently escaped from Jacobite captivity reported that the Jacobites were planning on attacking the outposts held by the Campbells that were covering Blair Atholl and Castle Menzies. The Jacobite commander, Lord George Murray, collected his Atholl Brigade along with two 4-pounder cannon and marched from Inverness to Strathspey, taking the surrender of Castle Grant on 14 March. Murray left the castle garrisoned by 100 men and in Ruthven, Badenoch he was joined by Archibald Menzies of Struan and Ewen MacPherson of Cluny with 300 Macphersons, bringing his total force to the number of 700 men. The Atholl raids The Jacobite troops were divided into thirty companies or detachments, consisting of both Atholl men and MacPhersons and were each assigned a particular target. The Jacobite force strode across 30 miles of hills to come within reach of their objectives, taking the Pass of Killiecrankie. The post at Bun Rannoch was then taken which was being held by the Loudon's 64th Highlanders and much to the embarrassment of that unit's commander, Colin Campbell of Glenure, as he was not present when the Jacobite attack went in. He claimed that at the time he was at Castle Menzies trying to obtain food for his men. His militia men at Bun Rannoch had been drinking when they were surrounded at 11pm on 16 March by the Jacobites. The first sentry fired his musket but to no effect and was surrounded. The next post to the east was Kynachan House which guarded an important bridge over the River Tummel, but again the sentry was surrounded and this time killed. The Campbell men inside the house did for some time stand firing out of slits of the building, but an opening was made in the roof above them and so they were obliged to surrender. At these two posts the garrison lost two men killed, including one officer, and eight or ten wounded. In all a dozen militia outposts had been taken by the Jacobites, and 300 government troops were taken prisoner. Aftermath All of the objectives had been taken including those of the regular soldiers who were closest to Blair Castle. All of the government schemes to reinforce the outposts came to nothing and the Jacobite general, Lord George Murray, was then able to lay siege to Blair Castle for two weeks. The Atholl raids proved Murray's contention that guerrilla warfare tactics were the best option, but left the Jacobite army spread out over the Scottish Highlands with few troops to prevent the Duke of Cumberland marching on Inverness. Colin Campbell of Glenure whose men were defeated at the raid on Bun Rannoch was later murdered in what is now known as the Appin Murder on 14 May 1752. Bagpipers According to historian John Buchan, the Jacobites had as many as twenty bagpipers with them when they carried out the Atholl raids.

These findings can often lead to a diagnostic dilemma, as the CT reflects the nonspecific appearances. Ultrasound (US) examination has a superior spatial resolution and is considered the modality of choice for thyroid evaluation. Nevertheless, CT detects incidental thyroid nodules (ITNs) and plays an important role in the evaluation of thyroid cancer. In this pictorial review covers a wide spectrum of common and uncommon, incidental and non-incidental thyroid findings from CT scans. It will also include the most common incidental thyroid findings. In addition, the role of imaging in the assessment of thyroid carcinoma (before and after treatment) and preoperative thyroid goiter is explored, as well as localization of ectopic and congenital thyroid tissue. Thyroid ultrasonography is the modality of choice for thyroid evaluation.Originally copied from: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License Yet, focal and diffuse thyroid abnormalities are commonly encountered during the interpretation of computed tomography (CT) exams performed for various clinical purposes. For example, CT often detects incidental thyroid nodules (ITNs). It plays an important role in the evaluation of thyroid cancer. Introduction Thyroid disorders are common and include many entities. They can be symptomatic, asymptomatic, diffuse, focal, neoplastic, or non-neoplastic processes. Neck ultrasound (US), with the prospect of proceeding to fine needle aspiration (FNA), is the first line of investigation; however, other options are available. Thyroid Uptake Scans using Tc-99 m or I-123 are typically reserved for specific clinical scenarios. Cross-sectional imaging including computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detect incidental thyroid nodules (ITNs) and can be used in the evaluation of thyroid cancers and goiter. The aim of this article is to provide a pictorial review of a broad spectrum of incidental and non- incidental thyroid findings on CT scans. CT scans of the thyroid: normal anatomy and imaging techniques The thyroid gland is a vascular, encapsulated structure made up of right and left lobes, which are connected at the midline by the isthmus. Each lobe is about 2 cm thick, 3 cm wide, and 5 cm long. The thyroid apex is located superiorly at the level of the mid-thyroid cartilage. The inferior margin of the gland is at the level of the fifth or sixth tracheal ring. The thyroid gland is encapsulated by the middle layer of deep cervical fascia and is part of the visceral space in the infrahyoid neck. It wraps around the trachea and is separated from the oesophagus by the tracheoesophageal groove on each side, which houses the recurrent laryngeal nerves. The thyroid has variable lymphatic drainage to the internal jugular chain, para-tracheal region, mediastinum, and retropharyngeal area. It has homogeneous high attenuation values on a CT scan, as compared to adjacent muscles, due to its high iodine concentration. It shows avid iodine contrast enhancement due to its hypervascularity. Multi-detector volumetric acquisition from the skull base to the tracheal bifurcation is usually obtained. Multiplanar 2-mm axial, coronal, and sagittal images are typically available. Examination can be acquired with or without administration of intravenous (IV) iodinated contrast. Incidental thyroid findings on CT scan The thyroid gland can have variable CT scan findings, such as calcifications, single or multiple nodules, cysts, or diffuse enlargement. Thyroid calcifications on a CT scan can be seen in both benign and malignant thyroid lesions. Sonographic examination of the thyroid can differentiate between micro-calcifications, which are highly associated with papillary thyroid carcinoma, and eggshell calcifications, which favour a benign process such as colloid cysts (Figs. 1 and and2)2). In a retrospective review of preoperative CT scan, 35 % (135 of 383) of the patients had detectable intra-thyroidal calcifications. Among them, 48 % had a histopathologically proven thyroid cancer. Calcified nodules had a significantly higher incidence of thyroid cancer and lymph node metastases. The incidence of thyroid cancer among nodules with different calcifications patterns were 79 % of nodules with multiple punctate calcifications, 58 % of nodules with a single punctate calcification, 21 % of nodules with coarse calcification, and 22 % of nodules with peripheral calcification. Most of the single calcified nodules were malignant. However, this did not include patients with ITNs and the sample is skewed towards malignancy. Another study evaluated the presence of ITNs on CT scans and found that 12 % of thyroid nodules were calcified, with no significant correlation between malignant or potentially malignant histology and punctate calcifications. As a result, some researchers believe that calcification per se is not a suspicious CT sign, and have suggested that calcified thyroid nodules on CT scans should be treated the same as non-calcified nodules. Fig. 1. An incidentally discovered colloid nodule with calcification, shown on CT scan of a 58-year-old female patient. a Non-enhanced axial CT scan of the neck demonstrates a coarse calcification at the left thyroid inferior pole. b Sagittal grey scale ultrasound of the thyroid demonstrates a heterogeneous nodule with predominant cystic component. Calcification was not seen in the ultrasound, probably due to its lower location in the superior mediastinum. Fig. 2. A 51-year-old female patient post left hemi-thyroidectomy, with incidentally discovered right thyroid colloid nodule on CT scan. an Enhanced axial CT scan of the neck demonstrates a well-defined, hypodense right thyroid nodule (white arrow) with no internal calcifications or cervical lymphadenopathy. b Transverse greyscale thyroid ultrasound demonstrates a well-defined, hypoechoic right thyroid lobe nodule with a central echogenicity including comet tail (ring down) artefacts (white arrow). No vascularity (not shown) or calcifications were detected. Thyroid cystic changes are variable, ranging from simple cysts with a thin wall to complex cysts with septations and solid components. An adenoma may undergo cystic degeneration. It is important to note that papillary carcinoma may mimic a benign-looking cyst. Simple serous cysts appear with fluid density on a CT scan, whereas a cyst with haemorrhage or high thyroglobulin content is iso-dense to muscle. Thyroid nodules that are detected by an imaging study but have not been previously detected or suspected clinically are considered to be ITNs. ITNs are one of the most common incidental findings on neck imaging. ITNs are reported in up to 25 % of chest CT scans, and in 16‚Äì18 % of cervical region cross-sectional imaging, including CT and MRI scans. The rate of malignancy in the detected ITNs on CT and MRI scans varies from 0 % to 11 %. Incidentally detected thyroid carcinomas are more likely to be papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) (Fig. 3). Incidentally detected cancers tend to be smaller in size and less likely to have distant metastasis, as compared to clinically suspected thyroid cancers. Fig. 3. An incidental PTC in a 62-year-old male patient with lymphoma. a, b Enhanced axial CT scan and fused PET/CT scan of the neck demonstrate a well-defined, hypodense right thyroid nodule (white arrow) with high FDG uptake. The FDG-avid uptake in the left side (circle) is related to patient's known lymphoma, which resolved after treatment. c, d Transverse greyscale and sagittal colour Doppler ultrasound of the neck demonstrate a right thyroid irregular hypoechoic lesion with some micro-calcifications (white arrows) and increased vascularity. On CT scans, a malignant lesion is suspected when the margins are ill-defined and there is extra-thyroid extension, lymph node involvement, or invasion of the surrounding structures. The absence of these features does not exclude malignant tumours, especially papillary, follicular, and medullary thyroid carcinomas (Fig. 3). Therefore, ultrasound is the modality of choice for thyroid lesion evaluation, due to its superior spatial resolution compared to CT examinations. Sonographic features of malignancy are micro-calcifications, acoustic shadowing, anti-parallel orientation, marked hypoechogenicity, irregular or microlobulated margins, and increased vascularity. CT scans lack the ability to detect these reliable sonographic signs of malignancy. Therefore, further management of ITNs, if required, usually begins with thyroid ultrasound and FNA should be considered according to the ultrasound findings. The American College of Radiology (ACR) flowchart and recommendations for ITNs detected by CT or MRI offer general guidance and are not applicable to all patients. The recommendations are primarily based on the presence or absence of suspicious features, nodule size, patient's age, patient's life expectancy, and patient's comorbidities. Suspicious features that can be detected on CT scans include signs of local invasion and abnormal lymph nodes. Abnormal lymph nodes may show cystic components, calcifications, and/or increased enhancement. Mere nodal enlargement is less specific for thyroid cancer metastasis; however, further evaluation should be considered if the ITN has ipsilateral jugulo-digastric lymph nodes > 1.5 cm on the short axis or > 1 cm for other groups. Cervical Level IV and VI lymphadenopathies raise a higher suspicion of thyroid carcinoma metastasis. Almost all patients with ITNs and suspicious imaging features should be evaluated with a neck ultrasound. Patients with comorbidities or limited life expectancy without suspicious features should not undergo further evaluation. Nevertheless, further workup might be necessary for such individuals if it is clinically warranted, or specifically requested by the referring physician or the patient. In patients with ITNs, it is important to inquire about pertinent historical factors predicting malignancy. These factors include history of childhood or adolescent head and neck or total body radiation exposure, and familial thyroid carcinoma or thyroid cancer syndrome. Syndromes associated with thyroid cancer include multiple endocrine neoplasia 2, familial adenomatous polyposis, Carney complex, Cowden's disease, and Werner syndrome/progeria. If a patient has a first-degree relative with such a syndrome, screening based on the various components of that syndrome is advised. Nevertheless, there are no guidelines specifically addressing ITNs detected on CT scans in patients at risk of thyroid cancer. Therefore, in the absence of suspicious features on the CT scan, other criteria such as nodule size on the CT scan, patient age, and levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) are important in guiding management in such a patient population. Although the correlation between thyroid nodule size and malignancy risk is limited, nodule size affects prognosis in malignant nodules. Small thyroid cancers (less than 2 cm) tend to have an indolent course, with favourable prognosis even if not treated. Less than 7 % of the imaging-detected ITNs are seen in younger populations. However, Shetty et al. found a higher rate of malignancy in the ITNs detected on CT scans among patients younger than 35 years. Ito et al. found a higher tumour progression risk among young patients (<40 years) with subclinical, low-risk PTCs who undergo observation rather than surgery. Therefore, nodule size and patient age should determine the need for workup in the general population without suspicious imaging features and with normal life expectancy. Further evaluation with ultrasound is required for patients less than 35 years old with nodules measuring more than 1 cm in the axial plane. The cutoff size for further evaluation is raised to 1.5 cm for patients more than 35 years old. This recommendation should be applied to the largest thyroid nodule in cases of multiple thyroid nodules. Incidentally discovered heterogeneous and enlarged thyroid glands should undergo dedicated ultrasound if the patient has no limited life expectancy or serious comorbidities. Thyroid cancers =Epidemiology= Primary thyroid carcinomas include papillary, follicular, medullary, and anaplastic carcinomas. Lymphoma and metastasis of other primary malignancies to the thyroid gland represent a minority of thyroid carcinomas. Differentiated thyroid carcinomas (DTCs) originate from follicular epithelial cells and encompass PTCs and follicular thyroid carcinomas, including the Hurthle cell variant of follicular carcinoma. DTCs have an excellent prognosis and fortunately represent the majority of thyroid carcinomas. PTCs and follicular thyroid carcinomas represent 88 % and 8 %, respectively, of all thyroid malignancies. Medullary thyroid carcinoma arises from neuroendocrine C-cells and has a good prognosis. Anaplastic carcinoma is an aggressive undifferentiated tumour that usually affects the elderly and tends to have a worse prognosis. =Role of imaging= Fig. 5. A poorly differentiated invasive left thyroid mass in a 58-year-old female patient. a Sagittal greyscale neck ultrasound shows a large hypoechoic lesion with macro-calcification and micro-calcification. b Sagittal colour Doppler ultrasound shows left internal jugular vein filling defect with detected internal vascularity suggestive of tumour thrombus. c Enhanced axial and coronal CT scans of the neck show heterogeneously enhancing large lesion replacing the left thyroid lobe and extending to the isthmus and the medial aspect of the right thyroid lobe (white arrow). The mass and the conglomerate lymph nodes measure 12.5 √ó 7 √ó 5.8 cm (white arrows). d, e Axial enhanced CT scans show enlarged left cervical nodes (white arrow) and left internal jugular vein (IJV) thrombus (black arrows). Note the IJV distention and central enhancing portion in the upper cut (black arrow in e) concerning the tumour thrombus. f, g Enhanced axial CT scan of the upper chest demonstrate a mass extension into the retrosternal area, left tracheoesophageal groove, and posterior to the trachea (white arrows in f). There are multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules (white arrows in g). Surgery is the primary mode of treatment for DTCs. Post total thyroidectomy radioactive iodine (RAI) ablation is an option, especially in patients with distant metastasis, tumours larger than 4 cm, or extra-thyroidal disease extension. Ultrasound examination is usually adequate in evaluating primary tumours and cervical lymph nodes. Preoperative cross-sectional imaging with CT or MRI is indicated if there is a concern for local invasion that may alter the patient's staging as well as surgical approach (Figs. 4, 55 and 6)6) . Some thyroid primaries may be small, diffuse, or multifocal and therefore may be occult on imaging (Fig. 4) . In patients with known thyroid malignancies, a non-enhanced exam is preferred due to the possible undesired interference of free iodide contrast medium with thyroid iodide I-131 uptake for 6‚Äì8 weeks or more. This would adversely affect the management of these patients by delaying diagnostic thyroid scintigraphy and radioiodine ablation in patients with DTCs for 2‚Äì6 months. The radiologist must evaluate the central structures draping the thyroid gland including the trachea, oesophagus, larynx, and pharynx, as well as the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Invasion is suspected if the thyroid mass abuts the airway or oesophagus for more than 180 degrees. Luminal deformity, mucosal thickening, and mucosal focal irregularity are more specific indicators of invasion. Obliteration of the fat planes of the tracheoesophageal groove in three axial images and signs of vocal cord paralysis are indicative of recurrent laryngeal nerve invasion. Invasion of these central structures meets the criteria for T4a disease (Figs. 5 and and6)6). Arterial invasion constitutes T4b disease, which may preclude curative surgery. More than 180 degrees of arterial encasement is suggestive of invasion, however, arterial deformity or narrowing is much more suspicious for invasion. The carotid artery is the most commonly involved artery; however, the mediastinal vessels should also be examined. Encasement of the carotid artery or mediastinal vessels for more than 270 degrees is unlikely to be resectable. On the other hand, occlusion or effacement of the internal jugular vein can occur without invasion and does not influence surgical resectability or staging. Asymmetry of the strap muscle and the tumour abutting its external surface are signs of invasion. However, invasion of the pre-vertebral musculature is more challenging, as a large lesion can compress the muscle without invasion (Figs. 5 and and6)6). File:US of visually normal thyroid, but CT of mediastinal metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma.jpgFig. 4. A 45-year-old male patient presented with anterior mediastinal metastatic PTC lesions and occult primary on imaging. Histopathology examination of the resected thyroid gland revealed micro-foci of PTC; the largest, in the isthmus, measured 4 mm. a Transverse greyscale ultrasound of the thyroid demonstrates homogenous gland with normal echogenicity and size. No focal lesion or micro-calcifications. b Non-enhanced CT scan obtained as part of PET/CT examination shows a heterogeneous, large, relatively dense anterior mediastinal mass (white arrow) with peripheral calcification (arrowheads). Thyroid gland has normal CT appearance with no abnormal FDG uptake (not shown). File:CT of locally progressive papillary thyroid carcinoma.jpgFig. 6. A 61-year-old female patient with locally aggressive PTC. an Enhanced axial CT scan of the neck demonstrates a heterogeneous infiltrative thyroid mass. This mass diffusely involves the entire gland and circumferentially encases the trachea with involvement of bilateral tracheoesophageal grooves (white arrows). b, c Additional axial cranial images show right cricoid cartilage destruction (black arrows in b), right thyroid cartilage destruction (black arrow in c), right vocal cord paralysis (white arrows in b), and bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy (arrowheads). Finally, the possibility of metastatic disease should be excluded. PTCs and medullary thyroid carcinomas tend to metastasize to regional lymph nodes. According to the AJCC/UICC TNM staging system, the nodal stage is classified by site: N1a indicates level VI nodal involvement, including paratracheal nodes; N1b indicates unilateral or bilateral lateral cervical nodal disease or superior mediastinal nodal disease (Figs. 4, 55 and and6)6). The incidence of hematogenous spread of follicular carcinomas is 21‚Äì33 % and that of PTCs is 2‚Äì14 %. In medullary thyroid cancer and anaplastic thyroid cancer, distant metastasis was reported in 25 % and 40 % of patients, respectively. Distant metastases from DTCs tend to have a more favourable prognosis. Distant metastatic disease may appear years after the initial presentation. Therefore, imaging for distant metastases is usually done pre- operatively for anaplastic thyroid cancer and post-operatively for DTCs. DTC distant metastases sites include the lung (50 %), bone (25 %), lung and bone (20 %), followed by other sites (5 %). =Recurrence= The thyroid cancer recurrence rate is reported to range from 7 % to 14 %. Recurrence is usually detected within the first decade after initial disease diagnosis. Large lymph node metastasis is considered the strongest predictor for thyroid cancer recurrence. Post-treatment surveillance for recurrent disease depends on cancer type and staging. Patients with DTC are usually treated with total thyroidectomy and RAI ablation. Patients should have baseline neck US evaluation at 6‚Äì12 months after the RAI ablation and then periodically, depending on the patient's risk for recurrent disease and thyroglobulin (Tg) status. After the first post-operative RAI ablation, further RAI imaging is not necessary if the patient has normal neck US, undetectable Tg level under TSH stimulation, and negative antithyroglobulin (TgAb). Annual neck US with or without FNA, along with measurement of serum Tg and serum TgAb, is usually sufficient for post-treatment surveillance in those patients. Moreover, annual US is appropriate in patients with medullary cancer and normal calcitonin levels. The likelihood of positive anatomic imaging is greater when serum Tg is >10 ng/mL. A diagnostic CT scan adds additional value to neck US in detecting central compartment macro-metastases in the mediastinum and retro- tracheal area. According to the recent American Thyroid Association guidelines, an upper chest and neck CT scan with IV contrast should be obtained when: 1) neck US is inadequate in visualizing possible local nodal disease (high Tg, negative neck US, and RAI imaging); 2) US is not able to delineate the disease completely, as in the case of bulky recurrent nodal disease; or 3) evaluation of possible recurrent invasive disease is needed (Figs. 7, 88 and and9).9). CT scans are also the most sensitive diagnostic tool for the detection of pulmonary micro-metastases. Many of the neck US features that are considered as suggestive signs of disease recurrence are also applicable to CT examination. These signs might include sizable rounded nodules in the thyroid bed, fine calcifications, or cystic change.

A 51-year-old female patient post total thyroidectomy for PTC with elevated thyroglobulin measurement. an Axial non-enhanced CT scan of the neck at the level of the thyroid bed demonstrates a well-defined, rounded, homogenously dense soft tissue situated between the trachea and left internal jugular vein (white arrow). b Transverse ultrasound image of the neck demonstrates a well- defined, homogenous, hypoechoic soft tissue nodule measuring 6 mm (white arrow) with no detected micro-calcifications.

The lesion exerts a mass effect on the oesophagus (black arrow) and is inseparable from the trachea.

A 58-year-old male patient with persistence PTC at thyroid bed with hypervascular nodal metastasis. a‚Äìc Transverse greyscale and colour Doppler neck ultrasound demonstrate hypoehoic soft tissue in the left thyroid bed (white arrow in a). There are a heterogeneous enlarged lymph nodes at level 2 and 3 with markedly increased vascularity (white arrow in b and c). d‚Äìf Enhanced axial CT images of the neck demonstrate a 2.7 √ó 1.4 cm hypodense soft tissue lesion anterior to the left carotid sheath (white arrow). There are left-sided enhancing abnormal and enlarged lymph nodes at cervical level 2 and 3 (black arrows). In cases of elevated thyroglobulin with negative neck US and iodine whole body scintigraphy (WBS), fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) is the next modality of choice. Dedifferentiated thyroid carcinoma usually has avid FDG-PET uptake and a negative radioiodine scan, typically does not respond to RAI therapy, and has a poorer prognosis. There is not yet consensus in the research literature on whether cross-sectional imaging (CT or MRI) or an 18FDG-PET/CT scan should be performed as the first-line imaging modality for such patients. Enhanced CT scan was thought to be more sensitive for detection of lymph node metastases. Nonetheless, scans using modern PET/CT equipment are as reliable as a proper routine staging CT scan. Many lesions can be found on 18FDG-PET/CT scanning despite the lack of IV contrast injection. However, differentiation between local recurrence versus lymph node metastases and detection of direct involvement of the aerodigestive axis or vascular structures are not technically possible in the absence of IV contrast administration. For these reasons, 18FDG-PET/CT utilizing contrast administration should be considered for most patients with extensive disease. Metastasis to the thyroid Metastasis to the thyroid is rare and represents 5.5 % of biopsied thyroid malignancies. It is commonly found with cancers originating from the breast, renal cell, lung, melanoma, and colon. Direct invasion from adjacent structures such as the pharynx, larynx, trachea, or oesophagus has been reported (Fig. 10). Metastatic disease has a non-specific appearance. Fig. 10. Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of unknown origin in a 42-year-old female patient. a, b Axial and coronal enhanced neck CT scan demonstrates infiltrative hypodense left thyroid lobe lesions (white arrows). There are multiple necrotic cervical nodal metastases (white block arrows). Presence of ITNs in patients with another known malignancy is a common clinical problem with controversial management guidelines. Wilhelm et al. followed 41 patients with a known extra-thyroid malignancy and ITNs; 35 of them met the criterion for biopsy (nodule ‚â• 1 cm). Pathology revealed four papillary thyroid cancers and five micropapillary thyroid cancers. Only two metastatic cancers were detected. Clinical history (history of radiation, age, endocrine syndromes), TSH, nodule size, and sonographic features are important to determine which nodule(s) should be followed or biopsied. However, existing guidelines do not specifically address how to approach ITNs detected on CT scans in such a specific patient population. Thyroid lymphoma Thyroid lymphoma represents about 5 % of thyroid malignancies. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is the most common type and can be secondary to generalized lymphoma or a primary tumour. Primary thyroid lymphoma usually pre-exists with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. On CT scans with and without contrast, lymphomas tend to have low attenuation values. Thyroid lymphomas have variable appearance and mostly manifest as a solitary mass (80 %). They may also manifest as multiple nodules (15 % to 20 %) or as a bulky mass replacing the entire gland with extra-thyroid extension (Figs. 11 and and12).12). The presence of cervical lymphadenopathy supports such a diagnosis. Although it is uncommon, tumour necrosis has been reported. File:Thyroid CT with non-Hodgkin‚Äôs large B-cell lymphoma.jpgFig. 11.

It is encasing the right carotid artery (short white arrow) and displacing of the trachea and oesophagus to the left side. Goiter A goiter is an abnormal thyroid gland proliferation that manifests as multi-nodular, uni-nodular, or non-nodular diffuse glandular enlargement. A goiter is formed of solid matrix, colloid cysts, blood products, calcification, and fibrosis, and this heterogeneity may lead to variable appearances on a CT scan (Figs. 13, 1414 and and15)15). US is more sensitive in evaluating thyroid nodules within a goiter; however, a symptomatic goiter may require surgical treatment with total thyroidectomy, and in this case CT plays an additional role in preoperative evaluation. Specific aspects for examination on a CT scan during the preoperative evaluation for goiter include extension, mass effect, and suspicious features of malignancy. File:CT of goiter.jpgFig. 13. A 27-year- old female patient known to have goiter. a, b Axial and sagittal enhanced CT scan images of the neck demonstrate a heterogeneously enhancing, enlarged thyroid gland with scattered calcifications (white arrow), cystic changes, and substantial retro-sternal extension (black asterisks). No lymphadenopathy or substantial airway narrowing. File:Ultrasound and CT of Hashimoto‚Äôs thyroiditis.jpgFig. 14. A 19-year-old male patient known to have multi- nodular goiter and FNA, showing underlying Hashimoto's thyroiditis. a, b Sagittal and transverse greyscale and colour Doppler ultrasound of the neck demonstrate a hypoechoic enlarged right thyroid lobe with small hyperechoic regenerative nodules and marked hypervascularity (white arrows). c, d Enhanced axial CT scan images of the neck demonstrate a heterogeneously enhancing and enlarged thyroid gland, left more than right lobe, and the trachea is markedly narrowed. File:CT and ultrasonography of Hashimoto‚Äôs thyroiditis.jpgFig. 15. A 33-year-old female patient who presented with neck swelling and pain and was later diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. an Axial enhanced CT scan of the neck demonstrates minimal diffuse enlargement of the thyroid gland, especially the isthmus (white arrow). b Transverse greyscale ultrasound of the neck demonstrates heterogeneously enlarged thyroid and thickened isthmus, measuring 8.6 mm. Malignancy can coexist within the goiter and a CT scan may give a clue if there are abnormal cervical lymph nodes and/or signs of invasion. Retrosternal extension (Fig. 15) could affect the surgical approach, as a lower extent may require a partial or total sternotomy to facilitate complete resection. Therefore, the distance of the retrosternal extent from the sternal notch should be measured on a sagittal image. The interpreting radiologist should describe the mass effect, detailing its degree and direction of displacement of central structures, including the trachea, oesophagus, larynx, and pharynx. Attention should be directed to the upper extent of the goiter and structures immediately surrounding the thyroid gland, including the neuro- vascular structures, retropharyngeal space, and pre-vertebral space. The reporting radiologist should evaluate the vocal cords for symmetry and signs of vocal cord palsy. Inflammatory lesions Inflammatory thyroid disorders include acute infectious thyroiditis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Riedel's thyroiditis, and granulomatous thyroiditis (de Quervain's). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is associated with an increased risk of lymphoma and papillary thyroid carcinoma. The CT scan findings of thyroiditis are nonspecific and variable (Figs. 14, 1515 and and16)16). The thyroid gland has a very high iodine concentration, resulting in high CT attenuation (80‚Äì100 Hounsfield Units). The presence of thyroiditis can be suggested by a diffusely enlarged and hypo-attenuating (around 45 Hounsfield Units) thyroid gland. This is probably due to follicular cell destruction and reduced thyroid iodine concentration. Marked homogenous enhancement is typically expected. Therefore, moderate thyroid enhancement in a case of thyroiditis suggests a diffuse inflammatory process. It is essential to clinically correlate this with a thyroid function test and serum autoantibody levels. Fig. 16. Midline ectopic thyroid with Hashimoto's thyroiditis in a 49-year-old female patient. a Transverse greyscale ultrasound shows a 1.6 √ó 0.8 cm solid, well-defined, heterogeneous area (white arrow) in the midline, superior to the thyroid gland. It is iso-echogenic to the thyroid gland with no definite connection to the thyroid gland. b Transverse colour Doppler ultrasound shows significant increase in vascularity. c Axial enhanced neck CT scan at the level of thyroid cartilage demonstrates midline infrahyoid hyperdense soft tissue mass (white arrow) embedded within the strap muscle. Ectopic tissue/gland During embryogenesis, the bi-lobed thyroid migrates inferiorly from the foramen cecum of the tongue to the lower neck. Initially, the thyroid primordium passes anterior to the primordial hyoid bone, before it loops posteriorly and inferiorly to the hyoid bone. Then it continues its descent into the infra- hyoid portion of the neck, anterior to the trachea, thyroid cartilage, and thyroid membrane. Any thyroid residual along the descent course may lead to the development of ectopic thyroid glands. Thyroid carcinomas, thyroiditis, and goiter may develop within any ectopic thyroid tissue. Thyroid scanning with technetium-99 m (Tc99m) plays an important role in detecting orthotopic and ectopic thyroid tissue. Both CT scans and US can help detect ectopic tissue when a lesion demonstrates imaging and enhancement characteristics of thyroid tissue. The absence of normally sited thyroid gland in US and CT scans also supports the diagnosis. In addition, US can guide FNA for cytological confirmation of a thyroid lesion. Ectopic thyroid tissue appears as a well- circumscribed, homogeneous, highly attenuating mass relative to adjacent muscles. Normally, it enhances avidly following the administration of iodinated contrast. Ectopic thyroid tissue may be detected in the tongue near the foramen cecum (90 %) and along the midline between the thyroid isthmus and posterior tongue, lateral neck, mediastinum, and oral cavity. The most frequent location is the base of the tongue (Figs. 16, 1717 and and18).18). In 70 % of cases, the ectopic thyroid is the only functional thyroid tissue present in the body (Fig. 18). File:CT and scintigraphy of ectopic thyroid on the parotid gland.jpgFig. 17. Ectopic thyroid on the left parotid gland with a palpable left parotid mass in a 69-year-old male patient. a, b Axial and coronal enhanced neck CT scan demonstrates well-defined homogeneous enhancing mass (white arrows) within the left parotid gland with preserved surrounding fat planes. It also shows a normal thyroid in normal position in the lower neck. c Image taken 20 minutes after 5 mCi injected Tc99m-Pertechnetate shows normal thyroid uptake of tracer and physiological uptake in the salivary glands (short black arrow).

Lingular thyroid in a 33-year-old male who presented with oropharyngeal bleeding. an Axial enhanced neck CT scan at the level of mandible demonstrates a 3 √ó 3 √ó 3.4 cm round, partly well- delineated, heterogeneously enhancing lesion (white arrow). It is predominantly on the left side of the oropharynx and to some extent at the mid part of the base of the tongue. Thyroid gland was normal (not shown). b Image of the anterior face and neck taken 20 minutes after Tc99m-Pertechnetate injection shows absent thyroid radiotracer uptake in normal thyroid anatomical location (black short arrows). There is an area of increased uptake (long black arrows) corresponding to posterior tongue mass identified on CT scan. Ectopic thyroid tissue lateral to the orthotopic midline location is rare. The exact anatomical definition of this rare entity is debated in the literature. To avoid confusion, some authors define a lateral neck ectopic thyroid as any thyroid tissue superficial to the strap muscles with no midline continuity. The majority of lateral thyroid ectopia cases have been reported as lesions closely related to the strap muscles. There are few reported cases of ectopic lateral thyroid tissue in the submandibular region, jugulodigastric region, or within the parotid gland substance (Fig. 17). The origin of lateral ectopic thyroid tissue is not fully understood. Although this is controversial, some authors suggest that it might have originated from lateral thyroid anlagen (ultimobranchial bodies) that failed to fuse with the median anlage during caudal migration. A thyroglossal duct cyst (TDC) is a duct remnant between the foramen cecum and thyroid isthmus. Most TDCs are located below the hyoid bone and in the midline. The more caudal the cyst, the more likely it will be off midline within 2 cm (Fig. 19 and and20).20). On a CT scan, a TDC appears as a well-circumscribed area of fluid attenuation with thin walls. The cyst wall can become thick with an enhancing rim indicative of current or previous infection. These cysts maybe complicated by haemorrhage, infection, or malignancy. Therefore, their US and CT scan appearance may vary based on their content. Nodular enhancement within a TDC should initiate further workup to exclude malignancy (Fig. 21). US-guided FNA of these suspicious nodular areas is considered an appropriate next diagnostic step, taking into consideration the high rate of false negative results. File:Ultrasonography and CT of a thyroglossal duct cyst.jpgFig. 19. Long-standing infected thyroglossal duct cyst in a 29-year-old male patient. a Transverse greyscale ultrasound at midline, just above the level of the thyroid gland, shows an oval cystic lesion with internal echoes (white arrows) and posterior enhancement (arrowheads). b Transverse colour Doppler ultrasound shows surrounding peripheral flow (white arrow). c Axial enhanced neck CT scan at the level of the thyroid cartilage demonstrates a slightly off-midline, well-defined, homogeneous cystic lesion embedded in the left strap muscle with peripheral enhancement (white arrow).

However, the second resection showed signs of chronic inflammation, with no malignant cells. a, b Enhanced axial and sagittal neck CT scans demonstrate a unilocular cystic lesion arising from the tongue base and extending through the partially resected hyoid bone. This cystic lesion has peripheral enhancing wall, which becomes more thick over its inferior aspect associated with surrounding fat stranding at the surgical site (white arrow). There are no internal septations, nodules or masses, or calcifications. c Transverse view of power Doppler ultrasound at the submental area demonstrates cystic lesion and internal debris with no detected internal vascularity.

Intra-thyroid parathyroid adenoma Parathyroid adenoma (PA) is the most common cause of primary hyperparathyroidism. Ectopic parathyroid adenoma is rare. The third and fourth pharyngeal pouches represent the embryological origin of the parathyroid tissues, and ectopic parathyroid adenoma can ultimately develop anywhere along their migration course. In a large retrospective study of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, PA was detected in the intra-thyroid location in 0.7 % of cases. In another retrospective analysis of 202 patients with ectopic PA, intra-thyroidal location was found in 18 % of the cases. Intra-thyroid parathyroid adenomas mimic thyroid nodules in CT scans and may even show uptake on a thyroid iodine scan. Correlation with laboratory workup, including measurement of serum parathyroid hormone and calcium level, is required. In addition, the evaluating radiologist should search for radiological manifestations of hyperparathyroidism, such as osteopenia, bone resorption, and brown tumours (Fig. 22). Fig. 22. A 26-year-old male patient with elevated serum parathyroid hormones and calcium secondary to intra-thyroid parathyroid adenoma. a, b Enhanced axial and coronal CT scan of the neck demonstrate a well-defined hypodense right thyroid nodule (white arrows). c Bone window coronal CT scan shows lytic expansile lesions at the right mandible and left frontal bone (white arrows). d Transverse colour Doppler ultrasound of the neck demonstrates a well-defined, heterogonous, predominantly hypoechoic right thyroid nodule measuring 2.7 cm, with mild increased vascularity and no internal micro-calcifications (white arrow). e, f Delayed anterior planar and fused SPECT/CT parathyroid Sestamibi scan at 2 hours demonstrate persistent focal activity in the right thyroid lobe (white arrows). Note the scattered mandibular/maxillary uptakes in planar image representing the known brown tumours. In the case of inconclusive Tc99m Sestamibi and neck US imaging, FNA biopsy with FNA-iPTH (intact parathyroid hormone) measurement can provide simultaneous biochemical and cytological evidence. Elevated FNA-iPTH measurement, as compared to serum iPTH, is considered positive and diagnostic of parathyroid adenoma. Conclusion Thyroid disorders are common and tend to have non-specific appearances on CT scans. Commonly encountered findings when evaluating a CT scan of the neck include thyroid nodules, glandular enlargement, and calcifications. Management of ITNs depends on several factors including nodule size, patient's age, overall health status, and the presence or absence of suspicious features such as lymphadenopathy and/or invasion of adjacent structures. A CT scan provides additional important information regarding the local extension of cancer or presence of mass effect, and is useful in evaluating recurrent disease. Furthermore, CT examination plays a crucial role in preoperative evaluation and preoperative surgical planning for patients with symptomatic goiter.

He was considered a pioneer of cross-cultural psychology and his research focused on the cognitive aspects of attitudes, norms, roles and values in different cultures.  Education and career  Triandis was born in Patras, Greece on 16 October 1926. pp. 15 During the Second World War, he learned four foreign languages and developed his curiosity about the differences that exist between cultures. His time getting to know people across various European nations inspired him to research cultural disparities in the way people think. At age twenty, he moved to Canada where he graduated as an engineer at McGill University in 1951. Three years later, he obtained a Master's degree in Commerce from the University of Toronto. During this time, he was exposed to the work of psychology and pursued further education in this field. In 1958, he completed his doctoral education in Social Psychology at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. He was Professor Emeritus at the Psychology Department of the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign until his death in 2019. Triandis's early contributions to the field of cross-cultural psychology involved the development of several culture-sensitive measurements. He was president of several academic societies such as the International Association of Cross-Cultural Psychology (1976), the Interamerican Society of Psychology (1987-1989), the Association of Applied Psychology (1990-1994), and Division 8 and 9 of the American Psychological Association in 1977 and 1976, respectively.

Security forces suspect that La Garra heads the drug trafficking operations for the CJNG in the United States under Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes (alias \\"El Mencho\\"), the top leader of the criminal group. La Garra reportedly coordinates marijuana, cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine shipments to Los Angeles, San Jose, Atlanta, and New York City from Mexico. Unlike his counterparts, few details are known of his criminal background. In 2008, he was arrested for his alleged participation in the murder of a family of six in Jalisco. However, when those involved were charged in an indictment, La Garra was released from prison without a public explanation. His name was not mentioned in the legal proceedings. Over the years, he rose to the top of the CJNG's leadership chain. In 2016, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) identified La Garra as one of top three leading members of the CJNG. Early life and career Unlike his counterparts in the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), few official details exist of La Garra's criminal background. Mexican state authorities suspected he was involved in a 2008 murder incident case. On 25 July 2008, authorities identified La Garra as part of a gang that participated in the murder of six family members in Zapotl√°n el Grande, Jalisco. The six victims were F√©lix Bautista Lugo (aged 69); Carmen Campos C√°rdenas (aged 45); her sister, Adriana Patricia Campos C√°rdenas (aged 24); Roberto Bernardino Campos (aged 17), son of Carmen and stepson of F√©lix; and Magali and Mayra Bautista Campos (aged 8 and 7), daughters of Carmen and F√©lix. All but two of the victims (Roberto Bernardino and Carmen) had coup de gr√¢ce wounds. These two were stabbed and killed by asphyxia respectively. The family was originally from Zacatecas and San Luis Potos√≠, and had bought the house from the former Governor of Jalisco and Secretariat of Agriculture, Alberto C√°rdenas Jim√©nez. Though the family shared a last name with the politician, he claimed that they were not blood-related to him and were only long-time friends. The family had moved to the new home two months prior to the incident because one of their relatives was kidnapped. When the bodies were found, investigators concluded that the victims were killed 36 and 48 hours prior to their discovery. Investigators also located a vehicle owned by the family, and discovered that one of the victims had withdrawn a large sum of money from a bank prior to the murder. Investigators later found out that the incident started as far as 4 April, when Roberto Bernardino was kidnapped and released after the family paid a large sum of money. During that incident, one former agent of Jalisco's anti-kidnapping squad came in contact with the family. He noticed that the family was wealthy and relayed that information to a kidnapping ring he was working with. They worked together to kidnap the entire family and force them to withdraw money from their bank accounts. However, Roberto Bernardino noticed that the Jalisco official and the kidnapping group were working together and was killed. The abductors then decided to murder the rest of the family to cover up their collusion. On 1 August, La Garra and six other men were arrested for their alleged involvement in the crime. According to state officials, they stole MXN$400,000 from the family. Police officers believe this sum of money was intended to be used as ransom money by the family to pay the kidnappers for their relatives' return. Officials also seized two vehicles, multiple rounds of ammunition, two guns, and communication equipment. On 30 August 2008, a court in Jalisco formally issued seven charges for the murder. However, La Garra's name was not in any of the indictments. Authorities claimed that the case was not related to drug trafficking and was strictly a kidnapping scheme conducted by an abduction ring and an anti-kidnapping agent working for the Jalisco state government. La Garra was released from prison without any public explanation from authorities. Years after his release, La Garra's influence within the CJNG grew and he positioned himself as one of the leading members of the criminal group.  Leadership tenure  In November 2016, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) identified La Garra as one of the top three leaders of the CJNG, along with El Mencho and Abigael Gonz√°lez Valencia (alias \\"El Cuini\\"). La Garra's decision-making power and role within the CJNG is lower than El Mencho's. According to the DEA report, the CJNG was responsible for shipping wholesale amounts of methamphetamine, marijuana, cocaine, and heroin to the United States from the border crossings in Tijuana, Ciudad Ju√°rez, and Nuevo Laredo. The CJNG then used distribution centers in Los Angeles and Atlanta to move narcotics across the country. In the report, the DEA stated that La Garra's organization was the newest of the main drug trafficking groups in Mexico and had risen to prominence through aggressive territorial expansion. In Mexico, La Garra reportedly operates mainly in Jalisco, Colima, Guanajuato, Nayarit, Veracruz, Morelos, Guerrero, and Michoac√°n. At least 26 active drug-related investigations by the DEA were open that year against CJNG members, including La Garra. In addition to him, other suspected Mexican drug lords were mentioned in the report. From the Sinaloa Cartel, the DEA targeted Joaqu√≠n \\"El Chapo\\" Guzm√°n, Ismael Zambada Garc√≠a (alias \\"El Mayo\\"), and D√°maso L√≥pez N√∫nez (alias \\"El Licenciado\\"); from the Ju√°rez Cartel they targeted Jes√∫s Salas Aguayo (alias \\"El Chuy√≠n\\"), Carlos Arturo Quintana Quintana (alias \\"El 80\\"), and Julio C√©sar Olivas Torres (alias \\"El Sexto\\"); from the Gulf Cartel it targeted Jos√© Antonio Romo L√≥pez (alias \\"Don Chucho\\") and Petronilo Moreno Flores (alias \\"Panilo\\"); from Los Zetas and the Beltr√°n Leyva Cartel they targeted √ìscar Omar Trevi√±o Morales (alias \\"Z-42\\") and H√©ctor Beltr√°n Leyva (alias \\"El H\\") respectively. At least six of the eight men mentioned in the DEA reports were not wanted by the Mexican government at the time of the announcement. The DEA was looking to apprehended all these individuals, including La Garra. In a report the following the year, the DEA increased the number of active investigations against the CJNG hierarchy to 46. La Garra was listed a main CJNG member again, along as his counterparts El Mencho and El Cuini. In addition to Los Angeles and Atlanta, the DEA reported that the CJNG also had distribution centers in San Jose and New York City. Several of the previously mentioned suspected drug lords were kept in this report, but there were some additions to the release. For the Sinaloa Cartel, the DEA included Rafael Caro Quintero; in the Gulf Cartel, they added Jos√© Alfredo C√°rdenas Mart√≠nez (alias \\"El Contador\\"); for Los Zetas they included Juan Francisco Trevi√±o Ch√°vez (alias \\"El Kiko\\") and Juan Gerardo Trevi√±o Ch√°vez (alias \\"El Huevo\\"); and for the Beltr√°n Leyva Cartel they added Fausto Isidro Meza Flores (alias \\"Chapo Isidro\\"), Juan Francisco Patr√≥n S√°nchez (alias \\"H2\\"), and Jos√© Luis Ruelas Torres. Security forces suspect that La Garra is one of the leading coordinators of the CJNG in the United States. Based on his influence in the United States, investigators suspect that La Garra may not live in Mexico and may be residing in the United States, specifically California, where the CJNG has a major corridor through Tijuana. According to the DEA, Mexican nationals who work for drug trafficking groups may enter the U.S. legally or illegally, and try to blend in with the larger Mexican-American communities in the U.S. In some cases, these U.S.-based members may have family ties with suspected drug lords in Mexico, or have ties with the communities where the criminal group was originally from. Upon a successful career in Mexico, some U.S.-based members return to Mexico to work directly with the criminal group that employed them. By 2019, La Garra was listed by the DEA as not only being in charge of the CJNG's trafficking operations to the United States, but also serving as the CJNG's liaison as well.https://eldiariony.com/2019/09/18/la-garra-posible-sustituto-de-el- mencho-del-cjng-y-actual-lider-del-cartel-en-eeuu/ See also *List of fugitives from justice who disappeared *Mexican Drug War Sources =Footnotes= =References= External links *Jalisco New Generation Cartel ‚Äì InSight Crime Category:Fugitives wanted by the United States Category:Jalisco New Generation Cartel Category:Living people Category:People of the Mexican Drug War Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"Jorge Luis Mendoza C√°rdenas"},{"id":"57933138","text":"Rick Wiles (born 1953) is a far right American political commentator, non- denominational senior pastor at Flowing Streams Church in Vero Beach, Florida, and a conspiracy theorist radio host and pundit.

Wiles has said that Jews seek to obtain control of countries to kill millions of Christians, and has described Jews as \\"deceivers\\" who \\"plot, they lie, they do whatever they have to do to accomplish their political agenda.\\"  Career  Before becoming a radio host, Wiles worked as an advertising and marketing sales manager for CNN and ESPN in the early 1980's, and in 1984 joined the Christian Broadcasting Network as their first National Cable Marketing Manager. In 1995, he was hired as the Marketing Director for Trinity Broadcasting Network. He resigned from the network in September 1998. Wiles previously broadcast his radio show on WRMI (Radio Miami International), but has since adopted the internet as its sole platform, abandoning the short-wave broadcasting station. = TruNews = Wiles founded the organization later to be called TruNews in September 1998, based in Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas, as a Christian ministry. During later months, Wiles toured America where he spoke of moral decline and aimed to prevent \\"economic collapse\\" and \\"war on American soil\\". On May 24, 1999, the organisation, then named America's Hope, made its first broadcast. After five years of regular broadcasts, the news station changed its name to America Freedom News for a brief period. Wiles later changed it a second time to its current name, TruNews. It has also been known as Christian News Channel. Wiles was reported by The Colorado Independent in October 2014 to have said the spread of Ebola \\"could solve America's problems with atheism, homosexuality, sexual promiscuity, pornography and abortion\\". In late January 2020, he said the coronavirus was God's \\"death angel\\" and \\"plagues are one of the last steps of judgment.\\" TruNews is known for promoting racist and antisemitic conspiracy theories. TruNews frequently described President Barack Obama as a \\"demon from hell\\". Obama, he claimed while the former president was in office, was the \\"jihadist-in-chief\\" who was \\"waging jihad against the United States from inside the White House\\" and murdered Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia as a \\"pagan sacrifice\\". During 2017, Wiles' guests included someone who claimed President Bill Clinton is a flesh eating cannibal leading to his contraction of related diseases. Another asserted that Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom is a \\"lizard person\\" who had Diana, Princess of Wales murdered because the Princess was in the process of revealing that the Royal Family was involved in satanism. He has also asserted that Israel and the \\"Jewish mafia\\" had President John F. Kennedy assassinated. Another edition of Wiles program claimed Israel and the \\"synagogue of Satan\\" are pushing the United States to fight wars on their behalf. Wiles has asserted that the effects of Hurricane Harvey upon the city of Houston, Texas, in September 2017 resulted from Houston's \\"LGBT devotion\\"; has described Judaism and Islam as \\"the Antichrist\\"; has called Central American immigrants a \\"brown invasion\\" being used by God to punish White Americans for legal abortion; has claimed that the 2017 Las Vegas shooting was conducted by government death squads from a \\"gay/lesbian Nazi regime\\"; and, in July 2018, predicted an imminent coup (led by CNN's Anderson Cooper and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow) that would result in the nationally televised decapitation of the Trump family on the White House lawn. Wiles promoted antisemitic conspiracy theories of Jewish world domination while discussing the 2019 AIPAC conference. He said on TruNews in November 2019 that the congressional hearing concerning the impeachment of Donald Trump are \\"infested with Jews\\" and constitute a \\"Jew coup\\". He claimed: \\"That's the way the Jews work. They are deceivers.

Martinez-Ruiz's work interrogates and traces the connections between the Bakongo traditions of graphic writing prevalent in the Democratic Republic of the Congo & Angola and the Palo Monte traditions in Cuba. More broadly, Martinez-Ruiz's research challenges the disciplinary boundaries of art history to unfold the rich and valuable visual communication, ethnography, ecology and cosmologies by and through the art and cultural heritage of African Atlantic diasporas. Martinez-Ruiz received his BA at the University of Havana in 1994 and his PhD from Yale University in 2004. At Yale he was a student of Robert Farris Thompson, who wrote the Flash of the Spirit: African and Afro-American Art and Philosophy. Martinez-Ruiz grew up in Cuba Oriente, the eastern provinces of Cuba and later moved to Havana. At the age of 18 he was drafted into the Cuban military and was sent to Angola as a soldier. Upon his return to Cuba, he finished his degree began teaching Caribbean art and working in film, at the Instituto Superior de Arte, in Havana, and Havana University. In this capacity he was able to return to Angola to collaborate with other artists on a film. The film project became a point of entry into the Kongo graphic writing systems and rock painting studies that has informed his research for over 27 years.

Anti-Americanism became government policy during the Cold War in East Germany, with dissenters being punished. In West Germany, this sentiment was generally limited to left wing politicians.Dan Diner, America in the eyes of the Germans: an essay on anti-Americanism (1996). With the election of eurosceptic president Donald Trump, some people observe that Anti-Americanism may be growing in Germany.

However in the late 1960s, West Germany's youth contrasted the images of Woodstock --which they likedand Vietnam--which they hated. Young rebels turned to violence to destroy the foundations of a society that backed American cultural imperialism. Anti-Americanism reappeared among intellectuals after the attacks on 11 September 2001 because some of them linked globalization, Americanization, and terrorism.Berendse, \\"German anti- Americanism in context.\\" Journal of European Studies 33.3-4 (2003): 333-350. During the Cold War, Germany was split into two parts, East Germany and West Germany. In Communist East Germany, anti-Americanism was official government policy. Anti-Americanism was strong among left wingers. Right wingers saw the United States as a protector against communism, but some still saw the American way of life as uncultured. =Iraq War of 2003= The War in Iraq in 2003 was highly unpopular at all levels of German society.Tuomas Forsberg, \\"German foreign policy and the war on Iraq: Anti-Americanism, pacifism or emancipation?.\\" Security Dialogue 36.2 (2005): 213-231.

Densley has published extensively on street gang issues and has been described as \\"among the most accomplished rising leaders of modern gang research in criminology.\\" Densley is best known for his ethnography of gang life in London, England, and his applications of economic signalling theory to gang membership. Densley's research examines group processes in gangs and compares gangs with other violent collectives such as hate groups and terror groups. He once compared the Islamic State to a ‚Äústreet gang on steroids‚Äù. Densley writes about the ‚Äúglocalisation‚Äù of gang culture, cyber violence, and the role of rap music and social media in gang violence. He is also known for his research into mass shootings. Densley is a TEDx speaker and has written for CNN, The Conversation, The Guardian, The Herald, HuffPost, Los Angeles Times, MinnPost, Salon, StarTribune, USA Today, and The Wall Street Journal on a range of public issues, including gangs and gang responses, gun violence, knife crime, drug sales, school shootings, and violent extremism. He has appeared on CBS This Morning, CNN Tonight with Don Lemon, Viceland's Black Market: Dispatches with Michael K. Williams, and on local news to comment on criminal justice issues, including police use of force and law enforcement education and training. Education and early career Densley received his B.A. in sociology with American studies from the University of Northampton in 2003. He earned a M.S. in sociology from the University of Oxford in 2004, and then moved to New York City where he enrolled in the NYC Teaching Fellows and taught 7th and 8th grade special education at University Neighborhood Middle School in Manhattan's Lower East Side.Densley, J. (2012). Street gang recruitment: Signaling, screening and selection. Social Problems, 59(3), 301‚Äì321. doi: 10.1525/sp.2012.59.3.301. In New York, he earned his teacher's license and a master's degree in education from Pace University. In 2007, Densley moved back to England to complete a D.Phil. in sociology from Oxford University's Extra-Legal Governance Institute. Densley studied under mafia scholars Diego Gambetta and Federico Varese, and his work seems to reflect his time with them from his methods, to his theory, and focus on social organizations. Densley graduated in 2011 and was hired by Metropolitan State University that same year. He was promoted to full professor in 2019, aged just 37. Research The 2011 England riots occurred just weeks after Densley had finished his PhD, a study of gangs in London. After the UK Prime Minister David Cameron blamed the riots on gangs, Densley was one of the first academics to question this logic. Densley's first book, How Gangs Work, grew out of his PhD research and reflects upon the ‚Äúwar on gangs‚Äù launched after the 2011 riots. The British Journal of Criminology mentions the book's ‚Äúcritical ethnography and first-class fieldwork‚Äù, concluding that ‚ÄúDensley‚Äôs work points the way to how gang research should be done in the future.‚Äù In the book and in later research, Densley used signaling theory to make sense of how and why youth join gangs. He found that prospective gang members signal their potential value to the gang by engaging in violent and criminal acts that are beyond the capacity of most people. Densley also used signaling theory to advance a model of disengagement from gangs that allows ex-gang members to communicate their unobservable inner change to others and satisfy community expectations that desistance from crime is real. For Densley, religious conversion in prison was one example of a disengagement signal. Densley's work explores the rationality of gang behavior. He developed an influential model of gang evolution that explains the relationship between gangs and organized crime. He found that recreation, crime, enterprise, and governance were not static gang activities or distinct gang types, but instead sequential \\"actualization stages\\" in the lifecycle of gangs. Densley's evolutionary model was later validated by studies of gangs in London, England, and Glasgow, Scotland. Densley also studies illicit drug dealing. In 2012, he warned about the county lines model of drug distribution in which drug‚Äêselling gangs from the major urban areas, like London, send vulnerable youth to exploit markets in other towns and areas: ‚ÄúMost youngers are employed by their elders to work what was known colloquially as the ‚Äòdrugs line,‚Äô although some are sent out ‚Äòon assignment‚Äô to explore ‚Äònew markets‚Äô in areas where they are unknown to police; notably commuter cities with vibrant nighttime economies‚Äù.Densley, J. (2014). It‚Äôs gang life, but not as we know it: The evolution of gang business. Crime & Delinquency, 60(4), 517‚Äì546. doi: 10.1177/0011128712437912. Page 533. His later work looked at debt bondage and child exploitation in county lines drug dealing, and how expressive uses of social media by gang members, such as posting rap videos to YouTube, helped advance gang members‚Äô material interests in county lines.  The Violence Project  In 2017, Densley launched The Violence Project with psychologist Jillian Peterson of Hamline University. Densley and Peterson built a database of all public mass shooters since 1966 coded according to 100 different variables. Their research on mass shooters included in-depth analysis of K-12 school shootings and how the Columbine High School massacre became a blueprint for future massacres. Densley and Peterson are critical of active shooter lockdown drills in schools for traumatizing young children and normalizing school violence. In a 2019 op-ed for the Los Angeles Times, The Violence Project presented a new, hopeful, framework to understand mass shootings. Based on a study funded by the National Institute of Justice, Peterson and Densley found mass shooters had four things in common: (1) early childhood trauma and exposure to violence at a young age; (2) an identifiable grievance or suicidal crisis point; (3) validation for their belief system, have studied past shootings to find inspiration; and (4) the means to carry out an attack. This new framework highlights the complexity of the pathway to a mass shooting, including how each one can be ‚Äúsocially contagious‚Äù,\\"Mass shootings: Experts say violence is contagious, and 24/7 news cycle doesn't help\\". NBC News. Retrieved 2019-08-11. but also creates a plan to prevent the next shooting. Each one of the four themes represents an opportunity for intervention. By reducing access to firearms (means), slowing contagion (validation), training in crisis intervention de-escalation (crisis), and increasing access to affordable mental healthcare (trauma), a mass shooting can be averted. Densley and Peterson's research also shows that to really understand the profiles of mass killers, you have to look at the types of locations they target because K-12 school shooters are different from house of worship shooters, who are different still from workplace shooters and so on. Densley and Peterson also partnered with the Minnetonka Police Department to develop a new mental illness crisis intervention training for law enforcement, known as The R-Model.  Growing Against Violence  Densley is co-founder of Growing Against Violence, a London-based charity that since 2008 has delivered violence prevention programming to nearly 200,000 children and young people in hundreds of schools. Densley wrote and piloted the original curriculum and later conducted an evaluation of the program. In 2017, Densley was awarded the Prime Minister's Points of Light award for his ‚Äúoutstanding‚Äù volunteerism.  Selected publications  * *McLean, R. Robinson, G. & Densley, J. (2020).

The J-pouch, an alternative to a permanent ileostomy or colostomy, allows patients who have had their colons removed to continue to have regular bowel movements without an ostomy bag. This is now the standard of care for patients with rectal carcinoma across the country and world. =Incontinence and Constipation Scores= The Wexner Incontinence Score is the most common score used to determine the severity of incontinence before and after surgery for anal incontinence. The Wexner Incontinence Score is based on the research of Wexner and his associate J. Marcio N. Jorge, MD. The scoring system takes into account the frequency of incontinence, alterations a patient makes to cope with incontinence, and lifestyle modifications. Wexner's research has also developed the Wexner Constipation Score, occasionally known as the Cleveland Clinic Constipation Score.[7] The score measures the severity of constipation by taking into consideration a number of factors, which his research found to correlate with objective physiologic findings. Information on these factors is collected from each patient's subjective reports, and they are given a score. This score allows for appropriate and consistent diagnosis and treatment. The factors include the frequency and completeness of bowel movements, the difficulty of evacuation, the type of assistance used (if any), the patient's level of pain, and duration of constipation. In 1996, Wexner and colleagues released a method of scoring perianal disease activity for patients with Crohn's Disease. The goal of the scoring system is to utilize a patient's medical history and the results of physical examination to predict the likelihood of success of surgical intervention. Prior to the development of this method, doctors lacked reliable indices of disease activity or prognostic implications from surgery. =Patents=    Honors and Awards  In 1999, Wexner was awarded an FRCS from the Royal College of Surgeons in Edinburgh, Scotland.

Early life and family The grave of Admiral Sir William Ramsay and Dean Ramsay, St John's Episcopal Church, Edinburgh Ramsay was born at Balmain House in Aberdeenshire, the sixth son of Alexander Burnett (later known as Sir Alexander Ramsay, 1st Baronet of Balmain), and his wife, Elizabeth Bannerman, daughter of Sir Alexander Bannerman, 4th Baronet. Alexander Burnett was the second son of Catherine Ramsay, the granddaughter of Sir Charles Ramsay, 3rd Baronet of Balmain of an earlier creation (1625) in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia, which was inherited by Catherine's brother Alexander. Catherine Ramsay married Sir Thomas Burnett of Leys, 6th Baronet and their elder son, Robert, inherited the Burnett baronetcy. Catherine's brother Alexander, the 6th Baronet, died without sons in 1806 (though two relatives styled themselves as the next baronet, without proving parentage), at which point the Nova Scotia baronetcy either became extinct or dormant. In 1806, Sir Alexander Ramsay, 6th Baronet bequeathed his estates to his nephew Alexander Burnett. The baronetcy was revived in favour of Burnett a few months after Sir Alexander's death, who changed the family surname to Ramsay. His elder brothers included Sir Alexander Ramsay, 2nd Baronet of Balmain and Dean Edward Ramsay, leader of the Scottish Episcopal Church. Career He entered the Royal Navy in 1809. He became a lieutenant in 1821, a commander in 1831 and a captain in 1838. His main command was HMS Terrible, a uniquely profiled paddle steamer with two pairs of funnels. He joined the ship from its initial launch at Woolwich Dockyard in 1845. He then joined the Channel Squadron. In 1847 he was put to special duties on a new ship, HMS Dragon, conveying food to Ireland during the Great Famine, before returning to HMS Terrible for duties in the Mediterranean.

She was the first woman to attain a chair of sociology in Spain, in 1982. She was one of the first researchers in her field who carried out works with a feminist perspective in the Spanish academic world. In 1979, she was the founder and director of the of the Autonomous University of Madrid, the first university institute for women's studies created in Spain. In 2002 she received the in Economic and Legal Sciences. Retired in 2012, she is currently active at the of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) as an ad honorem researcher. Biography Mar√≠a √Ångeles Dur√°n is part of the first Madridian generation of a family from the Extremaduran Sierra de Gata. Her father was an industrial engineer born in the north of C√°ceres who had a career in Madrid, and her mother was from La Granja de San Ildefonso. Mar√≠a √Ångeles, the oldest of six children, was born and lived in Madrid, although she often returns to Extremadura. The sociologist credits her father's influence for her interest in mathematics and languages. She arrived at the Faculty of Political Sciences at age 16, at a time when university women were the exception. At 18 she was a delegate of her class. She graduated in Political and Economic Sciences in 1964 and earned a Ph.D. in Political Science from the Complutense University in 1971, with a doctoral thesis entitled El trabajo de las Mujeres (The Work of Women). In 1972, she did postdoctoral studies at the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research on a grant from the Fulbright Program, specializing in the differential socialization of gender and social inequalities. In 1979 she founded the Women's Study Seminar, forerunner of the Autonomous University of Madrid's (IUEM), the first such institute established in Spain, and served as its first director until 1985. She carried out various works investigating the situation of women in the scientific field and the application of gender perspective to research, and in 1981 published Liberaci√≥n y utop√≠a: la mujer ante la ciencia. In 2001 she was one of the founders of the (AMIT). In 1982 she won the Chair of Sociology, becoming the first woman in Spain to achieve a chair in that specialty. Dur√°n has been a professor of Sociology at the Autonomous and Complutense Universities of Madrid, CEU, and Zaragoza. From 1987 until her retirement in 2012 she took residencies to teach or carry out research at the University of Michigan, University of Rio de Janeiro (1981), University of Cambridge (1988 and 1997), University of Washington, Seattle (1989), and the European Institute of Florence (1997). She was also Professor of Research in the specialty of Social Sciences at the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC). Currently, she continues to work at the CSIC's as an ad honorem researcher. From 1998 to 2001 she chaired the Spanish Federation of Sociology, and from 2002 to 2006 she was a member of the Executive Committee of the International Sociological Association. In 2009, she was the promoter of the UNESCO Chair UNITWIN Network in Gender Policies and Equality of Rights Between Women and Men, which she headed from 2010 to 2013. In October 2013 she was replaced by IUEM member Virginia Maquieira. Dur√°n is currently the Honorary Chair. She holds honorary doctorates from the University of Valencia, Autonomous University of Madrid, and University of Granada, and her work has been published in English, French, German, Portuguese, Italian, and Catalan. Unpaid work of women Dur√°n is a specialist in analyzing the value of unpaid work in developed economies, and in studying to what extent societies' level of well-being would be sustained without these contributions, often invisible and made by women. She was a pioneer in making visible the unpaid sector of the Spanish economy that allowed accounting for women's unpaid work. Her research has revealed that Spanish women are those who spend the most time on unpaid work and the least on paid work in Europe. They fall within the scope of economic sociology: the value of unpaid work, the social cost of illness, the global need for care and the perception of the body and space of women, the interdependence between life private and public, as well as the situation of social groups that until the beginning of her work had attracted little interest from sociology and economics. In the study \\"La Cuenta sat√©lite\\", the role of housewives in the economy is analyzed in depth, and it is concluded that this group represents the great engine, not only of the economy, but of the survival of homes. According to calculations of her research, during the first years of the 21st century in Spain, men performed 70% of paid work and women only 30%. But women performed 79% of domestic work, while men only 21%. \\"Hence, to work, what is said to work, women work more than men,\\" said Dur√°n in 2008. \\"The average work week of a Spanish male, excluding vacations and holidays, is 36 hours and 43 minutes a week; that of a woman is 56 hours and 7 minutes.\\" In 2011, she estimated from her research that unpaid work represented around 53% of the Spanish GDP. \\"Women, as a whole, bear the responsibility of their children, the sick, and the old, and also give a large part of their resources to the active population of men so that they are more available for their professional careers.\\" Their achievements have been at the cost of \\"juggling and finding an exceptional partner,\\" Dur√°n explained in 2012. Breast cancer survivor In the late 1990s Dur√°n was diagnosed with breast cancer. \\"I was already working on the use of time, so I marked myself, as a bit of therapy, to make the observation of lost times in the waiting rooms, in the treatments. I turned it into an observation of myself, to take iron and give it a use.\\" In 2003 she published an autobiographical book, Diario de batalla. Mi lucha contra el c√°ncer, in which she related her experience of six years of struggle to defeat the fear of breast cancer to endure and overcome the disease. She was one of the founders of AMIT and also a pioneer in investigating the situation of women in the scientific field, and the application of gender perspective to research, publishing Liberaci√≥n y utop√≠a: la mujer ante la ciencia in 1981. Her autobiographical book Diario de batalla was recognized by the Foundation for Public Education and Oncological Continuing Education (FEFOC) as \\"a valuable contribution to knowledge and better understanding of the situation of the sick and their emotional environment.\\" Personal life Mar√≠a √Ångeles Dur√°n married in 1967, at age 24.

His hacking missions are given to him by a mysterious artificial intelligence known as EMBER-2. Each mission takes place inside a network of interconnected and specialized computer systems. Using programmable software agents called EXAs, the player must accomplish each given task by writing computer code to cleverly manipulate the data stored on the network's systems. The EXAs' instruction set features a few simple opcodes for movement, data processing, network messaging, and interfacing with files and registers. Due to their limited memory capacity, these tasks often require several agents working together in a highly coordinated fashion. EXA units also have the ability to replicate themselves inside the network. Typical missions include retrieving data from secured storage systems, hacking into company databases, and causing an automated teller machine to dispense free cash. Some puzzles also require the player to hack Moss's body to maintain his health. Some puzzles challenge the player to hacker battles, where they must pit their EXAs against an opponent's agents, for example altering a television station's program to broadcast Moss' content instead. Players are generally free to write code for EXAs with as many EXAs as necessary, those are often limited by the number of opcodes that can be used. The player's solution must satisfy 100 different case scenarios iterating on the same problem. When the player demonstrates a successful solution, the game records how many cycles the solution took, the size of their code across all EXAs, and the number of movement and kill commands executed by the solution. These are tracked against other players' scores via histograms and friends' scoreboards, allowing players to try to optimize their solutions. Instructions for EXAs as well as additional useful information for some of the simulated systems are provided by issues of \\"Trash World News\\", a fictional zine; players can view these issues digitally or print out. After completing a number of puzzles, the player gains access to both a puzzle editor to make new puzzles that can be uploaded to the Steam Workshop, as well as access to an in-game handheld game console, called Redshift, and program games for it. A free Redshift player was released by Zachtronics allowing any player, even those who had not purchased Exapunks, to play other players' Redshift creations. There is also a simple solitaire game and a tile-matching game unlocked through progression of the main story. Development Zach Barth, the founder of Zachtronics, was inspired to create Exapunks after reading about the Stuxnet viruses that had impacted a nuclear facility in Iran in 2010. Barth said that Stuxnet \\"sparked the idea of these malicious programs that are designed to unfold like origami into a specific network and manipulate it in some way\\". He developed Exapunkss lore on the cyberspace culture envisioned by William Gibson, though with more focus on the \\"punk\\" side of the 1980s and 1990s - small-time hackers fighting against large corporations. He also took inspiration from 2600: The Hacker Quarterly and attended various DEF CON events, while the game's writer, Matthew Burns, also considered cyberculture works like Wired, Transmetropolitan and Tom Clancy's Net Force Explorers influential. Barth also considered how films like Hackers made the hacking culture cool. In terms of developing the EXA's opcodes, Barth borrowed concepts common to many real operating systems like Unix for file operations and links, and envisioned the EXAs as elements of the Magic Cap metaphor for computing systems. Zachtronics announced Exapunks on July 18, 2018; the studio said it would follow a similar release approach they had done for previous games Shenzhen I/O and Opus Magnum by using an early access period for a nearly feature-complete game to gain and implement feedback from players before releasing the final game. The Early Access was to start August 21, 2018, but Zachtronics released the game earlier on August 9, 2018. The full version of Exapunks out of Early Access was released on October 22, 2018. Reception Initial reception of the game was positive. User reviews on Steam are overwhelmingly positive. Rock Paper Shotgun included Exapunks on its list of \\"10 Best Hacking Coding and Computing Games\\", calling it \\"...an accurate portrayal of the decade (the 90's).\\" \\"It's awesome.\\" - Jeff Gerstmann, Giant Bomb References External links * Category:2018 video games Category:Cyberpunk games Category:Early access video games Category:Programming games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Linux games Category:MacOS games ","title":"Exapunks"},{"id":"57933968","text":"Rolando Vargas is the head tennis coach for the Troy Trojans men's tennis team.

History  The bridge was built in 1917 along with the extension of the North Coast line to Kempsey. The steelwork for the bridge was made at the Walsh Island Dockyard and Engineering Works and transported to the bridge site by steamer. The bridge was damaged in floods in 1949 and 1950. It was initially proposed to replace the entire bridge as a result, but this proposal had been abandoned by 1953. In 1966 the bridge spans were raised by due to the 1950s floods, with new pre-cast concrete approaches constructed.  Description  The bridge is a steel truss bridge with consisting of two steel spans and two plate girder spans. It was built with steel approaches, with the pre-cast concrete approaches added later when the bridge was raised.  Heritage listing  The Macleay River bridge is one of the major river crossings on the North Coast railway line. When opened in 1917, the crossing of the river was achieved by 3 steel truss spans, approached by timber trestles. After two floods in 1949 and in 1950, the steel trusses were raised approximately and the approaches replaced by pre-stressed concrete spans. The Kempsey rail bridge over the Macleay River was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.

Early life Forbes was born on February 24, 1849. He was the second son of Valeria Medora (n√©e Wright) Forbes and Paul Siemen Forbes (1808‚Äì1886), who traveled to China in 1857 joined his cousin John Murray Forbes, the United States Consul in Canton who was a partner in Russell & Co., the largest American trading house in Qing dynasty China from the 1840s until its closing in 1891. He had two brothers, William Howell Forbes and Paul Revere Forbes; and a sister, Mary Elizabeth \\"Nellie\\" Forbes (1854‚Äì1932), who married Gaston Louis Philippe de Choiseul, the 6th Duc de Praslin, the son of Fran√ßoise, duchesse de Praslin and Charles de Choiseul- Praslin, the 5th Duc de Praslin, in 1874. After his brother William's death in 1896, William's widow, the former Dora Delano (sister of Frederic Adrian Delano and Sara (n√©e Delano) Roosevelt), married Henry's other brother, Paul. His maternal grandparents were Eliza Lee (n√©e Warner) Wright and Samuel Turbutt Wright, the 2nd Adjutant General of Maryland. After his grandfather's early death in 1810, his grandmother remarried to Forbes' namesake, William Henry De Courcy Wright, the son of U.S. Senator and Governor of Maryland Robert Wright and Sarah (n√©e De Courcy) Wright. Forbes attended and graduated from Trinity Hall, Cambridge. Career Following the family tradition, Forbes entered Russell & Co. as a director, serving as an attorney for his father. While the firm had been extremely successful in the past, increased competition led to its decline. Russells attempted to rescue itself when it was about to bankrupt by founding the National Bank of China to draw some capital. Forbes, his brother William, and the Howqua family became founders of the Bank. S. W. Pomeroy, a Russell partner and former director of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, with other members of the company, criticized the Forbes brothers for sponsoring the new Bank which the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank viewed as rival. This led to further curtailment of credit to Russell & Co., forcing the firm to sell its assets resulting in a full collapse on June 9, 1891. The business was acquired by two of its employees, Robert Shewan and Alexander Charles Tomes, who renamed the firm Shewan, Tomes & Co. in 1895. =Society life= In 1892, Forbes was included in Ward McAllister's \\"Four Hundred\\", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in The New York Times. Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom. Forbes was heavily interested in horse racing and was a prominent member of the New York Jockey Club when Pierre Lorillard and James R. Keene were racing horses. He also served as a director of the National Horse-Show Association of America. Personal life Forbes, who did not marry, lived at the Knickerbocker Club in New York City. He died at the home of his brother Paul, 37 Avenue de l'Alma, in Paris in July 1920.

The castle stands on a rocky islet which due to drainage works and farming activities has now become linked to the shoreline through a curved earthen embankment. Semple is sometimes written as 'Sempill'; however, for consistency the more commonly found spelling will be used here. History =Robert, 3rd Lord Semple= Aird Meadow and Castle Semple Loch with the site of the peel tower lying to the left in the distance. In August 1560 the Scottish parliament confirmed the 'Confession of Faith' however, Robert Semple, 3rd Lord Semple remained a staunch Catholic and continued to take mass and oppose the Scottish Reformation. He was a loyal supporter of Mary Queen of Scots and the queen regent, Mary of Guise, against the supporters of John Knox and was described by that personage as \\"a man sold under sin, an enemy to God and to all godliness.\\"Knox, John, Works, vol. 1, p. 339. In July 1560 a treaty had called for peace and reconciliation; however, as stated, Lord Semple and others continued to commit many murders, stole cattle, burned down houses, set fire to crops and committed crimes even to the extent of \\"..not sparand to sla auld men of fowr skoir yeris off age, lyand decreppit in their beddis.\\". Although called to appear in front of the Justice-General to account for these actions he instead set about strengthening the garrison and the defences of Castle Semple and had also \\"..off new fortit ane hows within an ile in the loch of Lochquhinyeoch.\\" This new tower house or peel, built on a rocky island in the loch opposite Lochwinnoch church, is the ruinous fortification that now stands connected via the curved embankment to the Lochside House or eastern side of the shore of Castle Semple Loch. Although the peel of Castle Semple was built for security, in times of peace it was also used for recreation by the Semples and had a degree of comfort as indicated by the ornately carved stones found within the fortification. It was built shortly before 1560 during the troubled times of the Scottish Reformation as a place of safety and an impregnable retreat. Lord Semple gave the new fort he built on island in the loch the name \\"Defender of the Faith\\".Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1547-1563, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), p. 498 This reflects on the reason for its construction by one who opposed the Protestant faith. =The Castle Semple siege and aftermath= The Earl of Glencairn had put together sufficient soldiers and artillery to attack Castle Semple and despite seven days worth of truly appalling weather he was able on the eighth day to set his artillery in an ideal position and by 3pm the following day the Castle Semple gate house had been destroyed. Glencairn's soldiers attacked through the breach in the walls; however, they were beaten off. The next morning, October 19, 1560, a white flag was seen flying and the siege was over. A Captain Forbes with a garrison of ten men were left in charge of Castle Semple and the peel whilst the remainder of the troops disbursed, one side glad to still be alive and the other side content with their pay. Castle Semple Loch from Kenmure Hill with the site of the Peel Tower in the middle distance. Lord Semple's son, known in accordance with feudal tradition as the 'Master of Semple' was captured and taken to Hamilton. His father had not been at the castle and in 1561 came to terms with the authorities. The Protestant Reformation in the meantime continued with the Earls of Argyle, Glencairn and others burning down Paisley Abbey, Kilwinning Abbey, Crossraguel Abbey and others. After the murder in 1567 of Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, the second husband of Mary Queen of Scots, Lord Semple changed sides and was very active in the queen's downfall and imprisonment. Lord Semple had been bailie to Archbishop John Hamilton, a Catholic, who was convicted of art and part in the murder of the Regent Moray and Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley in 1571. Archbishop Hamilton had three children by his mistress, Grizzel Semple, Lord Semple's daughter. =The bronze cannons= In the 18th and 19th centuries several bronze cannon with octagonal barrels were found in the loch around the peel tower, each carrying a falcon and the insignia 'IRS' for James V of Scotland. Probably used at the siege, one was kept at Castle Semple House and is now lodged in the collections of the Glasgow Museums at the Kelvingrove Museum. These may have originally been lost during transportation or were deliberately placed there to disarm the peel tower and prevent further immediate use. Castle Semple Loch Castle Semple Loch was at one time around 4.5 miles long and nearly a mile wide; however, the loch was the subject of much drainage work between 1680 and 1774, resulting in around 400 acres of acres of rich land such as Aird's Meadow being made available for cultivation and grazing with a concomitant loss of surface area and depth of water. Some this had to be reversed to provide for mills powered by the Black Cart Water. In William Roy's map of circa 1747‚Äì1755 the peel is shown on an irregularly shaped isthmus extending from the shoreline at Lochside House and the Black Cart Water shows signs of having being canalised. By 1800 the water level had risen again and the peel is shown on an island. In 1856 an embankment had been built around the Aird Meadow which was then under cultivation although subject to flooding in winter. The peel was situated on this embankment. Description Peel or Pele Towers or tower houses were usually minor fortified keeps, constructed as watch towers in prominent positions where signs of approaching danger could be communicated by signal fires, etc. The Castle Semple Loch example had cannons as shown by the gun ports and probably stood at least three storeys high. The construction of the present day ruins may date from around 1560 when Robert Semple, 3rd Lord Semple was in armed conflict with the adherents of the Scottish Reformation. Ornately carved stonework was present and the fortification had the overall shape of an irregular pentagon with a sharp end pointed towards the head of the loch. The ruins have the aforementioned gun ports on the ground floor with a circular spiral stair which once gave access to the living quarters on the floor above. The ground floor cellar had a vaulted ceiling. In an 1856 survey rubbish and stones at the site made it difficult to interpret the layout of the structure. In 1826 the peel is shown as intact and sitting on an islet connected by a causeway to the shore at Lochside House. After 1856 most of the rubble and rubbish was removed and much of the lower storey of the peel tower was revealed. The tower walls are still around 3m thick and the quoins are made from dressed stone. The walls to the north-west and to the south-east stand to a height of around 3 m. To the south-west the wall also still stands; however, to the north-east only the foundations remain, probably due to robbing of the stone for use elsewhere such as in the construction of the embankment that encloses Air Meadow. The walls have masonry rubble-cores with external facings of square-faced stone. In the east corner are the remnants of a newel or spiral stair leading to the upper floor. =Aird Meadow= As states the peel tower was built on an islet in the loch as shown by old maps; however, extensive drainage reduced the size and depth of the loch, and the creation of Airds Meadow involved the formation of an embankment that joins the islet to the shore on the Lochside House side. In Scots 'Aird' refers to a piece of ground as opposed to a body of water such as in Airds Moss, etc. See also *Castle Semple *Loch Doon Castle *Barr Castle *Kilbirnie Loch References ;Notes ;Sources * Groome, Francis H.

In 1959, he created the first halfway house to support men coming out of prison: Dismas House. Clark knew that if a man coming out of prison could be given a decent place to live and a job, he rarely returned to prison. However, if a man did not receive such support he had a very high chance of committing another crime and returning to prison. For his work with ex- convicts, Clark earned the moniker ‚ÄúThe Hoodlum Priest.‚Äù In 1960, actor Don Murray came to St. Louis to film the movie The Hoodlum Priest on Father Clark‚Äôs effort to create Dismas House. Life Father Clark was born Charles Clark in 1901 in Pennsylvania. His family moved to Illinois. In 1919 he entered the Jesuits (the Society of Jesus) at St. Stanislaus Seminary in Florissant and was ordained a Catholic priest in 1932. He taught at Saint Louis University High School from 1934 to 1936. During World War II, Father Clark served as an Army chaplain at Camp Bowie, Texas. Being Clark, he connected most to the soldiers who got in trouble. Clark then became a retreat leader and did parish mission work around the country. Clark was a popular speaker who packed them in with his frankness and honesty. He connected easily with the sinners, but not so much with ‚Äúthe good people.‚Äù One day Clark found himself outside of City Jail in St. Louis. Curious, he went inside. There he found a prisoner in a cell laying in his own vomit who had been beaten into a false confession. Charles Clark found his mission. He made more visits to City Jail and discovered more mistreatment of prisoners and injustices in the court system. In particular, he became aware of the lack of support for prisoners leaving prison. He began working full time with men in prison. Often called ‚ÄúCharlie,‚Äù Father Clark changed his first name to Dismas to connect with ex- convicts. According to Christian tradition, St. Dismas was the name of the Good Thief on the cross to whom Jesus promised: ‚ÄúToday you will be with me in paradise.‚Äù As is mentioned in the movie The Hoodlum Priest, the Good Thief is the only one in the gospels to get such a promise. With the help of prominent St. Louis lawyer Morris Shenker, Clark created Dismas House. In the next decades half-way houses were set up across the country. Dismas House was originally on Cole Street in downtown St. Louis. It still exists today on North Kingshighway and Cote Brillante in North St. Louis in the building that was once the residence of the Brothers of Mary who taught at McBride High School.Elizabeth Mulligan, The Hoodlum‚Äôs Priest (St. Louis: Sunrise Publishing Co., 1979). The Hoodlum Priest The 1961 movie The Hoodlum Priest, starring Don Murray, depicted the life of Dismas Clark. Many scenes were filmed in St. Louis, including scenes on Produce Row--which still looks the same today--and the Mill Creek neighborhood as it was being torn down. Several scenes were filmed downtown in front of a strip joint and sleazy bar which were later torn down in the 1960s to revitalize downtown St. Louis. Father Clark died in 1963, an exhausted man. In the weeks before his death, he had worked hard in a futile fight to save a young man from Missouri‚Äôs gas chamber.Harry J. Cargas, ‚ÄúThe Hoodlum Priest: R.I.P., The Story of Fr. Dismas Clark, S.J.‚Äù Homiletic and Pastoral Review 68: 328-34. (January, 1964). The Frank Sinatra Spectacular During his life, Dismas Clark received support from the Teamsters Union which often provided jobs for the men at Dismas House. Harold J. Gibbons was the local Teamsters president. In 1965, Gibbons invited Frank Sinatra to do a fundraiser for Dismas House. Sinatra produced a show called the Frank Sinatra Spectacular with Frank, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., and Johnny Carson as the M.C. Also appearing were Count Basie and his orchestra, Kaye Stevens, and Trini Lopez. The show was filmed. When the film of the show was rediscovered in the 1990s and put on cable TV it introduced a new generation to Frank Sinatra and his Rat Pack. The show can be seen on YouTube.Stephen A.

Among these works is Sunset, done by Delacroix circa 1850. The drawing depicts a sunset, set behind and above a gently sloping landscape. The sunset is partially blocked by two cloud formations, one directly above the Earth and a second, thicker band along the top of the painting.

The concept is based on the Princeton field-reversed configuration reactor invented in 2002 by Samuel A. Cohen, and is being modeled and experimentally tested at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, a US Department of Energy facility, and modeled and evaluated by Princeton Satellite Systems. As of 2018, the concept has moved on to Phase II to further advance the design. Principle The Direct Fusion Drive (DFD) is a conceptual fusion-powered spacecraft engine, named for its ability to produce thrust from fusion without going through an intermediary electricity-generating step. The DFD uses a novel magnetic confinement and heating system, fueled with a mixture of helium-3 (He-3) and deuterium (D), to produce a high specific power, variable thrust and specific impulse, and a low-radiation spacecraft propulsion system.Fusion-Enabled Pluto Orbiter and Lander - Phase I Final Report. (PDF) Stephanie Thomas, Princeton Satellite Systems. 2017. Fusion happens when atomic nuclei, comprising one species in a hot (100 keV or 1,120,000,00 K) plasma, a collection of electrically charged particles that includes electrons and ions, join (or fuse) together, releasing enormous amounts of energy. In the DFD system, the plasma is confined in a torus-like magnetic field inside of a linear solenoidal coil and is heated by a rotating magnetic field to fusion temperatures. Bremsstrahlung and synchrotron radiation emitted from the plasma are captured and converted to electricity for communications, spacecraft station-keeping, and maintaining the plasma's temperature.. Yosef S. Razin, Gary Pajer, Mary Breton, Eric Ham, Joseph Mueller, Michael Paluszek, Alan H. Glasser, Samuel A. Cohen. Acta Astronautica. Volume 105, Issue 1, December 2014, Pages 145-155. . This design uses a specially shaped radio waves (RF) \\"antenna\\" to heat the plasma.Direct Fusion Drive Quad Chart. Princeton Satellite Systems. Accessed: 18 July 2018. The design also includes a rechargeable battery or a deuterium-oxygen auxiliary power unit to startup or restart DFD. The captured radiated energy heats to a He-Xe fluid that flows outside the plasma in a boron-containing structure. That energy is put through a closed-loop Brayton cycle generator to transform it into electricity for use in energizing the coils, powering the RF heater, charging the battery, communications, and station-keeping functions. Adding propellant to the edge plasma flow results in a variable thrust and specific impulse when channeled and accelerated through a magnetic nozzle; this flow of momentum past the nozzle is predominantly carried by the ions as they expand through the magnetic nozzle and beyond, and thus, function as an ion thruster. Development The construction of the experimental research device and most of its early operations were funded by the US Department of Energy. The recent studies ‚ÄîPhase I and Phase II‚Äî are funded by the NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts (NIAC) program. A series of articles on the concept were published between 2001 and 2008; the first experimental results were reported in 2007. Numerous studies of spacecraft missions (Phase I) were published, beginning in 2012. In 2017 the team reported that \\"Studies of electron heating with this method have surpassed theoretical predictions, and experiments to measure ion heating in the second-generation machine are ongoing.\\" As of 2018, the concept has moved on to Phase II to further advance the design. The full-size unit would measure approximately 2 m in diameter and 10 m long.How Direct Fusion Drive (DFD) will Revolutionize Space Travel. Zain Husain, BrownSpaceman. 1 October 2016. Stephanie Thomas is vice president of Princeton Satellite Systems and also the Principal Investigator for the Direct Fusion Drive.Direct Fusion Drive technical animation. Princeton Satellite Systems. Accessed 18 July 2018. Projected performance Analyses predict that the Direct Fusion Drive would produce between 5-10 Newtons thrust per each MW of generated fusion power,Nuclear and Future Flight Propulsion - Modeling the Thrust of the Direct Fusion Drive.

Cohen, Alexander Glasser. 2018 Joint Propulsion Conference, Cincinnati, Ohio. with a specific impulse (Isp) of about 10,000 seconds and 200 kW available as electrical power. Approximately 35% of the fusion power goes to thrust, 30% to electric power, 25% lost to heat, and 10% is recirculated for the RF heating. Modeling shows that this technology can potentially propel a spacecraft with a mass of about to Pluto in 4 years. Since DFD provides power as well as propulsion in one integrated device, it would also provide as much as 2 MW of power to the payloads upon arrival, expanding options for instrument selection, laser/optical communications, and even transfer up to 50 kW of power from the orbiter to the lander through a laser beam operating at 1080 nm wavelength. The designers think that this technology can radically expand the science capability of planetary missions. This dual power/propulsion technology has been suggested to be used on a Pluto orbiter and lander mission, a well as integration on the Orion spacecraft to transport a crewed mission to Mars in a relatively short timeDirect Fusion Drive to Mars ‚Äì A FISO Talk.

The large, waterfront park stretches over half a mile, past two state office buildings. Its most notable feature is a breaching whale sculpture called Takhu, designed by Alaskan artist Skip Wallen and built in Anaheim, California. The sculpture was placed in a fountain, next to the Juneau- Douglas Bridge, overlooking Gastineau Channel. The park is within walking distance of Downtown Juneau, the cruise ship docks and Douglas Island. It was completed in 2018. A system of boardwalks and trails connect Downtown Juneau to the park. The park is named after Bill Overstreet, a former mayor of Juneau who successfully fought to maintain Juneau as the capital city of Alaska. Park amenities Whale sculpture and fountain in the park Completed in 2018, the park includes the humpback whale sculpture and fountain, as well as public restrooms, a covered picnic area, benches and tables, and signs to direct tourists who walk over from the nearby cruise ship docks. The park also provides access to the beach. Funding Funding for the whale sculpture was provided by private donations. However, controversy arose when the Cruise Lines International Association, (CLIA) alleged that the City and Borough of Juneau (CBJ) \\"illegally\\" used \\"head tax\\" funds collected from each passenger to partially fund the building of the park itself, which the CLIA maintains violates the tonnage clause of the U.S. Constitution. The CBJ maintains that because the fees are used for the benefit of ships and passengers using the port, and not for the privilege of entering the port itself, they do not violate the Constitution. In December, 2018, Judge H. Russel Holland issued a ruling that benefited both the CLIA, as well as the CBJ. In his ruling, Judge Holland declared that the CBJ may continue to collect the per-passenger head tax, but must spend the receipts on projects that directly benefit the ship itself, not its passengers. Holland used crossing guards and sidewalk maintenance as two things the city may not spend passenger fees on. Both sides agreed that Judge Holland's ruling means that these funds cannot be used to build, maintain or expand the park. Both the CLIA and CBJ have stated that they will not appeal the ruling.

The film is known to reuse footage from Der Ewige Jude.  Plot  The film starts by showing a demonstration in London at the Soviet embassy. The voice-over informs that \\"this petty Zionist agent ... recruited and paid 5 pounds to each of the demonstrators from the Zionist treasury.\\" In reality the footage shows the 1972 demonstration against the conditions of detention in the Soviet prison of the pregnant Lyudmila Prussakova, the wife of Valentin Prussakov. The demonstration was triggered by the Bernard Levin's Times column, which reported on Prussakova's state, and was organized by British actresses Haley Mills and Barbara Oberman. The film reflected the anti-Zionist point of view prevailing at that time in Soviet ideology. The film, in particular, accuses Zionism of cooperation with Nazi Germany, including the mass extermination of Jews (the Holocaust) and the indigenous peoples of the USSR. The Soviet version of the role of Zionism in the Middle East conflict is reflected. The film represents the activities of Zionist organizations as subversive, directed against the USSR and other countries. The film also reflects the opinion on the role of owners of transnational corporations in the policy of Zionism.  Criticism  The World War II cameraman Leonid Kogan wrote in a letter addressed to Leonid Brezhnev that \\"the film uses material from the Nazi anti-Semitic films\\" and it forms the impression that \\"Zionism and Jews are one and the same.\\" Kogan called the film Black Hundreds inspired and expressed surprise that such a work could appear within the framework of the Central Studio for Documentary Film studio. Doctor of Art History Valery Fomin found out that the film was commissioned by the ideological department of the CPSU Central Committee in accordance with the recommendations on strengthening the ideological struggle against Zionism and was supervised in the process of creation. A famous film critic Miron Chernenko wrote that \\"the authors and consultants clearly broke a certain line, behind which state anti- Semitism came into conflict with the so-called \\"proletarian internationalism.\\" Chernenko calls the film the top of the \\"rabid\\" anti-Zionist \\"but actually anti-Semitic propaganda\\" that unfolded in the USSR after the end of the Six- Day War. Nikolai Mitrokhin, the candidate of historical sciences, regarded the film as \\"pseudo-documentary\\" and connects it with the conspiracy theory, according to which Jews are allegedly behind all key events of the 20th century.

It was built from 1924 to 1970. It is also known as Kinchela Boys' Home and the Aboriginal Mission School. The property is owned by Kempsey Local Aboriginal Land Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 17 February 2012.  History  =Background= Historically Aboriginal children were separated from their families from the earliest days of the colony. Governor Macquarie established the first Native Institution in Parramatta as early as 1814 and in 1823 another Native Institution was started in Blacktown (Blacktown Native Institution Site). Both these institutions were considered failures, one reason being that once parents realised their children wouldn't be allowed to come home, they wouldn't give them up to the institutions. The Government of New South Wales also subsidised missionary activity among the Aboriginal people, including that of the London Missionary Society in the 1820s and 1830s. On the frontier of Wellington Valley the Reverend Watson gained a reputation for stealing Aboriginal children and as a consequence the Wiradjuri hid their children from the white men. With the spread of settlers and their livestock came conflict and dispossession. The first bill for the Protection of Aborigines was drafted in 1838 after the Myall Creek massacre in June that year. Thus began a systemic government approach to the regulation and control of the lives of Aboriginal people that got tighter and tighter until the 1967 referendum finally brought significant change. Until 1881 Aboriginal people were under the jurisdiction of the Colonial Secretary, Police and the Lands Department. In 1880 a private body known as the New South Wales Aborigines Protection Association was formed, and following agitation by this body, the Government appointed a Protector of Aborigines, Mr. George Thornton MLC. The Board for the Protection of Aborigines was subsequently created in 1883. \\"The objectives of the Board were to provide asylum for the aged and sick, who are dependent on others for help and support; but also, and of at least equal importance to train and teach the young, to fit them to take their places amongst the rest of the community\\". This objective became the basis of future child removal policy: that the inferiority of the Aborigines would only be dealt with by removing the children and educating them in white ways. In Darlington Point Reverend Gribble established the Warangesda Aboriginal Mission in 1880 and in 1883 set up a separate girls' dormitory. The dormitory housed the girls separately in a building which included a dining room and kitchen as well as the dormitory room. Girls were brought in from many places and were trained to be domestic servants. When Warangesda Mission became an Aboriginal Station in 1884 the Aboriginal Protection Board continued to send Aboriginal girls to the Warangesda girls' dormitory. It was the Warangesda Mission/Station girls' dormitory which became the model or prototype for the later Aboriginal Children's Training Homes at Cootamundra (Cootamundra Domestic Training Home for Aboriginal Girls) and Kinchela. Frustrated by the lack of legislative power to control the education and lives of Aboriginal children the Aborigines Protection Board successfully lobbied for a new act which was introduced in 1909. The Board's Annual Reports of 1909 and 1911 show the emphasis on training of Aboriginal children. The Board felt limited by the Act because it only gave them direct control over children over 14 who could be apprenticed. To remove younger children they had to apply to the magistrate under the Neglected Children and Juvenile Offenders Act 1905. The Board was of the opinion that the children would only become good and proper members of \\"industrial society\\" if they were completely removed and not allowed to return.(Brindley p48, A board official quoted by P Read and C Edwards.) The underlying assumption, as ever, was that Aboriginal people lacked the intellect to undertake anything but menial tasks. This later translated into the limits on the types of training provided; girls training for domestic service and the boys for labouring. The Aborigines Protection Act was amended in 1915 and again in 1918 giving the Board the right \\"to assume full control and custody of the child of any aborigine, if after due inquiry it is satisfied that such a course is in the interest of the moral or physical welfare of such child. The Board may remove such child to such control and care as it thinks best.\\"(Aborigines Protection Amending Act, 1915, 4. 13A.) A court hearing was no longer necessary. If the parents wanted to appeal it was up to them to go to the court. The depression and drought years of the 1920s and 1930s were particularly difficult for Aboriginal people. Conditions in the reserves remaining from the soldier settlement land redistribution, were poor, often overcrowded, and it was easy for the government to prove neglect and remove Aboriginal children. In 1937, in response to public pressure from academic and missionary groups sympathetic to Aboriginal people, a meeting was convened of State and Commonwealth Aboriginal authorities. The result was an official assimilation policy formed on the premise that \\"full-blood\\" Aborigines would be soon extinct and the \\"half-caste\\" should be absorbed into society. Meanwhile, the Aboriginal people were organising to become a force of resistance. The Sesquicentenary was marked by a National Day of Mourning and a call for the abolition of the Protection Board. The Aborigines Protection Board was finally abolished and replaced by the Aborigines Welfare Board in 1940. Aboriginal children were then subject to the Child Welfare Act 1939 which required a magistrate's hearing and the child had to be proven neglected or uncontrollable. Aboriginal children continued to be sent to Cootamundra, Bomaderry and Kinchela, some went to Mittagong or Boystown. There were no specific homes for uncontrollable Aboriginal children so these were sent to State corrective institutions such as Mt Penang or Parramatta Girls.Brindley 60 The education of Aboriginal children had generally been one of segregation until, in 1940, the Department of Education officially took on the role. In the 1960s the work of British psychiatrist John Bowlby on \\"attachment theory\\", began to influence the institutional care of children in Australia. That an infant needs to develop a relationship with at least one primary caregiver for social and emotional development to occur normally: rather than only being treated with affection as a reward (Cupboard Love) which was the prevailing theory of the 1940s. Fostering then became the preferred option and a more common occurrence. In accordance with the assimilation policy which was still prevalent, Aboriginal children were fostered with non-Aboriginal parents. In May 1967 a referendum changed the Australian constitution bringing positive changes for the Aboriginal people. One resultant change was the abolition of the Aborigines Welfare Board in 1969. After this time non-Aboriginal girls were admitted to Cootamundra Girls Home. =Kinchela Aboriginal Boys' Training Home= The Board for the Protection of Aborigines gazetted the Kinchela Aboriginal Reserve on 23 April 1883.AR 174 Kinchela (originally known as Arakoon) was gazetted as a village in 1885 or 1886. Dormitories were added to the Aboriginal Reserve in 1924 to accommodate the daughters of Aborigines who lived too far from a school and boys who were transferred from Singleton Aboriginal Boys' Home. The Kinchela village became a centre of shipping for produce and cattle on ocean - going steamers. Three sugar mills operated in the vicinity and the hamlet was the centre of a large maize growing area. Cheese making was an important industry and the village had a bakery and butchery, two churches, two schools, a post office and a hall.(4) Aboriginal people were excluded from the activities of the village and the local community successfully petitioned in the 1940s to prevent the Aboriginal boys from the Home from attending the local school. The precursor to Kinchela, Singleton Boys' Home, was established by the Board for the Protection of Aborigines in December 1918 on the grounds of a former Mission. By the end of 1918 there were 46 boys accommodated there. The home was intended to accommodate the boys removed from their families under the Aborigines Protection (Amendment) ActNo.2 1915 until they were old enough to be sent out to work. The boys were to receive training whilst in the home so they could be gainfully employed in manual or agricultural work when they turned 15 years of age. They remained wards of the state until they were 18 and their income was held in trust by the Board. By 1923 eight boys had been placed in apprenticeships. By the end of 1923 the Board decided to dispose of the Singleton Home on the ground that the premises were unsuitable. The school on the grounds was officially closed on 15 January 1924 and the boys remaining at the home were transferred to Kinchela Aboriginal Boys' Training Home. Established in 1924 the Kinchela Aboriginal Boys' Training Home had the same function as the Singleton Home. Under the Aborigines Protection Act boys between the ages of 5 and 15 were removed from their families if in the opinion of the Board (or those enacting its laws, the police or reserve managers) it was \\"in the interest of the moral or physical welfare\\" of the child. These boys were sent directly to Kinchela or if they had been taken at a younger age they were sent to Bomaderry Children's Home until they were old enough to be transferred to Kinchela. Once the boys were removed from their families and communities they became officially Wards of the State until they were 18 years old. From the 1920s until the 1940s the Kinchela Home was known as an extremely harsh and cruel environment. After this time the home is said to have improved however oral history shows that conditions were still appalling. When describing the difference between the Bomaderry Home and Kinchela, one former resident felt that whilst there were difficulties with Bomaderry they were too young to comprehend the impact of the separation from their families until much later. He felt that the United Aborigines Missionaries tried to provide a loving caring environment whereas Kinchela was an institution. He described the manager at the time, in 1935, as \\"dictatorial and aggressive\\". The staff were untrained and did not make the same efforts to provide a homely environment. The boys were referred to by number rather than name. Cases of beatings and sexual abuse are well documented. The cruelty was investigated in the 1940s and some staff were dismissed. The policy of segregation from the rest of society became more relaxed and boys were permitted to engage in activities outside the home. The original dormitories constructed in 1924 were large \\"tin sheds\\"; these were replaced in 1935. The policy of assimilation was strictly enforced and anything connecting the boys to their Aboriginal culture was prohibited. The use of Aboriginal languages was banned in the home. The boys could go to the annual Kempsey show but they were prohibited from speaking with other Aboriginal people. The first Aboriginal School in the area (Pelican Island Aboriginal Provisional School) was established in 1892 but only functioned for a year. In 1919 another school called the Pelican Island Provisional School was established, apparently on the Aboriginal Reserve and in July 1928 it was renamed the Kinchela Aboriginal Provisional School, becoming an integral part of the Kinchela Boys' Home. It operated until 1941 when the School was closed and re-opened as Kinchela Aboriginal Public School which offered basic elementary education at a primary school level. According to former Home Boys the Provisional School was staffed by the Manager of the Home or other staff members and on some occasions an elder boy. None of these were trained teachers and as a consequence the standard of education until 1941 was extremely poor. The boys were not permitted to attend the local Kinchela School. When Kinchela School was asked by the local school inspectors to accept the boys from the Home the parents of the white children voted thirty three votes to one against the proposal. The Kinchela community voted again in the 1960s permitting Aboriginal students to attend the Kinchela School. A new school was built in 1941 (Kinchela Aboriginal Public School) and for the first time trained teachers were employed. Boys were also permitted to attend the high school in Kempsey after this time. The Kinchela Aboriginal Public School operated until 1962. The original Admissions Register, Punishment Books and Visitors Book for the Kinchela Aboriginal School can be found in the NSW State Archives. After the closure of the school the boys attended West Kempsey Primary School. Kinchela Boys Home was 16 miles from Kempsey on 32 acres of land alongside the Macleay River. In 1952 the home was described in DAWN magazine (published by the Aborigines Welfare Board) as having lawns, gardens, swimming pool and a playground. Twenty nine acres of the land was given over to a large vegetable garden and a dairy herd of 33 head and four horses. Weekly church services were held at the home together with Sunday School. The boys also participated in local sports activities during the 1950s, gaining a reputation in swimming, football, boxing and surf lifesaving. The location of the home on the river flats next to the Macleay River caused flooding problems on numerous occasions (as recorded in Dawn Magazine in 1954 and 1956). After 1959 whenever the Home flooded the boys would be relocated to the Aboriginal ReserveReserve 82168 at South West Rocks in the former South West Rocks Public School buildings. They would also use this place as a base for their South West Rocks sporting events and school holidays. DAWN Magazine of December 1954 described the Home: \\"buildings of a simple design and comprise dormitories, dining room, recreation room, kitchen, ablution block and the usual out buildings and school.\\" The same article notes some boys were given the privilege of attending the local picture theatre in Kempsey. If they attended with a white friend they could sit in the general area whilst other Aboriginal people had to sit in a segregated area of the theatre. Increasing Aboriginal activism together with the positive results of the 1967 Referendum which changed the Australian Constitution to include Aboriginal people, finally lead to the abolition of the Aborigines Welfare Board and changes to the way Aboriginal children were removed and segregated. The Kinchela Aboriginal Boys' Training Home was closed in 1970. After closure of the Home the Aboriginal community lobbied to keep it for the control and use of the Aboriginal Community. The Minister for Child and Social Welfare determined the site would be sold and advertised it to be auctioned on 5 May 1972. Thanks to the advocacy of strong Aboriginal voices, such as Mary Duroux, the government overturned its decision and the former home was passed into Aboriginal ownership. The former Kinchela Aboriginal Boys' Training Home now belongs to the Kempsey Local Aboriginal Land Council. The Land Council leased it to Benelong's Haven, a Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation Centre for Aboriginal people, for 41 years from 1976 to 2017. The organisation renovated the site, which had been described as \\"derelict\\" when they moved in. It went into liquidation and ceased operations on 5 December 2017. A future use for the site has not been determined. The former Kinchela Aboriginal Boys' Training Home is a place which is connected to very difficult memories. In 2002 a Kinchela Boys' Home Reunion was held at the site. Former residents describe the loneliness, fear, physical hardship and abuse they suffered at the home. They describe how their lives have been irreparably damaged as a result. At the time of the reunion their experiences were recorded in the local paper: \\"Jail was not as hard as that place. I can't remember a day I wasn't caned.\\" One man described being made to walk on his knees for five hours whilst holding a metal bar above his head. \\"All the boys were made to line up and every one, about 60, had to bash me as I walked down the line. If they didn't, they were made to follow behind me and be bashed themselves.\\" The Deputy Premier of New South Wales and Minister for Aboriginal Affairs used the occasion to formally apologise to the former Home Boys and congratulated them on their courage in returning.

The smaller parcel of 2 acres 3 rods and 38 perches fronts South West Rocks Road alongside the Macleay River. This parcel corresponds with Aboriginal Reserve AR174 gazetted 23/4/1883. This parcel contains all the buildings used for dormitories, staff accommodation, recreation, dining and the school as well as ancillary building such as the wood store. The other parcel is accessed via an unformed lane on the northern boundary called Herborn Street. The second parcel of 29 acres 2 rods and 20 perches was farming land with milking sheds and a chook shed located in the north western corner. The north western corner of this lot also contains significant trees including a large Ficus and a group of Bunya Pines. The property is low lying and floods frequently, i.e. almost on an annual basis. At the time of inspection in June 2011 the farm lot was under water and the property had recently been cut off for 6 days. The original dormitories constructed in 1924 were large \\"tin sheds\\"; these were replaced in 1935. The new school constructed at this time was a long rectangular building clad in fibro with a hipped corrugated steel roof. At the eastern end of the building was the \\"all weather shed\\" where boys would go for recreation in wet weather. This open room has since been enclosed. The main home building was designed in a U shape with its open end facing the road. The recreation hall/ gymnasium and dining rooms were located in the southern wing. The big boys dormitory was located in the centre and the small boys dormitory was located in the northern wing. The centre of the U was used for assembly and the boys would march from here around to the separate school building that was located on the northern side of the main building. Kitchens and stores were located behind the main building. All of these building have since been adapted for use by Benelong Haven. There was a laundry building on the southern boundary but this has been demolished. There was also a managers' residence at the front on the southern boundary that has been demolished. Out the front was also an orchard and was generally a \\"no go\\" area for the boys. There are two intact staff residences at the northern end of the property facing the road. Between these buildings and the school were the football field and the swimming pool. Along the eastern boundary of the front lot were a number of ancillary buildings housing the milk separator, stores and a wood shed which doubled as a punishment room. Benelong Haven took over the use of the property in 1976, several years after the Home was closed. The former home buildings were then renovated in 1988. The buildings were re- clad, reroofed and refurbished. A verandah was constructed interconnecting the complex of main buildings so that it could function during floods, fit outs were made for offices and accommodation and three new houses were built next to the former football field. The swimming pool has been filled in and the managers house has been demolished. The buildings were reported to be in good condition as at 7 July 2011. The property is reasonably intact. The layout is retained however buildings have been re-clad and adapted to other uses.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries The policies and practices of the New South Wales Government described below are historic and are not current policies and practices. The former Kinchela Aboriginal Boys' Training Home provides tangible evidence of the historic Government policy and practice of taking Aboriginal children away from their families and communities, severing all ties with their culture in order to assimilate them into white Australian society. Placement of Aboriginal boys in an institution that has become notoriously known as a place where cruelty, abuse and deprivation were an everyday occurrence, has caused ongoing health problems and cultural dislocation for the former residents and associated problems within the Aboriginal community. The place is associated with commemoration and healing of these individuals and communities and is a means to reconnect to the past. The former Kinchela Aboriginal Boys' Training Home provides historical evidence of the Government policy of assimilation that was based on Social Darwinism or the premise that \\"full blood\\" Aborigines would die out and the \\"mixed race\\" Aboriginals would soon have their Aboriginality bred out. The former Kinchela Aboriginal Boys' Training Home is evidence of the plan to train Aboriginal boys to become agricultural labourers demonstrating the prevalent ideology of the early and mid twentieth century that Aboriginal people were inferior in intelligence and only fit to become the servants of the rest of society. The Boys' Home provides an example of the historical practice of Aboriginal wards of the State being denied their Aboriginality and cultural heritage. This was the subject of a National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from their Families in 1997 (Commission of Inquiry). The nation was made aware of how widespread the practice of removal was, which affected every Aboriginal community but was outside the consciousness of mainstream Australians. The Kinchela Aboriginal Boys' Training Home provides contemporary Australia with physical evidence as a means to comprehend the pain and suffering inflicted by past assimilation practices. The former Home is a rare example of an Aboriginal Boys' Home in NSW and has the potential to provide insight into the accommodation and training of Aboriginal wards of the State in the first half of the twentieth century. Kinchela Aboriginal Boys' Training Home was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 17 February 2012 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The former Kinchela Aboriginal Boys' Training Home provides tangible evidence of the social theory and subsequent Government policy which controlled the lives of Aboriginal people throughout the 20th century. The belief that Aboriginal people were a \\"child\\" race and had to be protected for their own good, carried over from the 19th century and was enshrined as Government policy through the Aborigines Protection Board, which later became the Aborigines Welfare Board. The Boys' Home is a direct example of how the Board's policies were implemented and the government acted as a paternalistic force in Aboriginal lives. The Boys' Home provides physical evidence of the Government policy of assimilation as a means to empty the Aboriginal Reserves and force Aboriginal people to live like the rest of society. The training of children and removal from their families and culture was to provide them with the skills necessary, albeit as the servants to the rest of society. The Boys' Home as a training facility emphasised labouring and agricultural careers demonstrating the entrenched social theory of the 19th and greater part of the 20th centuries that Aboriginal people were inferior in intelligence and only capable of manual tasks. The employment of a former resident as a manager in the two years before the home closed, demonstrates the beginning of changing attitudes at the time of the Constitutional referendum concerning Aboriginal rights in 1967. The home provides historical evidence of the ethnocentric attitudes of mainstream Australian society which denied Aboriginal culture a place in that society until the 1967 Referendum. It demonstrates the implementation of Social Darwinism as Government policy which believed that \\"full blood Aborigines\\" would become extinct and the rest of the \\"half caste \\" population would be assimilated or absorbed into white society. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The former Kinchela Aboriginal Boys' Training Home is directly associated with the Aborigines Protection Board and the Aborigines Welfare Board. The Home is associated with Cootamundra Aboriginal Girls' Training Home to which many of the sisters of the boys sent to Kinchela, were sent. The Home is also associated with Bomaderry Children's Home where babies and young children were sent before being transferred to Kinchela Aboriginal Boys' Training Home. The Home provides an example of the historical practice of Aboriginal wards of the State being denied their Aboriginality and cultural heritage which was the subject of a National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from the Families in 1997 (Commission of Inquiry). The Home is associated with prominent individual Burnam Burnam ( Harry Penrith 1936-1997). The Home is also associated with Link-Up an organisation formed to unite former residents and families of children's homes. The Home is associated with the National Apology to the Stolen Generations in Federal Parliament in 2008 by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. The property has association with Benelong Aboriginal Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation Hostel which occupies the property today. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Kinchela Aboriginal Boys' Training Home has strong social significance for former residents and for the families and communities from whom the boys were taken. The place is associated with stories of deep personal grief and social and cultural dislocation and has also been demonstrated to be associated with ongoing heath issues for some past residents. The Home buildings provide a tangible link to the past for former residents. Memories associated with the place whether painful or not, are revisited when former residents visit the former home. Some former residents speak of the healing process experienced when returning whilst others don't ever want to return. Kinchela Aboriginal Boys' Training Home provides contemporary Australia with evidence of the practice of removing Aboriginal children from their families. This practice affected the lives of every Aboriginal Australian but was largely outside the consciousness of mainstream Australians until the 1997 Commission of Inquiry. The Home provides verification of past assimilation practices and the potential for greater understanding and compassion towards those who suffered as a result. The home provides evidence of the ongoing public debate which polarised the Australian community with the publication of the findings of the Commission of Inquiry in 1997. There was considerable debate, particularly over whether there should be a public apology to the \\"stolen generations\\". In 2008 the Prime Minister issued a public apology. The assimilation policies and removal of children have created ongoing issues for contemporary Aboriginal communities which have to deal with the cultural divergence that is the result of some Aboriginal people being raised in non-Aboriginal families or institutions. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The former Kinchela Aboriginal Boys' Training Home buildings provide evidence of the conditions experienced in the children's homes from 1924 until the 1970s. The original buildings together with descriptions of their former use, provide an insight into the domestic routine and the life of the home and methods used in raising Aboriginal wards of the State. Many of the oral histories of former residents describe the routine at the Home. The use of the former Home buildings reflects the early 20th century practice of placing Wards of the State in dormitories, divided by age. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Kinchela Aboriginal Boys' Training Home is the only surviving Aboriginal boys' training home in NSW. It was the longest surviving Aboriginal training facility for boys. The place has rarity as the only surviving built evidence of the assimilation policies which dictated that Aboriginal boys be institutionalised and trained as labourers in NSW. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The former Home is representative of the systemic historic government practice of assimilation of Aboriginal people during the 20th century.

History The Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC), founded in 1829, initially managed all matters related to golf in India. The RCGC instituted several prestigious national golf tournaments. RCGC members decided to establish a new organization in 1955 to facilitate the growth of golf in India beyond the major metropolitan centers, to organize junior level tournaments and to send teams abroad for international events. The Indian Golf Union was established in December 1955 through an initiative undertaken by some senior golfers in Calcutta, and supported by golfers in Delhi, Mumbai and Madras. All administrative powers of the RCGC were transferred to the IGU after the latter's establishment, including the right to conduct the Amateur Golf Championship of India. The RCGC, which had established the tournament, also donated the trophy to the IGU. A.D. Vickers served as the first President of the IGU, and Major L.B. Hirst, the Secretary of the RCGC, became the IGU's first Secretary. P.R. Surita was appointed as the first Honorary Secretary of the IGU in 1957. The IGU conducted the All India Amateur Golf Championship at the Delhi Golf club in 1958, the first time the tournament was held outside Calcutta. The IGU became affiliated with the International Golf Federation in 1958. The Union Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports derecognized the IGU on 1 April 2018 for failure to hold elections and non-compliance with the National Sports Code.

It consists of approximately six species of shrubs and small trees native to the West Indies, Mexico, Central America, and South America. Its type species, Prockia crucis, is highly polymorphic and has a broad distribution, from Mexico and the West Indies to Uruguay and northern Argentina. Historically, Prockia was characterized by having pseudo-axile placentation (i.e., parietal placentae that intrude into the center of the ovary and eventually fuse, appearing axile) and 3-merous flowers and lacking nectaries.Sleumer, H.O. 1980. Flacourtiaceae. Flora Neotropica 22: 1-499. However, discoveries of new species have confounded a simple morphological diagnosis of the genus, as P. pentamera has 5-merous flowers, and P. oaxacana and P. krusei are polygamodioecious or androdioecious and have more typical parietal placentation.
