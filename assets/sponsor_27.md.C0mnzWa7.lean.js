Wood professes to have collected the materials for his short notice of Bannard from some manuscript fragments extant in his time in the library of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, which formerly belonged to the library of Exeter Cathedral. Tanner adds that in the same college library (MS. cxvi.) there is a treatise directed against the views entertained by John Bannard, the Augustinian, on the question of the Immaculate Conception; but no mention of this author is to be found in Mr. Coxe's catalogue of the Oxford college manuscripts.

It is known from the holotype MPZ ELI-1, a partial skull from El√≠as site, and from the referred material MPZ2010/948, MPZ2010/949, MPZ2010/950 and MPZ2010/951, four teeth from Blasi 2 site. It was found by the researchers Jos√© Manuel Gasca and Ainara Badiola from the Tremp Formation, in Ar√©n of Huesca, Spain. It was first named by Eduardo Pu√©rtolas, Jos√© I. Canudo and Pen√©lope Cruzado- Caballero in 2011 and the type species is Arenysuchus gascabadiolorum. The generic name refers to the finding site, and \\"suchus\\", from Greek meaning crocodile. The specific name honours the researchers who discovered the holotype. Etymology Arenysuchus was named and described in 2011 by Eduardo Pu√©rtolas and his colleagues for a partial skull and teeth. For the generic name, Areny is named after Ar√©n, spelt as Areny in the Catalan language, the locality where the skull was found, and souchus, the Greek word for crocodile, leading to Latin, suchus. The specific epithet of \\"gascabadiolorum\\" is dedicated to the researchers Jos√© Manuel Gasca and Ainara Badiola, who discovered the holotype. Description Holotype skull ELI-1 in two other views Arenysuchus is known a partial skull and four teeth. One feature linking it to early crocodilians is the contact of the frontal bones with the margin of the supratemporal fenestrae, two holes in the top of the skull. The frontal bone is also unusual in that its front end is extremely long. A sharp projection of the frontal divides the nasal bones, making up most of the midline length of the snout. Usually, the nasal bones would occupy the midline and the frontal would be restricted near the eye sockets. Near the frontal, the lacrimal bones are unusually wide in comparison to their length. Below the supratemporal fenestrae are the Infratemporal fenestra, long openings along the side of the skull behind the eyes. The infratemporal bar (a projection of the jugal bone below the infratemporal fenestra) is very thin and vertically expanded. In most other crocodilians, it is thicker and laterally, not vertically, expanded. The edges of the orbits, or eye sockets, are raised. The orbit edges of more advanced crocodyloids like modern crocodiles are also raised, but those of the closest relatives of Arenysuchus are not. Another feature of Arenysuchus that distinguishes it from other basal crocodyloids is its small palatine process, a bony plate of the maxilla that forms the front portion of the palate. The palatine process of basal crocodyloids usually extends to the suborbital fenestrae, a pair of holes on the underside of the skull beneath the orbits. In Arenysuchus, the process is much shorter. Arenysuchus also has a pit between the seventh and eighth maxillary teeth that is otherwise only seen in \\"Crocodylus\\" affinis. This pit would hold a dentary tooth if the lower jaw were present. All other teeth of the lower jaw are set inward from those of the upper jaw, so they are covered by the upper teeth when the jaws are closed. =Distinguishing anatomical features= Arenysuchus can be distinguished by the following features: an infratemporal bar that is tabular and vertically oriented, with little dorsoventral thickness and an extreme lateromedial compression; the dorsal portion of the anterior process of the frontal bone has a very elongated and lanceolate morphology; the anterior process of the frontal projects strongly beyond the main body of the frontal and extends between the nasals, ending in a sharp point beyond the anterior margin of the orbits and the prefrontal bone, at the height of the anterior end of the lacrimal bone. Phylogeny Cladogram with skull diagrams In Pu√©rtolas, Canudo & Cruzado-Caballero's phylogenetic analysis, Arenysuchus was found to be one of the most basal members of Crocodyloidea, the superfamily of crocodilians that includes crocodiles and their extinct relatives. Other basal crocodyloids include Prodiplocynodon and \\"Crocodylus\\" affinis from North America and Asiatosuchus from Europe. Of these genera, only Arenysuchus and Prodiplocynodon are known from the Late Cretaceous, making them the earliest known crocodyloids. Below is a cladogram after Pu√©rtolas, Canudo & Cruzado-Caballero, 2011: Paleobiology Arenysuchus was part of an initial evolutionary radiation of crocodylians in the Northern Hemisphere during the Late Cretaceous. During the late Maastrichtian, Europe was an island archipelago surrounded by shallow seas. In this archipelago, crocodilians made up the majority of the crocodylomorph fauna. In the southern hemisphere, however, crocodilians were not yet common, with other crocodylomorphs like metasuchians comprising the dominant fauna. Crocodilians were entirely absent from Europe before this time. Dinosaurs were abundant, with a diversity of sauropods, theropods, and ornithopods. With the formation of the archipelago, a faunal turnover took place in the late Maastrichtian. Dinosaurs became much rarer, primarily represented by hadrosaurs. Crocodylians radiated to become a much larger component of the island ecosystems. With the exception of Prodiplocynodon, Late Cretaceous North American crocodylians were mostly alligatoroids and gavialoids. In what is known as vicariance, migration did not occur between Europe and North America, separating the two crocodilian faunas. It was not until the Paleocene that crocodyloids diversified into the more derived relatives of Arenysuchus. Paleoecology Excavation site The Elias site, located west of Ar√©n, is on the west end of the Tremp Syncline. Geographically, the site is located in Unit 2 of the Tremp Formation, and equivalent of the Conques Formation. In the same section of the Tremp Formation, but lower down, are the Blasi sites 1-3. The dinosaurs Arenysaurus and Blasisaurus are both from Blasi 1-3. The Tremp Formation is made up of of reddish rock in the South Pyrenean central Unit. Lower in the formation is a mix of platform marine deposits, that are late Campanian to Maastrichtian in age. Blasi 1 is located in the upper Ar√©n Formation, with Blasi 3 extending into the upper Tremp Formation. The Tremp Formation dates to the late Cretaceous. It has been dated by means of planktonic foraminifers and magnetostratigraphy. The formation includes the planktonic Abathomphalus mayaroensis Biozone, which was dated in 2011 from 68.4 to 65.5 Ma. This gives the formation a late Campanian to early Danian age. The bottom of the Elias site is about 67 million years old, so the site dates from 67.6 to 65.5 Ma.

His developments received universal recognition and serve as a basis for considerable part of the optical designs used today. Biography Ludwig Jakob Bertele was born 25 December 1900 in Munich, to an architect‚Äôs family. In 1916 he began to work as an assistant of optics designer in Rodenstock firm in Munich. In 1919 he went to Dresden to work in . He worked there under the supervision of August Klughardt as designer of optics.Hartmut Thiele.

Auflage mit erweiterten Tabellen, Privatdruck M√ºnchen 2007, p. 34 In 1919 Ludwig Bertele started to develop a type of optical scheme, subsequently known as . He has taken for a basis an optical scheme of cinema lens Ultrastigmat, a modified triplet, which was calculated by Charles C. Minor in 1916 and being produced by Gundlach Company. The main purpose was the increasing of light-gathering power and diminution of aberration. In 1923, after four years of intensive efforts, he has patentedPatents for lens Ernostar: * Great Britain ‚Ññ 191,702, * Germany ‚Ññ 401,274, * USA ‚Ññ 1,584,271. his first ultra high-aperture objective Ernostar f/2, its successive versions followed until 1926. That lens was fitted to the Ermanox camera, which was specially developed for photo reportage. This was the first camera having sufficient speed and image quality for candid photography in available light conditions. The pictures of prominent political figures taken with it by Erich Salomon are widely known.Rudolf Kingslake. A history of photographic lens. Academic Press , San Diego, USA 1989, p. 111 After the foundation of Zeiss Ikon in 1926, as a result of integration of companies ICA (Internationale Camera Actiengesellschaft), Optische Anstalt CP Goerz, Contessa-Nettel and with Carl Zeiss, Ludwig Bertele continued his work in Dresden except for a short trip to United States in 1929. An experimental optical workshop was given at the disposal of Bertele. That shop made all examples and prototypes of Bertele's calculations. Every lens got a unique five-cipher number; often a current number of the variant was also engraved. In the late 1920s Bertele began the development of a series of excellent lenses, based generally on the second Ernostar type, which was developed in 1924 (i.e., each lens had a single positive element in front of it followed by a thick negative meniscus- shaped component, with a positive element behind). In 1931, the first example of such lenses appeared. It received the name Sonnar.Patents for lens Sonnar: * Great Britain ‚Ññ 383,591, * Germany ‚Ññ 570,983, * USA ‚Ññ 1,998,704. This lens consisted of seven elements in three groups with a maximum aperture of f/2. The main difference from his predecessor Ernostar was a lesser number of optical groups and therefore lesser light dispersion and higher contrast. Those lenses proved extraordinarily successful and got high marks from specialists. In 1932 a Sonnar f/1.5 appeared, which was fitted to Zeiss Ikon's 35 mm Contax cameras. with Sonnar versions following with focal lengths from 50 to 300 mm been developed until 1940. Around 1934, Bertele, having taken the scheme of Sonnar as a basis, created the first wide-angle lens Biogon with a 60¬∞ viewing angle. In 1935, Ludwig Bertele calculated the Sonnar 180mm/2.8 on the occasion of the XI summer Olympic Games of 1936 in Berlin - hence the name \\"Olympia Sonnar\\". It was a fabulous lens, which made an image of highest quality with beautiful bokeh. This lens has been appreciated by photographers and collectors up to now. Between 1943 and 1945, Ludwig Bertele was working in firm, situated in Munich and Lustenau . That firm worked for German weapons manufacturers, a/o, the German Ministry of aviation. As Zeiss in Dresden and Jena had become part of the Soviet Zone of Occupation in 1945, they were required to transfer these designs as well as machinery and staff for training to Russia and the Ukraine, where all Sonnars were produced in vast numbers under the \\"Jupiter\\" designation, constituting by far the most desirable optical products from behind the Iron Curtain until this day. The East and West German Zeiss production was tiny by comparison, while Ludwig Bertele, fortunately in absence, had become the most significant optical designer of the former Soviet Union for over four decades. In 1946, he moved to Switzerland, where he founded an optical bureau and started to work in Wild Heerbrugg Company (now Leica Geosystems) in the field of photogrammetry and geodesic devices. In 1950 he created an aerial 90¬∞ viewing-angle lens Aviogon, which was free from optical aberrations. Distortion was less than 10 ¬µm at any point of the image field, and the resolution at F/4.5 was excellent. The new lens quickly replaced the Topogon and Metrogon as the standard lens for aerial photography and photogrammetry. This lens, as well as 120¬∞ Super Aviogon, which appeared in 1956, won a great number of prizes and merited general recognition.Rudolf Kingslake. A history of photographic lens. Academic Press , San Diego, USA 1989, p. 151 At the same time he computed new optical designs for Carl Zeiss in Oberkochen. Thus, a Biogon with 90¬∞ viewing-angle appeared in 1954. This new design was the basis of ultra wide-angle lenses, such as Biogon F/4.5 21 mm 1954 for Contax; Biogon F/4.5 38 mm 1954 for Hasselblad; Biogon F/4.5 53 mm and Biogon F/4.5 75 mm 1955 for Linhof. NASA used the Hasselblad Biogon to document Project Gemini (1965/66) and later the Apollo program (1968-72)., p.92 In addition to this he developed objectives for Schacht firm and got special tasks for computations of oculars etc.Hartmut Thiele. Entwicklung und Beschreibung der Photoobjektive und ihre Erfinder; Carl Zeiss Jena, 2. Auflage mit erweiterten Tabellen, Privatdruck M√ºnchen 2007, p. 35 He left the firm in 1956, continuing his own research and giving consultations. In 1959, he was awarded the rank of Honorary Doctor of ETH Zurich and he appraised it greatly. Having retired in 1973, Ludwig Bertele continued to work a lot. He received his last patent in 1976. In his last years he lived in the small town Wildhaus in canton St. Gallen in Switzerland. He died on 16 November 1985. Interesting facts * The name Sonnar is derived from German word ‚ÄúSonne‚Äù (Sun). * The name Sonnar had been used previously by the Contessa Company for one of their folding cameras and for the Tessar-type lens fitted to it. After Contessa became part of Zeiss Ikon the name Sonnar became Zeiss‚Äôs property. * Optical scheme Ernostar, developed by Ludwig Bertele, serves as a basis for lens Canon EF 135mm F/2.0 L, which is very popular among portrait photographers. The Sonnar scheme is also used in the Sony Carl Zeiss Sonnar T* 135/1.8 ZA lens, which is being produced for Sony A-mount SLR cameras.  References   Bibliography  * Hartmut Thiele.

It is considered an early classic work of comparative politics and letters. Whitman, who was then working as a federal clerk, does much to expound on the influence of the Louisiana Purchase and expansion on the American spirit, character, and body politic (foreshadowing Frederick Jackson Turner's frontier thesis). In it, he criticizes Thomas Carlyle's Shooting Niagara: and after? and other literary works. It also comments on the Industrial Revolution and the predecessors of Modernism, which chose restraint and rationality above emotion and feelings. Whitman condemned the corruption and greed of the Gilded Age, denouncing the post-Civil War materialism that had overtaken the country. ‚ÄúNever was there, perhaps, more hollowness at heart than at present, and here in the United States. Genuine belief seems to have left us,‚Äù he wrote. His solution to the moral crisis was literature: \\"Two or three really original American poets...would give more compaction and more moral identity, (the quality to-day most needed) to these States, than all its Constitutions, legislative and judicial ties,‚Äù he declared, believing that literature would unite the country.

Born in Leeds to a Scottish father and Zulu mother, both from South Africa, Robert grew up in Zimbabwe and attended university in England. She converted to Islam in 1998. Currently Robert divides her time between London and Cairo with her three sons and two daughters. Her husband Henry Amankwah died in April 2015. Early life Robert's family moved from England to Ethiopia when she was two years old and then four years later relocated to Zimbabwe where Robert received her formal primary education. Robert had a typical middle-class childhood with her younger brother and sister in the suburbs of the capital city Harare. As well as being immersed in Zimbabwean culture, Robert's parents instilled in the children their South African roots and a strong political consciousness. Her father, Robert McLaren, was a senior lecturer at the University of Zimbabwe and her mother, Thembi McLaren, was an entrepreneur. After graduating high school in Zimbabwe, Robert returned to England for university and earned a first-class degree from the University of London. Conversion During her university studies Robert travelled to Egypt as an amateur musician and singer playing traditional Zimbabwean compositions at a music festival. Her initial reaction to the hijab-wearing Muslim women was to be \\"appalled\\" but finally asked an especially beautiful Egyptian woman why she would choose to cover her beauty: 'Because,' she said, 'I want to be judged for what I say and what I do, not for what I look like.\\" After their exchange Robert says, \\"I began to think about my life, about my own self-image and how I wanted to grow and develop.\\" Robert returned to London and began reading the Marmaduke Pickthall translation of the Quran, learning about Islam and Islamic law, and she gave \\"dressing modestly a try.\\" Over the Christmas holiday that same year Robert travelled to \\"Muslim Africa, to Guinea\\" where she found that \\"As someone still steeped in the ideals of Black nationalism, these Muslims appealed to my own African identity and my sense of Black pride.\\" In Guinea Robert began making the Islamic five daily prayers, fasted during Ramadan and upon her return to London announced her shahada (declaration of Islamic faith) in 1998. Writing career =Fiction= After teaching in the classroom and founding a private home school, Robert began writing multicultural picture books with Muslim themes for children. Her first picture book, The Swirling Hijab, was included in the Booktrust programme. Robert's picture books and young adult fiction have had cross-over appeal being accepted for inclusion in state settings, such as schools and multicultural training, as well as recognised as Islamic fiction amongst Muslims. To date she has published thirteen picture books for children, many of which are used in dual language settings and are published in up to 31 languages, including Tamil, Kurdish, Portuguese, Japanese, Russian, Yoruba, Czech, Arabic, Polish, Chinese, Urdu, Panjabi, French, Swahili and Farisi. Journey Through Islamic Arts was awarded the UK National Literacy Trust Association WOW! Award for Best Children's titles. After the success of her autobiography, From My Sisters' Lips, Robert began writing young adult (YA) Islamic fiction. Her first YA novel, From Somalia, With Love was inspired by a weekend retreat with a group of Somali youth, arranged by the Somali Integration Team. From Somalia, With Love is one of the few novels available with Somali Muslim characters and subjects. It was included in the World Book Day 2009 school's pack and was long-listed for the United Kingdom Literacy Association Award. Robert's second YA novel, Boy vs. Girl, challenged common stereotypes about young Muslims in Britain and featured a cameo appearance of Urban Islamic graffiti artist Muhammed 'Aerosol Arabic' Ali. Robert's third YA title, Far From Home, is a historical fiction novel set in Zimbabwe and is featured in the 2011 Pop-Up Festival of Stories in London. In 2005 Robert's agent encouraged her to write an autobiography which became the international Muslim best-seller From My Sisters' Lips. In addition to being a memoir, From My Sisters' Lips uniquely includes the personal narratives of several other converts and reverts to Islam, \\"[From My Sisters' Lips] systematically describes the process of reversion from first impression through conversion, hijab, and the manner of marriage in Islam. It opens the doors to the private thought processes and struggles that confront new Muslims and makes the difficult understandable and even funny. From My Sisters' Lips has been translated and published in Arabic. As the founder and editor of the UK-based international Muslim women's SISTERS Magazine, Robert and the magazine's contributors have pioneered in addressing commonly taboo topics within the Muslim community, such as child abuse, miscarriage, domestic violence, depression and self-esteem issues among Muslim women. Robert has given support to and created alliances among SISTERS Magazine and many Muslim community organisations, such as Mercy Mission UK, Solace, Nour DV, The Muslim Youth Helpline and Half Date. In addition to writing an editorial for each edition of SISTERS Magazine, Robert writes articles about Islam and Muslim related issues, such as Ramadan, Muslim holidays, hijab (Islamic scarf) and niqƒÅb (Islamic face veil) for mainstream publications, including The Times Online, The Times newspaper, and The Observer. Robert has spoken to audiences about Muslim related issues on the BBC's Sunday Morning Live, Woman's Hour, Radio London, Channel 5, Newsnight, BBC Asian Network, GMT with Lorraine Kelly, and BBC Radio 4's The Moral Maze. In 2014 she launched her critically acclaimed YA title, She Wore Red Trainers, a love story which explores the Muslim identity. NiqƒÅb Robert is a full-time observer of the niqƒÅb (Islamic face-veil) and a vocal advocate for women's right to choose to fully cover. Soon after becoming Muslim in 1998 Robert began to wear the niqƒÅb full- time in 1999. In her memoir, From My Sisters' Lips, Robert explained the effect of wearing niqƒÅb, \\"[The covered woman] cannot be judged on her appearance because nothing personal about her can be seen...She does not feel the need to live up to society's changing expectations of women's bodies...So whoever relates to her must relate to what she has presented ‚Äì be it what she says, does or thinks.\\" Robert is one of the founding members of Veiled Justice and has represented the East London Mosque on Muslim women's issues. She has spoken in support of the niqƒÅb in numerous British media, including The Telegraph, BBC News, The Times Online, BBC Radio 4's The Moral Maze and Channel 4's Undercover Mosque series; as well as speaking to Muslim and international media outlets, such as for Islam Channel and AIM TV. Robert's young adult fiction novel Boy vs. Girl includes the niqƒÅb-wearing character, Auntie Najma. The Auntie Najma character has been both negatively and positively criticised as either an unrealistic portrayal or as a positive role-model for Muslim youth. Robert has said that Auntie Najma, like the other characters, is an amalgamation of real sisters she knows personally.

In 1895, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ceded jurisdiction of Wheatfield Road to the War Department, and in 1900 two cast iron identification tablets were placed to label the road. \\"Outside Wheatfield Rd (past Rose farm): On August 14 [1893] a Confederate avenue was surveyed, which was temporarily named the 'Outside Wheatfield avenue' beginning at the Emmitsburg road, 800 feet southwest of the crossroads at the Peach Orchard, running easterly to the lands of the Memorial Association, thence in a southeasterly direction by the lands of the Memorial Association, and terminating on a west line of the Crawford tract, near Devil's Den.\\" The Gettysburg Electric Railway tracks were removed from the Wheatfield Road in 1917 and the road was repaired in 1931. The Wheatfield Road was resurfaced with asphalt west of Sykes Avenue in 1933, and completed \\"from the Rosensteel pavilion to the Taneytown road\\" in 1940 by the McMillan Woods Civilian Conservation Corps camp.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Brampton, the archdeaconry of Carlisle, and the diocese of Carlisle. Its benefice is united with those of four nearby parishes. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History The present church was built in 1869‚Äì70 on the site of a previous medieval church, which had itself been rebuilt in 1811 and extended in 1843. The architects were the Lancaster partnership of Paley and Austin. The church cost about ¬£2,000 (equivalent to ¬£ as of ). Architecture =Exterior= St Mary's is constructed in red sandstone on an ashlar chamfered plinth. It has quoins, a string course, and slate roofs with coped gables, a cross finial, and decorative ridge tiles. The plan consists of a four-bay nave, a north aisle, a three-bay chancel, and a tower incorporating a porch at the northwest. On the west wall of the tower is a stair turret. The entrance to the porch is through a pointed doorway on the north side. The bell openings are also pointed, they contain louvres, and are Early English in style. On top of the tower is a pyramidal roof with small louvres. The sides of the church differ. The south side contains tall lancet windows and one quatrefoil. The north side has a catslide roof extending from the ridge to the edge of the aisle. It contains smaller lancet windows. At the west end are a pair of lancet windows and a rose window. At the east end are three equal-sized lancet windows with a quatrefoil above. =Interior= The pews and all the furnishings date from the 19th or early 20th century. At the base of the font is a fragment of a cross from the 10th or 11th century. On the walls are marble memorial plaques moved from the earlier church. The reredos dates from 1899 and consists of a mosaic framed in alabaster. The stained glass in the east window is by William Wailes and is dated 1869. In the north aisle is a window by Heaton, Butler and Bayne from about 1912. The age of the single- manual organ is not known, but it thought to have been built by Samuel Renn of Manchester. External features In the churchyard is a hearse house dating from the early 19th century. It is constructed in calciferous sandstone and has a slate roof. It has been listed at Grade II. It is probable that its round-arched window comes from the 1813 church.

CKFG's studios are located on Kern Road in the Don Mills neighbourhood of North York, while its transmitter is located at the top of First Canadian Place in Downtown Toronto. The station is targeted to the local Black Canadian community and began broadcasting on October 3, 2011. The station airs a mix of R&B;, soul music, reggae, soca, hip hop, world beat, gospel, and smooth jazz that targets the 25-54 age demographic within the Caribbean and African communities. Coverage area The station's signal covers most of the city of Toronto, and extends towards Milton, Oakville, Brampton, Aurora, and Pickering. However, in the northeastern part of the GTA, particularly in the Scarborough area, reception of CKFG is often impacted by CBLA-FM's repeater in Peterborough. To try and remedy this interference in Scarborough and in Durham Region, Intercity applied for a re-broadcaster on 102.7 MHz as part of the CRTC's call for applications of new radio stations in May 2014. The CRTC declined the request on November 5, 2014, and instead awarded a new license to East FM, who launched CJRK-FM on that frequency. History =Founding= The station was founded by Fitzroy Gordon, a Jamaican-Canadian who immigrated to Canada in 1979 who became a late night disc jockey on CHIN Radio in the 1990s hosting a programme aimed at the Caribbean community. The station was originally licensed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission in 2006,\\"Caribbean radio station set for Toronto at 98.7 FM\\". Toronto Star, February 2, 2011. but as the proposed 98.7 frequency was second adjacent to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's CBLA-FM, the approval was made conditional on the new station's owner, Fitzroy Gordon, submitting a revised application for a different frequency. Milestone Radio also filed an intervention, stating that the station's proposed format duplicated that company's Flow 93.5. The station did not file a revised application, however, and the initial authorization lapsed; instead, Gordon subsequently reapplied for the same 98.7 frequency. Accordingly, Industry Canada allowed the station to broadcast a test signal for three weeks in 2010 to determine whether the frequency could be used without impacting CBLA. The test signal, a mix of reggae, rhythm and blues, hip hop, gospel and soca music, was branded as Caribbean African Radio Network, or CARN. The test found no significant interference, and on June 9, 2011, Gordon's Intercity Broadcasting Network received CRTC approval to use the 98.7 frequency. The CBC again noted its objection to the licensing of a second-adjacent frequency; four commercial broadcast groups ‚Äî Rogers Media, Astral Media, Bell Media and Durham Radio ‚Äî also filed comments in support of the CBC's position. The station's call sign CKFG is named after the founder Fitzroy Gordon. Gordon stated that the station's goal was to have at least a temporary signal on air in time for the 2011 Scotiabank Toronto Caribbean Carnival, but did not immediately confirm a permanent launch date. RadioInsight revealed on October 1 that the station would begin airing on October 3. On that day, the station officially signed on the air and changed monikers to \\"G 98.7\\". =On the air= 170px On November 28, 2011, at 6 AM, the station aired its first live broadcast with the song \\"I Can See Clearly Now\\" by Jimmy Cliff, then founder Fitzroy Gordon said a prayer, before handing it over to morning hosts Mark Strong and Jemeni, both formerly of Flow 93.5. The station is also slated to air local news and sports programming, as well as talk shows relating to the African and Caribbean communities. Virtually during the same time CKFG-FM signed on the air, its rival CFXJ-FM flipped from rhythmic contemporary back to urban contemporary (that station has eventually switched back to Rhythmic CHR as of 2017-18). Ironically, because there are no other R&B;/Hip-Hop or Adult R&B; outlets in Canada, the only major music chart CKFG reports to is the BDS Canadian Top 40 chart panel. In 2012, Intercity Broadcasting was one of 27 applicants for the 88.1 frequency vacated by the revocation in early 2011 of CKLN-FM's license,\\"Stations vie for vacant radio licence\\" The Globe and Mail, 18 December 2012. applying to move CKFG-FM to the 88.1 frequency.Broadcasting Notice of Consultation CRTC 2012-126. Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, March 2, 2012. The bid was unsuccessful and the CRTC awarded the frequency to CIND-FM. On October 21, 2014, it was announced that Gordon was granted a licence by the CRTC to launch a national Black/Caribbean television station. It would have been the second Black Canadian television service after FEVA TV, which launched in August 2014 and targets African-Canadians.

Soon after his death, shareholder and former chief financial officer Delford Blythe initiated court proceedings in an attempt to take financial control of the station, alleging significant mismanagement by Gordon which was threatening the station's survival.\\"Toronto's G98.7-FM in financial peril, according to court records\\". The Globe and Mail, June 17, 2019. The station was put into receivership as a result. In 2019, the station reportedly owed ‚Äúmore than $200,000 to the Canada Revenue Agency; $183,000 to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, the federal regulator; and additional sums of more than $165,000 to creditors who have received judgments against the station.\\" By 2020, debts were reported to be in excess of $2,000,000.

The Yogi Gita encapsulates the necessary attributes one must imbibe in order to progress spiritually and become Brahmarup or attaining the highest level of spiritual enlightenment. The Yogi Gita contains invaluable interpretations of Swaminarayan's teachings from the Vachanamrut. This, too, provides an expansive view of the Akshar- Purushottam Darshan, the doctrinal foundation of BAPS philosophy. The Yogi Gita begins with a letter from Yogiji Maharaj to a devout follower and Prarthana or prayer offered in Mahelav, Gujarat. The Yogi Gita continues with the Jivan Bhavna, a collection of Yogiji Maharaj's life philosophy and guidance, and the Hrudayni Vato, a collection of words of wisdom.Yogi Gita. Swaminarayan Aksharpith(2002). Origins The Yogi Gita consists of a letter which was written over a period of three days, from 28 March to 1 April 1941, as well as a prayer said at Shastriji Maharaj's birthplace 9 December 1966. In 1940, Yogiji Maharaj came down with a severe case of dysentery in Rajkot. When Shastriji Maharaj, his guru, heard of Yogiji Maharaj's plight, he sent an attendant named Jagivan Ruda Poriya to nurse Yogiji Maharaj back to health. Upon Yogiji Maharaj's full recovery, Jagjivan asked to be sent off with Yogiji Maharaj's spiritual wisdom as ‚Äúreward‚Äù for his efforts. In response to the request, Yogiji Maharaj wrote the letter that would later become a part of the Yogi Gita.Sadhu Viveksagardas, Yogi Gita Marma (Gujarati) (Discourses on Yogi Gita). Swaminarayan Aksharpith. 2008. . Sections =Letter to a Satsangi= In his letter to Jagjivan. the \\"satsangi,\\" Yogiji Maharaj reinforced the importance of three basic qualities: Samp or cooperation, Suhradhaybhav or friendship, and Ekta or unity, and indicated that all devotees should strive to live by these principles. Yogiji Maharaj also described the following principles that he believed would lead to eternal peace and happiness: *Service, Humility and Attaining Moksha: Yogiji Maharaj stressed the importance of Atmanishta or believing oneself to be the soul as one of the pre-requisites to attaining liberation. The values of faithfulness and total surrender to God and his sadhu and his belief that one should live as das no das or the servant of God's servant were also succinctly explained within the section. *Avoiding Gossip: This short section addresses how gossiping reduces the virtues of an aspirant and is one of the biggest obstacles on the path to liberation. *Realization of one's Faults: To highlight the need for introspection, Yogiji Maharaj referred to the words of Jaga Bhagat. Yogiji Maharaj wrote that if one begins to look at the faults of other, they should pause and look at their own faults instead. *Tolerance and Forgiveness: Yogiji Maharaj described these two virtues as amongst the most powerful qualities a spiritual aspirant could have. *Mutual Affection: Yogiji Maharaj explained the need for a collaborative understanding of various principles. *Spiritual Discourses: Yogiji Maharaj stated that by constantly listening to spiritual discourses and absorbing the knowledge inherent in them one would experience tranquility and inner happiness.Sadhu Viveksagardas, Yogi Gita Marma (Gujarati) (Discourses on Yogi Gita). Swaminarayan Aksharpith. 2008. . =Prarthana= The second section contains Yogiji Maharaj's earnest prayer to Shastriji Maharaj while at Mehelav. Yogiji Maharaj used various spiritual qualities of Shastriji Maharaj as examples to illustrate the tenets that devotees should instill in themselves. In essence, Yogiji Maharaj prayed that all devotees could become as virtuous and devout as Shastriji Maharaj.Yogi gita. Swaminarayan Aksharpith(2002). =Jivan Bhavna= The editors of the text compiled various proverbs of Yogiji Maharaj that encapsulated his insights and philosophy of life.Yogi gita. Swaminarayan Aksharpith(2002). =Hrudayni Vato= Literally meaning \\"the sayings of the heart,\\" this section explores numerous sayings and empirical teachings of Yogiji Maharaj. It focuses on the spiritual attributes that are necessary for one to attain liberation. Yogiji Maharaj reinforced the fact that devotees would never suffer from misery if they had a firm refuge in God.Yogi gita. Swaminarayan Aksharpith(2002). Importance to BAPS To devotees of the BAPS Swaminarayan sect, the Yogi Gita is an inspirational text that aims to increase the spiritual purity of ordinary believers. Yogiji Maharaj's own virtuous life and esteem in the eyes of BAPS followers give added weight to the teachings present in this work.Williams Raymond. (1984) A New Face of Hinduism: The Swaminarayan Religion. Cambridge University Press. A theme prevalent throughout the Yogi Gita is the Akshar-Purshottam Darshan and the belief that true spiritual awakening and liberation can be achieved only with the help of a Satpurush ‚Äì a God-realized soul.Yogi gita. Swaminarayan Aksharpith(2002). In the Yogi Gita, this Satpurush was Shastriji Maharaj. Devotees within the sect often use Yogiji Maharaj's adherence to his guru's principles and intense devoutness as prime examples of how an ideal spiritual life should be led.Sadhu Viveksagardas, Yogi Gita Marma (Gujarati) (Discourses on Yogi Gita).

Early life  McPherson was born and grew up in Golders Green, North London. She was the only child of Sadie and Max Egelnick, a tailor. Both parents were secular Jewish Communists from Eastern European immigrant families. McPherson was a good student at Copthall County Grammar School in Mill Hill but found it difficult to get a place to study medicine owing to her political background and gender. However, she was offered a place at St George's Hospital Medical School where she excelled in her studies and busied herself with social, political and academic activities.  Career  Throughout McPherson's career she aimed to communicate to the public about medicine, improve 'the patient journey' and help doctors and patients to understand each other. = General Practitioner = Having graduated with a distinction in 1968, McPherson chose to pursue General Practice and trained at Caversham Practice in Kentish Town, London and at Harvard, in Boston USA. In 1979 McPherson became Principal at a practice in Oxford where she worked until 2007 when she retired for her own health reasons. As a GP, McPherson became known for having a 'sixth sense' in diagnosing her patients. McPherson was respected for being ready to fight her patients' corner with consultants and for being available to concerned patients by phone on evenings and weekends. Following her own experience of overcoming breast cancer, McPherson co-founded the Database of Individual Patient Experiences or 'DIPEx', with the aim of providing a resource that would enable patients, families and health professionals to understand the experience of a variety of health conditions, by watching video clips of people talking about their experiences. The websites healthtalkonline.org and youthhealthtalk.org now cover over 60 health conditions. The research is carried out by The Health Experiences Research Group at Oxford University. The group was founded by McPherson herself and she held the position of Medical Director, until her death in 2011. At the time McPherson died, she was fundraising towards establishing The Health Experiences Research Institute in Oxford with the aim of becoming \\"the world's first interdisciplinary academic research centre dedicated to understanding the attitudes, values and experiences of people coping with illness or making decisions about their health, and to use this to make a difference\\" at Green Templeton College. McPherson was a champion of young people's health and held the position of Chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners adolescent task group, served on the Independent Advisory Committee on Teenage Pregnancy and was a founding Trustee of the Association of Young People‚Äôs Health. = Author = McPherson published 30 books including Women's Health in General Practice, written with Deborah Waller. In 1987 McPherson co- authored the book 'Diary of Teenage Health Freak' with Aidan McFarlane. The book was published in 27 languages, sold over 1 million copies. The book inspired McPherson and McFarlane to set up a website, Teenagehealthfreak, where children and teenagers can find out about health issues and contact 'Dr. Ann' the virtual doctor with their problems. The television comedy series Teenage Health Freak was based on the book. = Campaigning for Assisted Dying = In 2009, McPherson wrote an article for the British Medical Journal in support of a change in the law to allow terminally ill patients the option of assisted suicide or 'assisted dying' which was the term that Ann preferred. She received numerous emails and letters from other doctors in support of her position. Encouraged by this support, she founded Healthcare Professionals for Assisted Dying in October 2010, which had more than 400 members at the time of writing. McPherson took her campaign to the mainstream media appearing, among others, in the Independent and on the Today programme) and Sky News. McPherson was also a Patron of Dignity in Dying.  Personal life  Ann married Klim McPherson in May 1968. The couple lived in North Oxford and had 3 children; Sam, Tess and Beth who produced five grandchildren with one more on the way, at the time McPherson died (now seven grandchildren). Ann enjoyed spending time in the South of France relaxing with her family. McPherson recovered from breast cancer in the late 1990s but was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2007. Ann died on 28 May 2011 aged 65. Among those paying tribute to McPherson was the actor Hugh Grant, whom she had persuaded to become Patron to The DIPEx Charity. He said \\"Ann was an amazing woman, doctor, author, campaigner and founder of the inspired healthtalkonline. I am so delighted she nagged me into helping with it and I am so sorry for her family, for medicine and for the country that she has gone\\".  Awards and accolades  In 2000 McPherson was given a CBE for her work on women's and adolescent health. She received the Medical Journalists' Association's Lifetime Achievement Award in July 2010. In 2011 McPherson received the British Medical Journal's Health Communicator of the Year award.

The instrumental is made up of a four bar introduction, a 16 bar verse followed by a 32 bar chorus, after which the verse and chorus are repeated with a 2 bar extended ending. The same melody is used for the verses, but both choruses have different melodies though nearly identical chords. Only on the last refrain of the chorus do we hear the melody which can be identified as \\"Davenport Blues\\". Both choruses end in different chord progressions.

Cast * Marshall Allman as Donald \\"Don\\" Miller * Claire Holt as Penny * Jason Marsden as Kenny * Tania Raymonde as Lauryn * Eric Lange as The Hobo * Justin Welborn as The Pope Production Steve Taylor pitched the film to investors for four years until two investors, one from Seattle and one from Los Angeles, agreed to sign on for $250,000 each. The day before pre-production, the Los Angeles investor backed out and the film was scratched. When Donald Miller posted on his personal blog that the film was to be cancelled, however, two readers from Tennessee announced that they would raise the remaining required funds by way of the Kickstarter website. According to Yancey Strickler, one of the founders of Kickstarter, only six films have ever raised more than $100,000 through the website as of May 2011. Taylor didn't believe that this fundraising effort would work, so he agreed to personally call and thank every donator of more than $10 if they met the target goal of $125,000. By October 2010, $345,992 had been donated through the website towards the film. Considering so much money had been raised through Kickstarter, the backer from Seattle matched that amount and contributed even more. Taylor was able to shoot the film for $750,000 and have an extra $500,000 left for post-production. By May 2011, Taylor had personally called and thanked half of the 3,300 people who donated more than $10 through Kickstarter. He had called the remainder by April 2012. Blue Like Jazz: The Movie was the second most successful Kickstarter fundraiser in 2010. Miller's 2009 book A Million Miles in a Thousand Years is based on his experience of revising his memoir into the screenplay for this film. Filming took place in Nashville, Tennessee and Portland, Oregon. Release The film had its world premiere as an official selection of the South by Southwest Film Festival on March 13, 2012. It was released in theaters on April 13, 2012 through Roadside Attractions. It was released on DVD and Blu-ray on August 7, 2012 in the United States and Canada.

Her father, Ping-Hsun Chang, was a diplomat, and her family moved from China to New York City when she was a child. Chang was interested in theatre and began studying acting in high school, at the High School of Performing Arts, then at Barnard College. Soon after finishing college, she started her career as an actor performing in Broadway plays and musicals, including Lovely Ladies, Kind Gentlemen and The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel. She also appeared in a few films, including Ambush Bay and Greetings. Chang began directing theatre in 1973, when she began working at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club. With money earned from her Broadway acting, she established the Pan Asian Repertory Theatre in 1977. Her intention in creating the group was to popularize Asian-American theater and to create opportunities for Asian-Americans actors to find non-stereotypical roles. Chang has received several awards for her work, including a Theatre World Special Award in 1988. She remains active as artistic director of the Pan Asian Repertory Theatre to present. Early life Tisa Chang was born on April 5, 1941 in Chongqing, Republic of China. At the age of six, she and her family moved to New York City. Her father, a Taiwanese diplomat, was appointed as the Republic of China's consul general to the city in 1946. He moved back to China in 1957 to serve within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. According to TV Times, \\"for 11 years, [Tisa] Chang was steeped in the subtleties and protocol of diplomacy. Her deep diplomatic connections extended as far as Ottawa where the ambassador from the Republic of China, Liu Chieh, was a friend of her father's and she called the Canadian-based diplomat uncle.\\" Chang chose to stay in New York with her three siblings instead of returning with her father to China. Chang became interested in theatre at a young age, and was taken by her mother to see operas and plays. She even performed her own rendition of Cinderella for her nanny in the family's kitchen when she was ten years old. Her father was also interested in acting and performed in school plays when he was younger at Nankai University together with Zhou Enlai, who went on to become the leader of China. Career After finishing college, Chang performed in several musicals as a dancer. She then started acting in Broadway plays and musicals, including Lovely Ladies, Kind Gentlemen (1970‚Äì1971), The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel (1977), and Pacific Overtures (1976). She also acted in television and film. She had roles in Ambush Bay (1966), Greetings (1968), Escape from Iran: The Canadian Caper (1981 television film by Lamont Johnson), Enormous Changes at the Last Minute (1983 television film), A Doctor's Story (1984 television film), and Year of the Dragon (1985). In Escape from Iran, she used her diplomatic background to play the wife of Kenneth D. Taylor, the Canadian ambassador to Iran during the Iran hostage crisis. After acting for a few years, Chang started directing theatre. She made the change because \\"it was a chance to work on projects that resonate deeply and personally and highlighted my world [...] of coming from a divided China that was still in the throes of revolution but steeped in culture and history. As a director, I had more autonomy in choosing projects, and felt I was contributing to American theatre with stories drawn from China's vast literary legacy. I had been acting and dancing professionally for 10 years on and off-Broadway, so I had a very good immersion into mainstream theatre. With directing, I can help shape what the audience experiences and walks away with.\\" Chang began her directing career in 1973 at the La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club, where she began as a director for Ellen Stewart's Chinese Theatre Group. She directed and/or produced bilingual versions of classical Asian and western plays, such as A Midsummer Night's Dream in both Mandarin and English and Servant of Two Masters, in which all the asides were spoken in the characters' native language. Chang was working as an actress and dancer at La MaMa when she asked Stewart for the opportunity to direct her own play. Her first work was the Peking opera The Return of the Phoenix, which opened in 1973 during the Independence Day weekend.La MaMa Archives Digital Collections. \\"Production: Return of the Phoenix, The (1973a)\\". Accessed April 4, 2018. Chang described this date as \\"the death slot\\" when it comes to theatre visitors, but \\"fortunately, Richard Shepard of The New York Times came down to East 4th Street and loved the show, praised it.\\" Chang established the Pan Asian Repertory Theatre as a resident company at La MaMa in 1977, with the intention of popularizing Asian-American theater. Chang has said that \\"the extraordinary talent and dedication of the actors [at Stewart's Chinese Theatre Group] inspired me to formalize the group into Pan Asian Repertory Theatre.\\" She used the money she earned from starring in The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel to fund the beginnings of Pan Asian. Chang's main principle with Pan Asian has always been to \\"promote opportunities for Asian-American actors to be seen in context of who we really are and what we are capable of achieving as artists.\\" According to Chang, Asian-Americans had difficulty finding roles in New York City before she established Pan Asian. They were usually limited to playing stereotypical Asian characters, such as geisha girls and houseboys. It was easier for Asian-American actors to find substantive roles in Los Angeles, where the East West Players had been founded in 1965. Many people in the theatre business doubted that Pan Asian would be successful. Chang has said that \\"because we were considered a curiosity or something very new and unique, people did come.\\" TV Times wrote in 1981 that Pan Asian was \\"the most respected experimental theatre group in New York City.\\" As of 2009, it is the world's largest producer of Asian-American theatre. Since Chang started Pan Asian Repertory Theatre, a lot of progress has been made for Asian-American actors in American theatre. However, as The New York Times writes in 2007, \\"the struggle continues, and not only in the live theater.\\" Daniel Dae Kim, a Korean American actor who first worked with Pan Asian in 1990, told the newspaper that \\"whereas it‚Äôs gotten better for ethnic minorities in terms of general representation, what hasn‚Äôt really improved is the complexity of the roles that we‚Äôve been given to play. Many of the parts I see Asians playing onstage, as well as on screen, are smaller supporting roles whose function is to provide exposition or support to the leads.\\" Kim is famous for acting in the television shows Lost and the new Hawaii Five-O. In addition to her work as artistic director at Pan Asian Repertory Theatre, Chang has also directed some own plays and musicals for the group. She directed the world premiere of Shanghai Lil's at the Pan Asian Repertory Theatre in 1997, and returned to direct a new production in November 2011 at the West End Theatre in New York. In 1988, she was awarded a Theatre World Special Award for the establishment of Pan Asian and her directorial work. Chang has also won the 2002 Lifetime Achievement Award from Organization of Chinese Americans, the 2001 Lee Reynolds Award from the League of Professional Theatre Women, the 1993 Chinese American Cultural Pioneer Tribute from New York City Council Andrew Stein, and the 1991 Barnard Medal of Distinction. She is currently on the executive board of the Stage Directors and Choreographers Society. In 2016, Chang was an honoree at East West Players annual awards dinner and silent auction. She received the Visionary Award, which seeks to celebrate \\"individuals who have raised the visibility of the Asian Pacific American (APA) community through their craft.\\" In an interview, Chang shared her vision for East West Players and Pan Asian to collaborate and grow. Personal life Chang married Ernest Abuba on January 25, 1976, at the La MaMa Annex. He worked as an actor, playwright, and director at Pan Asian. The couple divorced in the early 1990s, but have remained friends. They had one son together, named Auric Kang.

Sir William Berkeley (1639 ‚Äì 1 June 1666) was an officer of the Royal Navy who saw service during the Second Anglo-Dutch War, rising to the rank of vice-admiral. Berkeley was born into a noble family, one of the younger sons of a courtier of King Charles II, and a younger brother of one of the King's favourites. William joined the Royal Navy and enjoyed a meteoric rise owing to these important sources of patronage, something he himself acknowledged. After service in the Mediterranean, and time spent commanding his own ships, he was advanced to flag rank and joined the Royal fleets assembling for battle during the Second Anglo-Dutch War. He was a junior flag officer at the Battle of Lowestoft in 1665, during which his brother was killed. Caustic comments were made about his conduct, including by the poet and satirist Andrew Marvell. Determined to answer his critics, Berkeley, by now promoted to vice-admiral and leading the van at the Four Days' Battle, took his ship into the thick of the fighting, and was surrounded by Dutch ships. Cut off from support he fought fiercely, but his ship was overwhelmed and captured, with Berkeley being killed in the action. His body was taken to the Netherlands and embalmed, before being returned to England and interred in Westminster Abbey. Accusations of cowardice pursued him even after his death, but later biographies have been more sympathetic. Family and early life Berkeley was born in 1639, the third son of Charles Berkeley, and his wife Penelope Godolphin. Charles Berkeley was the treasurer of the household to King Charles II, and had powerful political connections which would ensure the rapid rise of his sons to positions of prominence. William's elder brother, Charles, was also a prominent courtier, who used his influence to promote William's rise. William entered the navy, becoming lieutenant of on 4 April 1661 and serving aboard her until April 1662. He benefited from his relationship to his brother, one of the closest friends of King Charles II and the Lord High Admiral, James, Duke of York. Rapid promotion followed, with Berkeley being appointed captain of that April. He served in command of her until August 1662, when he moved to , and later had the commands of and . Berkeley attracted the support of another powerful patron in the form of Admiral Sir John Lawson, the commander of the Mediterranean Fleet during Berkeley's service there from 1661 to 1664. Berkeley had commanded Bristol in Sir John's squadron in an attempt to persuade the Dey of Algiers, Ismail Pasha, to stop attacking English ships. Berkeley's connections culminated in a knighthood on 12 October 1664 and his appointment as rear-admiral of the red squadron, during the Second Anglo-Dutch War. Second Anglo-Dutch War Berkeley raised his flag aboard his old ship, HMS Swiftsure, and joined the fleet assembling for the 1665 campaign. He saw action at the Battle of Lowestoft on 3 June 1665 as one of the junior flag officers. Reports of his actions during the battle were confused and contradictory, some accounts suggesting that he had taken a squadron of six ships and pursued nine Dutch vessels, others stating that he had abandoned the fight after the death of his brother, Charles. Poet Andrew Marvell added a critical verse suggesting the latter view was correct in his 1666 poem 'The Second Advice to a Painter': > Berkeley had heard it soon, and thought not good > To venture more of royal Harding's blood ‚Ä¶ > With his whole squadron straight away he bore, > And, like good boy, promised to fight no more. Berkeley was supported by the Duke of York, who appointed him vice-admiral of the white, and William succeeded his dead brother as lieutenant-governor of Portsmouth later in 1665. Public scepticism over his actions persisted however, with Samuel Pepys commenting that 'it is strange to see how people do already slight Sir Wm. Berkeley ... who three months since was the delight of the Court'. Berkeley's reputation was further tarnished when he was implicated in the irregular plundering of prize goods from captured Dutch merchantmen, and accused of having abandoned an action with the Dutch ship Luipaard in discreditable circumstances on 21 August 1665. Death Captured English ships, including HMS Swiftsure, being sailed away by the Dutch after the battle, by Willem van de Velde the Younger With his conduct called into question, Berkeley resolved to answer his critics by distinguishing himself in the 1666 campaign. He had by now been appointed vice-admiral of the blue and been given command of the van of the English fleet which sailed to engage the Dutch at the Four Days' Battle. Flying his flag in Swiftsure again, he led the van of the fleet on the first day of the battle, 1 June 1666. He outran his squadron, sailed into the midst of the Dutch fleet and was surrounded by enemy ships. After a fierce battle he was killed and Swiftsure captured. He was reported as having fought to the end, until when almost alone on the quarter- deck, he was hit by a musket-ball in the throat. He staggered into the captain's cabin and was found by the Dutch lying dead on the table. His body was carried to Zeeland and embalmed by Frederik Ruysch, before being placed on public display, in a large sugar chest, in the Grote Kerk in The Hague for a time. It was returned to England in August and interred in Westminster Abbey, where a monument to his memory was raised. Legacy Berkeley died unmarried, a proposal he had made to Sir John Lawson's daughter in 1665 having been rejected. Public opinion was that he had died gallantly, but Marvell presented an alternative viewpoint in 'The Third Advice to a Painter': > And if the thing were true, yet paint it not, > How Berkeley (as he long deserved) was shot, > Though others that survey'd the corpse so clear > Say he was only petrified with fear. Berkeley's biographer, J. D. Davies, wrote after examining his letters that Berkeley appears as a 'lively, friendly young man, fully aware of his dependence on the patronage of others, supportive of and loving towards his family, and genuinely enthusiastic to make a success of his chosen career', quoting a letter from William to Charles Berkeley in June 1663: > I must assure you I think there is no so beggarly a trade as this if people > serve truly and honestly, as I am resolved I will do, although I am never > worth six pence. All my hope is on my dearest brother's kindness. Notes a. Charles Berkeley was a courtier, not a naval officer, but had volunteered for service with the Royal fleet. He was killed by a cannon shot during the battle.

It is symbolized by the slogan unus rex, una lex et grex unus (\\"one king, one law, one people\\") possibly coined by Johan Skytte, governor-general in Swedish Estonia, Ingria and Livonia. However, the phrase is also found in the debates on the possible union of Scotland and England in 1607, when Sir Edwyn Sandys noted King James VI & I's view that for a perfect union there should be unus rex, unus grex, una lex. Most notably, the uniformity policy aimed at abolishing serfdom then common in Estonia, Livonia and the Swedish dominions in the Holy Roman Empire (Ingermanland naturally had a free peasantry). While implemented in Livonia against the will of the local Baltic German nobles, the Estonian and Pomeranian peasants remained serfs: Estonia had voluntarily submitted to Sweden and thus had been given leeway in keeping the traditional local law code, while Swedish Pomerania had retained its traditional law code when, on behalf of the then ruling Swedish high nobility, the Peace of Westphalia granted it to Sweden while remaining part of the Holy Roman Empire, and not in a formal cession which would have resulted in the implementation of Swedish law. Swedish law was thus only introduced to Swedish Pomerania after the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806.

Founded in 1999, Philadelphia Jobs with Justice is an autonomous affiliate of the national Jobs with Justice network. Its stated mission is to fight for the rights of working people in Philadelphia and the surrounding area. History In 2000, Philadelphia JwJ launched its first major campaign to ensure fair treatment and good contracts for public workers unionized with the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME). Tactics included sending postcards to officials and leaders, sending out statements in the form of brochures and press releases, and holding rallies. The campaign succeeded in showing solidarity with the AFSCME members, educating Philadelphians on the importance of the issue, and limiting Mayor John Street's anti-union activity. Philadelphia JwJ worked closely with security guards at the University of Pennsylvania, Temple University, and the Philadelphia Museum of Art to gain independent union recognition. The guards at the museum, who are contracted with AlliedBarton, voted to form the Philadelphia Security Officers Union (PSOU). Since then, Philly JwJ has coordinated campaigns to organize graduate students at Temple University, to ensure benefits for part-time professors at the Community College of Philadelphia, to expose Comcast's workers' rights violations, to support Verizon workers' unionization efforts, and to raise awareness about Walmart's violations as an employer. JwJ supported the Transit Workers' Union SEPTA strike in 2005 to get better healthcare benefits and higher wages. 2010 In September, 2010, JwJ organized a jobs rally in center city outside the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce. The goal was to send the message that the mayor and city council should be making large corporations pay higher taxes. JwJ, and other groups present‚Äîsuch as AFSCME DC 47‚Äîsaid that tax policies benefitting large corporations were hurting the middle class and the job market. Speakers at the rally also asked that large non-profits, such as hospitals and universities, who receive services from the city, should pay taxes as well. In November, JwJ organizers led a protest with union members from the International Longshoremen's Association, the Philadelphia Electricians' Union. The activists nonviolently occupied a convenience store in Center City to protest Fresh Del Monte Produce's corporate policy. Prior to the protest, Del Monte had made a decision to unload fruit in New Jersey, rather than the Philadelphia port, depriving Philadelphia workers of many hours of work and pay, sometimes as much as 75%. Protestors refused to recognize the new union that Del Monte was working with. Philadelphia unions declared a boycott of Del Monte until they reversed their decision. 2011 In March, 2011, JwJ activists disrupted the Paradigm Award Ceremony granting Sunoco CEO Lynn Elsenhans an award for being a strong female business leader. The disrupters said that they \\"saw no female leader present\\", as Elsenhans was responsible for laying off hundreds of workers and slashing health care benefits for the employees in dangerous refineries. Philadelphia Jobs with Justice is a member of the Coalition for Healthy Families, a coalition of 100 organizations trying to get legislation passed ensuring paid sick days for all Philadelphia workers. The campaign has been active since late February, when a City Council committee was considering bringing a bill before Council. On March 1, protesters carrying signs gathered around City Hall and within Council chambers demanding the Earned Sick Time bill. On that date, the bill, entitled \\"Promoting Healthy Families and Workplaces\\" (Bill Number 08074) universally passed out of committee, meaning that the next step was to have council as a whole vote on the bill. Beginning later in March, public commenters began speaking at council proceedings weighing in on both sides of the issue. Activists also started holding rallies; on May 9, working mothers and daughters shared statements outside the Childspace Day Care Center describing how difficult it is to care for a child and hold down a job without paid sick days. Later that same month, activists surrounded city hall with 10,000 orange postcards that supporters of the bill from every city district had filled out with messages explaining the bill's necessity. On June 9, Council delayed a vote on the bill for another week, but voted on an amendment to the bill exempting businesses with fewer than 5 employees. Workers protested outside beforehand, and packed chambers during the proceedings, holding up signs whenever the bill was up for discussion and giving public comment. Opponents of the bill spoke as well. The bill, which would affect 210,000 Philadelphia workers, has 70% support in the city; 64% of Republicans and 72% of Democrats support it, and many of them say that they would rather vote for City Council candidates who support it as well. On June 16, City Council passed the bill by a vote of 9‚Äì8, but was vetoed by Mayor Michael Nutter.

Pilkey uses \\"George Beard\\" as the author and \\"Harold Hutchins\\" as the illustrator. These are the names of his characters in the Captain Underpants books. The plot of the book involves George and Harold, the lead characters from Pilkey's Captain Underpants series, complaining that scientists don't know everything, so they make a comic book about science facts. Plot The book begins with a scientific disclaimer by professor Gaylord M. Sneedly, saying that the book \\"contains many scientific errors and stuff.\\" He stated that dinosaurs and cavemen did not live at the same time, as dinosaurs lived 64 million years before cavemen. He then stated that he should know about it, since he was a recipient of \\"The Most Brilliantest Science Guy of the Whole Wide World Award\\" in 2003, a reference to the seventh Captain Underpants book. However, George and Harold refute this via a \\"scientific disclaimer disclaimer\\". They said that scientists make theories based on evidence they discovered, and that everyday, all kinds of evidence are being discovered. They also mentioned that they have a time machine, and been time traveling to the future and past, discovering much evidence that scientists had no knowledge of, including dinosaurs and cavemen living at the same time. George and Harold stated that \\"scientists won't discover that until 2073.\\" So they made \\"the world's first book based on science facts\\". =Plot= In Cave-land Ohio, 500,001 BC, the tribal leader of Cave-land, Big Chief Goppernopper, forces Gak, the older sister of Ook, to marry him in order to keep Ook and Gluk from bothering him. After saving her from a sandpit, the two Cave-kids befriend one of the dinosaur species Mog-Mog and her baby, and stop the wedding. Angered, Goppernopper walks away until he meets his descendant, J.P, who is the CEO from 2222 A.D. The Goppernoppers steals natural resources from caveman days through a time portal, since natural resources will be used up by that year. Ex-Chief goes back to the past and forces every cave-person in Cave-land to belong to the Goppernopper Enterprises. The Cave-kids and the baby Mog-Mog are shoveling until the Goppernoppers take them to 2222 to torture them, but the baby helps them escape and the three hide in Master Wong's School of Kung-Fu. Ook and Gluk grow up, training under Master Wong for 7 years, but the cave- kids have to give the right answer: \\"Who is the greatest man?\\" When it's time to save their people, they finally answer: nobody. Wong finally awards them black belts. They and their dinosaur buddy Lily travel back to caveman days (in 500,008 BC) and free the slaves. Goppernopper returns and orders his Mecha-saurs to attack the cave kids and dinosaur, but they spray-paint on the Enterprises building, then an explosive tank, which also destroys the Mecha- saurs themselves. Goppernopper sends them a letter, that Wong and Lan will be executed if the kids won't surrender. Back to 2229, Ook and Gluk plead with the Goppernoppers that they will do anything to satisfy them and they handcuff the three, but vows to execute them all. Wong tells them to remember their training, then, when J.P prepares his ray, the Cave-kids ask: Who is the greatest man? J.P and Chief answer themselves and their argument eventually makes J.P. shoot and kill Chief, which accidentally erases himself and his damage on the world from history. The Cave-kids and Lily run back to the disappearing portal, but Ook soon returns for Lan, who agrees to be his cave wife and they warp back together, while 2229 receives a brighter and peaceful future. Lily finally re-unites with Her Mother, while the Cave-kids, Lan and the dinosaurs return happily to Cave-land.

It is an active Anglican parish church of the Church in Wales, in the deanery of Arllechwedd, the archdeaconry of Bangor and the diocese of Bangor. The church is designated by Cadw as a Grade II* listed building. History The church was built between 1870 and 1873 to accommodate the increasing numbers of summer visitors to the area. It was designed by the Lancaster partnership of Paley and Austin, the commission being gained as a result of a competition won by Hubert Austin. The principal benefactor was the Liverpool businessman Charles Kurtz. The church was consecrated in July 1873, and provided seating for 150 people. It replaced a medieval church dedicated to Saint Michael, and cost ¬£5,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). The tower was completed in 1907. Architecture =Exterior= St Mary's is constructed in rubble stone with sandstone dressings, and it has slated roofs. Its architectural style is Transitional Norman. The plan is cruciform with a tower at the crossing and an organ chamber to its south. To the west of the crossing is a four-bay nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles, and a north porch. To the east of the crossing is a chancel. On the north side of the tower is a four-stage stair turret with a conical roof. The middle stage of the tower has lancet windows, and in the top stage are louvred lancets flanking clock faces. On the south side is blind arcading. The parapet is stepped at the corners. Along the sides of aisles, clerestories and chancel are more lancet windows. At the east end is a five-light window with plate tracery, and at the west end is a rose window, also with plate tracery. =Interior= Inside the church are arcades with pointed arches. The font is constructed in black and burgundy marble, and the pulpit is in sandstone; both are in Early English style. In the south wall of the chancel is a recess, and in the north wall is an aumbry. The chancel is floored with tiles. The choir stalls and reading desks are in Arts and Crafts style. The reredos, inserted in 1929, is in Italian alabaster, and depicts the Passion of Christ. Most of the stained glass was made by Shrigley and Hunt of Lancaster. Other windows were made by Jones and Willis, based on designs by Edward Burne-Jones. The two-manual organ was built in 1870 by Gray and Davison. It was enlarged in about 1913 and again in about 1920 by the same firm. In 1969 the organ was rebuilt by Wood Wordsworth and Company.

Line Skis was founded by Jason Levinthal in 1995 to produce short, twin-tipped skis for freestyle skiers, and has since moved to produce full-length freeskis. The brand also sells goods such as ski poles, streetwear, and various accessories, which are not available online. Line Skis manufactures in the same Chinese factory as K2 Skis. Line Skis maintains a pro team featuring athletes like Eric Pollard, Tom Wallisch, Leo Tailleffer, and Hadley Hammer. Many are featured in Line's online webisode series, the LINE Traveling Circus.  History  = Establishment = Line Skis was formed in a one-car garage, where the founder Jason Levinthal began manufacturing Line's skiboards. After visiting a trade show known as the SIA with some prototypes, Levinthal signed a contract with a Japanese distributor for his first order of 1000 pairs of skis. Line Skis then moved to a rented garage, where friends and family helped him fill the order. In 1997, Line Skis filed the first patent for twin-tipped skis. Line Skis had little U.S. market until the 1997 SIA, when the large company Salomon presented its own novelty skiboards, and sales improved. The next season, Line signed five of its first athletes: Carter Griffin, Mike Nick, Reg Pare, Doug Levinthal, Mike Wilson, and Jason Levinthal himself. Line also introduced four new skiboards: the Mike Nick Pro Model, the Jedi 89, the Cruiser 89, and the Kicker 76. In 1998, Line introduced a full- length pro model, \\"The Ostness Dragon\\", as well as a short, center mounted, symmetrical ski called the Twelve Sixty. K2 Skis had previously released the short, unwieldy K2 Poacher, and Salomon had produced the Salomon 1080. = Post-establishment = By this time, in 1999, Levinthal was producing 4,000 skis a year through various garages. Months later, Line Skis was acquired by the Canadian manufacturer Karhu, from Cowansville, Quebec, who began producing Line Skis; Karhu already produced Karhu skis and some Burton snowboards. When Karhu was acquired by the larger K2 Sports in 2006, and Line Skis moved to Seattle, Jason Levinthal continued to direct the company from Burlington, Vermont. In 2008, Andy Parry and Will Wesson joined the Line team. Together they established the LINE Traveling Circus, and finished filming their tenth season in 2018. In 2013, Jason Levinthal left his top position at Line Skis in order to start a new, direct-to-consumer company known as J Skis. He was succeeded by former intern Josh Malczyk.  Sale of company  In 2003, Jason Levinthal sold Line Skis to Trak Sports USA. Line Skis then moved from Levinthal's garage in Albany, NY, to a shared complex in Burlington, VT with Karhu USA, another one of Trak Sports' ski company subsidiaries. Later, in 2006, Trak Sports USA sold Line Skis and Karhu USA to K2 Sports, thus combining K2's manufacturing connections with Line's ski development. Line Skis moved production from their original factory in China, to the same Chinese factory as K2 Skis. Although Line's skis are outsourced to China, the design and prototyping is conducted in Washington. Following the acquisition, Tim Petrick, vice president of global sales for K2 Sports, announced: \\"[Line Skis, Karhu USA, and K2 are] different brands with different distribution strategies, and distinct pricing structures backed by a reliable supply chain, management, warranty protection, and solid production facilities.\\" Line Skis and Karhu subsequently moved to K2 Sports' headquarters in Seattle, WA, although they retained several of their Burlington employees; namely, the directors, graphic designers, and engineers. K2 Sports itself was acquired by Jarden Corp. in 2007 for $1.2 billion. Then, in 2016, Newell Rubbermaid acquired Jarden Corp. as they merged into Newell Brands, Inc. The resulting $16 billion consumer goods company shortly began to offload the winter sports businesses Jarden had acquired in 2007, which included Line's parent K2 Sports. For ten months, Line Skis was in danger of closure; Michael Polk, CEO of Newell Brands, told investors in September 2016 that if they were unable to find a buyer for their winter brands by June 2017, K2 Sports would face closure. However, some consumers argue that there was little chance of this, due to the quality reputations of K2 and its subsidiaries. In late May 2017, Kohlberg & Company, LLC agreed to purchase K2 Sports (excluding Marmot) from Newell Brands for $240 million. The vice president of K2 Sports expressed his excitement at the sale, saying: \\"it's the first time in a long time that we've had ownership that has been 100% excited about the opportunity of the winter sports business.\\" As of July 2018, Line Skis continues to serve as a subdivision of K2 Sports beneath its parent business, Kohlberg & Company, LLC.  Eric Pollard  Eric Pollard is an artist, designer, and professional skier for Line Skis. Line has sponsored Pollard since 1997. Eric Pollard works directly with Line's engineers to develop his pro models; his first recorded personal project, and second pro model, was the LINE Elizabeth in 2005. Since 2003, the partnership between Pollard and Line Skis has produced ten pro models, each with topsheets and bases designed yearly by Pollard himself. As of the 2018-2019 season, his signature collection comprises the LINE Pescado, Sakana, Magnum Opus, Mordecai, Sir Francis Bacon, and Sir Francis Bacon Shorty. He also has a pro model pole: Pollard's Paintbrush. Eric Pollard is artistically involved with Line, and has previously gone beyond ski topsheets and graphics to contribute to the brand's streetwear as well. Line's engineers concur that Pollard \\"epitomizes our ethos of going down the mountain in a different way, of looking at the hill with a new perspective.\\"  Tom Wallisch  Signed with Line Skis on November 3, 2014. Tom Wallisch (born July 22, 1987 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) is a professional freeskier. He began skiing in 1990 and competing in the sport in 2009. After graduating from high school, Wallisch moved to Salt Lake City for post-secondary education at the University of Utah where he is pursuing a degree in the school of business.  Line Traveling Circus  To contrast to the high budget ski films and online webisodes, Line created the Traveling Circus to document pro skiers adventures in an average person‚Äôs playground. High School friends and professional skiers Will Wesson and Andy Parry first approached Levinthal with the idea of traveling around and skiing after they graduated from college, and filmed a pilot episode at Mt. Hood, Oregon. The series centers on the newschool skiing and non-snow adventures of Wesson and Parry, with many guest stars throughout. The series epitomizes the ultimate quest for snow that is a ski bum's lifestyle. Many of the locations filmed are low profile resorts, especially from the East Coast. In season 3, episode 2, the Traveling Circus acquired the now famous yellow TC van, which is still in use. Also in season 3, the TC expanded their boundaries outside of North America by venturing to Europe for the first time in episode 4. Season 5 again expanded the boundaries with Will, Andy and friends going to New Zealand (Episode 5.2 \\"Lord of the Pies\\") and then to Japan to explore the bottomless powder (Episode 5.5 \\"The Last Skiurai\\"). Released as roughly monthly webisodes online in 2008, the series has had 10 seasons to date. After episode 8.1, principal cinematographer Shane McFalls retired. Jake Strassman now films and edits the series.  Notable skis  = 1260 = The 1260 was the first one hundred percent symmetrically shaped ski. This meant that it was the same forwards as it was backwards. It was a freestyle machine made for spinning and landing backwards. The equal height tip and tail also aided in the reverse landings and carving. Equal height tip and tail means that the tails are exactly the same height off the ground as the traditionally upturned tips. The twelve sixties also featured symmetrical flex which is equal flex in front of and behind the boot. This allowed the ski to bend and pop back into shape for easier popping and carving. The 1260s name refers to a 1260 degree rotation (3.5 spins). = The 130 = In 2001, Line Skis and Eric Pollard got together to talk powder. They wanted a powder ski that broke away from traditional powder ski design. Most powder skis were only 105 mm underfoot at the time. The 130 was 130 mm underfoot. This made it one of the widest skis available. Pollard and Line designed the 130 to also be useful on not only deep powder, but on groomers and in the trees as well. = Invader = The Invader showcased a new concept that inspired a new way of riding in and out of the park. The Invader's progressive \\"Butter Zone\\" construction featured a thinner ski in front and behind the boot that allowed the rider to lean forwards or backwards to playfully \\"butter\\" around in most any condition. Buttering is the act of spinning around on ones tips or tails, picture butter being spread on toast. The ski tips or tails act as a slippery pivot point. Buttering opened up a new world of technical tricks. People began buttering off of jumps and onto rails and even using the technique to continue tricks after they landed them, a similar concept of reverting on a skateboard. = EP Pro = Eric Pollard was happy with the creation of The 130 and it became his implicit pro model. Not until 2007 did Pollard get a ski named after him. The EP Pro is a cornucopia of innovative features. First, they have Early Rise. Early Rise is describing the way the camber of the ski is reversed near the tip and tail. The skis have conventional upturned tips, but they are made higher off the snow by the actual flex of the ski being turned up gradually as it goes from binding to tip. This makes skiing forwards and backwards in deeper snow much easier to control. Another aspect of the EP Pro that helps the skiers control in the powder is the Early Taper. Traditional ski designs make the widest part of the ski at the tip, making it the last part of the ski to touch the snow before it upturns to the tip. Early Taper brings the fattest part of the ski back toward the boot and away from the tip. This gives more control and quick response from the ski in the deep powder, making turns more creative and free, rather than relying on the harsh curve of the side-cut to whip you into a turn. =Chronic Cryptonite= This ski was first introduced in 2010. It was notable for its firm powerful flex pattern, a 92 mm waist and its g-cut geometry. There is reverse camber to promote reliable handling on groomed terrain, and it has a fatty base/edge for skiing in fresh snow. This ski provides uncompromised versatility, stability and control. This ski is innovative in the Line collection for being an all mountain ski; it provides great usage when skiing in both the park (freestyle terrain), and all over the rest of the mountain‚Äîanywhere from groomed trails to fresh snow. =Afterbang= This ski was first ever constructed like a skateboard. Since the act of skiing has changed from simply skiing down a hill to grinding metal railing (urban skiing) the market demanded a ski to hold up stronger than the current construction. =Sick Day Series= A new directional freeride ski with a lightweight core and geometry the yields ease of use on any terrain. There are 3 models in the series which differing waist widths of 95, 110 and 125 millimeters underfoot to accommodate different terrain. =Supernatural Series= The Supernatural series is based on its predecessor, the Prophet series. The Supernatural series uses a few unique features to achieve a solid all-mountain ski fit for terrain from groomers to bumps to powder. The sidewall construction allows for better shock absorbing ability, while the Metal Matrix used within the Maple Macroblock core gives the skis rigidity resulting in a smooth and stable ride at speed.

Born in Wiesbaden, having finished his studies in 1894, Theo Wiederspahn immigrated to Brazil in 1908. He intended to work for ‚ÄúVia√ß√£o F√©rrea do Rio Grande do Sul‚Äù, a railroad state-owned company, but it never happened because of contract problems. Wiederspahn then started working as an architect for Rudolph Ahrons‚Äôs engineering firm in Porto Alegre. Together they revolutionized the urban landscape of the city, and many of his works became part of its artistic cultural heritage.

It also supports the government of Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner, who was reelected for a second term in the 2011 Argentine general election. Development The commercial was developed three months after the death and state funeral of N√©stor Kirchner. The lyrics were written by Horacio Bouchoux, and the video includes 120 singers.Letra de \\"Nunca menos\\", la canci√≥n homenaje a Kirchner The video features musician Horacio Fontova, legislators Eric Calcagno and Ariel Pasini, actors like V√≠ctor Laplace, Gustavo Garz√≥n and Lito Cruz, and organizations such as \\"Descamisados\\" and \\"Negros de mierda\\". The copyright of the song was given to the youth organization The C√°mpora. Political controversy The Radical Civic Union (UCR) considers the commercial a violation of the law that regulates the political campaign. The law authorizes political commercials only during a certain time period, at television timeouts determined by the government (the purchase of advertisement time to host such commercials is not allowed), and within a defined time length. The government, however, has no restrictions in promoting government actions, educative, artistic or cultural works. The UCR considers that the \\"Nunca Menos\\" commercial can not be considered within the allowable exceptions, and that it is a clear act of forbidden proselitism, with an undeniable identification with the Kirchnerist political party, a misuse of the state treasury, seen as electoral campaign by all people, and not following any applicable laws.El nunca menos es la versi√≥n kirchnerista del Menem lo hizo As a result, the UCR filled a writ of amparo against the commercial. Criticism The video was criticised by periodist Ernesto Tenembaum because of not following the usual standards of political commercials: rather than highlighting positive aspects of the Kirchner administration, it focuses on negative things, without encouraging a will of improvement. The \\"Nunca menos\\" slogan thus becomes similar to a \\"this is better than nothing\\" slogan.¬øNunca menos? The unusual length of the commercial, more than four minutes, goes against usual television standards for commercials, and may alienate independent voters against the government.

Trained at the Kingston Art School, then did his military service in the Seaforth Highlanders in Malaysia ( during the Malayan Emergency). He then graduated from The Royal College of Art , London UK, in 1955. After graduating he wrote to John Fowler ( Colefax & Fowler), writing \\" You are the only person in the world I want to work for\\". Unfortunately, his interview with John Fowler didn't go as well as one might hope. John Fowler said to him \\" What have you been doing at that college for three years? You know nothing!\\".Luckily, three weeks later, Imogene Taylor of Colefax & Fowler called to offer him a position. His first celebrity job was an apartment in Eaton Square for Sir Laurence Olivier and Vivian Leigh, as well as working on their country house. After a couple of years or working with John Fowler and Nancy Lancaster, he realized that he was never going to climb any higher at Colefax & Fowler, luckily Mrs. Henry \\"Sister Parish\\" II was in London. John Fowler \\" lent\\" Keith out to Sister Parish for job in Johannesburg, who, when the job was finished, offered Keith a job in New York and $40.00 a week. So in 1957 he left England for the Big Apple, with $38.00 in his pocket. The next morning he took a cab straight from the boat to the Sutton Place home address of Sister Parish- who had forgotten that she had hired him. On the first day in the office he was handed a card that read \\" Lord help the Mister who comes between you and Sister\\", things went downhill from there. Keith did not like Sister Parish, and not only because he wasn't allowed to use the bathroom ( it was all women in the office), and had to go across the street to the Old Westbury Hotel, instead. He was not impressed by Sister Parish's decorating, which he said was \\" appealing on the surface but without depth\\". He managed to deal with the situation for nine months before he informed Sister Parish that he was leaving to start his own firm. On hearing this news Sister Parish said to him \\" you will never last for a year. You don't know anyone.\\". When Keith first arrived in New York he had searched for an apartment share in the New York Times, and ended up meeting Robin Roberts . Before things could really settle Keith had a partner and firm, Roberts & Irvine . Finding it difficult to find the French and English fabrics that where a staple in Keith Irvine's decorating style, Roberts and Irvine created the fabric house Clarence House. Tom Fleming became an assistant as the business took off. Before the year was out the firm split ( Keith claimed that with the influx of \\"top drawer\\" clients, Roberts had become a \\"liability\\" as he didn't \\"move readily in 'polite society'\\", Roberts took Clarence House, and Keith left to start Keith Irvine & Co. Tom Fleming stayed on with him and became a partner on 1 January 1967 and Irvine & Fleming was born. Many successful designers started their careers as Keith Irvine's assistant, such as Tom Fleming, Mario Buatta, Sam Blount, Gary Zarr, Richard Keith Langham, Greg Jordan, Edwin Jackson, and Jason Bell. Keith Irvine's celebrity clients included Leonard Bernstein, William F. Buckley, Jr., Cary Grant, Rex Harrison, Vivien Leigh, Laurence Olivier, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Ted Kennedy, Jerome Robbins, Diana Ross, Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt Jr., and Wallis, Duchess of Windsor, and many more.

It has been restored and converted into a law office. It is the tallest building in Tampa's Ybor City Historic District. History The Florida Brewing Company Building was built to house the Florida Brewing Company, which was founded in 1896 by cigar industrialists Vicente Ybor and Edward Manrara. The brewery building is six stories tall and remains the tallest building in Ybor City. Florida Brewing Company was the first brewery in the state of Florida. When operational in the late-19th and early-20th centuries, the building housed the leading exporter of beer to Cuba and was a leader in western Florida. After brewing operations ceased, the building was used for a variety of purposes, although it was eventually abandoned and fell into disrepair. Recently, the building was renovated and is now home to several commercial enterprises. It was built on the Government Spring, which originally supplied water to the military men of Fort Brooke. This spring was valued by many cultures to be sacred. Florida's Paleo Indians believed the water in the spring to be of a sacred nature. They brought their sick and wounded to bathe in the water with the belief that it would cure their injuries and diseases. Nearly every Indian tribe respected the spring's holiness and thus would use the land around the spring as a peace zone, where no one would attack. Influenced by these tales and others in Europe, Spanish Conquistadors fell under the belief that there were crystalline fountains of youth hidden in the springs. Juan Ponce de Le√≥n helped spread these rumors when he and a Spanish Armada set out to find a mythical fountain of youth. Many still believe the spring to have supernatural powers. In its prime, The Florida Brewing Company produced 80,000 barrels of beer annually. It was the leading exporter of beer to Cuba in the U.S. and the premier brewery on Florida's west coast. Theodore Roosevelt and his Rough Riders visited for a beer in celebration after the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. The brewery survived the adversities of the Prohibition and the Great Depression. However, the business closed in 1961 as a result of the embargo on Cuba and the opening of rival breweries by Anheuser-Busch and the Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company in Tampa. After brewery closing In the years following its closing, the former brewery served several purposes. It was used as a storage place for fresh tobacco in the 1960s and later became a bomb shelter throughout the Cold War. However, it was abandoned for the latter 25 years of the 20th century, and its condition declined. The former brewery became generally considered a detriment to the redevelopment of Ybor City. Restoration and current use In 1999, attorney Dale Swope and contractor Joseph Kokolakis purchased the building to restore and convert it into a law firm and office space. The restoration project received a Builders' Choice grand award in adaptive re-use. Timeline * 1897 ‚Äì This year marked the grand opening of The Florida Brewing Company and distribution of the La Tropical line. Locals were invited to celebrate the launch with beer, barbecue and live music. * 1898 ‚Äì Teddy Roosevelt and his Rough Riders rode in for some brew before departing for the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. * 1905 ‚Äì The brewery combined with Tampa wholesale liquor and Ybor City Ice Works. * 1906 ‚Äì A fire, resulting from a lack of water pressure, caused $1,000 worth of damages. The Florida Supreme Court ruled against Tampa Water Works in a $25,000 judgment. * 1913 ‚Äì Although another fire caused $10,000 in damages, production was booming and the brewery was the main distributor to 80% of the bars in the area. * 1915 ‚Äì The Davis Bill Package, which prohibited the distribution of draft beer in Florida, was passed and caused owners to question further expansion. * 1918 ‚Äì The Volstead Act was passed and prohibition throughout the U.S was enacted. The brewery supposedly began serving soft drinks and cereal beverages. * 1928 ‚Äì Salvador Martinez Ybor was sentenced to six months in jail for illegally distributing alcoholic beverages. * 1933 ‚Äì With the prohibition over, the brewery opened under a new owner, Wilbur Leavine, who renamed the brewery Tampa, Florida Brewery Inc. * 1936 ‚Äì To compete with other beers of the time, the brewery introduced FLA 6 Beer. However, this line of ale was dropped within a year because a state law which prohibited advertising for alcoholic content was passed. * 1949 ‚Äì The brewery introduced a new cone top can line to increases sales. * 1950 ‚Äì Sales doubled and production reached 300 barrels or 5,000 cases a day as a result of the new line of cans, fermenting storage cellars, a warehouse and equipment. * 1953 ‚Äì The brewery dropped the coned top can line and opted for a flat top instead. * 1961 ‚Äì The brewery closed due to the embargo on Cuba and the opening of the Anheuser-Busch Company. Samuel Greenburg, owner of Brewers and Bottlers Equipment Corporation, bought the brewery. * 1962 ‚Äì Greenburg sold the south portion of the brewery to Corral, Wodiska & Company Cigar Manufacturers. The building was used as a storage place for fresh tobacco. * 1999 ‚Äì Dale Swope and Joe Kokolakis purchased the dilapidated brewery and renovated the building. * 2001 ‚Äì With renovations complete, a number of corporate tenants acquired office space in the building.

Biography His parents were Frederick David Schaeffer and Rosina Rosenmiller. His father was a Lutheran clergyman, as were his brothers Frederick Christian, Charles Frederick, and Frederick Solomon, and his nephew Charles William. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1807, studied theology with Justus Henry Christian Helmuth, John Frederick Schmidt, and his father, and was ordained by the Pennsylvania Ministerium in 1812, though he had received his license to preach in 1808. In 1808 he became pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran congregation at Frederick, Maryland, where he remained for the rest of his life. Activities A ministerial challenge in his times was the development of English-language worship as an alternative to the hitherto exclusive use of the German language. Schaeffer was one of the leaders in this effort. He was an able theologian, always having students under his direction, among whom were his brothers Frederick Christian and Frederick Solomon. Two other distinguished students were Emanuel Greenwald and Charles Philip Krauth. He was connected with all the important enterprises of his own church and with many outside of it. From 1826 until 1831 he was the editor of the first English-language periodical that was established in the Lutheran church in the United States, the Lutheran Intelligencer. He took an active part in the establishment of the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, in 1826, was one of the founders of the general synod of the Lutheran church (1821), secretary in 1821-29, and its president in 1831-33. In 1836 he received the degree of D.D. from St. John's College, Annapolis, Maryland. Besides a large number of doctrinal and other articles in the Lutheran Intelligencer, he published various addresses and sermons. His reputation was based mostly on his work as a pastor. Illness and the death of his wife were difficulties of his later years, as was the Maryland Synod, which sanctioned him for intemperance. Family He married Elizabeth Krebs of Philadelphia in 1810. They had six children.

Barber was originally a clergyman of the established church, but long before the beginning of the civil wars he adopted the principles of the baptists. He had numerous followers, who assembled for worship in the Spital in Bishopsgate Street, London, and appear to have been the first congregation among the baptists that practised the laying on of hands on baptised believers at their reception into the church. This custom was introduced among them about 1646 by Mr. Cornwell. Previously to the year 1641 Barber was kept eleven months in Newgate Prison for denying the baptism of infants and that the payment of tithes to the clergy was God's ordinance under the gospel. He preached his doctrines in season and out of season, and he has himself left an account of the disturbance he caused in 1648 in the parish church of St. Benet Fink. The date of his death is unknown, but in 1674 he was succeeded in the care of the Baptist church in Bishopsgate by Jonathan Jennings. He is the author of: 1. ‚ÄòTo the King's most Excellent Maiesty, and the Honourable Court of Parliament.

Sumerian √â·∏™URSAG is written as a special ligature (√âPAxG√çN íÇçíâ∫íÇÖ), sometimes etymologized as √â.·∏™AR.SAG (), written with the signs √â \\"temple\\" (or \\"house\\"), ·∏™AR \\"mountain\\" and SAG \\"head\\". Ehursag is commonly associated with a temple of Enlil discovered by Sir. Charles Leonard Woolley during excavations at Ur in modern-day Iraq. He originally considered this to be a palace, a view that was later rejected in replace for a temple. The location of the royal palace at Ur remains unknown. No graves were discovered under the Ekursag during these excavations. Woolley eventually conceded that it was a \\"minor temple of some sort.\\" Modern scholars still vary on their interpretations of it as a temple, palace or administrative building. It has even been suggested to be a wing or annex of the main temple, having had some of its foundations destroyed. Stamped bricks used in the construction of the foundations revealed that they were built by Ur-Nammu of the Third Dynasty of Ur. Bricks from the pavement bore the stamp of his successor, Shulgi and later ones of the Isin-Larsa period after Ur was destroyed by Elamites. Ehursag is also the name or epithet of Ninhursag's temple at Hiza and has been suggested to have been an interchangeable word with Enamtila. The Ehursag at Ur was restored in 1961 using ancient and modern bricks, a 2008 report for the British Museum noted that this had collapsed in some areas, especially the northwest corner.

Their targets have included the Conservative Party of Canada and Husky Energy. On June 7, 2011, LulzRaft claimed responsibility for a hacking into the Conservative Party of Canada website and posting a false story about Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper. The hackers posted an alert on the site claiming that Harper had choked on a hash brown while eating breakfast and was airlifted to Toronto General Hospital. The story fooled many, including Canadian MP Christopher Alexander, who spread the story on Twitter. A spokesman for the Prime Minister soon denied the story. LulzRaft again targeted the Conservative Party on June 8, taking responsibility for a successful breach of a database containing information about the party's donors. The information accessed by the group including the names of donors as well as their home and e-mail addresses. LulzRaft later stated that the party had \\"terrible security\\" and that for the intrusion it used very basic methods. LulzRaft also apparently hacked into the website of Husky Energy on the same day. They inserted a notice promising free gas to users who used the coupon code \\"hash-browns\\", claiming that it was a gesture of goodwill intended to placate conservatives who were offended by their previous attacks. Though some commentators have speculated that the group is motivated by a dislike of the Conservative party, LulzRaft has stated that they are a non-partisan group with a general dislike of politicians.

The church dates from the Middle Ages; it was enlarged in the 16th century and restored twice in the 19th century. St Mary's is an active parish church in the Diocese of Blackburn and the archdeaconry of Lancaster. It has been designated a Grade II* listed building by English Heritage. History St Mary's Church dates from the Middle Ages; it was probably in existence by 1281, and certainly by 1330. It was probably first established as a chapel of ease to St Michael's Church in Kirkham. With the possible exception of one of the windows of the north aisle, nothing of the current building is older than the 15th century, with features from this period including the tower and the north arcade and aisle. The church was enlarged commencing in the 16th century; the chancel is said to have been rebuilt in 1553 and the south arcade and aisle were possibly rebuilt at the end of the 16th or early in the 17th century. At the end of the 18th century, possibly in 1788, the western gallery was added and in 1800, the eastern gallery in front of the chancel. In 1868‚Äì1869 substantial repairs and restoration of the church's older features was undertaken by Lancaster architecture firm Paley and Austin; they renovated the roof (at which time the gabled dormers were possibly added), repaired window stonework and lowered the floor. Seating in the nave and aisles was altered. Further restoration took place in 1895. Present day and assessment St Mary's was designated a Grade II* listed building on 11 November 1966. The Grade II* designation‚Äîthe second highest of the three grades‚Äîis for \\"particularly important buildings of more than special interest\\". An active church in the Church of England, St Mary's is part of the diocese of Blackburn, which is in the Province of York. It is in the archdeaconry of Lancaster and the Deanery of Garstang. Architecture =Exterior= St Mary's is constructed of sandstone rubble with gritstone dressings and has slate roofs. Its plan consists of a nave with aisles to the north and south, a chancel to the east (with galleries facing north and south), and a tower to the west. There is a porch to the south-west of the south aisle, and a vestry north of the chancel. Most of these feature are designed in the Romanesque style. The roof over the nave features three gabled dormers on the north and two on the south, each with four small semi-domed windows to provide illumination for the congregation. The tower is tall. It is of three stages and has a stair turret to the south-east. There are diagonal six-stage buttresses at the west corners and a square three-stage buttress at the north-east corner. The tower has a crenellated parapet. It has three-light belfry louvres that have Perpendicular style tracery and a rounded arched doorway. The south aisle is of four bays and has low buttresses. The east window in the chancel is recessed and has five plain, pointed lights. =Interior and fittings= The nave measures by . It is separated from the aisles by arcades with pointed arches and octagonal piers. The Middleton Chapel is at the east end of the north aisle and has by wooden screens that date from the late 17th or 18th century. In the south aisle there is a stone baptismal font that is tall and has a large square bowl. It possibly dates from the 15th century. The tower has an active ring of six bells, with the inscriptions: Treble, 'God preserve the Church and Queen Ann 1713'; (2) 'Prosperity to the Church of England a.r. 1742'; (3) 'Abr. Rudhall cast us all 1713'; (4) 'Christopher Swainson A.M. minister, a.r. 1742'; (5) 'Presented by R. Newsham esq. Mears and Stainbank 1883'; tenor, 'I to the Church the living call and to the grave do summon all, 1753.' The chalice is from 1746 and a paten is inscribed 'Presented to Goosnargh Church in memoriam Charles Osborne Gordon, vicar of the parish, who died Aug. 19, 1892.' There are also a plated chalice and flagon, and a plated breadholder inscribed 'Presented to the Parish Church of Goosnargh by Townley Rigby Knowles esq. in memory of the late William Shawe esq. 1872.' A pipe organ was previously located in the west gallery. The current organ, at the east end of the south aisle, was built in 1906. Stained glass in the church includes work by Shrigley and Hunt, Harry Stammers and Heaton, Butler and Bayne. Churchyard Sundial in the churchyard The gravestones in the churchyard include one dated 1668. There are war graves of four soldiers of World War I and one of World War II. CWGC Cemetery Report.

History It was formed in 1959. The taps and valves industry is currently worth ‚Ç¨19 billion. Structure Within the 13 member national trade associations it has 340 member companies - 95 for sanitary valves, 60 for building valves (gas, water and fire-fighting valves), and 185 in industrial valves (including valve actuators). It is located in the same building as Pneurop. The European Association for the Valves and Taps industry is truly democratic, no national association can veto decisions. Like a true democracy and in a way that mirrors the European Union dynamic, the decisions at Board level are taken in consensus. These industries cover products such as industrial valves, butterfly valves, valve actuators, relief valves, pressure-reducing valves, central heating thermostatic valves, taps and cocks. The constituent organisations include: * The Federation of Finnish Technology Industries * Profluid - Association fran√ßaise des pompes et agitateurs, des compresseurs et de la robinetterie * AVR - Associazione italiana construttori valvole e rubinetteria * AIMMAP - Associ√£cao dos Industrias Metal√∫rgicos, Metalomec√£nicos e Afins de Portugal * –ù–∞—É—á–Ω–æ-–ü—Ä–æ–º—ã—à–ª–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –ê—Å—Å–æ—Ü–∏–∞—Ü–∏—è –ê—Ä–º–∞—Ç—É—Ä–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–∏—Ç–µ–ª–µ–π (NPAA) - Scientific & Industrial Valve Manufacturers Association * AGRIVAL - Asociaci√≥n Nacional de Fabricantes de Griferia y Valvuleria * Svensk Armaturindustri * URS - Verband Schweizerischer Armaturenfabriken (Union de Fabriques Suisses de Robinetterie) * POMSAD - T√ºrk Pompa ve Vana Sanayicileri Derneƒüi (Turkish Pump & Valve Manufacturers' Association) * Ukrainian Association for Valves Industry * The Bathroom Manufacturers Association Besides the General Assembly and the Board, 3 Committees exist : * Marketing & Communication Committee * Sanitary Technical Committee * Building & Industrial Valves Technical Committee Function It holds its annual meeting in April or May. The 2012 meeting was held in May near Paris, in Chantilly. It was organised by Profluid, the French association The 2013 annual meeting will take place in Belgium in Ghent. The event will take place on 24 and 25 May. It is organised in a new way so that the 24 conference is open to any persons having an interest in taps and valves and not only members. This conference will be under the heading of innovation, high level speakers from the Ghent Vlerick business school, from Solvay, from Cefic, the trade association for the chemical industry and from FECS will address the audience. Dynamics The European Association for the Taps and Valves industry has been very active since 2011. It changed its image with a new website, a newsletter, a corporate image and new designed slides. The association also changed its organisational structure to make it effective and best armed to deliver results. Technical Works CEIR's Sanitary Technical Committee is constituted of experts from main taps & showerheads manufacturers in Europe. Its main tasks are regulatory follow-up at European level, standardization follow-up and pre-normative works. It also represents taps & showerheads manufacturers views and interests as CEIR is a registered stakeholder at the European Commission. CEIR is involved in the following topics : * Materials in contact with drinking water * Construction Products Regulation * Water saving initiative and in particular the development of the European ecolabel for taps & showerheads * REACH Regulation CEIR's Building & Industrial Valves Technical Committee deals with a great variety of topics. Applicable regulations are numerous and include : * Pressure Equipment Directive * Construction Products Regulation * ATEX directive Building and industrial valves are used in a complex normative framework, that the Technical Committee is in charge to follow, that includes CEN TC69 and ISO TC153 for industrial valves, CEN TC236 for gas valves and CEN TC164 for building valves. Water label CEIR is heavily involved in the European water label. This voluntary labelling scheme was launched during the European Commission Green Week 2012. It enables consumers to make an informed choice when they buy taps, showerheads or control flow devices. Consumers can very easily and very quickly understand the water flow and thus consumption of the device. CEIR will promote its Water Label during the ISH 2013 trade fair.

Early life and studies Lalewicz finished school at a gimnazjum in Suwa≈Çki in 1895. He then studied architecture at the Academy of Fine Arts in Saint-Petersburg, from which he graduated in 1901. He continued his studies in Sweden, Norway, Germany, Austria and Italy. Until 1917, he taught the history of art and the history of architecture in Saint Petersburg schools, while at the same time designing various buildings in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. After World War I he moved back to newly independent Poland. Between 1925 and 1927 he was the dean of the Architecture Department at the Warsaw Polytechnic, and between 1935 and 1938, he was a rector. He was active in various social organizations dedicated to the preservation of historic buildings. World War II After the Nazi invasion of Poland, Lalewicz served as a director of the emergency medical services (Pogotwie Techniczne) during the Siege of Warsaw. Under German occupation he was a teacher at one of the secret universities (all education past primary school for Poles had been banned by the Nazis). He was expelled by the Germans from his home in 1943. Lalewicz was executed during the Warsaw Uprising by German units, in the Mass murder on Dzika street on August 21, 1944.

The novel was published on April 2, 2012 by Random House Australia. The published edition of the novel is estimated to be about a third of what the ultimate length of the finished product would have been and was discovered on White's desk after his death. Plot The novel was left largely unfinished, with the book initially planned to have three parts. The first part, the only part that White had completed, centers around Eirene Sklavos and Gilbert Horsfall, two children around the age of thirteen that have been brought as refugees to a garden in Sydney Harbour, Australia in order to seek shelter from the effects of World War II. Both children have lost parents due to the war. Eirene's father was executed in a Greek prison as a Communist while Gilbert's mother died during the Blitz in England. The two children are housed together with Essie Bulpit in Neutral Bay, despite Eirene having living relatives close by. The two children slowly find themselves drawn to each other, eventually becoming extremely close and spending much of their time in the unkempt garden surrounding Essie's home. The story follows Eirene and Gilbert as they deal with the hassles and expectations of everyday life, eventually culminating in an inevitable parting of ways when the war ends. White's story ends here, with the only known note as to any future developments in the story mentioned in a note White wrote at the end of the first part of the book stating \\"14 in 1945, 50 in 1981\\". Development White first began working on the novel in the 70s and 80s, but stopped working on the novel to focus on theater and political activism. White died before completing the novel, with him passing along instructions to his literary executor Barbara Mobbs that he wanted the work destroyed, a sentiment he had also expressed to the National Library of Australia when asked for some of his personal documents. She later discovered the novel among a set of personal papers on White's desk. Mobbs initially hesitated over publishing Hanging Garden, stating that she was afraid that the work would ruin White's literary reputation, a sentiment that was echoed by some reviewers. She eventually decided to have the manuscript transcribed from its handwritten state, stating that Hanging Garden \\"deserves to see the light of day\\". The novel was transcribed by Sydney University professors Margaret Harris and Elizabeth Webby, using a grant from the Australian Research Council, with Random House Publishing picking up the rights to the work. The transcribers have commented that the process was \\"challenging\\" due to White's handwriting and punctuation as well as the inclusion of colloquial Greek phrases, which necessitated finding a translator whose \\"Greek wasn't scholarly\\". One of the transcribers also theorized that the work wasn't abandoned, but was instead put on hold due to a note at the book's ending that read \\"14 in 1945, 50 in 1981\\". Of the novel's ending, White told his friends that the ending was \\"all in my head\\" but that \\"such things don't matter in the face of nuclear war, and that I can resist more effectively through plays and public appearances\\". White had also been vocal when it came to the preservation of any unpublished works, notes, or private documents. In a response to the National Library of Australia, White stated \\"I can't let you have my 'papers', because I don't keep any...Anything unfinished when I die is to be burnt.\\" Reception Critical reception for the unfinished work has been positive, with The Monthly writing that it was like a \\"blancmange\\" in that it was \\"perfectly smooth, rapidly consumed, easily digested\\". The Australian praised The Hanging Garden, calling it a \\"rich bequest\\". The UK Spectator cited the book's \\"arresting images\\" as a highlight, but stated that new readers should begin their reading with White's earlier works such as The Vivisector and The Eye of the Storm. The Sydney Morning Herald called it a \\"fitting coda to White's achievement\\" and expressed regret that the book remained unfinished and that the ultimate fates of the two main characters would remain unknown. The paper also stated that the book \\"[suggested] the author was moving towards a more humane view of the world\\". The Herald Scotland also expressed regret and sadness that the work was never completed, calling the book \\"a haunting and tantalising postscript.\\" References Category:2012 Australian novels Category:Novels by Patrick White Category:Unfinished novels Category:Novels published posthumously Category:Random House books ","title":"The Hanging Garden (White novel)"},{"id":"32033462","text":"Frederick Christian Schaeffer (born in Germantown, Pennsylvania, 12 November 1792; died in New York City, 26 March 1832) was a Lutheran clergyman of the United States. Biography His parents were Frederick David Schaeffer and Rosina Rosenmiller. His father was a Lutheran clergyman, as were his brothers David Frederick, Charles Frederick, and Frederick Solomon, and his nephew Charles William. He studied the classics partly at the Germantown academy and partly under his father, with whom he also read theology, and in 1812 was licensed to preach. In the same year he became pastor of the Lutheran congregation at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where he remained three years. There he developed services in both English and German without controversy, an almost unique feat for a Lutheran congregation in his times. In 1815 he accepted a call to United Congregations of New York City, where he preached in German and English, a challenge which had driven the previous pastor to resign. He opposed the New York City tendency of English-speaking Lutherans to join with congregations of the Episcopal Church. In 1823, he organized St. Matthew's English-speaking Lutheran congregation within the United Congregations. Frederick William Geissenhainer was retained to be co-pastor for the German-speaking congregations. Soon afterward difficulties about the church property arose between the German and English congregations. Schaeffer resigned, and organized St. James's English Lutheran congregation, which he served until his death. He received the degree of D.D. in 1830 from Columbia, and in the same year he was elected professor of the German language and literature there. He was deeply interested in the study of natural science, and received from the king of Prussia a gold medal for his valuable services in the interest of this study. He published The Blessed Reformation and Parables and Parabolic Sayings (New York, 1817), and several sermons. See also *St. Michael's Evangelical Lutheran Church (Mt.

It is the fifth track on the 1985 concept album Misplaced Childhood. The song was released as the third single from Misplaced Childhood on 18 November 1985 in the UK, the Netherlands, West Germany, Canada (on Capitol Records), South Africa and Australia. \\"Heart of Lothian\\" became the third Top 30 UK single from Misplaced Childhood, peaking at number 29. The song also peaked at number 51 on the German singles chart. The single version of Heart of Lothian actually begins with the last two sections of Bitter Suite: part d, Misplaced Rendezvous (minus the vocals that appear on the album) and part e, Windswept Thumb, before segueing into part a of Heart of Lothian, Wide Boy, but ends without including part b, Curtain Call. The 7\\" and 12\\" formats of the single both featured a live version of \\"Chelsea Monday\\", originally a track from Marillion's debut 1983 album Script for a Jester's Tear as the b-side. This was recorded at the Muziekcentrum Vredenburg in Utrecht on 15 October 1985. The 12\\" also includes the extended album version of \\"Heart of Lothian\\" as well as the single edit. In the US, the song was first used as the b-side for \\"Kayleigh\\", the band's European hit single. In 1986, \\"Heart of Lothian\\" reappeared as a b-side to the US-only single release \\"Lady Nina\\", which had in turn appeared as a b-side on the European release of the lead single from Misplaced Childhood, \\"Kayleigh\\". As all of Misplaced Childhood, the title track was produced by Chris Kimsey, while the live recording of \\"Chelsea Monday\\" was mixed by Mark Freegard. The cover art was designed by Mark Wilkinson and in the background features the Dugald Stewart Monument, a well- known Edinburgh landmark. There are other references to Edinburgh in the song‚Äî the title itself refers to the Heart of Midlothian, one line reads \\"And anarchy smiles on the Royal Mile\\". A CD replica of the single was also part of a collectors box-set released in July 2000 which contained Marillion's first twelve singles and was re-issued as a 3-CD set in 2009 (see The Singles '82‚Äì'88).

Peace council An important leader since the beginning of the 1820s, was chief and shaman; as their uncle, he trained the two cousins Pots ânakwahip â (Buffalo Hump) and Isaviah (Yellow Wolf), the most important war chiefs of the Penateka Comanches in the period between the Texas Independence and the Civil War; in 1829 he and Yncoroy tried to reach a peace agreement with the Mexican authorithies, but a raid against the settlements in the Guadalupe valley led by Pots ânakwahip â and Isaviah provoked the failure of this project; in 1838 he went to Houston, where he, Amorous Man (Pahayoko), Old Owl (Mupitsukup â), and Pots ânakwahip â met President Sam Houston and signed with him a treaty, while Isaviah stayed in charge of the warriors. His village along the San Saba River was attacked in February 1839 by a detachment of Texas Rangers and their Tonkawa and Lipan auxiliaries, led by Col. Jhon H. Moore.

It is commonly called the sinistral spiral tubeworm and is the type species of the genus Spirorbis.Daudin F. M. (1800). Recueil de m√©moires et de notes sur l'esp√®ces indites ou peu connues de mollusques, de vers et de zoophytes. Paris pp. 50 + 4 pl: Polychaetes, or marine bristle worms, have elongated bodies divided into many segments. Each segment may bear setae (bristles) and parapodia (paddle-like appendages). Some species live freely, either swimming, crawling or burrowing, and these are known as \\"errant\\". Others live permanently in tubes, either calcareous or parchment-like, and these are known as \\"sedentary\\". Description S. borealis secretes a very small, unridged, off-white, calcareous tube. This is about five millimetres in diameter and forms a flat, clockwise spiral coil as seen from above. The worm retreats into its tube when above water but under water can be seen to have green tentacles.John Barrett and C M Young, Collins Pocket Guide to the Sea Shore (1958) p.76 Distribution and habitat S. borealis is found on either side of the north Atlantic Ocean. This includes the coasts of Great Britain, Ireland, Spain and Portugal, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland, the Gulf of St Lawrence and the St Lawrence estuary. It is typically found growing on Fucus, Laminaria and other seaweeds as well as on rocks and stones. It is widely distributed and abundant on the middle and lower shore, down to a depth of about thirty metres. Biology S. borealis is a hermaphrodite. The segments at the front of the abdomen are female while those at the back are male. The male and female gonads mature at much the same time but the sperm is usually released first. Fertilisation is external to the body but inside the tube.Self- and cross-fertilization in Spirorbis borealis and S. pagenstecheri The larvae are free swimming member of the plankton for a short time.On the larval forms of Spirorbis borealis They then settle out. In a study, where fronds of Fucus serratus already colonised by adults were available for settling, the larvae avoided the most densely populated areas and favoured the concave grooves on either side of the midribs. When prevented from settling out for eight hours, they were much less selective and settled on any Fucus surface regardless of the presence of adults.Observations on the Settling Behaviour of Larvae of the Tubeworm Spirorbis borealis, Daudin (Polychaeta) References Category:Serpulidae Category:Animals described in 1800 ","title":"Spirorbis borealis"},{"id":"32033597","text":"William Baring may refer to: *Bingham Baring, 2nd Baron Ashburton (William Bingham Baring, 1799‚Äì1864), British politician and businessman *William S.

Bullen was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm off break. He was born in Clapham, London and educated at Rutlish School which he attended from 1976 to 1982. An all-rounder, Bullen played for Surrey County Cricket Club, Bedfordshire County Cricket Club and the Surrey Cricket Board in a career which spanned from 1982 to 2002. Surrey Bullen made his first-class debut for Surrey against Oxford University in 1982. He didn't play another first- class match for Surrey until 1985, when he appeared against Cambridge University. Bullen played two Youth Test matches in 1982 for England Under-19s against West Indies Under-19s, with both Tests coming in August 1982, after his June debut for Surrey. His List A debut for Surrey also came in 1985, against Sussex in the 1985 John Player Special League. During the course of his career with Surrey, Bullen was viewed by the county as predominantly a limited-overs player: he made 104 List A appearances, as opposed to just 30 first-class appearances. Playing for Surrey until the end of the 1991 season, Bullen scored 667 runs in limited-overs cricket, at a batting average of 23.00. He made a single half century, which was to be the highest score of his List A career, scoring an unbeaten 93 against Wiltshire in the 1990 NatWest Trophy. He took 92 wickets at a bowling average of 34.22, with best figures of 5/31; his only five wicket haul in limited-overs cricket, which came against Yorkshire in the 1989 Refuge Assurance League. Bullen had his best seasons with the ball in List A cricket in the 1987, 1988 and 1989 season's, taking 20 more wickets in each. Despite not being a regular in first-class cricket for Surrey, Bullen nonetheless had some success when he did play. A competent all- rounder, he scored 663 runs in his 30 first-class matches for the county, coming at an average of 23.67. He made 4 half centuries, with a high score of 65 against the touring Pakistanis in 1987. He took 38 wickets in first-class cricket, at an average of 28.36, which was a better average than his List A wickets came at. He took just one five wicket haul in first-class matches, which came against Middlesex, with figures of 6/119. However, 1989 saw Bullen play just two County Championship fixtures. In the following season he didn't make any first-class appearances, while in List A cricket he made 22 appearances, but struggled to make an impact. His 14 wickets that season came at an expensive average of 52.64. He made limited appearances in the 1991 English cricket season, with Surrey releasing him at the end of that season. Later career Bullen joined Bedfordshire for the 1992 season, making his debut for the county in the Minor Counties Championship against Lincolnshire. Bullen played Minor counties cricket for Bedfordshire from 1992 to 1997, making 51 Minor Counties Championship appearances and 14 MCCA Knockout Trophy appearances. He made his first appearance for Bedfordshire in List A cricket against Warwickshire in the 1994 NatWest Trophy. He made one further appearance for the county in limited-overs cricket, against Glamorgan in the 1997 NatWest Trophy. He took 3 wickets for Bedfordshire in these 2 games, although all 3 wickets came against Warwickshire, with Bullen claiming figures of 3/58 from 10 overs. While playing for Bedfordshire, he made one final first-class appearance for the Minor Counties cricket team against the touring South Africans. In this match, he bowled 4 wicket-less overs in the South Africans first-innings, while in their second innings he took the wickets of Daryll Cullinan and Gerhardus Liebenberg for the cost of 42 runs from 8.4 overs. With the bat, he didn't bat in the Minor Counties first-innings, while in their second-innings he was dismissed for 2 runs by Pat Symcox. Bullen left Bedfordshire at the end of the 1997 season. He played for the Surrey Cricket Board in the 1998 MCCA Knockout Trophy, while in the 1999 season he made his first appearance in List A cricket for the Board in the 1999 NatWest Trophy against Norfolk. Bullen appeared in a further 5 List A matches for the Board, the last coming against Lincolnshire in the 2nd round of the 2002 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy, which was played in 2001. He scored 103 runs for the Board in the 6 matches, coming at an average of 25.75, with a high score of 36. With the ball, he took 7 wickets at 31.57 a piece, with best figures of 2/16. Bullen was an able fielder during his career, taking a total of 65 catches in limited-overs cricket. Bullen currently works for Surrey County Cricket Club as a Cricket Development Manager. His cousin, David Roberts, played first- class and List A cricket.

They were the first German paratroopers to be committed in large-scale airborne operations. Throughout World War II the Fallschirmj√§ger commander was Kurt Student. Pre-war history During the interwar years the rapid development of aircraft and aviation technology drew the attention of imaginative military planners. The idea of inserting a large body of troops inside enemy territory was first proposed during World War I by commander of the U.S. Air Corps in France‚ÄîBrigadier General Billy Mitchell.Ailsby, Christopher: Hitler's Sky Warriors: German Paratroopers in Action, 1939-1945, page 12. Spellmount Limited, 2000. However, the Allied High Command was forced to abandon the idea as it was unprepared for such an undertaking, both logistically and in materiel. Among the first to recognize the potential of airborne forces were Italy and the Soviet Union.Ailsby, 16 The first effective means of supporting massed infantry airborne operations came with the development of the static-line parachute in Italy in the 1920s, whereby parachutes are attached to the inside of the aircraft and deployed automatically upon departure. This technique allowed the jumps to occur at lower altitudes, limiting exposure to enemy fire, and providing a tighter drop zone grouping than individually deployed rip-cord type parachutes. The word Fallschirmj√§ger is from the German Fallschirm \\"parachute\\" and J√§ger \\"hunter\\", the light infantry of the Prussian Army. The Soviets were the first to demonstrate the military possibilities of airborne infantry in the 1930s with a series of maneuvers held in 1935 and 1936. Though somewhat crude (the Soviet paratroopers had to exit their slow-moving Tupolev TB-3 transporters through a hatch in the roof and then position themselves along the wings and jump together), the exercise managed to land 1,000 troops through air-drops followed by another 2,500 soldiers with heavy equipment delivered via airlandings. The gathered forces proceeded to carry out conventional infantry attacks with the support of heavy machine guns and light artillery.Ailsby, 18 Among the foreign observers present was Hermann G√∂ring. Impressed, G√∂ring became personally committed to the creation of Germany's airborne arm in the 1930s.Ailsby, 21 As the Prussian Prime Minister of the Interior, he had ordered the formation of a specialist police unit in 1933, the Polizeiabteilung Wecke, devoted to protecting Nazi Party officials. The organization of this unit was entrusted to Polizeimajor Walther Wecke of the Prussian Police Force, who had assembled a special detachment of 14 officers and 400 men within just two days. On 17 July, the detachment was officially renamed Landespolizeigruppe Wecke.Ailsby, 22 On 22 December 1933, the unit was again retitled, becoming the Landespolizeigruppe General G√∂ring. The unit carried out conventional police duties for the next two years under the command of G√∂ring's ministerial adjutant Friedrich Jakoby, but it was G√∂ring's intention to ultimately produce a unit that would match the Reichswehr. In March‚ÄìApril 1935, G√∂ring transformed the Landespolizei General G√∂ring into Germany's first dedicated airborne regiment, giving it the military designation Regiment General G√∂ring (RGG) on 1 April 1935 (after Hitler introduced conscription on 16 March 1935). The unit was incorporated into the newly formed Luftwaffe on 1 October of the same year and training commenced at Altengrabow. G√∂ring also ordered that a group of volunteers be drawn for parachute training. These volunteers would form a core Fallschirmsch√ºtzen Bataillon (\\"parachute soldiers battalion\\"), a cadre for future Fallschirmtruppe (\\"parachute troops\\"). In January 1936, 600 men and officers formed the 1st J√§ger Battalion/RGG, commanded by Bruno Br√§uer, and the 15th Engineer Company/RGG and were transferred to training area D√∂beritz for jump training while the rest of the regiment was sent to Altengrabow.Ailsby, 23 Germany's parachute arm was officially inaugurated on 29 January 1936Ailsby, 26 with an Order of the Day calling for recruits for parachute training at the Stendal Parachute Training School located west of Berlin. The school was activated several months after the first parachute units were established in January 1936 and was open to active and reserve Luftwaffe personnel. NCOs, officers and other ranks of the Luftwaffe were required to successfully complete six jumps in order to receive the Luftwaffe Parachutist's Badge (instituted on 5 November 1936). Formation The 1st Parachute Division was originally formed in 1938, when it was designated as the 7th Air Division. It carried out airborne operations in the early stages of the war, including the successful capture of Fort Eben-Emael in Belgium. It later fought in the Battle of Crete but its heavy losses there saw Hitler refuse to consider using his troops in a significant airborne role again. It became the 1st Parachute Division in 1942, when it was reformed in Russia. The division existed as a fighting unit until the German surrender in Italy of 2 May 1945, one week before the end of World War II in Europe. The 2nd Parachute Division was formed in France under the command of Generalleutnant Hermann-Bernhard Ramcke in early 1943, based on the 2nd Parachute Brigade that had fought in North Africa. Sent to Rome as part of the occupation force when the Italian government began to reconsider its war effort, it later fought in the Ukraine and in western France. The majority of the division was cut off and surrounded in Brest during the German retreat from France, resulting in the Battle for Brest, that lasted until September 1944. A new 2nd Parachute Division was formed in November 1944 and the following year was involved in fighting in Arnhem, during the Rhine crossings and in the Ruhr Pocket with Army Group B. The 3rd and 4th Parachute divisions were formed in 1943. The 4th also contained Italian paratroopers drawn from the 184th Airborne Division Nembo and 185th Paratroopers Division Folgore. The 3rd fought during the Normandy Campaign; it was largely destroyed in the Falaise Pocket in August 1944. It was then reformed and took part the Battle of the Ardennes, and ended the war in the Ruhr Pocket where it surrendered to US troops in April 1945. The 4th fought exclusively on the Italian front including the Battle of Anzio, Rome and on the Gothic Line. It surrendered to Allied forces in April 1945. The 5th Parachute Division was formed in France in 1943. It was involved in the fighting in Normandy after D-Day and most of its personnel were killed or captured in the Falaise Pocket. It was reformed in the Netherlands but with Luftwaffe ground crew. It fought in the Ardennes offensive and along the Rhine before its survivors surrendered at the end of the war. The 6th and 7th Parachute divisions were formed in 1944 in France and Germany respectively and fought on the western front as regular infantry. Both divisions surrendered at the end of May. The 8th, 9th and 10th were Fallschirmj√§ger by name only, as they were hastily formed in late 1944‚Äìearly 1945 from a disparate collection of Luftwaffe units, including ground crews. Furthermore, they never reached divisional strength and under-trained and mostly ill-prepared for combat. The 8th fought in the Netherlands before being destroyed in the Ruhr Pocket while the 9th and 10th fought on the rapidly collapsing Eastern Front, including within Germany. The 9th fought in the Battle of the Seelow Heights and in the Battle of Berlin before being destroyed in April 1945; the 10th surrendered to Soviet army forces in May 1945.

During the German invasion of Poland in September 1939 the Fallschirmj√§ger were sent to occupy several airfields between the Vistula and Bug rivers.McNab P.39 The first opposed airborne attacks occurred during the Norwegian Campaign, first during the initial invasion when Fallschirmj√§ger captured the defended air base of Sola, near Stavanger. The Fallschirmj√§ger also had their first defeat in Norway, when a company was dropped on the village and railroad junction of Domb√•s on 14 April 1940 and was destroyed by the Norwegian Army in a five-day battle.Bj√∏rn Jervaas: The Fallschirmj√§ger Battle at Dombaas On 10 May 1940, the Fallschirmj√§ger performed a successful raid on the powerful fortification known as Eben Emael.McNab P.4 Eben Emael consisted of multiple gun emplacements and was manned by 1,200 Belgian troops. There are few better representations by elite troops and everything was cutting edge at the time, from tactics to method of deployment. The airborne troops attacked the artillery casements and pillboxes with flame throwers, demolition charges, and hollow charge grenades.McNab P.49 The mission was accomplished by Sturmgruppe Granit (Assault Group Granite), which consisted of only 85 soldiers. Despite being at both a numerical and firepower disadvantage, the airborne troops took control of the fort after a few hours of fighting. During the invasion of the Netherlands over 2,000 troops of the 7th Air Division were deployed, while approximately 12,000 troops of the 22nd Airlanding Division also participated.McNab P.50 The Fallschirmj√§ger successfully captured bridges at Moerdijk and Dordrecht. The airborne troops suffered heavy casualties while taking Dordrecht.McNab P.52 The paratroopers were able to captured airfields at Valkenburg, Ockenburg, Waalhaven, and Ypenburg. Yet, the Germans failed to capture Hague and force the Dutch to surrender. Therefore, the performance of the paratroopers in the Netherlands was mixed as far as efficiency and results was concerned.McNab P.54 The 22nd Airlanding Division was forced to land many of its aircraft on exposed motorways because the 7th Air Division had failed to secure designated airfields. Most aircraft ended up being shot up by Dutch infantry and artillery fire.McNab P.55 The airborne troops were able to cause disruption behind Dutch lines. During the Greece campaign, the German airborne forces would perform their last strategic parachute and glider performances of the war.McNab P.57 The airborne troops captured a critical bridge that crossed the canal in the Isthmus of Corinth so German forces could pursue Allied forces further in the Greek mainland.McNab P.59 The operation did not go smoothly due in part to heavy enemy ground fire. Demolition charges were also accidentally detonated, due to carelessness, leading to damage to the bridge and heavy casualties. One group of paratroopers was accidentally dropped into the sea where they all drowned. The airborne forces did manage to capture British anti-aircraft positions, which forced the surrender of the local town. 12,000 Commonwealth and Greek troops were also captured.Sutherland & Canwell P.8 The German airborne forces suffered 63 killed and 174 wounded. The final major offensive German action of the Greece campaign was the German invasion of Crete, in May 1941. The Fallschirmj√§ger would suffer further heavy losses during the Battle of Crete especially during Operation Merkur which would be the end of large scale airborne and glider operations for the Fallschirmj√§ger.McNab P.72 The Germans used 22,000 airborne soldiers but in only nine days 3,250 of them were killed or missing with another 3,400 wounded. It was said that Adolf Hitler was horrified at these losses incurred and that he would no longer sanction large scale airborne operations.Ailsby P.65 During the 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union the 1st and 3rd Battalions of the 1st Parachute Regiment and the 2nd Battalion of the Luftlande- Sturmregiment (Airlanding Assault Regiment) were assigned to the Army Group North's 18th Army where they would conduct operations in the Leningrad area.Ailsby P.66 The Fallschirmj√§ger were specifically deployed to the east of Leningrad on the River Neva to confront a Red Army effort to relieve the city. In October 1941, the German paratroopers were involved in heavy fighting against the Soviets and were successful in holding off Soviet attacks. From late October 1941 until 4 July 1942, the 22nd Airlanding Division participated in the Siege of Sevastopol. The Fallschirmj√§ger overran most of the Soviet 79th Naval Infantry Brigade during combat operations. The Soviet unit tried counterattacking on 10 June, but was repulsed. The Soviet formation was effectively destroyed, with the support of the Luftwaffe, which used anti- personnel bombs against Soviet infantry caught in the open.Forzcyk 2008, pp. 58‚Äì59. In July 1942, the Ramcke Parachute Brigade was deployed to North Africa to assist the Axis war effort there.Ailsby P.84 In late October the Brigade participated in the 2nd Battle of El Alamein.Ailsby P.87 The Brigade successfully captured a British supply column which provided it with some trucks and much needed supplies. Between November and December 1942, the 1st and 3rd Battalions of the 5th Parachute Regiment were flown into Tunisia to protect its airfields and take up defensive positions around the city of Koch during the Allied Operation Torch.Ailsby P.88,89 It was followed closely by the 11th Parachute Pioneer Battalion under the command of Major Rudolf Witzig. It had the strength of 716 men. It took up defensive positions west of Tunis where it had a series of battles with the advance guard of the Allied spearhead.Ailsby P.90 Parts of the unit had received special training in reconnaissance and intelligence gathering. This intelligence led to the last parachute drop in North Africa. The operation ended up a major failure due to mostly inexperienced and poorly trained pilots. The Fallschirmj√§ger were dropped too far from their targets. The paras never made it to their targets because many were captured by British patrols as they landed.Ailsby P.91 On 26 December 1942, the men of Parachute Company of the Brandenburg Regiment were transported by gliders in an operation to destroy bridges and supply routes used by the British. It too was a disaster. Some of the gliders were shot down while flying over enemy lines while others were destroyed while approaching their targets. Most of the paras were killed in the operation. The 2nd Parachute Regiment, an Assault Regiment Battalion, and Antitank and Machine Gun Battalions were sent to conduct operations in the Ukraine.Ailsby P.67 They would be assigned to Army Group South. This force would be known as Kampfgruppe Sturm commanded by Oberst Alfred Sturm. The Fallschirmj√§ger suffered heavy casualties while defending a sector along the River Mius around the town of Charzysk during the winter of 1941 and into early 1942. In March 1943, the Fallschirmj√§ger of the 3rd Battalion of the 4th Regiment, 7th Airborne Division defended a hill at Lushi on the Eastern Front.Sutherland & Canwell P.128 They were reinforced by paras from 3rd Battalion of the 3rd Regiment. Between 20‚Äì27 March these two battalions held off two complete Soviet divisions. In May 1943, what was left of Fallschirmj√§ger units in North Africa had been captured by Allied forces.Ailsby P.93 The Fallschirmj√§ger commanders were flown out of North Africa and managed to escape captivity. On 12 September 1943, the Fallschirmj√§ger conducted a successful rescue mission of Italian Prime minister Benito Mussolini at the Gran Sasso.Lopez P.24 It is known as the Gran Sasso raid. The operation received wide acclaim despite there being very little enemy resistance during the operation. Only two enemy soldiers died during the operation.Lopez P.20 The primary unit responsible for the success of the mission was Fallschirmj√§ger Lehr Batallion.Lopez P.6 It was considered elite of the elite and named for security reasons 1./FJR7. It was under the command of Major Harald Mors. General Kurt Student played a major role in the planning of the operation.Lopez P.7 The operation ended up being controversial due to Waffen SS legend Otto Skorzeny also participating in the operation. Skorzeny and his participating 26 Waffen SS troops managed to take much of the credit for the success of the operation despite the fact the 82 Fallschirmj√§ger soldiers played a more significant role during the operation.Lopez P.51,54 Skorzeny received a promotion to Sturmbannf√ºhrer, the award of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and fame that led to his \\"most dangerous man in Europe\\" image. During 26 September 1943 to 16 November 1943, the Fallschirmj√§ger participated in the Battle of Leros. In October 1943, the Fallschirmj√§ger 22nd Airlanding Division participated in the Battle of Kos. In November 1943, the 2nd Parachute Division was ordered to the Eastern Front where it took up position near the Russian held town of Zhitomir.Ailsby P.74 The Red Army was to seize a communication centre there and destroy the entire German Southern wing. The Red Army's primary aim was also to take Kiev. By December the Red Army had massed a large force northeast of the city. The Fallschirmj√§ger managed to assist other German forces in plugging the gaps created by the Soviet advance. On 15 December 1943, the 2nd Parachute Division was airlifted to Kirovograd and put on the front at Klintsy. It was supported by the 11th Panzer Division and the 286th Self Propelled Artillery Brigade. The Fallschirmj√§ger participated in fierce fighting around Novgorodka.Ailsby P.75 By 23 December the paratroopers stabilized the front but suffered heavy casualties. During 17 January ‚Äì 18 May 1944, the Fallschirmj√§ger participated in the Battle of Monte Cassino. Allied Forces' aim was a breakthrough to Rome. At the beginning of 1944, the western half of the Winter Line was being anchored by Germans holding the Rapido-Gari, Liri and Garigliano valleys and some of the surrounding peaks and ridges. Together, these features formed the Gustav Line. Monte Cassino, a historic hilltop abbey founded in AD 529 by Benedict of Nursia, dominated the nearby town of Cassino and the entrances to the Liri and Rapido valleys. Lying in a protected historic zone, it had been left unoccupied by the Germans. They had manned some positions set into the steep slopes below the abbey's walls. Repeated pinpoint artillery attacks on Allied assault troops caused their leaders to conclude the abbey was being used by the Germans as an observation post, at the least. Fears escalated along with casualties and in spite of a lack of clear evidence, it was marked for destruction. On 15 February American bombers dropped 1,400 tons of high explosives, creating widespread damage. The raid failed to achieve its objective, as the Fallschirmj√§ger occupied the rubble and established excellent defensive positions amid the ruins. Between 17 January and 18 May, Monte Cassino and the Gustav defences were assaulted four times by Allied troops, the last involving twenty divisions attacking along a twenty-mile front. The German defenders were finally driven from their positions, but at a high cost.Jordan, D, (2004), Atlas of World War II. Barnes & Noble Books, p. 92. The capture of Monte Cassino resulted in 55,000 Allied casualties, with German losses being far fewer, estimated at around 20,000 killed and wounded.name=\\"Axelrod208\\" In early January 1944, the Red Army conducted a new offensive against the 2nd Parachute Division. The Fallschirmj√§ger suffered heavy casualties. The 2nd Battalion of the 5th Regiment was destroyed. By 6 January 1944 The 7th, 5th, and 2nd Regiments had been forced to retreat from Novgorodka due to the efforts of the Red Army. The Paras dug in around Kirovograd. In March the Red Army once again resumed operations against the 2nd Parachute Division. By the last week of the month the Red Army had forced the paras across the Southern Bug River where they would establish defensive positions on the opposite bank. By May the Red Army forced the Fallschirmj√§ger back to the river of Dniester. The Fallschirmj√§ger had been decimated by the fighting and by the end of the month the division was transferred back to Germany for refitting.Ailsby P.78 On 3 July 1944 the 2nd Parachute Corps battled the U.S. 1st Army at Coutances-Marigny-St. Lo. The Fallschirmj√§ger utilized the terrain of the so-called Bocage and the hedgerows to their advantage to negate American superiority in both firepower and quantity of troops.Ailsby P.141 The Fallschirmj√§ger inflicted heavy casualties on American forces due mostly to tactical superiority and the terrain preventing the Americans from utilizing their armored forces.Ailsby P.142 On 11 July 1944 the 1st Battalion, 9th Parachute Regiment executed a successful attack on the U.S. 1st Battalion, 115th Infantry Regiment.Ailsby P.143 Initially, the Americans would suffer the loss of their outposts mostly due to German artillery and mortar fire. The Americans held due to their artillery and air support, and the paras eventually were forced to retreat. On 11 July 1944 the 3rd Parachute Division suffered heavy casualties while attempting to prevent American forces from capturing the city of St. Lo.Ailsby P.144 The German 12th Parachute Gun Brigade, 3rd Parachute Reconnaissance Company, and 3rd Engineer Battalion all suffered heavy casualties mostly due to outstanding American artillery fire.Ailsby P.144,145 The Paras would hold out until 27 July due to their great effort. German forces managed to inflict 11,000 casualties on its American opponents.Ailsby P.145 On 25 July 1944, the 21st Parachute Pioneer Battalion was positioned on the road between Dunaburg and Kovno in Lithuania. The Red Army attacked the Battalion the following day. The Battalion would be encircled and eventually destroyed. The unit would be disbanded and sent to other Fallschirmj√§ger units. On 25 July 1944, the 2nd Parachute Division was involved in the defense of Brest against the American 7th Corps. American forces suffered 4,000 casualties in its effort to invest the port.Ailsby P.146 Other elements of the 2nd Parachute Division were destroyed by American armored forces while on their way to assist the 5th Parachute Division at St. Malo. American forces captured Brest on 20 September 1944. What was left of the 2nd Parachute Corps was sent to Cologne after Falaise for rest and refitting. Heydte's 6th Parachute Regiment went to Guestrow-Mecklenburg to form the foundation of a new regiment. In September 1944, the 1st Parachute Corps fought in the Allied Offensive in Italy known as Operation Olive.Ailsby P.123 In September 1944, the 4th Parachute Division was defending positions at the Futa and 2 Giogo Passes when the U.S. 91st and 85th divisions mounted an attack.Ailsby P.128 This was followed by six days of intense fighting. American forces succeeded in capturing the 2nd Giogo Pass, Monticelli Ridge, and Monte Altuzzo, in Italy, mostly due to the overwhelming firepower of American forces. On 21 September 1944, British and Canadian forces were successful in overcoming defensive positions manned by the 1st Parachute Corps to capture Rimini.Ailsby P.126 On 13 October 1944, Axis forces which included the 4th Parachute Division manage to halt an Allied 2nd Corps' advance south of Bologna, Italy.Ailsby P.127 In April 1945, the 9th Parachute Division would be destroyed while trying to contain a Russian bridgehead on the west bank of the River Oder.Ailsby P.79 What remained of the unit would be destroyed while trying to defend Berlin from the Red Army. In April 1945, the 10th Parachute Division would be destroyed by the Red Army in Austria. The division's artillery battalion was destroyed in Feldbach by the Red Army. What remained of the unit would be destroyed north of Bruenn. On 15 April 1945, 760 Allied bombers pounded the positions of 1st Parachute Corps and other Axis units in the Argenta Gap, Italy. The paratroopers continued to fight but by 18 April, the Axis forces wavered to the massive Allied ground and aerial onslaught. In May 1945, the remaining paratroopers of the 1st and 4th Parachute Divisions surrendered in Italy along with the remaining Axis Forces.Ailsby P.129 The Allied Forces had succeeded in driving Axis forces into the open where massive air support inflicted heavy casualties and material losses. The Axis campaign in Italy had ended in defeat. =Casualties= According to the General Staff of the Wehrmacht the Fallschirmj√§ger had suffered the following losses by February 1945:Hahn, Fritz.

A reprisal was ordered to send a message to the Cretan population to not resist German occupation of the island. A select group of Fallschirmj√§ger were chosen to carry out the civilian reprisal which was composed of four trucks full of German paratroopers from the III Battalion of Luftlande-Sturm-Regiment 1 commanded by Oberleutnant Horst Trebes. On 2 June 1941, the paratroopers arrived at the village of Kondomari and rounded up the male villagers and chose their victims. Between twenty-three to sixty men were killed in a firing squad while the women and children of the village watched as witnesses to the mass murder which came to be known as the Massacre of Kondomari. As a further reprisal against the Cretans the following day, the 1st Air Landing Assault Regiment of the Fallschirmj√§ger killed one hundred eighty inhabitants in the village of Kandanos and razed the village to the ground.

In 1970 Lois Gould published her first novel, Such Good Friends, about a woman who learns of her husband's many affairs only after he has lapsed into a coma while in the hospital. Such Good Friends was on the New York Times best-seller list for seven weeks and was subsequently adapted for film by Otto Preminger. The book was republished along with Gould's other novels in 1988.Lois Gould, a Writer on Women's Inner Lives, Dies at 70 - New York Times The novel's plot was partly drawn from life: when, in 1966, Gould's then husband Philip Benjamin, a New York Times reporter, died accidentally in connection with minor surgery, his widow reputedly discovered, among his papers, an encoded diary which concerned his numerous acts of adultery. Lois married psychiatrist Robert E. Gould in 1967, who adopted her sons Anthony and Roger V. Gould.

Framework-based gender analysis has great importance in helping policy makers understand the economic case for allocating development resources to women as well as men. History The framework has its origins in 1980 with a request to Harvard University for Women In Development (WID) training from the World Bank. James Austin, who was well known for case-method training at Harvard, led a team with three women experienced in WID work: Catherine Overholt, Mary Anderson and Kathleen Cloud. These became known as the \\"Harvard Team\\". The framework was elaborated by the Harvard Institute for International Development in collaboration with the WID office of USAID, and was first described in 1984 by Catherine Overholt and others. It was one of the earliest of such frameworks. The starting point for the framework was the assumption that it makes economic sense for development aid projects to allocate resources to women as well as men, which will make development more efficient ‚Äì a position named the ‚Äúefficiency approach\\". The Framework for People Oriented Planning in Refugee Situations, more often called the People-Oriented Planning Framework, or POP, is a framework based on the Harvard Framework that tries to overcome some of its initial weaknesses, and is designed for use in emergency situations. POP was developed for the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. Other frameworks include Caroline Moser's Gender Planning Framework, Naila Kabeer's Social Relations Framework and the Womens Empowerment Framework. The framework The Harvard Analytical Framework is used to collect information from the community and from households. It describes who does each activity, who has access and control of resources and the influences on gender roles. The Activity Profile answers the question \\"Who does what?\\" for all relevant productive and reproductive tasks. The Access and Control Profile identifies the resources used in the tasks identified in the Activity Profile, and defines who has access to these resources and who controls their use. It also identifies the benefits that are realized from each activity, and who has access to and control over these benefits. The final Influencing factors section identifies factors that cause the differences of roles of each gender identified in the two profiles. These may indicate areas where there is opportunity to change gender roles. A project using the framework will have identification, design, implementation and evaluation stages. The framework also provides a series of checklists, questions to be asked at each stage. A more complete description of the framework is given in A Case Book: Gender Roles in Development Projects edited by Catherine Overholt, Mary B. Anderson, Kathleen Cloud, James E. Austin, published by Kumariyan Press in 1985. Strengths and weaknesses Being neutral and fact-oriented, the framework is useful in starting discussion on gender-related issues with people who otherwise resist thinking about the balance of power between men and women. It is also useful in presenting information to people who tend to see decisions in economic terms. The framework applies best to projects addressing agricultural or rural based communities, or that are seeking poverty reduction through implementing a sustainable livelihood. The Harvard Framework focuses on projects rather than programs, and on efficiency rather than effectiveness. It does not help identify strategic gender needs and gives no guidance on changing gender inequalities. The framework assumes that gender needs should be addressed for the sake of economic efficiency, and gives less importance to the concepts of equity, power relations or decision-making processes. The top-down check-box approach leads to simplification, ignoring the subjects' analysis of their situation and ignoring factors such as race, class, ethnicity and other types of relationships, essential in progressing efficiency itself.

It is a form of technical analysis, since it ignores the fundamental factors of a security and looks primarily at the security's price history. What differentiates it from most forms of technical analysis is that its main focus is the relation of a security's current price to its past prices as opposed to values derived from that price history. This past history includes swing highs and swing lows, trend lines, and support and resistance levels. At its most simplistic, it attempts to describe the human thought processes invoked by experienced, non-disciplinary traders as they observe and trade their markets.Livermore 1940, chapter 1Mackay 1869Mandelbrot 2008, chapter 1Schwager 1984, chapter 23 Price action is simply how prices change - the action of price. It is readily observed in markets where liquidity and price volatility are highest, but anything that is bought or sold freely in a market will per se demonstrate price action. Price action trading can be included under the umbrella of technical analysis but is covered here in a separate article because it incorporates the behavioural analysis of market participants as a crowd from evidence displayed in price action - a type of analysis whose academic coverage isn't focused in any one area, rather is widely described and commented on in the literature on trading, speculation, gambling and competition generally. It includes a large part of the methodology employed by floor tradersChicago Board of Trade 1997, chapter 8 and tape readers.Neill 1931, chapter 3 It can also optionally include analysis of volume and level 2 quotes. A price action trader observes the relative size, shape, position, growth (when watching the current real-time price) and volume (optionally) of the bars on an OHLC bar or candlestick chart, starting as simple as a single bar, most often combined with chart formations found in broader technical analysis such as moving averages, trend lines or trading ranges.Eykyn 2003, chapters 5,6,7Brooks 2009 The use of price action analysis for financial speculation doesn't exclude the simultaneous use of other techniques of analysis, and on the other hand, a minimalist price action trader can rely completely on the behavioural interpretation of price action to build a trading strategy. The various authors who write about price action, e.g. Brooks, Duddella,Duddella 2008, chapter 10 give names to the price action chart formations and behavioural patterns they observe, which may or may not be unique to that author and known under other names by other authors (more investigation into other authors to be done here). These patterns can often only be described subjectively and the idealized formation or pattern can in reality appear with great variation.  Credibility  There is no evidence that these explanations are correct even if the price action trader who makes such statements is profitable and appears to be correct. Since the disappearance of most pit-based financial exchanges, the financial markets have become anonymous, buyers do not meet sellers, and so the feasibility of verifying any proposed explanation for the other market participants' actions during the occurrence of a particular price action pattern is exceedingly small. Also, price action analysis can be subject to survivorship bias for failed traders do not gain visibility. Hence, for these reasons, the explanations should only be viewed as subjective rationalisations and may quite possibly be wrong, but at any point in time they offer the only available logical analysis with which the price action trader can work. The implementation of price action analysis is difficult, requiring the gaining of experience under live market conditions. There is every reason to assume that the percentage of price action speculators who fail, give up or lose their trading capital will be similar to the percentage failure rate across all fields of speculation. According to widespread folklore / urban myth, this is 90%, although analysis of data from US forex brokers' regulatory disclosures since 2010 puts the figure for failed accounts at around 75% and suggests this is typical.Bary 2011 Some sceptical authorsTaleb 2001 dismiss the financial success of individuals using technical analysis such as price action and state that the occurrence of individuals who appear to be able to profit in the markets can be attributed solely to the Survivorship bias.  Analytical process  A candlestick chart of the Euro against the USD, marked up by a price action trader. A price action trader's analysis may start with classical technical analysis, e.g. Edwards and Magee patterns including trend lines, break-outs, and pull-backs,Edwards and Magee 1948 which are broken down further and supplemented with extra bar-by-bar analysis, sometimes including volume. This observed price action gives the trader clues about the current and likely future behaviour of other market participants. The trader can explain why a particular pattern is predictive, in terms of bulls (buyers in the market), bears (sellers), the crowd mentality of other traders, change in volume and other factors. A good knowledge of the market's make-up is required. The resulting picture that a trader builds up will not only seek to predict market direction, but also speed of movement, duration and intensity, all of which is based on the trader's assessment and prediction of the actions and reactions of other market participants. Price action patterns occur with every bar and the trader watches for multiple patterns to coincide or occur in a particular order, creating a set-up that results in a signal to buy or sell. Individual traders can have widely varying preferences for the type of setup that they concentrate on in their trading. One published price action trader is capable of giving a name and a rational explanation for the observed market movement for every single bar on a bar chart, regularly publishing such charts with descriptions and explanations covering 50 or 100 bars. This trader freely admits that his explanations may be wrong, however the explanations serve a purpose, allowing the trader to build a mental scenario around the current 'price action' as it unfolds.  Implementation of trades  The price action trader will use setups to determine entries and exits for positions. Each setup has its optimal entry point. Some traders also use price action signals to exit, simply entering at one setup and then exiting the whole position on the appearance of a negative setup. Alternatively, the trader might simply exit instead at a profit target of a specific cash amount or at a predetermined level of loss. This style of exit is often based on the previous support and resistance levels of the chart. A more experienced trader will have their own well-defined entry and exit criteria, built from experience. An experienced price action trader will be well trained at spotting multiple bars, patterns, formations and setups during real-time market observation. The trader will have a subjective opinion on the strength of each of these and how strong a setup they can build them into. A simple setup on its own is rarely enough to signal a trade. There should be several favourable bars, patterns, formations and setups in combination, along with a clear absence of opposing signals. At that point when the trader is satisfied that the price action signals are strong enough, the trader will still wait for the appropriate entry point or exit point at which the signal is considered 'triggered'. During real-time trading, signals can be observed frequently while still building, and they are not considered triggered until the bar on the chart closes at the end of the chart's given period. Entering a trade based on signals that have not triggered is known as entering early and is considered to be higher risk since the possibility still exists that the market will not behave as predicted and will act so as to not trigger any signal. After entering the trade, the trader needs to place a protective stop order to close the position with minimal loss if the trade goes wrong. The protective stop order will also serve to prevent losses in the event of a disastrously timed internet connection loss for online traders. After the style of Brooks, the price action trader will place the initial stop order 1 tick below the bar that gave the entry signal (if going long - or 1 tick above if going short) and if the market moves as expected, moves the stop order up to one tick below the entry bar, once the entry bar has closed and with further favourable movement, will seek to move the stop order up further to the same level as the entry, i.e. break-even. Brooks also warns against using a signal from the previous trading session when there is a gap past the position where the trader would have had the entry stop order on the opening of the new session. The worse entry point would alter the risk/reward relationship for the trade, so is not worth pursuing.  Behavioural observation  A price action trader generally sets great store in human fallibility and the tendency for traders in the market to behave as a crowd. For instance, a trader who is bullish about a certain stock might observe that this stock is moving in a range from $20 to $30, but the traders expects the stock to rise to at least $50. Many traders would simply buy the stock, but then every time that it fell to the low of its trading range, would become disheartened and lose faith in their prediction and sell. A price action trader would wait until the stock hit $31. That is a simple example from Livermore from the 1920s. In a modern-day market, the price action trader would first be alerted to the stock once the price has broken out to $31, but knowing the counter-intuitiveness of the market and having picked up other signals from the price action, would expect the stock to pull-back from there and would only buy when the pull-back finished and the stock moved up again. Support, Resistance, and Fibonacci levels are all important areas where human behavior may affect price action. \\"Psychological levels\\", such as levels ending in .00, are a very common order trigger location. Several strategies use these levels as a means to plot out where to secure profit or place a Stop Loss. These levels are purely the result of human behavior as they interpret said levels to be important.  Two attempts rule  One key observation of price action traders is that the market often revisits price levels where it reversed or consolidated. If the market reverses at a certain level, then on returning to that level, the trader expects the market to either carry on past the reversal point or to reverse again. The trader takes no action until the market has done one or the other. It is considered to bring higher probability trade entries, once this point has passed and the market is either continuing or reversing again. The traders do not take the first opportunity but rather wait for a second entry to make their trade. For instance the second attempt by bears to force the market down to new lows represents, if it fails, a double bottom and the point at which many bears will abandon their bearish opinions and start buying, joining the bulls and generating a strong move upwards. Also as an example, after a break-out of a trading range or a trend line, the market may return to the level of the break-out and then instead of rejoining the trading range or the trend, will reverse and continue the break-out. This is also known as 'confirmation'.  Trapped  \\"Trapped traders\\" is a common price action term referring to traders who have entered the market on weak signals, or before signals were triggered, or without waiting for confirmation and who find themselves in losing positions because the market turns against them. Any price action pattern that the traders used for a signal to enter the market is considered 'failed' and that failure becomes a signal in itself to price action traders, e.g. failed breakout, failed trend line break, failed reversal. It is assumed that the trapped traders will be forced to exit the market and if in sufficient numbers, this will cause the market to accelerate away from them, thus providing an opportunity for the more patient traders to benefit from their duress. ‚ÄúTrapped traders‚Äù is therefore used to describe traders in a position that will be stopped out if price action hits their stop loss limit. The term is closely linked to the idea of a ‚Äútrap‚Äù which Brooks defines as: \\"An entry that immediately reverses to the opposite direction before a scalper‚Äôs profit target is reached, trapping traders in their new position, ultimately forcing them to cover at a loss. It can also scare traders out of a good trade.\\" Since many traders place protective stop orders to exit from positions that go wrong, all the stop orders placed by trapped traders will provide the orders that boost the market in the direction that the more patient traders bet on. The phrase \\"the stops were run\\" refers to the execution of these stop orders. Since 2009, the use of the term ‚Äútrapped traders‚Äù has grown in popularity and is now a generic term used by price actions traders and applied in different markets ‚Äì stocks, futures, forex, commodities, cryptocurrencies, etc. All trapped trader strategies are essentially variations of Brooks pioneering work.  Trend and range definition  A 'bear' trend where the market is continually falling, interrupted by only weak rises. This concept of a trend is one of the primary concepts in technical analysis. A trend is either up or down and for the complete neophyte observing a market, an upwards trend can be described simply as a period of time over which the price has moved up. An upwards trend is also known as a bull trend, or a rally. A bear trend or downwards trend or sell-off (or crash) is where the market moves downwards. The definition is as simple as the analysis is varied and complex. The assumption is of serial correlation, i.e. once in a trend, the market is likely to continue in that direction. On any particular time frame, whether it's a yearly chart or a 1-minute chart, the price action trader will almost without exception first check to see whether the market is trending up or down or whether it's confined to a trading range. A trading range where the market turns around at the ceiling and the floor to stay within an explicit price band. A range is not so easily defined, but is in most cases what exists when there is no discernible trend. It is defined by its floor and its ceiling, which are always subject to debate. A range can also be referred to as a horizontal channel.  OHLC bar or candlestick  Brief explanation of bar and candlestick terminology: * Open: first price of a bar (which covers the period of time of the chosen time frame) * Close: the last price of the bar * High: the highest price * Low: the lowest price * Body: the part of the candlestick between the open and the close * Tail (upper or lower): the parts of the candlestick not between the open and the close  Range bar  A range bar is a bar with no body, i.e. the open and the close are at the same price and therefore there has been no net change over the time period. This is also known in Japanese Candlestick terminology as a Doji. Japanese Candlesticks show demand with more precision and only a Doji is a Doji, whereas a price action trader might consider a bar with a small body to be a range bar. It is termed 'range bar' because the price during the period of the bar moved between a floor (the low) and a ceiling (the high) and ended more or less where it began. If one expanded the time frame and looked at the price movement during that bar, it would appear as a range.  Trend bar  There are bull trend bars and bear trend bars - bars with bodies - where the market has actually ended the bar with a net change from the beginning of the bar. = Bull trend bar = In a bull trend bar, the price has trended from the open up to the close. To be pedantic, it is possible that the price moved up and down several times between the high and the low during the course of the bar, before finishing 'up' for the bar, in which case the assumption would be wrong, but this is a very seldom occurrence. = Bear trend bar = The bear trend bar is the opposite. Trend bars are often referred to for short as bull bars or bear bars. = With-trend bar = A trend bar with movement in the same direction as the chart's trend is known as 'with trend', i.e. a bull trend bar in a bull market is a \\"with trend bull\\" bar. In a downwards market, a bear trend bar is a \\"with trend bear\\" bar.Brooks 2009, chapter 1 = Countertrend bar = A trend bar in the opposite direction to the prevailing trend is a \\"countertrend\\" bull or bear bar. = BAB = There are also what are known as BAB - Breakaway Bars- which are bars that are more than two standard deviations larger than the average. = Climactic exhaustion bar = This is a with-trend BAB whose unusually large body signals that in a bull trend the last buyers have entered the market and therefore if there are now only sellers, the market will reverse. The opposite holds for a bear trend. = Shaved bar = A shaved bar is a trend bar that is all body and has no tails. A partially shaved bar has a shaved top (no upper tail) or a shaved bottom (no lower tail).  Inside bar  An \\"inside bar\\" is a bar which is smaller and within the high to low range of the prior bar, i.e. the high is lower than the previous bar's high, and the low is higher than the previous bar's low. Its relative position can be at the top, the middle or the bottom of the prior bar. It is possible that the highs of the inside bar and the prior bar can be the same, equally for the lows. If both the highs and the lows are the same, it is harder to define it as an inside bar, yet reasons exist why it might be interpreted so. This imprecision is typical when trying to describe the ever-fluctuating character of market prices.  Outside bar  An outside bar is larger than the prior bar and totally overlaps it. Its high is higher than the previous high, and its low is lower than the previous low. The same imprecision in its definition as for inside bars (above) is often seen in interpretations of this type of bar. An outside bar's interpretation is based on the concept that market participants were undecided or inactive on the prior bar but subsequently during the course of the outside bar demonstrated new commitment, driving the price up or down as seen. Again the explanation may seem simple but in combination with other price action, it builds up into a story that gives experienced traders an 'edge' (a better than even chance of correctly predicting market direction). The context in which they appear is all-important in their interpretation. If the outside bar's close is close to the centre, this makes it similar to a trading range bar, because neither the bulls nor the bears despite their aggression were able to dominate. The outside bar after the maximum price (marked with an arrow) is a failure to restart the trend and a signal for a sizable retrace. Primarily price action traders will avoid or ignore outside bars, especially in the middle of trading ranges in which position they are considered meaningless. When an outside bar appears in a retrace of a strong trend, rather than acting as a range bar, it does show strong trending tendencies. For instance, a bear outside bar in the retrace of a bull trend is a good signal that the retrace will continue further. This is explained by the way the outside bar forms, since it begins building in real time as a potential bull bar that is extending above the previous bar, which would encourage many traders to enter a bullish trade to profit from a continuation of the old bull trend. When the market reverses and the potential for a bull bar disappears, it leaves the bullish traders trapped in a bad trade. If the price action traders have other reasons to be bearish in addition to this action, they will be waiting for this situation and will take the opportunity to make money going short where the trapped bulls have their protective stops positioned. If the reversal in the outside bar was quick, then many bearish traders will be as surprised as the bulls and the result will provide extra impetus to the market as they all seek to sell after the outside bar has closed. The same sort of situation also holds true in reverse for retracements of bear trends.  Small bar  As with all price action formations, small bars must be viewed in context. A quiet trading period, e.g. on a US holiday, may have many small bars appearing but they will be meaningless, however small bars that build after a period of large bars are much more open to interpretation. In general, small bars are a display of the lack of enthusiasm from either side of the market. A small bar can also just represent a pause in buying or selling activity as either side waits to see if the opposing market forces come back into play. Alternatively small bars may represent a lack of conviction on the part of those driving the market in one direction, therefore signalling a reversal. As such, small bars can be interpreted to mean opposite things to opposing traders, but small bars are taken less as signals on their own, rather as a part of a larger setup involving any number of other price action observations. For instance in some situations a small bar can be interpreted as a pause, an opportunity to enter with the market direction, and in other situations a pause can be seen as a sign of weakness and so a clue that a reversal is likely. One instance where small bars are taken as signals is in a trend where they appear in a pull- back. They signal the end of the pull-back and hence an opportunity to enter a trade with the trend.  ii and iii patterns  An 'ii' is an inside pattern - 2 consecutive inside bars. An 'iii' is 3 in a row. Most often these are small bars. An iii formation - 3 consecutive inside bars. Price action traders who are unsure of market direction but sure of further movement - an opinion gleaned from other price action - would place an entry to buy above an ii or an iii and simultaneously an entry to sell below it, and would look for the market to break out of the price range of the pattern. Whichever order is executed, the other order then becomes the protective stop order that would get the trader out of the trade with a small loss if the market doesn't act as predicted. A typical setup using the ii pattern is outlined by Brooks. An ii after a sustained trend that has suffered a trend line break is likely to signal a strong reversal if the market breaks out against the trend. The small inside bars are attributed to the buying and the selling pressure equalling out. The entry stop order would be placed one tick on the countertrend side of the first bar of the ii and the protective stop would be placed one tick beyond the first bar on the opposite side.  Trend  Classically a trend is defined visually by plotting a trend line on the opposite side of the market from the trend's direction, or by a pair of trend channel lines - a trend line plus a parallel return line on the other side - on the chart. These sloping lines reflect the direction of the trend and connect the highest highs or the lowest lows of the trend. In its idealised form, a trend will consist of trending higher highs or lower lows and in a rally, the higher highs alternate with higher lows as the market moves up, and in a sell-off the sequence of lower highs (forming the trendline) alternating with lower lows forms as the market falls. A swing in a rally is a period of gain ending at a higher high (aka swing high), followed by a pull-back ending at a higher low (higher than the start of the swing). The opposite applies in sell-offs, each swing having a swing low at the lowest point. When the market breaks the trend line, the trend from the end of the last swing until the break is known as an 'intermediate trend line' or a 'leg'.Brooks 2009, chapter 3 A leg up in a trend is followed by a leg down, which completes a swing. Frequently price action traders will look for two or three swings in a standard trend. With- trend legs contain 'pushes', a large with-trend bar or series of large with- trend bars. A trend need not have any pushes but it is usual. A trend is established once the market has formed three or four consecutive legs, e.g. for a bull trend, higher highs and higher lows. The higher highs, higher lows, lower highs and lower lows can only be identified after the next bar has closed. Identifying it before the close of the bar risks that the market will act contrary to expectations, move beyond the price of the potential higher/lower bar and leave the trader aware only that the supposed turning point was an illusion. A more risk-seeking trader would view the trend as established even after only one swing high or swing low. At the start of what a trader is hoping is a bull trend, after the first higher low, a trend line can be drawn from the low at the start of the trend to the higher low and then extended. When the market moves across this trend line, it has generated a trend line break for the trader, who is given several considerations from this point on. If the market moved with a particular rhythm to-and-fro from the trend line with regularity, the trader will give the trend line added weight. Any significant trend line that sees a significant trend line break represents a shift in the balance of the market and is interpreted as the first sign that the countertrend traders are able to assert some control. If the trend line break fails and the trend resumes, then the bars causing the trend line break now form a new point on a new trend line, one that will have a lower gradient, indicating a slowdown in the rally / sell-off. The alternative scenario on resumption of the trend is that it picks up strength and requires a new trend line, in this instance with a steeper gradient, which is worth mentioning for sake of completeness and to note that it is not a situation that presents new opportunities, just higher rewards on existing ones for the with-trend trader. In the case that the trend line break actually appears to be the end of this trend, it's expected that the market will revisit this break-out level and the strength of the break will give the trader a good guess at the likelihood of the market turning around again when it returns to this level. If the trend line was broken by a strong move, it is considered likely that it killed the trend and the retrace to this level is a second opportunity to enter a countertrend position. However, in trending markets, trend line breaks fail more often than not and set up with-trend entries. The psychology of the average trader tends to inhibit with-trend entries because the trader must \\"buy high\\", which is counter to the clichee for profitable trading \\"buy high, sell low\\". The allure of counter-trend trading and the impulse of human nature to want to fade the market in a good trend is very discernible to the price action trader, who would seek to take advantage by entering on failures, or at least when trying to enter counter-trend, would wait for that second entry opportunity at confirmation of the break-out once the market revisits this point, fails to get back into the trend and heads counter-trend again. In- between trend line break-outs or swing highs and swing lows, price action traders watch for signs of strength in potential trends that are developing, which in the stock market index futures are with-trend gaps, discernible swings, large counter-trend bars (counter-intuitively), an absence of significant trend channel line overshoots, a lack of climax bars, few profitable counter-trend trades, small pull-backs, sideways corrections after trend line breaks, no consecutive sequence of closes on the wrong side of the moving average, shaved with-trend bars. In the stock market indices, large trend days tend to display few signs of emotional trading with an absence of large bars and overshoots and this is put down to the effect of large institutions putting considerable quantities of their orders onto algorithm programs. Many of the strongest trends start in the middle of the day after a reversal or a break-out from a trading range. The pull-backs are weak and offer little chance for price action traders to enter with-trend. Price action traders or in fact any traders can enter the market in what appears to be a run-away rally or sell-off, but price action trading involves waiting for an entry point with reduced risk - pull-backs, or better, pull-backs that turn into failed trend line break-outs. The risk is that the 'run-away' trend doesn't continue, but becomes a blow-off climactic reversal where the last traders to enter in desperation end up in losing positions on the market's reversal. As stated the market often only offers seemingly weak-looking entries during strong phases but price action traders will take these rather than make indiscriminate entries. Without practice and experience enough to recognise the weaker signals, traders will wait, even if it turns out that they miss a large move.  Trend Channel  A trend or price channel can be created by plotting a pair of trend channel lines on either side of the market - the first trend channel line is the trend line, plus a parallel return line on the other side. Edwards and Magee's return line is also known as the trend channel line (singular), confusingly, when only one is mentioned.Murphy 1999 chapter 4Brooks 2009, chapter 2 Trend channels are traded by waiting for break-out failures, i.e. banking on the trend channel continuing, in which case at that bar's close, the entry stop is placed one tick away towards the centre of the channel above/below the break-out bar. Trading with the break- out only has a good probability of profit when the break-out bar is above average size, and an entry is taken only on confirmation of the break-out. The confirmation would be given when a pull-back from the break-out is over without the pull-back having retraced to the return line, so invalidating the plotted channel lines.  Shaved bar entry  When a shaved bar appears in a strong trend, it demonstrates that the buying or the selling pressure was constant throughout with no let-up and it can be taken as a strong signal that the trend will continue. A Brooks-style entry using a stop order one tick above or below the bar will require swift action from the trader and any delay will result in slippage especially on short time-frames.  Microtrend line  If a trend line is plotted on the lower lows or the higher highs of a trend over a longer trend, a microtrend line is plotted when all or almost all of the highs or lows line up in a short multi-bar period. Just as break-outs from a normal trend are prone to fail as noted above, microtrend lines drawn on a chart are frequently broken by subsequent price action and these break-outs frequently fail too. Such a failure is traded by placing an entry stop order 1 tick above or below the previous bar, which would result in a with-trend position if hit, providing a low risk scalp with a target on the opposite side of the trend channel. Microtrend lines are often used on retraces in the main trend or pull-backs and provide an obvious signal point where the market can break through to signal the end of the microtrend. The bar that breaks out of a bearish microtrend line in a main bull trend for example is the signal bar and the entry buy stop order should be placed 1 tick above the bar. If the market works its way above that break-out bar, it is a good sign that the break-out of the microtrend line has not failed and that the main bull trend has resumed. Continuing this example, a more aggressive bullish trader would place a buy stop entry above the high of the current bar in the microtrend line and move it down to the high of each consecutive new bar, in the assumption that any microtrend line break-out will not fail.  Spike and channel  This is a type of trend characterised as difficult to identify and more difficult to trade by Brooks. The spike is the beginning of the trend where the market moves strongly in the direction of the new trend, often at the open of the day on an intraday chart, and then slows down forming a tight trend channel that moves slowly but surely in the same direction. After the trend channel is broken, it is common to see the market return to the level of the start of the channel and then to remain in a trading range between that level and the end of the channel. A \\"gap spike and channel\\" is the term for a spike and channel trend that begins with a gap in the chart (a vertical gap with between one bar's close and the next bar's open). The spike and channel is seen in stock charts and stock indices, and is rarely reported in forex markets.  Pull-back  A pull-back is a move where the market interrupts the prevailing trend,Edwards and Magee 1948, chapter 6 or retraces from a breakout, but does not retrace beyond the start of the trend or the beginning of the breakout. A pull-back which does carry on further to the beginning of the trend or the breakout would instead become a reversalBrooks 2009, chapter 4 or a breakout failure. In a long trend, a pull-back often last for long enough to form legs like a normal trend and to behave in other ways like a trend too. Like a normal trend, a long pull-back often has two legs. Price action traders expect the market to adhere to the two attempts rule and will be waiting for the market to try to make a second swing in the pull-back, with the hope that it fails and therefore turns around to try the opposite - i.e. the trend resumes. One price action technique for following a pull-back with the aim of entering with-trend at the end of the pull-back is to count the new higher highs in the pull-back of a bull trend, or the new lower lows in the pull-back of a bear, i.e. in a bull trend, the pull-back will be composed of bars where the highs are successively lower and lower until the pattern is broken by a bar that puts in a high higher than the previous bar's high, termed an H1 (High 1). L1s (Low 1) are the mirror image in bear trend pull- backs. If the H1 doesn't result in the end of the pull-back and a resumption of the bull trend, then the market creates a further sequence of bars going lower, with lower highs each time until another bar occurs with a high that's higher than the previous high. This is the H2. And so on until the trend resumes, or until the pull-back has become a reversal or trading range. H1s and L1s are considered reliable entry signals when the pull-back is a microtrend line break, and the H1 or L1 represents the break-out's failure. Otherwise if the market adheres to the two attempts rule, then the safest entry back into the trend will be the H2 or L2. The two-legged pull-back has formed and that is the most common pull-back, at least in the stock market indices. In a sideways market trading range, both highs and lows can be counted but this is reported to be an error-prone approach except for the most practiced traders. On the other hand, in a strong trend, the pull-backs are liable to be weak and consequently the count of Hs and Ls will be difficult. In a bull trend pull-back, two swings down may appear but the H1s and H2s cannot be identified. The price action trader looks instead for a bear trend bar to form in the trend, and when followed by a bar with a lower high but a bullish close, takes this as the first leg of a pull-back and is thus already looking for the appearance of the H2 signal bar. The fact that it is technically neither an H1 nor an H2 is ignored in the light of the trend strength. This price action reflects what is occurring in the shorter time- frame and is sub-optimal but pragmatic when entry signals into the strong trend are otherwise not appearing. The same in reverse applies in bear trends. Counting the Hs and Ls is straightforward price action trading of pull-backs, relying for further signs of strength or weakness from the occurrence of all or any price action signals, e.g. the action around the moving average, double tops or bottoms, ii or iii patterns, outside bars, reversal bars, microtrend line breaks, or at its simplest, the size of bull or bear trend bars in amongst the other action. The price action trader picks and chooses which signals to specialise in and how to combine them. The simple entry technique involves placing the entry order 1 tick above the H or 1 tick below the L and waiting for it to be executed as the next bar develops. If so, this is the entry bar, and the H or L was the signal bar, and the protective stop is placed 1 tick under an H or 1 tick above an L.  Breakout  A breakout is a bar in which the market moves beyond a predefined significant price - predefined by the price action trader, either physically or only mentally, according to their own price action methodology, e.g. if the trader believes a bull trend exists, then a line connecting the lowest lows of the bars on the chart during this trend would be the line that the trader watches, waiting to see if the market breaks out beyond it.Edwards and Magee 1948, chapter 14 The real plot or the mental line on the chart generally comes from one of the classic chart patterns. A breakout often leads to a setup and a resulting trade signal. The breakout is supposed to herald the end of the preceding chart pattern, e.g. a bull breakout in a bear trend could signal the end of the bear trend.  Breakout pull-back  After a breakout extends further in the breakout direction for a bar or two or three, the market will often retrace in the opposite direction in a pull-back, i.e. the market pulls back against the direction of the breakout. A viable breakout will not pull-back past the former point of Support or Resistance that was broken through.  Breakout failure  A breakout might not lead to the end of the preceding market behaviour, and what starts as a pull-back can develop into a breakout failure, i.e. the market could return into its old pattern. Brooks observes that a breakout is likely to fail on quiet range days on the very next bar, when the breakout bar is unusually big. \\"Five tick failed breakouts\\" are a phenomenon that is a great example of price action trading. Five tick failed breakouts are characteristic of the stock index futures markets. Many speculators trade for a profit of just four ticks, a trade which requires the market to move 6 ticks in the trader's direction for the entry and exit orders to be filled. These traders will place protective stop orders to exit on failure at the opposite end of the breakout bar. So if the market breaks out by five ticks and does not hit their profit targets, then the price action trader will see this as a five tick failed breakout and will enter in the opposite direction at the opposite end of the breakout bar to take advantage of the stop orders from the losing traders' exit orders.Brooks 2009, chapter 9  Failed breakout failure  In the particular situation where a price action trader has observed a breakout, watched it fail and then decided to trade in the hope of profiting from the failure, there is the danger for the trader that the market will turn again and carry on in the direction of the breakout, leading to losses for the trader. This is known as a failed failure and is traded by taking the loss and reversing the position. It is not just breakouts where failures fail, other failed setups can at the last moment come good and be 'failed failures'.  Reversal bar  A bear trend reverses at a bull reversal bar. A reversal bar signals a reversal of the current trend. On seeing a signal bar, a trader would take it as a sign that the market direction is about to turn. An ideal bullish reversal bar should close considerably above its open, with a relatively large lower tail (30% to 50% of the bar height) and a small or absent upper tail, and having only average or below average overlap with the prior bar, and having a lower low than the prior bars in the trend. A bearish reversal bar would be the opposite. Reversals are considered to be stronger signals if their extreme point is even further up or down than the current trend would have achieved if it continued as before, e.g. a bullish reversal would have a low that is below the approximate line formed by the lows of the preceding bear trend. This is an 'overshoot'. See the section #Trend channel line overshoot. Reversal bars as a signal are also considered to be stronger when they occur at the same price level as previous trend reversals. The price action interpretation of a bull reversal bar is so: it indicates that the selling pressure in the market has passed its climax and that now the buyers have come into the market strongly and taken over, dictating price which rises up steeply from the low as the sudden relative paucity of sellers causes the buyers' bids to spring upwards. This movement is exacerbated by the short term traders / scalpers who sold at the bottom and now have to buy back if they want to cover their losses.  Trend line break  When a market has been trending significantly, a trader can usually draw a trend line on the opposite side of the market where the retraces reach, and any retrace back across the existing trend line is a 'trend line break' and is a sign of weakness, a clue that the market might soon reverse its trend or at least halt the trend's progress for a period.  Trend channel line overshoot  A trend channel line overshoot refers to the price shooting clear out of the observable trend channel further in the direction of the trend.Brooks 2009, chapter 8 An overshoot does not have to be a reversal bar, since it can occur during a with-trend bar. On occasion it may not result in a reversal at all, it will just force the price action trader to adjust the trend channel definition. In the stock indices, the common retrace of the market after a trend channel line overshoot is put down to profit taking and traders reversing their positions. More traders will wait for some reversal price action. The extra surge that causes an overshoot is the action of the last traders panicking to enter the trend along with increased activity from institutional players who are driving the market and want to see an overshoot as a clear signal that all the previously non-participating players have been dragged in. This is identified by the overshoot bar being a climactic exhaustion bar on high volume. It leaves nobody left to carry on the trend and sets up the price action for a reversal.  Climactic exhaustion reversal  A strong trend characterised by multiple with-trend bars and almost continuous higher highs or lower lows over a double-digit number of bars is often ended abruptly by a climactic exhaustion bar. It is likely that a two-legged retrace occurs after this, extending for the same length of time or more as the final leg of the climactic rally or sell-off.  Double top and double bottom  When the market reaches an extreme price in the trader's view, it often pulls back from the price only to return to that price level again. In the situation where that price level holds and the market retreats again, the two reversals at that level are known as a double top bear flag or a double bottom bull flag, or simply double top / double bottom and indicate that the retrace will continue.Edwards and Magee 1948, chapter 33 Brooks also reports that a pull-back is common after a double top or bottom, returning 50% to 95% back to the level of the double top / bottom. This is similar to the classic head and shoulders pattern. A price action trader will trade this pattern, e.g. a double bottom, by placing a buy stop order 1 tick above the bar that created the second 'bottom'. If the order is filled, then the trader sets a protective stop order 1 tick below the same bar.  Double top twin and double bottom twin  Consecutive bars with relatively large bodies, small tails and the same high price formed at the highest point of a chart are interpreted as double top twins. The opposite is so for double bottom twins. These patterns appear on as shorter time scale as a double top or a double bottom. Since signals on shorter time scales are per se quicker and therefore on average weaker, price action traders will take a position against the signal when it is seen to fail. In other words, double top twins and double bottom twins are with-trend signals, when the underlying short time frame double tops or double bottoms (reversal signals) fail. The price action trader predicts that other traders trading on the shorter time scale will trade the simple double top or double bottom, and if the market moves against them, the price action trader will take a position against them, placing an entry stop order 1 tick above the top or below the bottom, with the aim of benefitting from the exacerbated market movement caused by those trapped traders bailing out.  Opposite twin (down-up or up-down twin)  An Up-Down Pattern. This is two consecutive trend bars in opposite directions with similar sized bodies and similar sized tails. It is a reversal signal when it appears in a trend. It is equivalent to a single reversal bar if viewed on a time scale twice as long. For the strongest signal, the bars would be shaved at the point of reversal, e.g. a down-up in a bear trend with two trend bars with shaved bottoms would be considered stronger than bars with tails.  Wedge  A wedge pattern is like a trend, but the trend channel lines that the trader plots are converging and predict a breakout.Edwards and Magee 1948, chapter 10 A wedge pattern after a trend is commonly considered to be a good reversal signal.  Trading range  Once a trader has identified a trading range, i.e. the lack of a trend and a ceiling to the market's upward movement and a floor to any downward move,Schwager 1996 chapter 4 then the trader will use the ceiling and floor levels as barriers that the market can break through, with the expectation that the break-outs will fail and the market will reverse. One break-out above the previous highest high or ceiling of a trading range is termed a higher high. Since trading ranges are difficult to trade, the price action trader will often wait after seeing the first higher high and on the appearance of a second break-out followed by its failure, this will be taken as a high probability bearish trade, with the middle of the range as the profit target. This is favoured firstly because the middle of the trading range will tend to act as a magnet for price action, secondly because the higher high is a few points higher and therefore offers a few points more profit if successful, and thirdly due to the supposition that two consecutive failures of the market to head in one direction will result in a tradable move in the opposite.  Chop aka churn and barb wire  When the market is restricted within a tight trading range and the bar size as a percentage of the trading range is large, price action signals may still appear with the same frequency as under normal market conditions but their reliability or predictive powers are severely diminished. Brooks identifies one particular pattern that betrays chop, called \\"barb wire\\".Brooks 2009, chapter 5 It consists of a series of bars that overlap heavily containing trading range bars. Barb wire and other forms of chop demonstrate that neither the buyers nor the sellers are in control or able to exert greater pressure. A price action trader that wants to generate profit in choppy conditions would use a range trading strategy. Trades are executed at the support or resistance lines of the range while profit targets are set before price is set to hit the opposite side. Especially after the appearance of barb wire, breakout bars are expected to fail and traders will place entry orders just above or below the opposite end of the breakout bar from the direction in which it broke out.

The college has one of the oldest special education programs in the United States. History Eastern Michigan University College of Education was one of the first colleges established at the newly named Eastern Michigan University. Even though the college was established in 1959, Eastern Michigan University has had a long history of training future educators since its inception in 1849. Eastern Michigan University was originally established as Michigan State Normal School. Michigan State Normal School was the first in Michigan and the first normal school created outside the original 13 colonies. A normal school was a school created to train high school graduates to be teachers. Its purpose was to establish teaching standards or norms, hence its name. The normal schools were to train teachers for common schools, which were being established rapidly in new towns in the state of Michigan. In 1849, when Michigan State Normal School was established, Michigan had only been a state for 12 years. In 1899, the school became the Michigan State Normal College when it created the first four-year curriculum for a normal college in the nation. Normal began the 20th century as Michigan's premier teacher-preparatory school and became the first teacher-training school in the United States to have a four-year degree program. In 1915, the school was the first program in the nation to train teachers to serve the disabled. In 1923 the Eastern Michigan University's Department of Special Education was established making it one of the oldest in the nation. In 1959, the College of Education was established. At the same time, Eastern became a university gaining the title Eastern Michigan University. The Porter College of Education is named after John W. Porter, former EMU President from 1979 to 1988. Facility Porter Hall The Porter College of Education building was built in 1967. The facility was originally built to serve as the university's library. As the university grew in size, a new library was needed. In 1998, Halle Library was built moving the library to its new location. The Porter College of Education then occupied the University Library's old location. The facility is 133,500 square feet. During the renovations in 1998 and 1999, the building was updated to provide state- of-the-art computer networks and an up-to-date multimedia systems. Departments The College of Education is divided into 3 departments: Leadership and Counseling, Special Education, and Teacher Education and offers over 85 majors and minors and over 30 graduate degrees. =Programs= The college itself has only been established since 1959 but the school has always been known for its education programs. The special needs program is one of the school's oldest. In 2008, with a joint program with the College of Health and Human Services, the COE began to offer a Ph.D. in Nursing education. The university declares the program as \\"the first of its kind in the midwest\\". The program is aimed to prepare nursing faculty to assist in the nursing shortage. Education Eastern declares that one of every four teachers in Michigan holds a degree from EMU. In the past the school also declared that at one time 1% of all the teachers in the United States received their degree from EMU. According to U.S. News the program is ranked #140 in the United States and #4 in the state of Michigan. Special Education In 1915, the school was one of the first in the nation to train teachers to serve people with disabilities. Today Eastern Michigan University's Department of Special Education is among the oldest and largest special education program in the United States.

In the 17th century the abbey transferred to the Catholic Church; it was immediately secularized and transformed into a secular community of canons following the Armenian Rite instead of the Byzantine Rite, reflecting a reorientation towards western Catholic practice rather than the Eastern Orthodox practice. The property of the abbey comprised several villages in territory that was proclaimed a sovereign principality of the Church in 1918 at the end of World War I, but in 1921 it was annexed by the Polish Republic. The first and only sovereign was Prince Abbot Heinrich Adam de Sozanski. In 1945 the Red Army exiled him and he sought asylum in Hungary. Currently the canon community continues in exile.

It disappeared with six passengers and nine crew en route from Guam to Manila, on July 28, 1938. Trans-Pacific service Pan American initiated trans-Pacific airmail service on 22 November 1935, and began carrying passengers in October 1936. The flying boat service between San Francisco Bay and Manila Bay required about 60 hours of flying time over six days, with intermediate stops at Pearl Harbor, Midway Atoll, Wake Island, and Guam. Disappearance Hawaii Clipper departed Guam on the last leg of the westbound journey at 11:39 local time on 28 July 1938. The last radio contact was 3 hours 27 minutes later, when the aircraft reported flying through layers of clouds and moderately rough air 565 miles from the Philippine coast. The US Army transport ship found an oil slick along the course of the lost aircraft about 500 miles from Manila, took samples, and stood by to investigate. Search for the plane was called off on August 5, 1938. Later tests on the oil samples collected by Meigs indicated no connection with the aircraft. Modern reviews of the events and oil sampling techniques have led some to conclude the test of oil from the tropical Pacific compared to samples from San Francisco were not conclusive in ruling out a link with a slick found close to the last estimated position allowing for ocean currents. Hawaii Clipper was the first of the initial three long-range flying boats to be lost. It was the worst Pacific airline accident at the time, although fatalities were higher when the other two Martin M-130 flying boats crashed later. The Philippine Clipper crash of 1943 killed 19, and 23 were killed when China Clipper crashed in 1945.Aviation Safety Network October 23, 2006, URL retrieved on 9 June 2011 Some believe that the Hawaii Clipper was hijacked by the Japanese military and taken to Truk Lagoon in the Federated States of Micronesia where the passengers and crew were executed, after which the Clipper was taken to Japan to be reverse engineered. A group of investigators, including former Naval Intelligence officers, have traveled to Truk in search of evidence.

Personal life Robert James Chapman was born in London, Ontario, Canada on February 10, 1949, a fifth-generation Canadian. Even as a young child he was fascinated by music and writing, both of which became lifelong passions. He attended local schools but dropped out in 1966 to pursue dreams of rock and roll stardom. Columbia records Jim played with several local bands from 1963 to 1966, before helping form The Bluesmen Revue, originally Sally and the Bluesmen. They quickly became the top-grossing and most popular band in Southern Ontario, touring throughout the area and into the U.S.The London Free Press April 26, 1966. Tom Rath \\"Dance Routines 'Something To Watch' When Sally and the Bluesmen Perform\\" Page 4-A At various times the band included Jim Chapman, Kenn Allison, Paul Kersey, Dave Baker, Rick Wadds, later known as Rick Alexander, Charlie Mitchell and Dave Partridge. In 1967 the Bluesmen Revue signed a recording contract with Columbia Records in the U.S. that saw the release of \\"Spin the Bottle\\", a local hit. They toured the U.S. east coast as far south as Florida for several months, including a two-week engagement at the legendary Trude Heller's in New York City, which also featured such acts as Joey Dee and the Starlighters, Otis Redding and Ben E. King. A falling out with their U.S. management company and dissatisfaction with the label's plans for them spelled the end of their Columbia contract, and, dispirited by their failure to crack the big time, the band split up in early 1969. Working musician After a year-long hiatus from music, Jim joined popular Canadian showband Leather and Lace for several months, leaving shortly before they changed their name to Ocean and had an international hit with Put Your Hand in the Hand. He then formed his own band, Bad Axe, with John Hotson, George Attrill, James Drynan and Bert Hamer.Scene October 7‚Äì20, 1999.

Jeffrey Reed \\"The Only Talk in Town\\" Pg. 10 When Hawkins left for an extended party tour of Europe with Kris Kristofferson, the band split up and Jim moved on to managing bands and artists. Supervision/Springfield Sound With partners Sandy Wilson and Brian Ferriman, Jim formed the successful musicians' management company, \\"Supervision\\". Among their clients were Garwood \\"Twitch\\" Wallace, Homespun, North, Busker, Rick McGhie, and Easy, all of whom enjoyed success as touring acts. With support from financier Lou Saddy and recording engineer Bob Leth, and hospitality on site studio manager, Beverley Barnett Leth (now Graham) they opened Springfield Sound in a former country schoolhouse near Aylmer, Ontario. Beverley found the location from an ad in the newspaper. A lowball offer of $10,000. for the schoolhouse on an acre of land was accepted and renovations began. It became the first state-of-the-art 24-track studio west of Toronto.London Free Press May 21, 1977. Pat Moauro \\"London Company Believes Things Go Better with a Jingle\\" It was at Springfield Sound that folk legend Stan Rogers recorded his iconic Fogarty's Cove and Turnaround albums. Todd Rundgren, John Allan Cameron, Helix, Jethro Tull, Crowbar, Matt Minglewood, Bernard Purdie, and Budgie were among many other notable acts that recorded there. It was also where Jim recorded his first album of \\"soft-rock/country\\" tunes, including \\"Reach out to the Children\\", a ballad that got extensive local radio airplay. Chapman, Hotson, Ferriman and Wilson soon formed \\"The Jingle People\\", which became the top jingle production company in the area, with dozens of their creations being heard on radio and TV over several years. Jim Chapman also rejoined the active music world as the bassist for Homespun, a popular act that toured across Ontario and had been tapped for a contract with A&M; Records when they broke up over \\"artistic differences\\" in 1976. He left Supervision shortly thereafter. Springfield Sound suffered the effects of a poor economy and was voluntarily liquidated in the early 1980s. Advertising agency In 1977 Chapman opened \\"Jim Chapman Associates\\", a full-service advertising and promotions company based in London but servicing clients across Ontario with its own art department and recording studio. Some notable clients included Kraft General Foods, Ontario Hydro, ParticipACTION, and the Ontario Home and School Association. The company created memorable musical themes for dozens of clients, including the London Tigers, a Detroit Tigers farm team, where Jim's theme song \\"Tear 'Em Up Tigers\\" became an anthem for the organization on its way to an Eastern League championship in 1989, in addition to getting significant local airplay and selling thousands of copies. Jim took over the duties of Marketing and Promotions Manager for the team in the early 1990s. The Morning Show Musical Maestro In 1988 Chapman was contracted to write novelty songs for Peter Garland's top-rated morning show on CFPL 980 Radio, reaching an audience across southern Ontario. As \\"The Morning Show Musical Maestro\\" from 1988 until the spring of 1991, Jim was the only staff songwriter at any Canadian radio station. He turned out dozens of humorous and satirical songs, also producing two albums of his tunes that raised thousands of dollars for charity. One of his songs, \\"Stand Up for Canada, Eh!\\" was recorded by the True Grit Band that included Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien and future City of London Mayor Joe Fontana was used as the theme for a campaign to promote Canadian unity. Politics Jim ran for public office three times, twice for London City Council in 1991 and 1994, and once for the provincial Legislature in 2007. Though he made a respectable showing, he was unsuccessful each time. Media personality In 1992 Chapman was offered a job as a talk show host at CJBK 1290 Radio.

After a 6-month break from radio in 2004, Jim returned to the airwaves at CHRW-FM 94.9 and did a daily news commentary show there. After a serious illness in 2005 Chapman was inspired to write another book, Come Back to Life. It related the story of his 1999 NDE and how the intervening years had been affected by it. He also wrote about his lifelong struggles with depression, a petrifying fear of death, and how his NDE had finally allowed him to put his life into perspective. As a very public figure willing to write and talk about very private things, Jim has been a role model for many other people who have suffered from depression, fear of dying and fear of being ridiculed if they shared their own NDE's. Over the years many, many people have written to thank him for his books and his positive example.Letters from Anthony Wilson-Smith (Editor of Maclean's Magazine) and others, available upon request Retirement Leaving CJBK in 2004, Jim took several months off to rest.

Roy MacGregor \\"At the doorstep, some voters rely on a method to sort out the political actors\\" Despite leading in the polls for a portion of the election, he ended up second to the incumbent. Jim decided to retire, planning to read, write, golf and work on his collection of classic cars. But he found an unstructured life unsatisfactory and soon revived his long-dormant communications consultancy, quickly recruiting several major clients. In 2008 he was invited to go back on the radio as the host of the daily Jim Chapman NewsHour on CFPL, his old home, and began writing again for The London Free Press and Business London Magazine. In 2009 he authored his third book, Mind How You Go, based on a collection of inspirational sayings submitted by his radio listeners. Recent projects In late 2009 Jim solicited a small group of politically minded investors and in 2010 launched The Voice of London,The Voice of London the city's first electronic political newsmagazine, and an almost-instant success. Aiming to inform voters about the upcoming civic election, it ceased operations after election day in October 2010. The following year he left radio again to devote more time to his family, consulting business, writing, and collection of rare automobiles. He has now published two novels, \\"I Am The Law\\" and \\"Sky Com:The Immortals\\", and is working on another, \\"His Will Be Done\\", to be released in early 2013.

Of note for the engines were a roaring lion on the smokebox door, a handwheel for a damper, diamond chimney stack and round spoked wheels. Waterloo Manufacturing of Ontario is occasionally confused with the Waterloo Gasoline Engine Company, of Waterloo, Iowa, U.S., which was purchased by John Deere for its popular Waterloo Boy Tractor.

North, and S.R.F. Price, Religions of Rome: A History (Cambridge University Press, 1998), vol. 1, p. 238. The English word \\"calumny\\" derives from the Latin. The Roman legal system lacked state prosecutors; crimes were prosecuted by any individual with sufficient legal training who chose to make the case. Prosecutions were often politically motivated, but a prosecutor who brought an accusation wrongfully could be sued under the Lex Remmia de calumnia if the accused was absolved of the crime. In this sense, calumnia resembled a charge of defamation or libel.Cicero, Rosc. Am. 19.55; Richard A. Lafleur, \\"Horace and onomasti komodein: The Law of Satire,\\" Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt II.31.3 (1981), p. 1822; H. Galsterer, \\"The Administration of Justice,\\" in The Cambridge Ancient History: The Augustan Empire, 43 B.C.‚ÄìA.D. 69 (Cambridge University Press, 1996), p. 402. The person found guilty of calumnia was subject to the same punishment the person he falsely accused would have received.George Mousourakis, The Historical and Institutional Context of Roman Law (Ashgate, 2003), p. 317; Beard et al., Religions of Rome, p. 238. One particularly well-documented trial that resulted in calumnia was that of M. Aemilius Scaurus, the praetor of 56 BC, who spoke in his own defense. Cicero was among his team of six advocates. Scaurus was charged under the Lex Iulia de repetundis for alleged misconduct during his governorship of Sardinia in 55 BC. A lengthy list of character witnesses is preserved. He was acquitted, with only four of twenty-two senators voting to convict, two of twenty-three equites, and two of twenty-five tribuni aerarii (\\"tribunes of the treasury\\"). Ten of these jurors voted that two of the prosecutors, Marcus Pacuvius ClaudiusThe cognomen is uncertain, and may be Caldus. and his brother Quintus, had committed calumnia, and three voted that a third prosecutor, Lucius Marius,A quaestor in 50 BC. had also done so.Michael C. Alexander, Trials in the Late Roman Republic, 149 BC to 50 BC (University of Toronto Press, 1990), pp. 143‚Äì144. Although the presiding praetor allowed charges of calumnia to proceed, all three were acquitted, even though the jury seems to have been the same.T. Corey Brennan, The Praetorship in the Roman Republic (Oxford University Press, 2000), p. 497. Another case involving calumnia is mentioned by Cicero in his first speech against Verres.Cicero, In Verrem 1.6. During the time of Sulla, Afrania,The name is vexed; it may also be Carfrania. a senator's wife, appeared so often before the praetor that muliebris calumnia (\\"woman's calumny\\") became regarded as pernicious to the legal system. An edict was consequently enacted that prohibited women from bringing claims on behalf of others, though they continued to be active in the courts in other ways.Richard A. Bauman, Women and Politics in Ancient Rome (Routledge, 1992, 1994), pp. 50‚Äì51. See also Women and the law in ancient Rome.

The other two sites are the A-site (aminoacyl), which is the first binding site in the ribosome, and the E-site (exit), the third. During protein translation, the P-site holds the tRNA which is linked to the growing polypeptide chain. When a stop codon is reached, the peptidyl-tRNA bond of the tRNA located in the P-site is cleaved releasing the newly synthesized protein. During the translocation step of the elongation phase, the mRNA is advanced by one codon, coupled to movement of the tRNAs from the ribosomal A to P and P to E sites, catalyzed by elongation factor EF-G. Overview The ribosomal P-site plays a vital role in all phases of translation. Initiation involves recognition of the start codon (AUG) by initiator tRNA in the P-site, elongation involves passage of many elongator tRNAs through the P site, termination involves hydrolysis of the mature polypeptide from tRNA bound to the P-site, and ribosome recycling involves release of deacylated tRNA. Binding a tRNA to the P-site in the presence of mRNA establishes codon- anticodon interaction, and this interaction is important for small subunit ribosome (30S) contacts to the tRNA. The classical two-state model proposes that the ribosome contains two binding sites for tRNA, P-site and A-site. The A-site binds to incoming aminoacyl-tRNA which has the anti-codon for the corresponding codon in the mRNA presented in the A-site. After peptide formation between the C-terminal carbonyl group of the growing polypeptide chain (attached to a P-site bound tRNA) and the amino group of the aminoacyl- tRNA (A-site bound), the polypeptide chain is then attached to the tRNA in the A-site. The deacylated tRNA remains in the P-site and is released once the peptidyl-tRNA is transferred to the P-site. Chemical modification experiments provided evidence of a hybrid model, in which tRNAs can sample a hybrid state of binding during the elongation phase (pre-translocation step). In these hybrid states of binding, acceptor and anti-codon ends of tRNA are in different sites (A, P and E). Using chemical probing methods, a set of phylogenetically-conserved bases in ribosomal RNA where the tRNA binds has been examined, and is suggested to be directly involved in the binding of tRNA to the prokaryotic ribosome. Correlation of such site-specific protected bases in rRNA and occupancy of the A, P and E sites has allowed diagnostic assays of these bases to study the location of tRNA in any given state of the translational cycle. Authors proposed a hybrid model in which higher affinity of the deactivated tRNA and peptide tRNA for the E and P sites of the 50S subunit, thermodynamically favours P/P to P/E and A/A to A/P transitions, which were further demonstrated through cryo-EM experiments. Also, single molecule FRET studies have detected fluctuations in the positions of tRNAs, leading to the conclusion that the classical (A/A-P/P) and hybrid states (A/P-P/E) of the tRNAs are certainly in dynamic equilibrium. Prior to peptide bond formation, an aminoacyl-tRNA is bound in the A-site, a peptidyl-tRNA is bound in the P-site, and a deacylated tRNA (ready to exit from the ribosome) is bound to the E-site. Translation moves the tRNA from the A-site through the P- and E-sites, with the exception of the initiator tRNA, which binds directly to the P-site. Recent experiments have reported that protein translation can also initiate from the A-site. Using toeprinting assay, it has been shown that protein synthesis initiates from the A-site of the ribosome (eukaryotic) in the cricket paralysis virus (CrPV). IGR-IRES (intragenic regions-internal ribosome entry sites) can assemble 80S ribosomes from 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits in the absence of eIF2, Met-tRNAi, or GTP hydrolysis and without a coding triplet in the ribosomal P-site. Authors also showed IGR-IRES can direct translation of a protein whose N-terminal residue is not methionine. Structure The complete three-dimensional structure of the T. thermophilus 70S ribosome was determined using X-ray crystallography, containing mRNA and tRNAs bound to the P and E sites at 5.5 √Ö resolution and to the A site at 7 √Ö resolution. Authors found that all three tRNA binding sites (A, P, and E) of the ribosome contact all three respective tRNAs at universally conserved parts of their structures. This allows the ribosome to bind different tRNA species in precisely the same way. The translocation step of protein synthesis requires movements of 20 √Ö or more by the tRNAs, as they move from the A to P to E sites tRNA-targeting antibiotics Oxazolidines (e.g. linezolid) prevent the binding of the initiator tRNA at the P-site. Oxazolidines have been demonstrated to pleiotropically affect initiator-tRNA binding, EF-P (elongation factor P)-stimulated synthesis of peptide bonds, and EF-G-mediated translocation of initiator-tRNA into the P-site. Macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin classes of antibiotics prevent peptide bond formation and/or the translocation of tRNA from the A-site to the P-site on the ribosome that eventually leads to interference with the elongation step and thus the inhibition of protein translation.

(Issue #122 was called Fightin' Marines Presents War, which was a tryout issue for the new Charlton title War, which ran from July 1975 ‚Äì October 1984.) From issue #131 (September 1976) onward, the cover of each issue featured a head shot of a Marine in dress uniform in the upper left hand corner, next to the title. Like much of the Charlton line, Fightin' Marines went on a publishing hiatus between November 1976 and October 1977 (issues #132 and 133). From issue #136 (April 1978) onward, Fightin' Marines was primarily a reprint title, mostly using material from earlier issues. The series ran through issue #176; Charlton published a total of 163 issues.

Keith Booker, ABC-CLIO, 2010, Pg. 106 The bulk of the stories in Fightin' Marines take place during World War II and the Korean War, but as the series moved along, more were set during the Vietnam War, the better to show the menace of Communism. = Shotgun Harker and Chicken = The ongoing Vietnam War feature Shotgun Harker and Chicken ran in Fightin' Marines issues #78‚Äì108, from January 1968 ‚Äì January 1973. Created by writer Joe Gill and artists Bill Montes and Ernie Bache, the series starred Sgt. Arkie \\"Shotgun\\" Harker and PFC \\"Chicken\\" Smith of Alpha Company. Harker is the gung-ho, hard-bitten Marine, while the bespectacled, blond-haired Chicken is more reserved ‚Äî though not actually a coward. Perhaps reflecting 1960s counterculture and the antiwar movement, Chicken was occasionally portrayed with flowers on his helmet. Shotgun Harker and Chicken stories were reprinted in Fightin' Army issues #140, 141, 146, 148, 156, 163, 167, 168, 172, 173, and 175 (as well as the Charlton titles War #45 and Battlefield Action #69 and #81).

History Jews in Montgomery first established Chevra Mevacher Cholim, a society to minister to the sick and bury the dead in 1846. A congregation, named Kahl Montgomery, was formed on May 6, 1849, first meeting in the homes of members, and later renting space on Dexter Avenue. The congregation drafted an official charter in 1852. In 1858, philanthropist Judah Touro left $2,000 to the congregation to purchase land for a temple. The temple was completed on March 8, 1862, at the corner of Church and Catoma Streets, and is still standing today serving as the Catoma Street Church of Christ. By 1870, the congregation had grown considerably, and ritual changes continued to occur. In 1874, the congregation adopted a Reform ritual and modeled it after Temple Emanu El of New York City, and was renamed Temple Beth Or. From 1876 to 1888, Hungarian-born Sigmund Hecht served as the rabbi.Encyclopedia of Southern Jewish Communities - Montgomery, Alabama, Goldring / Woldenberg Institute of Southern Jewish Life He also helped to establish a Sunday school. In 1902, some more recent Ashkenazi immigrants split off to form Agudath Israel Etz Ahayem. On June 6, 1902 a new temple at the corner of Sayre and Clayton Streets was dedicated. In 1933 Rabbi Eugene Blachschleger assumed the position of Rabbi. By the 1960s, the congregation had outgrown their temple once more. They decided to build a new Beth Or in the Cloverdale neighborhood. In 1961 the current house of worship was dedicated. In 1965 Rabbi David A. Baylinson was elected by the congregation after the untimely death of Rabbi Blachschleger. During Rabbi Baylinson's nearly 30 years with the congregation, Bar and Bat Mitzvah ceremonies were re- instituted and the prayer books Gates of Prayer and Gates of Repentance were introduced. In 1988, the entrance to the sanctuary, the religion school wing, grounds, and social hall were all renovated. Rabbi Baylinson retired in 1994 and was given the title of Rabbi Emeritus. Rabbi Elliot L. Stevens, held the post from July 2007, until his death in 2017. Rabbi Scott Looper became the current rabbi in July, 2018.

Biography His parents were Frederick David Schaeffer and Rosina Rosenmiller. His father was a Lutheran clergyman, as were his brothers David Frederick, Frederick Christian, and Frederick Solomon, and his nephew Charles William. He was educated in the University of Pennsylvania, and studied theology under the direction of his father and Charles Rudolph Demme. He was ordained in 1829, and became pastor at Carlisle, Pennsylvania, where he remained until 1834. In the latter year he moved to Hagerstown, Maryland, where he had charge of several Lutheran congregations until 1839. He was professor of theology in Capitol University, Columbus, Ohio 1840-43. He was culturally ill-suited for this position, and, after difficulties with a colleague, students and other ministers and pastor, he responded to a demand that he resign. He was then pastor at Lancaster, Ohio 1843-45, at Red Hook, New York 1845-51, and at Easton, Pennsylvania 1851-55. In 1855, he became professor of the German language and literature in the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. There his conservatism was a challenge to liberal colleagues like Samuel Simon Schmucker and middle-of-the-roaders like Charles Philip Krauth. The uneasy equilibrium ruptured in 1864, and Schaeffer left to become professor of systematic theology of a newly established theological seminary at Philadelphia, and its president. As representative of the strictly conservative and confessional party in the Lutheran Church, Schaeffer defended his position with great force in many publications, and was a leader in the organization of the general council in 1867. Works He published a large number of historical, homiletical, and doctrinal articles, and left several manuscripts of value, including a complete System of Lutheran Theology. Among his works are: *J. F. Kurtz, Manual of Sacred History, translated from the German (Philadelphia, 1855) *Martin Luther, Small Catechism, a revised translation (1856) *Inaugural Address at Gettysburg (New York, 1856) *Johann Arndt, True Christianity, translated from the German (1868) Family He married Susanna Schmucker in 1832, daughter of John George Schmucker.

It was first performed as a play in Leipzig in 1912 and appeared in 1915 as a storybook for children with illustrations by Hans Baluschek. A 2007 English translation names the book Peter and Anneli's Journey to the Moon. It is the story of Little Peter and his sister Anneli, who help a May beetle named Mr. Zoomzeman (German: Herr Summsemann) to retrieve his missing sixth leg from the Moon. After a fantastic and dangerous overnight adventure they recover the leg and are returned to their beds at home.  Plot  A thief, stealing wood in the forest, had cut off Mr. Zoomzeman‚Äôs great-great grandfather's sixth leg many years before. The Night Fairy banished the thief to the Moon as punishment, but he took the leg with him, causing later generations of the Zoomzeman family to only have five legs. The current Mr. Zoomzeman can break the curse and recover his missing leg if he finds two children who are pure of heart and have never been cruel to animals. He enters the house of Little Peter and his younger sister Anneli (Anneliese) and tells them the story. They promise to help him retrieve the lost leg. Mr. Zoomzeman teaches them a magical chant that allows them to fly and they set off for the Moon. On the Moon they meet the Sandman, who looks after the star children, each corresponding to a child on Earth. As their own stars are untarnished and shine brightly it proves Peter and Anneli are pure of heart. The Sandman is impressed and offers to take the three heroes to the Night Fairy's tea party at her castle. They travel in Sandman's celestial chariot, along the Milky Way, where the children learn about cosmic phenomena. Meanwhile, the Night Fairy has invited many celestial guests to her midnight party. These include the thunder man (Donnermann), the wind bride (Windliesel), the cloud woman (Wolkenfrau), the lightning witch (Blitzhexe), Rainy Fritz (Regenfritz), the gale giant (Sturmriese), Hail Hans (Hagelhans), Mother Hulda (Frau Holle), Ice Max (Eismax), the vodyanoy (Wassermann), Mary- of-the-dew (Taumariechen), morning glory (Morgenr√∂te), the afterglow (Abendr√∂te), the morning star (Morgenstern) and the evening star (Abendstern) and the Queen of the Day (die Sonne). The Guardian of the Milky Way appears and complains about the chaos caused by the guests travelling to the meeting. The guests apologize and offer the guardian gifts. Sandman and the adventurers arrive, surprising the guests as he is never usually late and by bringing humans. Mr. Zoomzeman's sad story prompts the celestial spirits to offer help. The Night Fairy asks the Guardian of the Milky Way to summon the Great Bear. Peter, Anneli and Mr. Zoomzeman are carried by the bear to the Moon cannon, via a meadow where gifts and sweets are grown for Christmas and past the nest where a hen lays colourful Easter eggs. The cannon fires the adventurers up onto a hill where the lost sixth leg is nailed to a sacred birch tree. At the tree the heroes are confronted by the Man in the Moon, a cruel, violent cannibal. In the fight to prevent the children from being eaten the celestial spirits attack the Man in the Moon and Peter battles with his wooden toy sword. Anneli summons her and Peter's stars, who blind the Man in the Moon. The evil giant cannot see and gets lost in the deep moon woods. Little Peter retrieves the sixth leg and Anneli attaches it to the unconscious beetle. Mr. Zoomzeman wakes and is delighted, but they must return to Earth immediately to avoid being stuck on the Moon forever. He uses an old charm which creates a hole. The children jump into the hole and fall back into their bedroom on Earth. Dawn breaks and the children open the window to let Mr. Zoomzeman fly away. Their mother enters the bedroom bringing a gift of gingerbread from Father Christmas.

Biography His parents were Frederick Solomon Schaeffer (1790-1815) and Catherine Elizabeth Schaeffer. His father was a Lutheran clergyman, as were his uncles David Frederick Schaeffer, Frederick Christian Schaeffer and Charles Frederick Schaeffer, and his grandfather Frederick David Schaeffer. He grew up in the home of his grandfather and that of stepfather Benjamin Keller. He attended Germantown Academy, and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1832, and at the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, in 1835, licensed to preach in 1835, and ordained in 1836. Immediately after being ordained, he took charge of a parish in Montgomery County, which he served until 1841. He was pastor at Harrisburg, in 1841-49, and at Germantown, in 1849-75, when he was retired as pastor emeritus. In 1864, when the theological seminary was established in Philadelphia, he was elected professor of ecclesiastical history, which post he had since held. He held high office in the councils of his church, and had been one of the trustees of the University of Pennsylvania since 1859, receiving from it the degree of DD in 1879. That of LL.D. was given him in 1887 by Thiel College, Greenville. Schaeffer was long one of the leaders of the conservative and confessional party in the Lutheran Church. He took an active part in the establishment of the theological seminary at Philadelphia in 1864, and in the organization of the general council in 1867. He was specially versed in American Lutheran history and the historical and doctrinal development of the Lutheran Church in the United States. The C. W. Schaeffer Combined Secondary and Primary School was a Philadelphia public school in Germantown built in 1876 and named in his honor. Writings He wrote numerous articles for church papers and theological reviews. He was for several years co-editor of the Lutheran Home Journal in Philadelphia, and the Philadelphian, Lutheran and Missionary. After 1879 he was editor-in-chief of The Foreign Missionary in Philadelphia, and after 1886 he was one of the editors of the Lutheran Church Review. He published: * W. J.

Dinitz, 424 U.S. 600 (1976), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States determined that the U.S. Const., Amend. V protection against double jeopardy did not prevent a retrial of a defendant, who had previously requested a mistrial.. Facts Nathan Dinitz was charged with narcotics offenses in violation of 84 Stat. 1260, 1265, 21 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 841(a)(1), 846. Five days before trial, Dinitz retained new lawyer, Wagner, for his defense. Wagner had not been admitted to practice in that court, but on the first day of the trial, the court permitted him to appear pro hac vice. The jury was selected and sworn, and opening statements by counsel began. In the defense's opening statements, Wagner gave improper personal opinions regarding the prosecution's key witness and case. The prosecutor objected, and the judge warned Wagner not to do it again. The judge found it necessary to twice more remind Wagner of the purpose of the opening statement and to instruct him to relate, \\"the facts that you expect the evidence to show, the admissible evidence.\\" Id. at 603. Wagner, however, continued to present improper arguments. The judge then excluded Wagner from the trial and ordered him to leave the courthouse. The judge asked Meldon, Dinitz's original defense counsel, if he was ready to proceed with trial or whether he would be willing to seek one of three alternative courses - (1) a stay or recess pending application to the Court of Appeals to review the propriety of expelling Wagner, (2) continuation of the trial with prior counsel, or (3) a declaration of a mistrial which would permit the respondent to obtain other counsel. Following the short recess, Meldon moved for a mistrial stating that the Dinitz had reviewed the alternatives and believed that mistrial would be in his best interest. Mistrial was granted without opposition. Procedural History Before the retrial, Dinitz moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that a retrial would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Constitution. The motion was denied. The appellate court took the view that the exclusion of Wagner and the questioning of Meldon left no choice but to move for mistrial. On that basis, the court concluded that the request for mistrial should be ignored and treated as though mistrial was declared over the objection of the defendant. The appellate court held that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred the second trial because there was no \\"manifest necessity\\" that another trial be held. Analysis of the Court The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment protects a defendant in a criminal proceeding against multiple punishments or repeated prosecutions for the same offense. Underlying this constitutional safeguard is the belief that: \\"the State, with all its resources and power, should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that, even though innocent, he may be found guilty.\\". Since Justice Story's 1824 opinion in United States v. Perez,. of whether, under the Double Jeopardy Clause, there can be a new trial after a mistrial has been declared without the defendant's request or consent depends on whether there is a manifest necessity for the mistrial, or the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated. A motion by the defendant for mistrial is ordinarily assumed to remove any barrier to retrial, absent bad faith on part of the prosecutor of judge. This is because the defendant has a choice to take the chance to go to the first jury and end the dispute, then and there, with an acquittal. The important consideration is whether the defendant retained primary control over the course to be followed in the event of error. The Double Jeopardy Clause protects a defendant against bad-faith conduct on part of the prosecutor or judge intended to provoke mistrial requests, and thereby, subject defendant to the substantial burdens imposed by multiple prosecutions. But here the judge's banishment of Wagner from the proceedings was not done in bad faith to goad Dinitz into requesting a mistrial or prejudice his changes of an acquittal. Wagner was guilty of improper conduct, which may have justified disciplinary action. Therefore, the Supreme Court held that the Court of Appeals erred in finding the retrial violated Dinitz's constitutional right not to be twice put in jeopardy.

He was known for his uncompromising stance against the Jiajing wokou pirates (so named because they raided during the Jiajing era) and the gentry members who secretly supported them. Early life and career Zhu Wan was born in Changzhou (), now a part of Suzhou, to the schoolteacher Zhu Ang () and his concubine surnamed Shi (). Throughout his upbringing, Zhu Wan and his mother were subject to various abuse by his father's principal wife and his half-brothers. The abuses started three days after he was born when they tried to starve him to death and lasted as late as 1546. His mother shielded him from the abuse when she could and once, an uncle and a cousin intervened to save him from death. Zhu Wan did not mention his father's role in the abuses, but wrote that his father was patient and strict when he taught him the classics and history. These experiences might have formed Zhu Wan's moral code, which was characterized by strict self-discipline and adherence to authority. Zhu Wan passed the imperial examination and earned a jinshi degree in June 1521, and started his career in the Ming bureaucracy by being an apprentice at the Ministry of Works in Beijing, but he apparently disliked his position and returned home. This short apprenticeship was his only position in the capital over his whole career. In 1522, he was appointed as the subprefecture magistrate of Jingzhou (), and was transferred to Kaizhou () the next year. From 1527 to 1532, Zhu Wan served several vice-director and director positions in the secondary capital Nanjing under the Ministry of Justice (), Ministry of War (), and Ministry of Personnel (). Provincial commissions In 1532, Zhu Wan was transferred from the metropolitan areas to the provinces, where he remained until his death. He was first sent to Jiangxi, where he served as assistant administration commissioner () and dealt with Dongxiang inhabitants who resisted mandatory labour service. He then was sent to Sichuan as surveillance vice commissioner () in 1536, where he restructured local defences and put down the Maozhou () and Weizhou aboriginal bandits militarily, putting a stop to the previous practice of paying them off. He recorded his Sichuan experiences in his Maobian Jishi (). In 1541 he was appointed as administration vice commissioner of Shandong (), where he released Shandong soldiers from faraway duties so they could bolster local defences. He was then sent to the southwestern province of Yunnan in 1543 as surveillance commissioner () but came back to Shandong as administration commissioner () the next year. This was followed by his transfer to the same position in Guangdong () in 1545, but even this commission was short-lived since he was promoted again one year later. As grand coordinator In 1546 Zhu Wan was assigned as the grand coordinator of southern Jiangxi (), a post roughly equivalent to a provincial governor and above commissioners of the military, provincial, and surveillance hierarchies. However, he was soon transferred to the coastal province of Zhejiang the next year, as it was undergoing a military emergency in the form of the wokou pirates. After several years of debate over the disturbances on the coast, the Ming court under Senior Grand Secretary Xia Yan decided to appoint a new grand coordinator to manage coastal defense in the two provinces most affected by the turbulence, Zhejiang and Fujian. In 1547, Zhu Wan was made the Grand Coordinator of Zhejiang and Concurrent Superintendent of Military Affairs for Zhejiang and Fujian Coastal Defense (), a new position specifically created to deal with the resurgent wokou problem. It was the first time in many decades that Zhejiang had a single administrative head instead of having three provincial heads. The situation on the coast had become very dire at the start of Zhu Wan's tenure as grand coordinator. In December 1547, the Portuguese had plundered Zhangzhou, and in February the next year the cities of Ningbo and Taizhou were struck by an unprecedented 1,000 raiders aboard a hundred ships. This raid happened whilst Zhu Wan was inspecting in Fujian, and the government troops could not stop the raiders from killing, looting, and burning government offices and homes. Despite the dismal state of coastal defence and the widespread collusion between the gentry and the pirates, Zhu Wan carried out his task energetically. He strictly enforced the maritime prohibitions, forbidding anyone from venturing out to sea on penalty of death, and put all ships to use for defence of the coast. He also publicized the names of the influential persons involved in the illegal trade, to the annoyance of the local gentry. However, Zhu Wan was not entirely against foreign trade as he accommodated an official Japanese trading mission led by Sakugen Sh≈´ry≈ç in early 1548‚Äîhe had no problem with foreign trade in principle as long as it was done through the proper channels. On 15 April 1548, Zhu Wan's fleet in Wenzhou set sail for the pirate haven Shuangyu under the command of Lu Tang and Ke Qiao (). The fleet descended onto Shuangyu one night in June, under the cover of thick weather. Fifty-five to a few hundred smugglers perished in the attack, but leading figures such as Li Guangtou () and Wang Zhi were able to escape. Lu Tang then razed the town and rendered the harbour permanently unusable by filling it in with stones under Zhu Wan's orders. Zhu Wan and his generals were greatly rewarded in silver for the victory, but he also drew the ire of his political enemies among the gentry, whose profits were directly affected by the destruction of Shuangyu. Eventually a pretense was found to demote Zhu Wan to the temporary position of inspector general (), the argument being one man cannot control two provinces at the same time. Downfall and death After the loss of Shuangyu, the smugglers scattered along the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian to find good hideouts to trade. The deep water inlet of Zoumaxi (Ëµ∞È¶¨Ê∫™, \\"Running Horse Creek\\") by the Dongshan Peninsula near the Fujian-Guangdong border was found to be a suitable place for trade since the terrain sheltered the ships from the winds, and the inhabitants of nearby Meiling () had been greatly involved in the illicit trade. On 19 March 1549, Lu Tang and Ke Qiao ambushed two junks in Zoumaxi while they were trading with the Portuguese aboard resulting in 33 deaths and 206 smugglers captured. Among the captured were Li Guangtou and a number of Portuguese men, and Lu Tang had four of the more good-looking Portuguese pretend to be kings of Malacca in order to make the victory seem more complete. Fearing that the captives might bribe their way out, Zhu Wan executed 96 of the Chinese smugglers using his discretionary powers. Zhu Wan's unauthorized executions of the Zoumaxi captives provided an excellent opportunity for his political enemies. On April 27, Zhu Wan was impeached for exceeding his authority since executions had to be sanctioned by the emperor. The Jiajing Emperor dismissed Zhu Wan from his post and ordered a full investigation on the matter. Seeing that the odds were against him, especially since his backer Xia Yan had been executed in disgrace in October last year, Zhu Wan wrote his own epitaph and committed suicide by drinking poison in January 1550. The investigation confirmed the allegations that Zhu Wan had killed the prisoners without imperial authorization, and so a posthumous death sentence was handed down. Lu Tang and Ke Qiao were also condemned to death, and the Portuguese smugglers were let off lightly, with exile as their punishment. The death of Zhu Wan was followed by the wholesale reversion of his policies, and the fleet that Zhu had assembled was dispersed. For three years the position held by Zhu Wan remained vacant, and during these years apparently no government official dared to mention the coastal situation in the adverse political atmosphere. The coastal gentry had come out on top over Zhu Wan, but in doing so they created a military vacuum on the Chinese coast, of which the wokou raiders took full advantage when they intensified their raids for the coming decade. Contemporaries and later historians lamented Zhu Wan's fate for his righteousness and steadfast resistance against the influential families, and his name was finally cleared by the Wanli Emperor in December 22, 1587.

Disused after 1915, it was restored for use by walkers and cyclists in 2003. Sixteenth century Clackmannanshire Council's public information board (see references) names Robert Spittal, the court tailor to James IV and a local philanthropist, as the person probably responsible for the bridge's construction. (A Robert Spittal was also tailor to Mary Queen of Scots and responsible for the Brig o'Teith over the River Teith at Doune.) Tullibody Old Bridge was built early in the 16th century, constructed of rubble with some ashlar and was designed to impede the rapid transit of horse traffic. The plan shows two opposed bends. With two main arches and three flood arches to the west, its great length (442 ft or 134.7m) probably reflects the difficulty in crossing the flood plain at this point. The eastern arch was demolished, by William Kirkcaldy of Grange in January 1560, to hamper French troops during the regency of Mary of Guise the mother of Mary, Queen of Scots. The French commander Henri Cleutin improvised a bridge using timbers from the roof of the nearby Tullibody Old Kirk, and carried on from Fife to Stirling.Laing, David, ed., 'John Knox's 'History of the Reformation', Book 3,' The Works of John Knox, vol. 2, Bannatyne Club, Edinburgh (1848), p. 14 A more permanent repair was made in 1560. Seventeenth century In the 17th century the bridge was often in a ruined state but was repaired several times with funds raised by tolls levied on users. In 1697 Thomas Bauchop, a mason, received a contract for repairs from the Earl of Mar. In that year he or his son, Alloa Master Mason Tobias Bauchop, built a new eastern arch and inserted iron ties. Recent history The Old Bridge went out of use in 1915 in favour of a lattice steel girder bridge, Downie's Bridge, built a short distance to the north to carry the A907 road. In 1999 the A907 was re-routed over the present concrete structure and the steel bridge, long neglected, was demolished in 2003. In January 2003, Clackmannanshire Council began restoring the Old Bridge and performed vegetation clearance, resurfacing and structural repairs to the masonry in accordance with conditions laid down by Historic Scotland. The project was completed in January 2005 and Tullibody Old Bridge now forms part of the National Cycle Network in Clackmannanshire. It is protected as a Category A listed building, and was a Scheduled Ancient Monument until 2016 when this status was removed due to dual designation.

(born 1939 in Korea) is a South Korean comic book artist, considered the first artist working in a manhwa style to be published regularly in the United States. The bulk of Kim's American work was for Charlton Comics' horror comics, as well as the Kung fu title House of Yang. In South Korea, Kim is known for the bestselling title Lifi, as well as his more recent History of Great Korean Empire. Lifi encouraged the Korean people to rise from the destruction of the Korean War, and is still imprinted in the minds of many people as Korea's first science fiction comic. Though Kim has worked in many styles and genres, the common theme that runs through his work is the pride and spirit of the Korean people.  Biography  = Early life and education = While a child during the Korean War, Kim lived in a refugee camp, where he read the comic strip \\"Mr. Manhong,\\" featured in a Busan newspaper. Inspired to become a cartoonist himself, Kim studied fine arts (including Western painting) at Seorabeol Art College in Seoul.Kim Dong-Hwa (Chairman of the Korean Cartoonists Association). \\"Who is Sanho Kim?\\" Archived on Terry Hooper's blog (Comic Bits Online) (August 16, 2009). While still at university, Kim made his professional debut in Manhwa Segye Magazine with \\"A Shining Star at Dawn,\\" a well-received story about fighters for Korean independence from Japan. Kim released his first full-length book, The Brilliant Twilight Star, in 1958. = Lifi and other Korean comics = In 1959, Kim published the science fiction bestseller Lifi the Fighter of Justice, set in the 22nd century. Published during a post-war period of great economic distress, Kim used his hero to express the spirit of the Korean people and to urge his readers to overcome their hardships. With a \\"„Ñπ‚Äù-shaped badge on the chest (based on the Taebaek Mountains), and armed with futuristic weapons, Lifi fought against crowds of devils. Despite comics being dismissed as a lowly genre, Lifi was a huge success and his image was ubiquitous throughout the country. From 1961‚Äì1967, Kim published the long-running series Rhye Pye (a.k.a. Frieple). He drew comics in several genres, including adventure, police, and war stories. = United States = In 1966, Kim moved to the United States, setting up a publishing house and working as an art director at the magazines Off Broadway and Village Times. By 1969, Kim had connected with the American comic book industry, eventually garnering over 300 credits during the period 1969‚Äì1976. The bulk of Kim's output during this time was for Charlton Comics, but he also worked for Warren Publishing, Skywald Publications, and Marvel Comics. With his Korean-informed style, Kim became the first manhwa artist working to be published regularly in the United States.Kim entry, Lambiek's Comiclopedia. Accessed June 9, 2011.  Charlton  For Charlton, Kim worked on a number of the company's horror and suspense titles, particularly The Many Ghosts of Doctor Graves, Ghost Manor, Ghostly Haunts, Ghostly Tales, and Haunted. (In addition to providing artwork for many interior stories, Kim drew most of the covers for Ghost Manor vol. 1.) He also illustrated stories for the Charlton Western comics Billy the Kid and Cheyenne Kid,Paul Gravett. Make Mine Manhwa!: Exporting Korean Comics and the war comic War. Kim's most important and artistically successful effort was for House of Yang (1975‚Äì1976), a spinoff of the Charlton title Yang, which ran from 1973‚Äì1976. The Yang titles were intended to capitalize on the mid-1970s Kung Fu craze in general and the television show Kung Fu in particular. House of Yang was set in Asia, which perfectly suited Kim's background and style. Kim had been slated to design and illustrate the original series, which he had titled Wrong Country, but the artwork was misplaced and Charlton regulars Joe Gill and Warren Sattler filled in for the duration of Yang's run. (The lost artwork for Wrong Country later turned up and was printed the CPL Gang fanzine Charlton Bullseye.)Charlton Bullseye #3 (CPL Gang, 1976).Agent, The Groovy. \\"Black and White Wednesday: Sanho Kim's Wrong Country,\\" Diversions of the Groovy Kind (May 12, 2010). Other Charlton titles Kim contributed to, though in a more sporadic fashion, included Beyond the Grave, Bounty Hunter, Fightin' Army, Fightin' Marines, Haunted Love, Scary Tales, Space Adventures, and Sword & Sorcery. During the period 1969‚Äì1976, Kim did over 60 covers for Charlton titles as well as interior lettering.  Other U.S. publishers  While working for Charlton, Kim freelanced for Warren Publishing, crafting a backup feature in Vampirella and contributing to Eerie in 1971‚Äì1972. Kim illustrated The Sword and the Maiden (vol. 1 of Sword's Edge), which was written by Michael Juliar and published by Iron Horse Publishing in 1973. For Skywald Publications from 1974‚Äì1976, Kim did the art for The Fiend of Changsha and Horror. Benefiting from the notoriety of his Asian-themed work for Charlton, Kim moved to Marvel Comics in 1975, contributing stories to the black-and-white comics magazines Deadly Hands of Kung Fu and Monsters Unleashed. = Return to Korea = In the early 1990s Kim traveled to China, where he came to believe that six thousand years earlier, ancient Koreans had governed broad areas of that country, including the Shandong Peninsula and Manchuria. Following his visit to China, Kim changed the focus of his comics to historical topics, including Daejusinjeguksa (History of Great Korean Empire). In this project, as well as The Duman River and The Story of Buddha, Kim has combined Western painting with comics art, in his words inventing a new form of \\"picture scenario\\" to tell his stories. Kim returned to South Korea in 1996. In October 2008, he was awarded the Order of Cultural Merit by the South Korean government.

Life and career Little Tony was born in Tivoli, Italy, but was a citizen of San Marino, where his parents were born, and never applied for Italian citizenship. He formed a rock and roll group with his two brothers, Alberto and Enrico, in 1957, naming himself Little Tony in emulation of Little Richard. The following year, the group were signed by Durium Records, who released a series of covers of American rock and roll songs by them in Italy. In 1959, the Italian singer Marino Marini, when in London, recommended the group to TV pop show producer Jack Good. Good visited Italy to meet the group, was impressed, and signed them up to appear in his British TV show Boy Meets Girls. They made their first appearance on the programme in September 1959, and released their first single in the UK, \\"I Can't Help It\\" - the 11th single of their career in Italy - on the Decca label soon afterwards. For their third British single, Good recorded the group in London for the first time, and the resulting single, \\"Too Good\\", written by Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman, reached # 19 on the UK singles chart in January 1960, their only chart success in Britain. The group continued to appear regularly on TV shows in Britain until 1962. The group first revisited Italy in 1961 to appear at the Sanremo Festival when they performed the song \\"24.000 baci\\" with Adriano Celentano and finished second, returning more permanently the following year. Little Tony then worked as a solo singer, having his first #1 in Italy with \\"Il ragazzo col ciuffo\\" in 1962. He began working as a movie actor, appearing in over 20 movies in Italy, and becoming a star in the musicarelli film genre. He also continued to record regularly through the 1960s, one of his biggest hits from Festival Sanremo '1967 is \\"Cuore matto\\" (crazy heart), no. 1 for nine consecutive weeks in 1967. It sold in excess of about six million copies and was awarded a gold disc in May 1967. Another successful song was \\"Quando vedrai la mia ragazza\\", that he performed in Festival Sanremo '1964, which sold almost one million copies, and later \\"Rider√†\\", which sold over a million copies in 1966. He formed his own record label, Little Records, in 1969. In Festival Sanremo 1969 Little Tony was singing the swing hit \\"Bada Bambina\\" (be careful baby) and in the following year, he participated in Festival Sanremo '1970 with the hit \\"La spada nel cuore\\" (sword in my heart) that became an international hit. In 1975 he recorded the album Tony canta Elvis, which pays tribute to Elvis Presley. In the 1980s the three singers Rosanna Fratello, Bobby Solo, and Little Tony and formed the group \\"Ro Bo T\\". In the late Eighties Little Tony was in America and recorded several songs with Diana Ross and the Supremes. In the 1990s and 2000s Little Tony participated in dozens of TV shows, particularly in Rai Uno and Canale 5, among others with the Italian superstars Gianni Morandi, Rita Pavone, Adriano Celentano, Mara Venier and many others. He continued to record and perform successfully in Italy, despite suffering a heart attack during his show in Canada in 2006. In 2008, Little Tony participated in the Sanremo Festival for the tenth time, with his hit \\"Non finisce qui\\".

The first political piece by Hitler, it is thought to have established his credentials as a radical rightist and, amongst conservative groups, as the man who could overthrow the Weimar Republic. Because the letter is the first record of Hitler's antisemitic views, and because it brought Hitler into politics, it is considered an important document in Holocaust studies.

Background On August 20, the Polish insurgents repulsed a German attack on the Muran√≥w neighborhood. The insurgents took heavy casualties, were looking at the increasingly indefensible positions, and were pressured by some civilians to stop the hostilities. On the morning of August 21, 1944, soldiers of the Polish Home Army, under command of Franciszek Rataj, left the neighborhood. This area was immediately seized by the advancing German troops. Crime Civilians who did not escape along with the soldiers of Home Army were captured. First, German soldiers separated the men from women and children. Then around 500 men were flocked to a warehouse on Stawki street. In the warehouse soldiers conducted a \\"selection\\" from the crowd all men who possessed elements of a military uniform (shoes, pants, caps, etc.), as well as items that may have come from German military warehouses (e.g. canned goods). They also brought elderly people from a nearby retirement home at Przebieg street as well as several women. Afterward, a group of around 200 \\"selected\\" men was taken to the yard of a housing block on Dzika 17 street and shot. Their corpses were burned.

Broomspun is best known for winning the $43,000 1921 Preakness Stakes at Pimlico Race Course on May 16, 1921, in front of a record-breaking crowd.  Two-year-old season  Broomspun broke his maiden at Aqueduct Racetrack in his second start in the summer of 1920 as a two-year-old. Later that summer, he won at a mile and an eighth in an allowance race at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky, in a very fast time. Broomspun did not win again over the next three months and was freshened for the winter.  Three-year-old season  Broomspun got a late start to his three-year-old season, making his sophomore debut in an allowance race at a mile and one eighth at New York's Aqueduct Racetrack. In that race, he ran second. Later that year, after the Derby runner did not return two weeks later in Baltimore, trainer James Rowe entered Broomspun in the second jewel of Triple Crown, the Preakness Stakes. In that race, four multiple stakes winners were assigned the high weight of 126 pounds. Broomspun, because of his lack of success, was given a weight allowance of 12 pounds and went to post carrying 114 pounds including his jockey, Frank Coltiletti. In 1921, the Preakness was the richest race held in North America. While $38,450 went to the winner of the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness victor received $43,000. A record 30,000 race fans were on hand, the most in the 48-year history of the race. At the start of the race, several of the 14 starters were fractious or unruly as it took the starter eleven minutes to get the field settled. Broomspun broke from post position 7 in a forward position and stalked the leaders from fourth passing the stands for the first time at Pimlico Race Course. He sat just off leader Leonard II's flank going down the backstretch in 47.4 for the first half mile. On the final turn, Broomspun worked his way around on the outside and burst down the lane to take the lead by just over a length. In the final strides, he was ridden out hard by jockey Frank Coltiletti to hold for the win by three quarters of a length over a hard- charging filly named Polly Ann. The headline in The Baltimore Sun the next day read, \\"From obscurity to fame, Broomspun jumped in less than two minutes in The Preakness Stakes. The 3-year-old son of Broomstick and Spun Giass, who is the property of Harry Payne Whitney, the New York City sportsman, won the Classic Preakness from a field of 14 strong competitors, the best three-year- olds in the country.\\" Besides beating Polly Ann, Broomspun defeated Jeg, who held on for third, and Leonardo II and Tryster, who dead-heated for fourth. That win was owner Harry Payne Whitney's second of four in the Preakness Stakes. While competing in the June 18, 1921 Carlton Stakes at New York's Aqueduct Racetrack, jockey Clarence Kummer felt Broomspun's leg give on his first stride at the start of the race and pulled him up after four furlongs. Broomspun was euthanized when it was determined he had broken his right foreleg at the shoulder.

It is noted for its use of multiple oscillators that are linked through a 'swarm' control, giving its distinctive sound and method of playing.  Operation  The Swarmatron is a fingerboard synthesizer like the Trautonium or Tannerin. A finger is placed or slid from side to side along a ribbon controller, controlling the pitch. Glissandi are obviously easily achieved, or careful finger placement may be used to play discrete notes. The distinctive feature of the Swarmatron is its use of eight individual oscillators, under a single control. These oscillators produce an equidistant chord, where their spacing is under the player's immediate control. There are two ribbon controllers: the larger controls the pitch in the obvious manner, the second is used to control the spacing of the oscillators when in 'Swarm' mode. A large central knob on a rotary control may also be used to control this swarm. The oscillators may also be switched on and off individually by a row of switches. With all but one switched off, the instrument becomes a simple ribbon-controlled monophonic synth, capable of the usual glissandi. Using combinations, and adjustment of the range control, allows a non-equidistant swarmed chord to be produced. The oscillators may also be preset to the usual chord intervals of major thirds etc. The pitch control also controls a low-pass filter. This may either track the main pitch, or may be controlled by the second ribbon.In this mode, swarming is controlled by the central knob. With the sawtooth wave of the oscillators, this tracking filter controls the sound of the instrument. As for many other analogue synths, there is also an ADSR envelope control. Like the Persephone, the tuning controls for the ribbon's base frequency and overall range have such a wide span that the ribbon controller itself is unlabelled, although some players mark note positions on the ribbons for a piece. There are no facilities for MIDI. However, there are three analogue 0-10V Control Voltage (CV) inputs for pitch, filter cutoff and swarm. With the use of a standard MIDI to CV converter, the instrument may be controlled from a sequencer or other MIDI controller.  Dewanatron  The Swarmatron was developed by Dewanatron, the Dewan cousins, Brian and Leon. They are still hand-made by the Dewans, explaining their high price-tag. Previous instruments such as their Melody Gins and Dual Primate Console have also used the same principle of multiple, interacting oscillators. These instruments also show the Swarmatron's retro styling of dark wood cases with hammer-finish green paint. Knobs and switches also show a distinctly retro influence. Front panels labels are deliberately minimal, controls being labelled with single letters rather than words. Dewanatron sell their Swarmatron through Big City Music of Los Angeles. As of March 2016, only 83 have been produced.  Notable appearances  Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross used a Swarmatron in his soundtrack for the 2010 film The Social Network. The DVD includes a bonus feature of Reznor discussing the instrument. Reznor and Ross's band How to Destroy Angels and their eponymous first album are as yet the most prominent users of the instrument.  Derived instruments  The Swarm, a software drone synth for the Mac and Windows has been produced, inspired by Swarmatron and Trent Reznor's soundtrack. Although this emulates many features of the Swarmatron, and adds MIDI control, it does not include the hardware features of the ribbon controls.

Ulmer and released by Allied Artists. The film is a variation on the 1886 gothic novella Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson. It stars Gloria Talbott, John Agar and Arthur Shields. In the film, Janet Smith (Gloria Talbott) learns that she is not only the daughter of the infamous Dr. Henry Jekyll, but is convinced by her guardian, Dr. Lomas (Arthur Shields), that she has inherited her father's transformative condition. Janet begins to believe that she turns into a monster after two local woman are found horribly killed and nearly takes her own life because of it. However, all is not what it seems. Daughter of Dr. Jekyll was released in theaters in the US on a double bill with The Cyclops.  Plot  Janet Smith (Gloria Talbott) and fianc√© George Hastings (John Agar) arrive at the English manor house that Janet will inherit the next day, when she turns 21. They meet Mrs. Merchant (Martha Wentworth), the housekeeper; Jacob (John Dierkes), the groundskeeper; and Maggie (Molly McCard), Janet's personal maid. Oddly, Maggie is frightened and in a hurry to get home before the moon rises. Janet and George also meet Dr. Lomas (Arthur Shields), Janet's soon-to-be ex-guardian. Janet surprises Lomas by revealing that she and George have decided to marry as soon as possible. Lomas says that their decision is \\"rash and ill-advised,\\" but then announces that in addition to the house, Janet is inheriting a \\"sizable fortune\\" and a huge estate. He also says, ominously, that he has another inheritance to explain in the morning. Next morning, Janet and George discover a hidden laboratory in the house. When they ask Lomas about it, he refuses to say anything until George leaves the room. George does, but when Janet returns from the lab, she tells him that the wedding is off because Lomas has told her that she's the daughter of the werewolf Dr. Jekyll. After Lomas takes them to the family crypt to see Jekyll's tomb, Janet says that she fears passing on \\"this madness\\" to her and George's future children. When George asks if that's possible, Lomas says that there's no proof one way or the other. Lomas hypnotizes Janet that night under the pretence of checking her for shock. Before Janet goes to bed, Maggie tells her that tomorrow night's full moon marks the night that \\"the monster Jekyll rises from his tomb.\\" Janet has a nightmare in which she sees a monster-woman kill another woman. Once awake, she finds blood on her hands and nightdress, and when she looks in the mirror, she sees the monster-woman looking back. Colored publicity shot featuring John Dierkes and Molly McCard.Merchant serves breakfast the next morning, complaining that Maggie and Jacob are late for work. Jacob then appears, carrying Maggie's body. She was killed on her way home last night, according to Jacob, by a werewolf. That night, the night of the full moon, Lomas doses Janet with brandy- and drug-laced milk before she goes to bed. Janet has second, longer nightmare, in which the monster-woman kills Lucy (Reita Green) in the woods, while leaving the young man (Marcel Page) she's with unharmed. Janet awakens and again finds blood on herself. In the morning, Jacob glares accusingly at Janet as he says, \\"We've found Lucy. With her throat torn out. Torn out by her!\\" Merchant resigns, too afraid to stay in the manor house any longer. Janet is by now in deep distress. She begs George to lock her up or put her \\"in a nuthouse,\\" then hysterically cries, \\"If you love me, please kill me,\\" threatening that if he won't, she will. George puts her back to bed, but she slips away. As they search for her, Lomas dismisses George's worries about Janet killing herself, saying that most suicide threats are \\"just talk.\\" They find Janet at the family crypt, Jacob sitting nearby sharpening a wooden stake. Lomas hypnotizes Janet again and leads her back to the crypt. George follows, unseen, unheard. Lomas tells Janet that she'll kill another woman that night and then hang herself over her father's tomb in regret. As George watches, Lomas transforms into a werewolf. They fight, the werewolf knocks George unconscious, then goes to the village and kills a woman (Marjorie Stapp) as she dresses. Armed village men shoot the werewolf and chase it toward the crypt. George rouses Janet from her trance and explains that Lomas is the werewolf, not her, and that he's framing Janet, just as he framed her father, because he wants the estate for himself. While the wounded werewolf and George fight in the crypt, Jacob skewers the werewolf with the wooden stake. The werewolf reverts to Lomas as it dies.

It was filmed in widescreen format with an aspect ratio of 1.85:1. Talbott said in an interview that the actual shooting time was \\"something like five to seven days\\" and that most of the filming took place \\"not on a stage, but in a house\\" on 6th Street in Los Angeles, near Hancock Park. She said that passing traffic can occasionally be seen through a window in the background of interior shots. Daughter of Dr. Jekyll has a virtually identical prologue and epilogue. In the beginning, after a voice- over informs viewers that Dr. Jekyll is dead, the camera cuts to a werewolf, sitting in a smoky lab, who cackles \\"Are you sure?\\" in what sounds like a high-pitched woman's voice. At the end, after the werewolf is killed, the same scene is repeated, but this time \\"Are you sure?\\" is asked in a more masculine- sounding voice. British film scholar Phil Hardy speculates that this was done in the belief that Daughter of Dr. Jekyll would be the first film in a series. It was not. In the fight scene between Agar and the werewolf, uncredited stuntman Ken Terrell stood in for Shields. The monster-woman version of Talbott during the nightmare scenes was played by an unnamed stunt double. To produce an unreal effect during the nightmares, Ulmer set the action in a wooded region that had recently been burned, then filmed it using ultraviolet film. Reflecting the film's low budget, screams heard during the nightmares came from the \\"convenient and valuable resource known as the Sound Effects Library.\\" Daughter of Dr. Jekyll is one of 35 films thematically related to the Stevenson novella and released between 1908 and 2005, according to a filmography compiled by Dr. Michael Delahoyd of Washington State University. It is one of only three werewolf movies made in the US during the 1950s, the other two being The Werewolf (1956) and I Was a Teenage Werewolf (1957). Release Colorized lobby card featuring Gloria Talbott and Arthur Shields.Daughter of Dr. Jekyll was released in the US as the second film on a double bill with The Cyclops, in which Talbott also stars, on 28 July 1957. The movie opened over a period of years in different countries: in Mexico during 1957, in Italy in 1959 and in Austria and West Germany in 1963. The film was released to theaters at unspecified dates in Belgium, France, Brazil, Greece, Serbia and Spain. It was re-released to US theaters in 1964, two years after it had been syndicated to television by Allied Artists as part of a 22-film package called \\"Sci-Fi for the 60s.\\" Allied Artists distributed the film in the US for its initial release in 1957 and again upon its re-release in 1964. Allied Artists de Mexico distributed the film to theaters there, while Mercator Filmverleih Boho Gaus handled it in Germany. The television release was somewhat unusual as the film's running time of 67, 69 or 71 minutes, depending on which version was used, was considered to be too short for \\"late night time slots.\\" As a result, the film was expanded to approximately 75 minutes by double-printing \\"some of the film's frames to stretch out the action\\" and lengthening Janet's nightmares \\"with footage from Frankenstein 1970 (1958).\\" Daughter of Dr. Jekyll has been available for home viewing for a number of years. Fox Video, Key Video and World Beyond Video all released the film on VHS in the US, although release dates have not been established. DVDs of the film were put out in the US by All-Day Entertainment in 2000 and by Image Entertainment in 2003. Outside the US, DVDs of the movie were released by Punto Zero in Italy in 2008, and in 2009 by BAC Films in France and L'Atelier 13 in Spain. In 2012, a DVD version was released by an unspecified company in Germany. Scenes, trailers and clips from the film are featured in the 1991 VHS documentary Wolfman Chronicles and in two episodes of the TV series 100 Years of Horror - \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" and \\"Girl Ghouls,\\" both from the series' first season in 1996. Reception Reviewers seem to have not been overwhelmed by the quality of the film at the time of its release. BoxOffice magazine summarized reviews in its standing feature \\"Review Digest\\" in the issue of 26 October 1957. Harrison's Reports, Film Daily, The Hollywood Reporter, Parent's Magazine and The New York Daily News all called the film \\"fair.\\" Variety and BoxOffice itself rated it as \\"poor.\\" About two months earlier, BoxOffice suggested to theater owners in its regular \\"Exploitips\\" feature that to drum up business, \\"At the curb in front of the theatre, have an ambulance bearing a sign: 'For the convenience of those who are overcome by the dual chiller-thrillers,'\\" a reference to the pairing of The Cyclops and Daughter of Dr. Jekyll. Later critics have tended to focus on the film's inconsistencies and shortcomings. American critic Andrew Sarris notes that the film has a \\"scenario so atrocious that it takes forty minutes to establish that the daughter of Dr. Jekyll is indeed the daughter of Dr. Jekyll.\\" Hardy calls the film \\"bizarre\\" and \\"the most unorthodox treatment of Stevenson's theme to date\\" (i.e., 1985) but also says that \\"Ulmer's direction is as hypnotic as ever but producer Pollexfen's script leaves him little room for genuine creativity.\\" Ken Hanke, film critic for the MountainXpress on-line newspaper, notes in a 2014 review of the movie, then being shown as part of a film series, that while \\"there are obvious attempts of someone making the best film possible given the script and budget,\\" the film makes little sense. For example, he notes that \\"It somehow manages to confuse Mr. Hyde with a werewolf [and] comes up with the screwy idea that being a drug-induced monster could be an inheritable trait.\\" Likewise, American sci-fi film scholar Bill Warren points out the inconsistency of having the werewolf killed with a stake through the heart \\"like a vampire.\\" He also writes that \\"To make a Jekyll-Hyde movie and leave out Hyde seems perverse.\\" Other critics, however, have more deeply explored the subtext of the film. Robert Singer suggests in a book chapter titled \\"Nothing to Hyde: Reading The Daughter of Dr. Jekyll\\" that the film \\"may be read as a critically significant text within the melodramatic crisis of female identity cinema of the 1950s,\\" with Janet treated simultaneously as a child and an adult, being \\"dressed, undressed, put to sleep, given pills, hypnotized and, when all else fails, she is nearly led to suicide.\\" Singer describes the film as \\"an identity quest set in a dark fairy tale\\" and calls George \\"an oafish white knight\\" who \\"in fairy tale fashion, saves his princess, the innocent persecuted heroine.\\" Similarly, Craig makes note of the sexual and patriarchal undertones of Daughter of Dr. Jekyll that are reflected in Janet, who by the end of the film is legally an adult (i.e., age 21) and very soon to be married. He writes that \\"Janet's first 'victims' are young women, easily seen as sexual rivals, reinforcing the notion that this 'alter ego' of hers is fueled in part by sexual desire suppressed.\\" Moreover, \\"she readily believes herself literally cursed by the 'sins of the father.' This notion follows the time-honored patriarchal script in which the female is blamed for the sins of the male, even unto potential self- destruction.\\" Stars Talbott and Agar appear to have disagreed about the worth of the movie, speaking about it in separate interviews. Talbott said that \\"I was amazingly surprised at it. I didn't think it was going to be anything - it was another of those 'wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am' shoots' - and yet it turned out to have a lot more content than I might have hoped.\\" Agar, though, said that \\"I did that picture strictly for the bread. I didn't fluff it - I did the best I could with what I had to work with - but it wasn't my cup of tea. I just didn't believe it.\\" Nonetheless, despite its shortcomings, some critics still find the movie enjoyable, calling it \\"immensely silly\\" and \\"more amusing than anything\\" as well as \\"delightfully daffy\\" and \\"an awful lot of fun.\\" See also * The Son of Dr. Jekyll References External links Category:1957 films Category:1957 horror films Category:Films directed by Edgar G.

It is a fictionalized account of an actual Old West event, the slaying of beautiful singer Dora Hand in Dodge City, Kansas, when Earp was a deputy there. In one of its many instances of dramatic license, the movie depicts Hand as Earp's sweetheart. The film's framing device is a reporter's interview with an aging Earp, who reminisces about the tragedy. (Val Kilmer plays the older Earp, while Shawn Roberts plays the younger one.) The film was released on March 6, 2012, in the United States. The film was produced by Jeff Schenck and Barry Barnholtz and directed by Michael Feifer. The screenplay was written by Darren Benjamin Shepherd. Plot Wyatt Earp sits down with a reporter in a suite at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco in 1907. The reporter is eager for information about the legendary \\"Buntline Special\\", a Colt six-shooter with a 12-inch barrel. He and Earp talk about how Earp became a famous lawman. Earp tells the story of how he became a fearless United States Marshal. In a flashback, a 30-year-old Wyatt Earp (Roberts) finds out that his first love, Dora Hand (DeGarmo), was murdered. He tracks the murderer down and teams up with his friend Doc Holliday (Bethel), Bat Masterson (Dallas), Charlie Bassett (Whyte) and Bill Tilghman (Fiehler).

Synopsis A stage magician conjures up a dove and places it in a box with a set of clothes. A boy appears from the box, and the magician divides him into two boys with an axe. The two boys squabble, and the magician transforms one into a paper tissue, which he shreds and places the other back in the box. The magician then destroys the box with a hammer to show the boy has vanished. The boy reappears and is transformed into flags. The magician then disappears in a puff of smoke, only to re-enter through a door to take his bow. Production At the time of filming The Famous Box Trick, M√©li√®s had recently finished a series of complex \\"reconstructed newsreels\\" (staged recreations of current events) about the Spanish-American War. He then moved back towards trick films with this film and a handful of others, short magical sketches focusing on special effects made with variations of the substitution splice. The Famous Box Trick, with ten substitution splices in a single minute of action, may be the most complex of this group. M√©li√®s plays the magician in the film, which also uses pyrotechnics in its effects. The style of the film is highly theatrical, with camera tricks only beginning around halfway through, and particularly reminiscent of M√©li√®s's earlier The Vanishing Lady (1896).

It was relaunched in January 2010 as \\"India‚Äôs only narrative journalism magazine.\\"  History  September 1944 coverThe Caravan was first launched in 1940 by founder Vishwa Nath as the first magazine published by Dehli Press. It closed in 1988 and was revived in 2009. It has been published since then from New Delhi, India, by Delhi Press. The managing editor called The Caravan an \\"editorial success, not a business success\\". The circulation has grown to 40,000 since its launch. , the magazine's website gets 1.5 million pageviews per month. The audience for The Caravan was described as the \\"pop intelligentsia.\\" The revival was inspired by New Journalism and long-form American magazines such as Harper's Magazine and The New Yorker. Staff Paresh Nath is editor-in-chief. His son Anant Nath, the grandson of the original founder, is the managing editor. Vinod K. Jose is the executive editor. While rebuilding The Caravan's brand, the staff was less than 10 and grew three-fold over the next five years. Jonathan Shainin, formerly with The New Yorker, joined the team in 2010 as a senior editor and left to go back to his former employer as a news editor in 2013. , The Caravan employed 38 people.  Threats and lawsuits  The magazine has published pieces that are critical of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh paramilitary organization and some actions of the government of India. Because the magazine does not receive advertisements from the government, it is not possible for the government to use the traditional \\"carrot and stick\\" approach to rewarding or punishing journalists by adding or removing paid advertisements according to how pleased the current government is with what they publish. In addition to receiving threatening messages, the magazine has been sued repeatedly for alleged defamation. These lawsuits are costly and typically take years to fight in court. In 2011, the magazine was the subject of a Rs 50 crore defamation suit by the Indian Institute of Planning and Management after it featured a profile of its head, Arindam Chaudhuri. During the years-long lawsuit, the magazine was ordered to take the article off its website. In 2018, the High Court allowed the magazine to re-publish the article, but the gag order was partly reinstated by a different court two months later. The magazine was issued legal notices in April 2013 regarding its May cover story about Attorney General Goolam Essaji Vahanvati but the top three editors decided to continue with its publication. In 2015, The Caravan was served a legal notice by the Essar Group because the magazine described the business and the family that runs it unfavorably, including evidence that the business gave iPads to 195 journalists, government employees, and politicians. Essar later filed a 250 crore civil defamation suit against the magazine; the business did not deny any of the facts presented in the magazine article.

Bari. He is the son of former footballer Riccardo Sogliano. Playing career Born in Alessandria, Sogliano started his career with Serie C2 club Varese at the age of 18. In 1991, he joined Serie B outfit Ancona, with whom he won a historical first promotion to Serie A for the small club from Marche and made his personal top-flight debut in 1992. In 1994, he joined Torino, where he played a single season with little success. After a few minor league experiences with Lucchese and Ravenna, he returned to play at Serie A level with Perugia in 1998. In 2003, aged 32, Sogliano left Perugia to join Napoli, then in Serie B, in what turned to be the club's final season before being declared bankrupt; his experience in Naples proved to be rather unsuccessful, with only six appearances until January 2004, when he was sold to Serie A club Ancona. After playing 11 games with the Dorici, Sogliano retired from active football in June at the age of 33. Post-playing career In the summer of 2004 Sogliano accepted to become general manager of Varese after the club was declared bankrupt and then admitted to the Eccellenza league (sixth level of Italian football) under a new ownership that also included his father Riccardo as vice-president and member of the consortium that controlled the club. Under his tenure as general manager, Sogliano was a key factor in acquiring many of the players that led the club back into professionalism through two consecutive promotions. In 2008 entrepreneur Antonio Rosati took over the club from the previous owners but confirmed Sogliano as general manager: a few weeks after the beginning of the season, after a series of disappointing results, Sogliano agreed to remove Pietro Carmignani as head coach and hire Giuseppe Sannino as replacement. The appointment proved to be a turning point in the season, as well as in Varese's future fortunes, as the club won two successive promotions to Serie B in 2009 and 2010 under the new head coach, also thanks to Sogliano's interventions during the transfer market windows. In 2010‚Äì11, Varese gained national news as the team completed the regular season in fourth place and won a place in the promotion playoffs, then lost to fifth- placed Padova in the semi-finals. Sogliano's impressive work at Varese became popular nationwide and led to a serious interest from Maurizio Zamparini, chairman and owner of ambitious Serie A club Palermo, who offered him the director of football position that was left vacant in November 2010 after the resignation of Walter Sabatini. On 8 June 2011, Palermo officially announced to have hired Sogliano as the club's new director of football. During his stay, Sogliano also appointed then-unknown youth coach Devis Mangia in charge of first team duties. He resigned on 2 November 2011 due to his strained relationship with Zamparini, as confirmed by the latter. In June 2012 he was appointed as director of football at Serie B club Verona. In his first season in the new role, Verona won promotion to the top flight; in the second season, Sogliano was responsible for signing players such as Juan Iturbe, R√¥mulo and Luca Toni, who turned out being instrumental in the team's successful first season back in the Serie A.

Artwork Mosher's artwork combines lyrical epigrams from famous musicians most often in the hip-hop genre. His recognizable collage and cut-paper style combines found imagery through both digital and traditional techniques such as painting and printmaking. It contains graphic images which are worn, used, or made to feel vintage in nature. Subjects are often, but not limited to: birds, flowers, vintage cars, small children, the elderly, fire hydrants, fans, pillow cases, and various other images that seem to be visual conundrums. Mosher's work borrows heavily from Modern artists like C√©zanne, Picasso, Braque, and Rauschenberg, and shares similarities with contemporary Brazilian artist Eduardo Recife (aka Misprinted Type). His work captures the world around him as interpreted through a combination of traditional simple forms, loose illustrative styles, and the use of modern graphic imagery. Example of Mosher's commercial work, Olamide Faison in the \\"Portrait Series\\" Early years Before becoming an artist, Mosher was a competitive athlete who played hockey while attending Nashua High School in Nashua, New Hampshire. Plagued by injuries prior to leaving for college, Mosher decided to pursue art instead and enrolled at the New Hampshire Institute of Art (NHIA) in the illustration program. At NHIA, Mosher earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.) in Illustration where he studied with Lynn Pauley. It was also at NHIA where Mosher first became inspired by C√©zanne's observations of simple forms, Picasso's synthetic cubism, and Rauschenberg's mixed media collages. While at NHIA, Mosher also had the opportunity to study in Florence, Italy in 2007, at which point he started to combine cut-paper techniques into his illustrations. In 2008 his illustration \\"Audubon 2\\" was selected as one of 96 winning student works from around the country featured in an exhibit at the Society of Illustrators Gallery in New York City. Career Mosher's work is strongly influenced by his connection to music, especially hip-hop, and he frequently combines lyrics from hip-hop artists with visual images in his trademark mixed-media style. Lyrics chosen are usually intended to motivate, inspire, or make a statement. Mosher's commercial work is visually more literal. For example, a recent series entitled \\"The Portrait Series\\" features portraits of musicians created using his signature cut-paper and collage style. Mosher's artwork has been featured in numerous online and print publications and for major clients including Forbes, Karmaloop, Highsnobiety, Mountain Dew's Green Label, Complex, Radeberger, Bud Light, Proteus Mag, the Phase Collective, bit FUUL mag, peculiar bliss, notofu, notpaper and get a candy.

Idstein was a residence of the counts of Nassau. The church building in the center of the historic Altstadt (old town) dates back to the 14th century when it was built as a collegiate church. It became Lutheran during the Reformation. Its interior was adapted in the 17th century to become a Lutheran \\"Predigt- und Hofkirche\\" (sermon and court church). The most prominent decoration in the church is the series of 38 paintings by the Flemish painter Michael Angelo Immenraedt, an exponent of Flemish Baroque painting, and others. They follow a program of Biblical scenes. The church was named Unionskirche in 1917 to commemorate the union of Lutheran and Reformed Protestants in the Duchy of Nassau in August 1817, the first of its kind (before the Prussian Union in September of the same year). The Unionskirche is a recognized monument under the Hague Convention. It is used by the Protestant congregation, and it is open to other institutions as a concert venue, including concerts of the Rheingau Musik Festival. It features an organ built in 1912 by Walcker Orgelbau and retaining the historic case dating back to 1783. The church was restored from 2012 to 2017, completed for 500 years since the Reformation and 200 years since the Union. The restoration was awarded the Hessischer Denkmalschutzpreis (Hessian monument preservation prize).  History  = Collegiate church of St. Martin = Remnants in the tower, which lies north of the choir, show that a Romanesque church existed before 1287 at the same location. The present edifice was built from 1330 to 1350 under Gerlach, Count of Nassau, as a collegiate church for a college of six canons, founded in 1333. The college and church were dedicated to St. Martin. = Protestant church = Idstein became Lutheran during the Reformation. After the Thirty Years' War, the church was transformed to a representative Baroque Predigt- und Hofkirche (sermon and court church) by Count Johann of Nassau-Idstein. The restructuring lasted from 1665 to 1677. While the nave was retained, the church was expanded to the west, and the walls were raised, resulting in flatter roofs. Most of the pillars were removed, oval windows were installed in the clerestory, and portals were rounded. Arnold Harnisch (Mainz) and Hans Martin Sattler (Idstein) removed the vaults and built Marmorarkaden (marble arcades). Galleries were installed on three sides in 1675. Plaque on a balustrade There were reserved chairs for certain senior members of society in royal government, municipal government, administration, jurisprudence, presiding roles, and the citizenry (Herrschafts-, Rats-, Sekret√§r-, Gerichts-, Vorsteher-, B√ºrgerstuhl). Plaques on the respective balustrades show Biblical quotations relevant to the position. In 1714, the tower was heightened, and in 1830 an octagonal spire with gables was added. In 1725, dormer windows were added to provide better lighting for the gallery. = Paintings = A unique feature of the church are 38 oil paintings, which completely cover the ceiling of the nave and the upper part of the walls. This use of paintings as an architectural feature is unusual for a Protestant church. The paintings, exclusively on Biblical topics, were created from 1673 to 1678 by Michael Angelo Immenraedt from Antwerp and his assistant Johannes Melchior Bencard. Three paintings are based on designs by Joachim von Sandrart, and five were executed by his nephew Johann von Sandrart. Several paintings are based on well-known works by Rubens. For example, The Wedding at Cana on the south wall shows similarity to Rubens's painting The Feast of Herod, which hangs today in the National Gallery of Scotland in Edinburgh. The sequence of paintings aims to tell Biblical stories to a partly illiterate congregation. The Biblical figures are depicted in courtly Baroque garments. The painting Heimsuchung (Visitation) shows Mary arriving with a servant who carries her baggage on his head. Her cousin Elizabeth lives in a residence with a formal garden in the background. Johann of Nassau-Idstein had a formal garden at the Idstein residential palace, which was begun in 1646. The topics of the paintings in the center row of the ceiling are, from the altar to the back: Verkl√§rung Christi am Tabor (Transfiguration), Kreuzaufrichtung (Elevation of the cross), Auferstehung (Resurrection), Kreuzabnahme (Descent from the Cross), Himmelfahrt (Ascension), and Johannes auf Patmos sieht den Himmel offen und die Engel mit dem Evangelium (Vision of St. John on Patmos, literally: John on Patmos sees heaven open and the angels with the Gospel).

It oprjochtsjen fan it kr√∫s (Michael Angelo Immenraet).jpgDescent from the Cross = Fittings and furniture = Altar The marble altar was built in 1676 by Arnold Harnisch. It shows a painting of the Last Supper from the end of the 17th century. The marble pulpit was erected in 1673 by Christian Ga√ümann and the baptismal font, also of marble, in 1675 by Martin Sattler. Count Johann, infamous for his persecution of witches (Hexenverfolgung) as late as 1676, died shortly before the reconstruction of the church was completed. constructed an epitaph for Georg August Samuel von Nassau-Idstein, his wife Henriette Dorothea and their children, who are buried there. It was designed by Maximilian von Welsch and placed to the left of the altar. Ceiling above the altar, depicting a vision from the Book of Revelation A 1725 fresco above the altar by Maximilan Pronner (Gie√üen) depicts a vision from the Book of Revelation as described by St. John (). George Frideric Handel set the same biblical passage to music as Worthy is the Lamb, to conclude his oratorio Messiah. In 1726, decorative wooden pillars in the shape of palm trees were installed. The lattice separating the elevated chancel was made by Johann Urban Zais. Two crystal chandeliers hang above the main aisle. They date from the early 19th century and were originally installed in the old Kurhaus Wiesbaden. = Church union = The Protestant church was simply called the Stadtkirche (town church). The few remaining Catholics of Idstein were not permitted to hold services until 1806. They were then granted the right to use the Schlosskapelle (Palace Chapel) until 1888, when they moved to their own church. The Stadtkirche was renamed as the Unionskirche in 1917 to commemorate the centennial of the union of Lutheran and Reformed Protestants in the Duchy of Nassau in 1817 in the so-called \\"Nassauische Union\\", to form the Evangelische Kirche in Nassau (Protestant Church in Nassau). It was the first such union in Germany, 300 years after the Reformation. = Present day = Ceiling above the altar after the restoration completed in 2017 The church is used by the Evangelische Kirchengemeinde Idstein (Protestant Congregation of Idstein), a member of the Evangelische Kirche in Hessen und Nassau. It is located in today's pedestrian area of the town. The congregation has been on good ecumenical terms with the Catholic parish St. Martin. Regular √∂kumenische Gottesdienste (ecumenical services) are held on the first Sunday in Advent (St. Martin) and Pentecost Monday (Unionskirche). The congregation has participated in the civic partnership between Idstein and Moshi, Kilimanjaro, founded by Werner Schuster. = Restoration = The church underwent restoration from 2012 to 2017, when it celebrated 500 years since the Reformation and 200 years since the Union. The restoration included the paintings. In 2017, the parish was awarded the Hessischer Denkmalschutzpreis (Hessian monument preservation prize) from the Landesamt f√ºr Denkmalpflege.  Historical assessment  The Landesamt f√ºr Denkmalpflege in Hessen, which cares for historic monuments in the state of Hesse, notes about the interior of the Unionskirche that firstly it follows the principles of a Protestant concept of church design, as they were first exemplified in the Hofkirche zu Torgau in 1544, with Martin Luther's approval. Secondly, the paintings are a distinct part of the architecture, as a rare and comparatively late example of evangelische Laiendogmatik (Protestant lay teaching) by painting. It is the first and heralding independent church-based creative structure (\\"erste und bedeutende eigenst√§ndige kirchliche Bausch√∂pfung\\") in Nassau after the Thirty Years' War.  Music  = Church music = Walcker organ at ceiling Chor St. Martin in the annual ecumenical service on Pentecost Monday, 2010 The organ, built in 1783 by , was replaced in 1912 by an instrument from Walcker, but retaining the historic case (Prospekt). The church choir, conducted by Edwin M√ºller, was named Idsteiner Kantorei in 1972 and started to perform two major concerts a year, in addition to services and concerts in smaller churches of the region. M√ºller was succeeded in 2003 by Carsten Koch, who also lectured at the Musikhochschule Frankfurt. Other musical groups at the Unionskirche are the Kinderkantorei (children's chorale), Jugendkantorei (youth chorale), Gospelchor (gospel choir), Fl√∂tenensemble (recorder ensemble) and Posaunenchor (trombone choir). = Concerts = The Unionskirche has been a venue of the Rheingau Musik Festival, especially for vocal music, such as a recital of Elizabeth Parcells and concerts of the vocal ensembles Chanticleer, ensemble amarcord and Die Singphoniker. In 2000 the Idsteiner Bachtage were held as an ecumenical collaboration of the Unionskirche and St. Martin. Concerts at the Unionskirche included the Brandenburg Concertos, cantata BWV 34 and the Missa in A. Idsteiner Kantorei performing Bach's Christmas Oratorio, Parts IV‚ÄìVI, on 9 December 2018 Carsten Koch established a series of symphony concerts for the annual \\"Tag des offenen Denkmals\\" (European Heritage Day), beginning in 2004 a cycle of the symphonies of Beethoven. It was completed in 2012 with the Ninth Symphony. This concert on 9 September, during a \\"Jubil√§umswoche der Kirchenmusik\\" (anniversary week of church music), was also part of the celebration of anniversaries marking 100 years with the Walcker organ and 40 years with the Idsteiner Kantorei. In addition to the standard choral repertoire, Koch has selected rarely performed works such as Schumann's Missa sacra on 9 November 2008. In 2011 the choir performed Mendelssohn's Lobgesang. In 2017, the first concert after restoration was dedicated to contemporary music including Ola Gjeilo's Sunrise Mass and Eric Whitacre's Five Hebrew Love Songs. In 2018, Bach's complete Christmas Oratorio was performed in two concerts in ecumenical collaboration.

Synopsis A clown constructs a mannequin of William Tell and places a piece of fruit on its head but the mannequin comes to life and hurls the fruit at the clown before he can take aim with his crossbow. The clown removes and replaces first the mannequin's arm and then its head, at which point it comes to life again, tramples the clown and makes its escape, with the now irate clown in pursuit.

The stadium was to replace their current home, the Memorial Stadium. Sainsbury's agreed to buy the Memorial Stadium in 2011 and lease it to the club while the new stadium was built to the north of the city. However, in 2014 the future of the stadium was put in doubt due to a court battle with Sainsbury's over the contract for the Memorial Stadium site. In July 2015 Sainsbury's won its High Court battle with Bristol Rovers over the termination of the ¬£30m deal to buy the Memorial Stadium. The future of the stadium became uncertain, with the club describing the ruling as a \\"kick in the teeth\\". Shortly after, the club were granted leave to appeal the decision which was completed in January 2016 and rejected in March 2016. The following month, Bristol Rovers were sold to the Jordanian Al-Qadi family with outgoing chairman Nick Higgs confirming the outcome of the court case is \\"no longer relevant\\". The club's new president Wael al-Qadi confirmed a new stadium is a \\"key requirement\\" for the new owners. In August 2017, the club announced the project had been cancelled as both parties were unable to agree acceptable terms.  History  Having left their long-term home at Eastville Stadium in 1986, Bristol Rovers spent ten years in exile at Twerton Park in Bath. They finally moved back to Bristol in 1996, becoming joint owners of the Memorial Stadium with Bristol Rugby. They then went on to buy the rugby club's share in the ground in 1998. In 2007, Rovers were granted permission for a complete rebuild of the stadium but, following numerous delays, began seeking alternatives to redeveloping their current home. On 9 June 2011, Bristol Rovers chairman Nick Higgs announced plans to build a 21,700 all-seater stadium in Cheswick in partnership with UWE. The application to build the stadium was submitted to South Gloucestershire Council on 9 March 2012. On 19 July 2012, planning permission was granted for the stadium with councillors voting 12 to 1 in favour. The planning meeting for Sainsbury's Memorial Stadium application was initially expected to follow shortly after this, but was delayed and took place on 16 January 2013. Councillors granted permission for the plans, voting 6 to 3 in favour. This was followed by approval by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles in March. However, the project was put in doubt in September 2013 when a group named TRASHorfield filed an application for a judicial review against Sainsbury's plans which was granted in November. The review was held on 13 March 2014 and rejected by Mr Justice Hickinbottom a week later. TRASHorfield appealed this decision on 26 March 2014, which was dismissed by Mr Justice Hickinbottom the same day. Doubts were raised about the stadium again in August 2014 after it emerged that Rovers had issued a writ against Sainsbury's, alleging that the supermarket chain was attempting to terminate its contract to buy the Memorial Stadium site. At a six-day High Court hearing in May 2015, Sainsbury's argued it had \\"lawfully terminated\\" the contract when planning conditions were not met before the \\"cut-off date\\" in the agreement. On 13 July 2015, Mrs Justice Proudman ruled in favour of Sainsbury's saying the way the deal was structured was an \\"insuperable barrier to the club\\". Rovers chairman Nick Higgs described it as a \\"huge disappointment\\" and stated ‚ÄúWe will be asking them [UWE] to hang in there with us as it‚Äôs not over yet. We have looked at a number of other options to still bring this new stadium to fruition, even without the help of Sainsbury‚Äôs, and we will continue to do that. We have an obligation to explore options and it would be remiss of us not to do so for the sake of the fans, and for this club.‚Äù The club were granted leave to appeal later the same month and confirmed Sainsbury's had made an out of court cash offer to end the litigation, which was rejected being described as 'derisory'. The appeal, held in January 2016, saw the club's lawyers claim Mrs Justice Proudman made a \\"fundamental error\\" in agreeing with the supermarket chain. The verdict from the two-day appeal came on 17 March 2016 and upheld the high court decision. A further twist to the tale came in February 2016 when Bristol Rovers were purchased by the wealthy Al-Qadi family of Jordan, rending the outcome of the court case \\"no longer relevant\\" as described by former chairman Nick Higgs.  Location  Proposed to be situated in the University of the West of England's Frenchay campus, it would have become the only 20,000+ seater stadium within a university campus in the UK. Though not within the city council boundary of Bristol, the stadium would have been located in the area sometimes known as Greater Bristol. The stadium will be located around 1.5 miles from Bristol Rovers current Memorial Stadium home and around 1.8 miles from their former ground at Eastville. The UWE Stadium would have been just off the A4174 and a short drive from junction 1 of the M32. There would have been space for 1,000 cars and coaches with a further 1,500 spaces on campus if needed. It would have also additionally be close to both Filton Abbey Wood and Parkway train stations.  Design  The bowl-shaped stadium would have been all-seated with an initial capacity of 21,700. The stadium has been designed to adhere to international standards for both football and rugby. However, following Bristol City majority shareholder Stephen Lansdown's takeover of Bristol Rugby, they have instead moved to play at Bristol City's Ashton Gate Stadium. The stadium was designed to minimise the impact on the local environment, including using the topography of the site to effectively enclose the stadium and minimise noise and light disruption, as well as being designed to allow the capacity to be increased to 26,000 without making any external changes and up to 35,000 should it be needed. Proposed facilities *Supporters club bar *Club shop *1000 seat conference centre and banqueting suite *28 executive boxes *Convenience store *Gym and jogging track *Cr√®che *19,000sq ft of teaching space for UWE  Criticism  UWE Students' Union website acknowledged that they had received student criticism but do not share such criticism. One student criticised the university for considerably inflating the benefits of the planned stadium to its students and the union for silencing student criticism.

He was one of a company who purchased land in Westerly and vicinity. The records reveal that his descendants settled in Westerly and that this settlement became the principal center of the Seventh-Day Baptist Church in New England.The first record of Nicholas Cottrell (spelled Cotterell) in the new world appears among the first list of inhabitants (42 in all) admitted at the Towne of Nieu Port (Newport) since twentieth of third 1638, (Found in the Rhode Island Colonial Records, page 92.)

March 22, 1661, he signed articles as a member of a company who purchased a large tract of land at Misquamicutt (Westerly, R.I.) (Westerly Town Records.) In 1678 he bought 700 acres of land in Plymouth County, on Taunton River, now called Assonet, in the Town of Freetown, Mass. He died there in 1680.The writer of this sketch, Roy F. Cottrell, visited Westerly, Rhode Island in the summer of 1932, and from the president of the \\"C.B.

Cottrell and Sons Company that provided the author of this booklet with much of the genealogy information for the earliest Cottrell's in America =1774-1852, John Cottrell= Rosswell's father, John Cottrell, was born 1774 in Westerly, Rhode Island. He was a Seventh-Day Baptist preacher. But he did not agree with the Baptist teaching on the immortality of the soul. He owned and worked a small farm woodware shop. These activities provided a source of income. He was not paid as a preacher. Along the intervening years several prominent members of the Cottrell family have become Seventh-Day Baptist preachers. James White visited John Cottrell in 1853 at Mill Grove, New York. He reported the meeting in the Review and Herald: :\\"Bro. Cottrell is nearly eighty years of age, remembers the dark day of 1780, and has been a Sabbath-keeper more than thirty years. He was formerly united with the Seventh-Day Baptists; but on some points of doctrine has differed from that body. He rejected the doctrine of the trinity, also the doctrine of man's consciousness between death and the resurrection, and the punishment of the wicked in eternal consciousness. He believed that the wicked would be destroyed. Bro. Cottrell buried his wife not long since, who, it is said, was one of the excellent of the earth. Not long since, this aged pilgrim received a letter from friends in Wisconsin, purporting to be from M. Cottrell, his wife, who sleeps in Jesus. But he, believing that the dead know not anything, was prepared to reject at once the heresy that the spirits of the dead, knowing everything, come back and converse with the living. Thus truth is a staff in his old age. He has three sons in Mill Grove, who, with their families are Sabbath-keepers.\\" White, James (1853).

Cottrell closed his business on the Sabbath in the early days of his business. Calvert B. Cottrell established a printing press manufacturing plant in Westerly. He practiced the Seventh Day Baptist faith and never operated on Saturdays in those early years.Later, those who operated the business observed Sunday rather than the Seventh-day. The branch of the Cottrell family living in Westerly, Rhode Island, have been observers of the Seventh-day Sabbath for more than three centuries.Cottrell, Roy F. A Brief Sketch of Cottrell Family History Brookfield and Mill Grove, New York John Cottrell and family moved to New York and lived for many years in Brookfield. In 1833 he moved his family again. This time they settled at the hamlet of Mill Grove, some twenty miles east of Buffalo. Erie Canal Tow Path at Utica north of Brookfield. Roswell, at 19 years of age, accompanied his parents to Mill Grove. They travelled much of the way on the then newly constructed Erie Canal. Roswell helped drive the team of horses along the towpath. At Mill Grove, Roswell married Catherine Harvey. He taught in the public schools for ten years. Soon after arriving at Mill Grove, he was one of those who witnessed the notable meteoric shower of November 13, 1833. With his father and other members of the family, Roswell was deeply interested in the message of William Miller, but did not identify himself with it, believing that when God would herald His second coming, the messengers would be observers of the seventh-day Sabbath. John Cottrell spent the remainder of his life at Mill Grove. In 1851, one year before his death, he became a Seventh-day Adventist.http://mytreewebsite.com/cccottrell/cottrellbooklet-13.html A Brief Sketch of Cottrell Family History, p. 13 At the time of this document, the author Roy F. Cottrell had in his possession the personal account book of John Cottrell, giving the record of his dealings from 1809 to 1831. Among hundreds of other items John Cottrell wrote how he made chairs for fifty cents, and \\"one little coffin is listed at seventy-five cents. He evidently possessed a keen sense of humor, for under the date of March 15, 1837, is the entry; \\"Mrs. Poley Cotterell baked one Indian shortcake and did not burn it.\\" Joins with Sabbatarian Adventists In 1851, the Roswell Cottrell family became Seventh- Day Adventists.Cottrell describes those early days in a letter sent to the Review. It was published November 25, 1851 at page 6: DEAR Bro. WHITE : There is a little company in this place who are trying to follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth.

My early education was such, that I have believed in the personal appearing of Christ, according to the Scriptures, from my youth. In 1843 and 1844, I heard the solemn cry, \\"The hour of his judgment is come,\\" and though I felt no disposition to oppose it, and thought I loved his righteous appearing, yet I was not disappointed when the time passed by. I saw the proclaimers of the Advent in darkness in regard to the commandments of God, and bowing to an institution of Papacy; and perhaps this was the reason I did not believe. But since, I have heard the message of the third angel, which was since the commencement of the Review and Herald, I have reviewed carefully the whole movement, and the solemn inquiry in my mind has been. Was it from Heaven or of men? After some nine months careful and cautious examination. I have just arrived at the decision. I believe with all my heart, it was from Heaven. I cannot believe that God would suffer Satan to get up so exact a fulfillment of the prophecies to deceive the lovers of Jesus Christ‚Äîthose who wait, and look for his appearing. If any one inquire how I can believe all this, since Christ did not appear according to the expectation of his children, I answer: We are instructed [Rev. xiv,] that an angel should fly through the midst of heaven, saying, \\"Fear God, for the hour of his judgment is come,\\" and yet there is time for two other messages to follow in succession, before the Son of man is seen on the white cloud. I greatly rejoice that when the temple of God was opened in heaven, his children on earth saw, by faith, the ark of his testament. Yours in the blessed hope, ROSWELL F. COTTRELL. Mill Grove, N.Y., Oct. 19, 1851 Soon after accepting the message of Christ's imminent return, he entered the gospel ministry, devoting his full-time to preaching and writing, and for a time serving as president of the New York Conference. For 41 years up to the time of his death in 1892, R. F. Cottrell supported the Seventh-day Adventist denomination. =Earliest Known Published Sermon by a Sabbatarian Adventist= The May 14, 1857, issue of the Review and Herald contains the earliest extant record of a sabbatarian Adventist sermon. Roswell F. Cottrell preached it to the Seneca Indians. This is also the earliest record of a Sabbath-keeping Adventists sharing his faith with members of an American Indian tribe. On February 2, 1857, R. F. Cottrell reported to the Review and Herald that he and William Ingraham had visited the Seneca Indian Reservation on Tonawanda Creek, located about 10 miles from Cottrell's home. Both Cottrell and Ingraham preached, through an interpreter, at the reservation's small Baptist church of fifty members. In the June 10, 1858 Review and Herald, a second sermon by Cottrell entitled \\"A Discourse Written for the Seneca Indians, to be delivered through an Interpreter, No. 2\\" was published. In reporting on the meetings, Elder Cottrell wrote: > \\"We gave two lectures through an interpreter in their chapel. They > manifested much interest. Their elder and deacon, and those among them who > can read English seemed anxious to read, and we distributed some of our > tracts among them gratuitously. Some said they believed from the signs that > the coming of the Lord was near.\\" [Review and Herald, February 12, 1857, p. > 117] =The Review and Herald and Other Church Journals= After the office of the Review and Herald was moved to Battle Creek, Michigan, in 1855, he served for a time as a member of the paper's editorial committee along with J. N. Andrews and Uriah Smith.Loughborough (1892), p. 196 From that year onward, Cottrell was a regular contributor to the Review.Loughborough, J. N. (1909) The Great Second Advent Movement He wrote close to 1700 articles for church papers over a period of 40 years. The Review and Herald grew considerably over its first two decades of operation. In the Review of Nov. 25, 1873, it was reported that the net earnings of the office for several months had been about $1000 per month. This made it possible to purchase another press, a Cottrell The Cottrell Printer manufacturing plant was located in Westerly, R.I. In the early days of the business C. B. Cottrell, a Seventh Day Baptist, would close his business every Sabbath and Babcock cylinder ‚Äî weighing 14,675 lbs., at a cost of $3400.Loughborough (1892), p. 295 The Youth Instructor James White asked Cottrell to develop and present a series of youth Sabbath School lessons. These were published in the Youth's Instructor in 1854 and 1855. =As an Evangelist= Early Adventist evangelists used tents to conduct their meetings. For example, during the summer of 1856 tents were used in Wisconsin, Michigan, New England, and in the State of New York. In New York, Cottrell's home state, he and evangelist Ingraham assisted Loughborough in such tent meetings. These tent meetings brought considerable success with new people joining the movement. In the States of New York and Pennsylvania, there was not much money available. During haying and harvesting time, Loughborough's team worked in the fields four and one half days each week. Their evangelistic pay amounted to two dollars per weekend. They conducted meetings on both Sabbath and Sunday. Including what they had earned in farm labor, Ingraham and Loughborough earned four dollars per week. Cottrell was paid three dollars per week for acting as tent-master and speaking occasionally.Loughborough, J. N. (1892) Rise and Progress of the Seventh-day Adventists, p. 208 =Cottrell and Adventist Colleagues= Rhodes :Cottrell became an Adventist as a result of Rhodes' evangelistic efforts. Loughborough :During the later 1850s Cottrell worked with Loughborough in New York evangelistic campaigns.Loughborough (1892), p. 190 James White :James White appreciated Cottrell's ability to explain things clearly. This is especially evident in his comments about Cottrell's help in writing a series of Sabbath School lessons for the Youth's Instructor in 1854 and 1855.Youth's Instructor Citation here But White and Cottrell did not always see matters the same way. They disagreed regarding church organization and the holding of property insurance. James White requested that those who disagreed with a proposed plan, provide a clearly stated alternate plan. Roswell Cottrell spoke from specific principles which James White challenged. White wanted clear Bible statements for guidance.Review and Herald, April 26, 1860 He challenged Cottrell to give as much Biblical support for his ideas on church organization as he had done for his powerful Sabbath essays. The public nature of the dispute between these two leaders provides a window into how disputes came to be resolved; i.e. through frank examination of assumptions. :The dispute, though public, remained civilized. Both men kept the bigger picture of church advancement in their focus.Review and Herald. June 5, 1860 These disagreements, for James White, seemed to be a source of stress and worry. Ellen White :Cottrell witnessed Ellen White's visionary ministry regarding the \\"Messenger Party\\". The disruptive activities of this group concerned Loughborough and others. They weren't sure what to do. Any confrontation seemed to make the situation worse. On the evening of June 20, 1855, James and Ellen White, Cottrell, and Loughborough met for a prayer meeting at a church member's home. At this meeting Ellen White had a vision. Afterwards, she related that the Adventist workers should preach the truth as they knew it and not confront the opposing group. This would result in their opponents turning against themselves. Her counsel proved correct and the Adventist movement continued to grow.Loughborough (1892), pp. 190, 191 John Nevins Andrews :Andrews and Cottrell shared similarly views regarding church organization. They believed that the Christian Church should use the early church record to define their efforts to organize the church. They understood this to put most of the responsibility on the local church for ownership and administration of Gospel work. Uriah Smith :Cottrell, Uriah Smith and J.N. Andrews comprised the Review and Herald's publishing committee in the mid-1850s.Loughborough (1892) p. 196 By 1860, Smith served as resident editor at Battle Creek, Michigan, while others, such as Cottrell, wrote to Smith and reported on their experiences. Dudley M. Canright :In 1858, Cottrell lived in Ridgeway, New York. Dudley Canright, as a young man, came to Cottrell's home. As they associated together there on the Cottrell farm, planting corn together and sharing the responsibilities of the farm, Canright accepted the Adventist message. Cottrell baptized him. Canright later came back as a church worker and reported his fond memories of those earlier days.Canright, D. M. New York: Ridgeway and Lancaster. Review and Herald, May 17, 1877, p. 3 =At the Time of His Death= Cottrell died at 78 year of age in 1892. S. H. Lane reported that the entire denomination had become familiar with his initials \\"R. F. C.\\" and that his poetry has been read and sung with delight everywhere. According to Lane, Cottrell was a 'superlative' writer. Right up to the time, Cottrell studied his bible and wrote both prose and poetry. The last night of his life, with a pencil and tablet, he wrote nearly all night and up to the time he died. At the time of his funeral, neighbors and friends, Adventists and otherwise, remembered him as a true Christian; a person true to his faith and to his church.Death of Elder R. F. Cottrell. Review and Herald, April 19, 1892, p. 13A Brief Sketch of Cottrell Family History =Spicer Looks Back= Elder William A. Spicer, writing in the \\"Review & Herald\\" of 1951, paid this tribute to the memory of \\"our pioneer, Eld. Cottrell: :\\"He had been a tireless evangelist. He had served a period as president of the N.Y. Conference. He endeared himself to us young people at the old headquarters in Michigan as chaplain of the Battle Creek Sanitarium. He gave us hymns we loved to sing. The first hymn our missionaries translated for China's non-Christian people was Elder Cottrell's hymn of creation; \\"The God that made the earth, and all the worlds on high.\\" Spicer, W. A. R. F. Cottrell's First Report a Century Ago. Review and Herald, October 25, 1951, pp. 12,13 Theology =Doctrine of God= :The Trinity :Many early sabbatarian Adventists did not believe in the trinitarian concept as taught by mainline churches. Roswell Cottrell seems to have been okay with the trinitarian idea but was ambivalent about it. =Doctrine of Man= :Non-immortality of the Soul :Roswell Cottrell and his father did not agree with their Seventh-day Baptist associates on the immortality of the soul. =The Doctrine of Salvation= :Cottrell's poetry reveals his concepts of salvation: :The Wonders of Redeeming Love :The wonders of redeeming love :Our highest thoughts exceed; :The Son of God comes from above :For sinful man to bleed. :He gives Himself, His life, His all, :A sinless sacrifice, :For man He drains the cup of gall, :For man the Victim dies. :And now before His Father's face :His precious blood He pleads; :For those who seek :the throne of grace, :His love still intercedes. :He knows the frailties of our frame, :For He has borne our grief; :Our great High Priest :once felt the same, :And He can send relief. :His love will not be satisfied, :Till He in glory sees :The faithful ones for whom He died :From sin forever free.The Wonders of Redeeming Love =The Doctrine of the Church= :Church Organization :Although R. F. Cottrell did not favor any formal organization of the denomination when such was first discussed in 1860, in the end he accepted it. Throughout the remainder of his life he was an active worker for the church mostly in the states of New York and Pennsylvania. :Authority of Local Church Leaders :Seventh Day Baptists tend to be congregationalists. As a former Seventh Day Baptist, Cottrell believed that the traveling leaders should enable the congregation's leadership to serve their local group in most matters of church governance. This included ordaining officers, administering the ordinances of the Lord's Supper, baptizing new believers, receiving them into membership and being a pillar and support of the truth.In 1856, Cottrell wrote: \\"I believe that each church should have the power and means within itself to walk in all the ordinances of the house of God, and to admit others who may be brought into the truth to all the privileges of membership with them. A traveling elder or evangelist is not always at hand to administer in those duties that frequently devolve upon a church. A Timothy or a Titus whose duty it is to travel from place to place and 'ordain elders in every city,' cannot be expected to be present to administer the ordinances in every church on every occasion; but when he has performed his duty--has 'set in order' the church by ordaining proper officers, they should be prepared to keep the faith of Jesus, to celebrate his death, to shine as the light of the world, and thus bring others into the fold of Christ, to administer baptism, receive to membership, and be the pillar and support of the truth; while those who labor in the field are going into new places to raise the standard of truth, gathering churches, and setting them in order.\\" R. F. Cottrell, \\"What Are the Duties of Church Officers?\\" RH, Oct 2, 1856, p. 5. =The Doctrine of the Christian Life= :The Sanctuary in Heaven Reveals God's Law :Of the centrality of the sanctuary in Sabbatarian belief, Roswell F Cottrell wrote in 1863: \\"We find, not only that the sanctuary is the grand centre of the Christian system, as the earthly was of the typical, but that this subject is the centre and citadel of present truth. And since our temple is in heaven, and in that temple, 'the ark of the testament.' containing 'the commandments of God,' and in the midst of these commandments, the Sabbath of the Lord, fenced around by nine moral precepts that can- not be overthrown, it is no wonder that the enemies of the Sabbath should, not only strive to abolish the Ten Commandments, but to abolish the true sanctuary in which they are deposited.\\" Knight, George R. The Pillar Doctrines. Australasian Record, July 31, 1993, p. 6 :Should Christians Fight :In 1865, Cottrell wrote a series of three articles for the Review and Herald in which he gives reasons why Christians should not fight.Should Christians Fight :Should Christians Vote :Cottrell opposed voting because the United States was prophesied to make an image to the beast.Review and Herald, October 30, 1856 :Health Reform :Cottrell took the Adventist principles of health reform seriously. He tried them himself and then advocated them to others.For a selection of his health- related essays, see the Adventist History Library. :Property and Life Insurance :Cottrell took a strong stand against Christians depending on insurance. James White, as editor and leader of the sabbatarian Adventists, encouraged the publishing of the various views on the subject. As people presented their Biblical reasons, their motto was \\"Truth shall stand.\\" :Disagreeing as Christians :Cottrell joined the sabbatarian Adventists as a strong-minded independent Christian. His family took a stand for the non- immortality of the soul with their Seventh Day Baptist associates. In the development of the sabbatarian Adventists, differences arose regarding legal organization and the holding of property. Cottrell differed with James White on some key points. His June 5 letter in the Review and Herald illustrates his leadership model. He begins his letter, \\"I did not wish to throw any obstacles in the way of the advancement of the truth in saying what I did in regard to a name, insurance, &c.; I should be very sorry to wound the cause I love.\\" He held strong views but did not want those views to interfere with the bigger picture. He expressed a humble, conciliatory approach by using phrases such as, \\"Perhaps I have had an undue prejudice...\\", \\"I may be wrong in this. If so, I do not want my opinions to be in the way of any...\\", \\"Perhaps this is error...\\", and \\"If I have spoken wrong, I hope that the right will prevail...\\" Cottrell considered it his duty to speak on matters, giving biblical reasons for his views. It was his duty to do so. Afterwards, he could write, \\"Having done my duty, I submit to the judgment of the church. My prayer is that the Lord will give his servants wisdom; and I believe he will. =The Doctrine of Last Things= :The Three Angels Messages Fulfilled Chronogically :Early sabbatarian Adventists, including R. F. Cottrell, taught that the messages of the three angels of Revelation 14 came one after the other chronologically. Cottrell wrote, \\"Do you say you do not believe that the second and third messages have been announced ? It is a historical fact that they have. How came you to believe that Persia, Greece and Rome were the kingdoms that were to succeed Babylon, the first of the series in Daniel's prophecy? It is simply because they came as predicted. Well, that is the way to believe the prophecy of the three messages...\\" Cottrell, R. F. (1864). Adventism. Letter to J. Croffut. Review and Herald, February 2, 1864, p. 5 :Sunday-keeping and the Mark of the Beast :Cottrell was one of the first Adventists to link Sunday- keeping and the Mark of the Beast.Froom, Leroy Edwin (1954). The Prophetic Faith of Our Fathers: The Historical Development of Prophetic Interpretation. Vol. 4. Washington D.C. Review and Herald Publishing Association, p. 1084. :The gift of prophecy expected in the last days. :Cottrell taught that God will provide the church with the prophetic gift in the last days. :Literal and Exact :Early Adventists examined carefully the meaning of each word in a prophecy. Then they applied their logical skills to derive their conclusions. The prophecy for the last days mentions every freeman and every bondman. From this Cottrell, and others, concluded that slavery would exist up to the end of time. To fight against slavery was to fight against the inevitable fulfillment of prophecy. Poet and Hymn Writer Elder Cottrell wrote a number of poems through the years that were published in the Review and Herald. In addition, he wrote several hymns, two of which are included in the current Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal. His poetry is playful and thought-provoking. Titles for Cottrell's poems Adventist History Library. Cottrell, Roswell F. Poetry :1. As drowsy earth is dreaming still :2. As time rolls on amid earth's gloom :3. Behold God's own exalted Son :4. Blessed are they henceforth that die :5. By living faith we now can see :6. Cheer up, ye soldiers of the cross :7. Delightful day, best gift of heaven :8. Erected high in heaven stands :9.

He graduated from Mount Vernon Academy in Ohio and Pacific Union College in California. After a period of service as pastor-evangelist, he became Bible teacher at the South Lancaster Academy. In 1908, he and his wife Myrtie accepted a call to mission service in China, where they worked for twelve years to 1920. While in China, he travelled extensively. He baptized hundreds of native converts, and wrote numerous tracts and booklets in the Mandarin language. He prepared the first subscription book, HERALDS OF THE KING, used by Seventh-day Adventist colporters in China. Since 1920, Roy lived in southern California where he worked as a pastor in Glendale, Santa Monica, Long Beach, Huntington Park and Los Angeles. He wrote for various religious journals, prepared eight series of international senior Sabbath School lessons, and for a considerable time conducted a weekly column entitled \\"The Newspaper Pulpit\\" which appeared in the three leading metropolitan papers of Los Angeles. He authored twenty-five books and booklets, ten in the Chinese language and fifteen in English. He retired from active pastoral service in 1950 and lived in Escondido, California. Roy Franklin Cottrell died in 1970.http://mytreewebsite.com/cccottrell/cottrellbooklet-17.html =1912-2003 Raymond Forrest Cottrell= Raymond Cottrell, the great-grandson of Roswell Fenner Cottrell and nephew of Roy Franklin Cottrell, was born in Glendale, Calif., in 1912. He is a graduate of La Sierra Academy and received his B.A, and :M.A, degrees from Pacific Union College. After his marriage to Elizabeth Landis of Phoenix, Ariz., and a period of service as teacher, evangelist and pastor, he was called to mission endeavor in Manchuria, China, where he labored for seven years. Returning to America, he taught in the Bible departments of Lodi Academy, Pacific Union Academy and Pacific Union College. In 1952, Mr. Cottrell accented the invitation to connect with the Review and Herald Publishing Association as Associate Editor in the production of the seven-volume Seventh-Day Adventist Bible Commentary, On completion of that monumental project, he became Associate Editor of the \\"Review & Herald'.

Steg was developed by Big Red Software and published by Codemasters in 1992 on a number of 8-bit and 16-bit computers. Players control the titular slug who must traverse caverns in order to capture maggots in bubbles, then guide them to his starving young who wait in a nest. Gameplay Players control the titular slug and are tasked with feeding his young, referred to as \\"T'yungunz\\" (the young 'uns). Steg's offspring occupy a nest at the top of a cavern, and must be fed with maggots. If the slugs are not fed in time, they die and are replaced by tombstones. Once all the young slugs are fed, Steg proceeds to the next cavern where another nest of young wait to be fed. Maggots roam the game's caverns and must be captured in the bubbles which Steg can blow in order to transport them. In order to blow bubbles the player must press and hold the fire button, which fills a meter. Once the meter is full, Steg blows a bubble when the fire button is released. Above the bubble blowing meter on the game screen is an energy bar which drains once the bubble meter is filled. Steg must hold his breath until the maggot is close enough to capture. Once encapsulated, the maggot can be blown to the nest by Steg, which involves avoiding hazards which can burst the bubble or harm Steg. Other objects such as trampolines can aid the player in jumping higher. Steg is invulnerable to damage but can suffocate if his breath is held for too long. To traverse levels he is able to jump and adhere to walls and ceilings, crawling up and down to visit the nest and locate maggots. Power-ups are available during play, including a set of robotic legs, a jet pack and boosts to Steg's speed and energy bar.

As of 2000, Black Oak had a population of 4,216, which was 84.7% white. It is Gary's only majority-white neighborhood, and the most recent neighborhood added to the city. Black Oak was annexed in 1976, under the administration of mayor Richard Hatcher. Prior to that, Black Oak had been an unincorporated area informally associated with nearby Hammond, and the area has Hammond telephone numbers. Located in Gary's southwest corner, Black Oak adjoins the town of Griffith and unincorporated Calumet Township; within Gary, neighboring neighborhoods include Glen Park to the east and Tolleston and Westside to the north. The neighborhood's northern boundary is formed by 25th Avenue, just north of the Borman Expressway; its eastern boundary is formed by Grant Street. Most of the neighborhood lies within the floodplain of the Little Calumet River. Because of its former status as an unincorporated region of the county, Black Oak is served by the Lake Ridge Schools Corporation, which also covers Calumet Township, rather than the Gary Community School Corporation. Similarly, it is the only neighborhood in Gary served by a branch of the Lake County Public Library rather than the Gary Public Library. Private schools in Black Oak include Gary Academy and the Black Oak School for the Deaf, both of which are K-12 schools. The housing stock in Black Oak is dominated by single-family and mobile homes. As of 2000, occupancy was 88%, and owner-occupancy was 70%. Black Oak is the only neighborhood in Gary where mobile homes make up a significant fraction of total housing. Thanks to its late date of annexation, it is also the only neighborhood where most development predates the neighborhood's becoming part of Gary. Poverty levels in Black Oak are similar to Gary as a whole; a 2005 study found that Black Oak residents faced obstacles to purchasing healthy and inexpensive food that were similar to those facing other Gary residents. Commercial development in Black Oak is concentrated at the neighborhood's eastern boundary along Grant Street, location of Gary's largest retail complex, the Village Shopping Center. Black Oak has numerous expanses of wetland and undeveloped floodplain land near the Little Calumet River. It is the site of Lake Etta County Park, the only county park located entirely within Gary; in addition, a bike trail runs along the south bank of the Little Calumet. However, environmental degradation is a serious problem, with frequent illegal dumping. The neighborhood includes Lake Sandy Jo, a Superfund site used as a toxic waste dump from 1967 to 1975, when it was closed by court order. Lake Sandy Jo was fenced off in 1986, and remediation by the EPA was completed in 1994.

From 1999 to 2009, he was intendente (mayor) of Mor√≥n, a partido in the Greater Buenos Aires metropolitan area. He was also a member of the Argentine Chamber of Deputies from 2009 to 2013, and director of the Federal Authority for Audiovisual Communication Services from 2012 to 2015. Since 2020, Sabbatella has been the chairman of the Matanza‚ÄìRiachuelo Basin Authority (ACUMAR). Early life and career Sabbatella was born in the western Buenos Aires suburb of Mor√≥n in 1970. He enrolled at the Manuel Dorrego National Middle School, where he became active in the Communist Party of Argentina. He served as Secretary of the center-left Frepaso caucus in the Mor√≥n City Council from 1995, and in 1997, was elected to the body on the Alliance ticket recently formed with the centrist Radical Civic Union (UCR). He married a psychologist, M√≥nica Macha, and they had one daughter. Mayor of Mor√≥n An institutional crisis developed in the city government when, in December 1998, Mayor Juan Carlos Rousselot was suspended amid corruption charges. Sabbatella was named to head the committee investigating Rousselot, and the latter was impeached. He was nominated as the Alliance candidate for mayor, and in elections the following October, was elected to the office. The youngest mayor in the city's history, Sabbatella created a civilian review board and Discrecionalidad Zero (\\"Zero Tolerance\\"), an anti-corruption office, during his first year. He signed an agreement to the effect with Transparency International whereby the Berlin-based corruption monitoring group would review all city contracts, as well as the personal financial disclosure forms of its elected officials. A fiscal conservative, he trimmed the municipal workforce by 1,000 (23%) and reduced the city's debt by over 20%; his rescission of the waste collection service subcontracted during the Rousselot tenure alone saved the city nearly us$6 million annually. The December 2001 resignation of President Fernando de la R√∫a, who had been elected in 1999 on the Alliance ticket, dissolved the latter party, and in 2002, Sabbatella formed the Nuevo Mor√≥n (\\"New Mor√≥n\\") party. His efforts against municipal and subcontractor corruption were featured in a July 1, 2003, story in the Wall Street Journal. Running for reelection that year, he refused to join a larger Party list, and instead urged voters to \\"cut the ballot.\\" Adopting school scissors as a campaign symbol, Sabbatella supported Justicialist Party candidates for Governor and the Provincial Legislature, while only fielding candidates for City Council and School District elections. The strategy succeeded, and both Sabbatella and the candidate he supported for Governor (the incumbent, Felipe Sol√°) won in Mor√≥n as well as in the province as a whole. Sabbatella launched a new alliance, Encuentro por la Democracia y la Equidad (\\"Encounter for Democracy and Equality\\"), in 2004, and his candidates won 9 of 12 seats contested in the 2005 City Council elections. He was named Executive Secretary of Mercociudades, a conference of 160 cities in the Mercosur trade bloc, for a two-year term in November 2006, and in 2007 served as coordinator of Mercosur's Municipal Advisory Forum. Reelected as Mayor in 2007, he earned a Konex Award in 2008 for his work in public administration, He later reaped controversy, however, by signing a municipal ordinance in February 2009 that would donate stray animals to laboratories for animal testing. Congressional term and AFSCA Sabbatella ran for a seat in the Argentine Chamber of Deputies in 2009, merging his Encounter ticket with the leftist Free of the South Movement, the Communist Party, and others into a Nuevo Encuentro (\\"New Encounter\\"). Garnering fourth place in the province, the party nevertheless elected two members to Congress: Sabbatella and Graciela Iturraspe (Mar del Plata). He expressed support for President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner ahead of the 2011 general elections. He ran for Governor of Buenos Aires on his New Encounter ticket later in the year, and obtained fourth place (6.4%). He remained as head of the New Encounter caucus in the Lower House. Sabbatella was appointed director of the Federal Authority on Audiovisual Communication Services (AFSCA) on October 1, 2012, at the height of ongoing controversies between Clar√≠n and Kirchnerism over a 2009 anti-trust law that would limit the number of radio and television licenses held by the Clar√≠n Group (the premier media conglomerate in Argentina).

Political map of Africa. Coronations in Africa are held, or have been held, in or amongst the following countries, regions and peoples:  By country, region or people  = Ashanti = The Asantehene, the ruler of the Ashanti of Ghana begins his reign by being raised and lowered over the Golden Stool (sika 'dwa), which is believed to embody the very soul of the Ashanti people, without touching it. The Golden Stool is the most sacred ritual object in Ashanti culture and only the Asantehene is allowed to touch it. = Central African Empire = The Central African Empire was a short- lived monarchical regime established in 1976 in what was then the Central African Republic, by Jean-B√©del Bokassa, the nation's president. Inspired by Napoleon's coronation in 1804, \\"Bokassa I\\" staged his own elaborate ritual inside a large outdoor stadium in Bangui, his capital, on 4 December 1977. While guests sweltered in the 100-degree heat, the self-proclaimed emperor ascended a giant golden throne shaped like an eagle with outstretched wings, donned a 32-pound coronation robe containing 785,000 pearls and 1,220,000 crystal beads, and then crowned himself with a gold crown topped by a 138-carat diamond that cost over $2,000,000 to manufacture. His empress, Catherine‚Äîthe youngest of his three wives‚Äîwas then invested with a smaller diadem. The total bill for Bokassa's regalia alone came to $5,000,000. 240 tons of food and drink were flown into Bangui for Bokassa's coronation banquet, including a tureen of caviar so large that two chefs had to carry it, and a seven-layer cake. Sixty new Mercedes-Benz limousines were airlifted into the capital, at a hefty cost of $300,000 for airfreight alone. All in all, the entire ceremony cost $20,000,000 to stage, an astronomical sum in a nation whose annual gross domestic product was only $250,000,000. The newly crowned Emperor used French aid grants to cover a significant portion of the bill, saying: \\"Everything here was financed by the French government. We ask the French for money, get it and waste it\\". In 1979, Bokassa was overthrown in a coup, carried out with French military support, by the very man he had overthrown in 1965, David Dacko. The monarchy was abolished, the emperor was exiled, and his empire reverted to its former name. = Egypt = The Kingdom of Egypt (1922‚Äì53) held an enthronement rite for its last ruling king, Farouk I. A controversy arose as to whether the ritual should be religious in nature, an option favored by the king, or whether it should be purely secular, which was desired by Farouk's Prime Minister at the time, Mustafa El-Nahhas. The religious ceremony envisaged the new king taking special vows in an Islamic ritual, followed by his receipt of the sword of Muhammad Ali Pasha. However, El-Nahhas insisted upon Farouk simply taking a constitutional oath before parliament, followed by a formal reception at his palace. The Prince Regent proposed combining the two ideas, but the government refused. The ceremony, which took place on 29 July 1937, followed the Prime Minister's directives. The Egyptian army swore loyalty to the new monarch, who then entered the Parliament chamber where he first greeted his mother, then listened to two speeches given by the Prime Minister and the speaker of the Upper House.A photo of King Farouk taken during this ceremony can be seen at \\"What European papers said \\"; Al Ahram Weekly Website Following this, the king took his constitutional oath, and was acclaimed by the assembled legislators and guests. Farouk was overthrown in the Egyptian Revolution of 1952. His son, Fuad II, was deposed in 1953 while still an infant, and the monarchy abolished. Egypt is now a republic. = Ethiopia = The Ethiopian Empire used a coronation ritual for its Emperors. The last such event was held on 2 November 1930, for Emperor Haile Selassie, the final monarch of Ethiopia. Heavily influenced by Ethiopia's Oriental Orthodox Christian tradition, preparation for the coronation ceremony commenced seven days prior to the actual event. Following an ancient Ethiopian custom, forty-nine bishops and priests continually chanted from the Psalter in groups of seven, in seven corners of the St. George's Cathedral, in Addis Ababa, where the crowning was to take place. On the eve of the ceremony, the imperial robes and regalia were taken into the church to be blessed and prayed over by the Abuna, or Archbishop, followed by the new Emperor and his family, who arrived at midnight and remained inside the cathedral that night in prayer.Background information on the coronation may be found at the rastaites.com website, Coronation of HIM Haile Selassie I . Retrieved on 24 August 2008. The following morning, the Emperor was met inside the cathedral by the Archbishop, who presented him with a Gospel Book and asked him to take a four-part coronation oath. This oath required him to defend the Ethiopian Orthodox Faith, rule according to law and the interest of his subjects, safeguard the realm and establish schools for teaching of both secular and Orthodox religious subjects. After this, the Abuna read a special prayer of blessing, while drums and harps accompanied the chanting of Psalm 48. Various items of the Imperial Regalia were brought forward, blessed and presented to the new sovereign one-by-one. These items included a golden sword, a scepter of ivory and gold, the orb, a diamond-encrusted ring, two traditional lances filigreed in gold, the imperial vestments, and finally the crown. Each item was accompanied by an anointing with seven differently-scented oils. After this, the new monarch and his consort were taken on a tour of the church, then escorted outside by a procession of notables carrying palm branches and chanting: \\"Blessed be the King of Israel\\". Ethiopian tradition required the Emperor's consort to be crowned at the palace, three days after the coronation. However, Haile Selassie broke with this precedent, and had his wife crowned (but not anointed) in the cathedral with him. Selassie was overthrown by a communist military coup in 1974, and the monarchy was abolished in 1975. = Lesotho = The tiny African kingdom of Lesotho crowns its monarchs. The last such ritual was held on 31 October 1997, when current king Letsie III was crowned in a sports stadium in the capital city of Maseru. King Letsie entered the stadium escorted by units of mounted police clad in red uniforms and carrying sabers and lances. Donning a traditional coat of animal skins, the new ruler was crowned by two chieftains with a beaded headband containing a brown and white feather. Traditional dances and songs followed. = Senegambia & Mauritania = The Serer people of Senegambia (Senegal and Gambia) and Mauritania crown their kings based on the tenets of Serer religion. Succession for kingship begins from the moment a prince is born. The parents must lodge their application to the Great Council of Nobles, headed by the Jaraff (the person responsible for electing the king from the royal family). The sacred ceremony is presided over by the Jaraff. After the coronation, the Maad a Sinig or Maad Saloum makes a royal proclamation, crowns his own mother or sister as Lingeer, then appoints his government. Sarr, Alioune, \\"Histoire du Sine-Saloum\\", Introduction, bibliographie et Notes par Charles Becker, BIFAN, Tome 46, Serie B, n¬∞ 3-4, 1986‚Äì1987, pp 28-30 = Eswatini = Eswatini, a small independent kingdom in southern Africa, held a coronation ritual in April 1986 for its current monarch, Mswati III. Although Swazi tradition required the king to wait until his twenty-first year to be crowned, Mswati was crowned three years early due to disputes between different factions in the regency council. Swazi chiefs paid a tribute of 105 cattle to the family of Mswati's mother, Ntombi, as a dowry for the woman who was to become the new \\"Mother of the Nation\\". The rite itself included various secret rituals, after which the new king took part in several ritual dances in full feathered regalia. At the coronation, tribal singers repeated his imposing chain of official titles, which include \\"the Bull\\", \\"Guardian of the Sacred Shields\\", \\"the Inexplicable\\" and \\"the Great Mountain\\". The dances were described by William Smith of Time as \\"exhausting\\". = Toro Kingdom = The Toro Kingdom‚Äîlocated in modern Uganda‚Äîcrowned its current ruler, Rukidi IV, on 12 September 1995. Rukidi was the world's youngest monarch at the time, being only three years old. The boy was awakened at 2AM, then led to the palace where the rites would take place. At the entrance, Rukidi and his entourage engaged in a mock battle with a \\"rebel\\" prince, then entered to the accompaniment of the Omujaguza, the traditional Toro war-drum.The Boy King . From the safariweb.com website. Contains photos from the ceremony. Retrieved on 8 September 2008. Once inside, Rukidi was led to the regalia room, where the Omusuga, or head of royal rituals, called upon the gods to strike the boy dead if he was not of royal blood. Once the Omusuga was satisfied as to the new king's lineage, Rukidi was permitted to ring the royal bell, then he sounded the Nyalebe or sacred drum, following which he was blessed with blood from a slaughtered bull and a white hen. As morning broke, women (who had been barred from the ritual up to this time) were admitted to the palace. The king was seated upon the lap of a virgin girl, and was fed with a royal meal of millet dough. A coronation oath was administered with the boy lying on his side, in accordance with Toro tradition. At 10AM, the king, wearing a jewel- studded crown, was led to St. John's Anglican Cathedral where he was crowned by Anglican Bishop Eustance Kamanyire. Rukidi was given a Bible by the local Roman Catholic prelate, then returned to his palace where he was presented with a centuries-old copper spear and leather shield. Following this the king led a procession of Toro notables to inspect the royal corral, then concluded his coronation by greeting his subjects from a traditional shed. = Yorubaland (Benin, Nigeria & Togo) = A coronation is known as √åw√∫y√®, meaning the action of bestowing a chieftancy title. Relative rank amongst the dynastic paramount chieftains of the Yoruba people of Benin, Nigeria and Togo is determined by the answering of three questions: Is a chief a direct descendant of the medieval emperor Oduduwa, is he entitled to wear a ceremonial crown, and how long has said crown been in his family? If a chieftain's earliest pioneering ancestor left the emperor's kingdom of Ile-Ife with the crown that is now used to crown him in his own kingdom during his coronation ceremony, and if he claims direct descent from Oduduwa himself, then he is traditionally viewed by the Yoruba as a king of the highest possible rank (with him being surpassed in such a case by only the pre-eminent Yoruba monarchs, such as the Ooni of contemporary Ile-Ife and the Alaafin of Oyo). Pre-coronation rites that are common amongst the Yoruba include an election to the office of king by the nobles of the realm, confirmation of said election by the Ifa oracle, going into the Ipebi ritual confinement (during which a would be king learns the various traditions of his people) and swearing to a series of oaths tied to the kingship. Only after all of the foregoing has occurred is the king installed according to local custom (In Egbaland, for example, the crown is placed upon the king's head by a chieftess known as the Moshade, who is subsequently regarded as his ritual mother because she did so).

Historical ceremonies of introducing a new monarch by a ceremony of coronation can be traced to classical antiquity, and further to the Ancient Near East (especially the \\"Crowns of Egypt\\").  Ancient Egypt  Pharaohs of Ancient Egypt were believed to be divine. In the coronation ceremony, the pharaoh was transformed into a god by means of his union with the royal ka, or life-force of the soul. All previous kings of Egypt had possessed this royal ka, and at his or her coronation, the monarch became divine as \\"one with the royal ka when his human form was overtaken by his immortal element, which flows through his whole being and dwells in it\\". This made him the son of Ra, the sun god, Horus, the falcon god, and Osiris, the god of life, death and fertility. From the Middle Kingdom on, the Pharaoh also came to be seen as the son of Amon, the king of Egyptian gods, until his cult faded in later centuries. At his death, the king became fully divine, according to Egyptian belief, being assimilated with Osiris and Ra. Upon the death of the reigning Pharaoh, his successor was named immediately, so that the nation's cosmic protection would continue unbroken. While the new monarch ascended the throne the very next day, the coronation ceremony did not take place until the first day of a new season, thus symbolising the beginning of a new era. The ceremony was usually carried out at Memphis by the high priest, who invested the new king with the necessary powers to continue his predecessors' work. As a permanent reminder to his people of his divine birthright, the Pharaoh wore various elements of royal regalia that varied depending upon the particular period in Egyptian history. Among these were a false beard made from goat's hair, identifying him with the god Osiris; a sceptre shaped like a shepherd's crook known as a Heka, which meant \\"ruler\\" and was often associated with magic; and a fly whip called the Nekhakha, symbol of his power and authority. The new monarch also wore a Shemset apron, while his back was protected by a bull's tail hanging from his belt, symbolic of strength, though this was later done away with. He was invested with a crown during his coronation: depending on the historic period, the king might have been given the White Crown, or Hedjet (the crown of Upper Egypt), the Deshret or Red Crown (diadem of Lower Egypt), the Pschent or Sekhemti (the Double Crown, combining the White and the Red Crowns), the Nemes or striped headcloth, or the Khepresh or Blue Crown. The Pschent was generally used for the highest state occasions, and was conferred on all Pharaohs from at least the First Dynasty on. When the Hedjet was combined with red Ostrich feathers of the Osiris cult, the resulting diadem was referred to as the Atef crown. Hebrew Bible According to the Hebrew Bible, Kings in Biblical Israel were crowned and anointed, most often by (or at the behest of) a prophet or high priest. In I Samuel 10:1, the prophet Samuel anoints Saul to be Israel's first king, though there is no record of his being crowned. However, on Saul's death, a crown that was on his head is presented to David II Samuel 1:10. Later, in I Samuel 16:13, Samuel anoints David to replace him - but again there is no reference to a crown at that point. In II Samuel 12:30, David is crowned with the Ammonite crown, after his conquest of Rabbah, the Ammonite capital. II Kings 9:1-6 tells of the anointing of Jehu as king of Israel. Esther 2:17 relates the crowning of Esther as consort of Ahasuerus, king of Persia.Smith's Bible Dictionary s.v. \\"Crown\\". A detailed account of a coronation in ancient Judah is found in II Kings 11:12 and II Chronicles 23:11, in which the seven-year-old Jehoash is crowned in a coup against the usurper Athaliah. This ceremony took place in the doorway of the Temple in Jerusalem. The king was led to \\"his pillar\\", \\"as the manner was\\", where a crown was placed upon his head, and \\"the testimony\\" given to him, followed by anointing at the hands of the high priest and his sons. Afterwards, the people \\"clapped their hands\\" and shouted \\"God save the King\\" as trumpets blew, music played, and singers offered hymns of praise. All of these elements would find their way in some form or another into future European coronation rituals after the conversion of Europe to Christianity many centuries later, and all Christian coronation rites continue to borrow from these examples. Classical antiquity = Ancient Persia = Double daric of Artaxerxes II, Babylonia, 4th century BC: the Persian king running, holding a bow. Plutarch wrote in his Life of King Artaxerxes that the Persian king was required to go to the ancient capital of Pasargadae for his coronation ceremony. Once there, he entered a temple \\"to a warlike goddess, whom one might liken to Artemis\\" (whose name is unknown today, nor can this temple be located), and there divested himself of his own robe, substituting the one worn by Cyrus I at his crowning. After this, he had to consume a \\"frail\\" of figs, eat turpentine and drink a cup of sour milk. Plutarch observed that \\"if they add any other rites, it is unknown to any but those that are present at them\\". =Classical Greece and Hellenistic era= A Didrachm of Bambyce, dated c. 342-331 BC, with a bust of Atargatis wearing a turreted crown. Antiochus I Soter wearing a diadem. The depiction of crowned heads on the obverse of coins becomes widespread from the 4th century onward. At first, these depict mainly deities, not kings, e.g. the Mother of Gods wearing the turreted crown (Rhea-Kybele is often depicted wearing the \\"turret crown\\", and is also given the title of Mater turrita by Ovid), Athena wearing a crowned helmet, or Zeus wearing a laurel wreath. In the early 3rd century BC, the Seleucid rulers begin to depict their own portraits on their coins, typically wearing a headband or diadem. The Book of Revelation in the New Testament makes extensive use of the crown motif, associating it with shared rulership for the saints in heaven (2:10, 3:11, 4:4) conquering (6:2) and ultimate rulership (14:14, 19:12). This suggests that the association was clearly understood in the Graeco-Roman world. = Roman era = The original status of the Roman emperors was in contrast to the kings of Rome who were expelled in the early years of the city, paving the way for a republic. Therefore, the Emperors were traditionally acclaimed by the Senate or by a legion speaking for the armies as a whole, and were subsequently confirmed without any special ritual. The Eastern diadem was later introduced by Aurelian, but did not truly become part of the imperator's regalia until the reign of Constantine. Prior to this, Roman sovereigns wore the purple paludamentum, and sometimes a laurel wreath as emblems of their office. Aurelian strengthened the position of Sol Invictus, whose corona radiata or \\"radiant crown\\" had become popular in depictions of emperors earlier in the 3rd century (Gordian III) with the development of the imperial cult,.Potter, David S., The Roman Empire at Bay, AD 180‚Äì395, Routledge, 2004, 237-8, citing Zosimus, 1.19.1‚Äì2. Emperor Diocletian (r. 285-305) greatly developed the ceremony surrounding the Roman Emperor; the quasi-republican ideals of Augustus' primus inter pares were abandoned for all but the Tetrarchs themselves. Diocletian took to wearing a gold crown and jewels, and forbade the use of purple cloth to all but the Emperors.Corcoran, Simon. \\"Before Constantine.\\" In The Cambridge Companion to the Age of Constantine, edited by Noel Lenski, 35‚Äì58. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 43. Potter, David S., The Roman Empire at Bay, AD 180‚Äì395, Routledge, 2004, p. 290. Constantine the Great reverted to the diadem (while he still was depicted alongside Sol Invictus, he was no longer shown as Sol Invictus). Following the assumption of the diadem by Constantine, future Roman and Byzantine emperors continued to wear it as the supreme symbol of their authority. Although no specific coronation ceremony was observed at first, one gradually evolved over the next century. The emperor Julian was hoisted upon a shield and crowned with a gold necklace provided by one of his standard-bearers; he later wore a jewel-studded diadem. Future emperors were crowned and acclaimed in a similar manner, until the momentous decision was taken to permit the Patriarch of Constantinople to physically place the crown on the emperor's head. Historians debate exactly when this first took place, but the precedent was clearly established by the reign of Leo II, who was crowned by the Patriarch Acacius in 473. This ritual included recitation of prayers by the Byzantine prelate over the crown, a further‚Äîand extremely vital‚Äîdevelopment in the liturgical ordo of crowning. After this event, according to the Catholic Encyclopedia, \\"the ecclesiastical element in the coronation ceremonial rapidly develop[ed]\\". Transition to the Middle Ages The Byzantine coronation ritual, from at least 795 on, incorporated a partial clothing of the new emperor in various items of special clothing prior to his entrance to the church, following which he entered the cathedral and received the prostrations of the Senators and other patricians. The Patriarch then read a set of lengthy prayers, as the sovereign was invested first with the chlamys and then finally with the crown. Following this, the emperor received Holy Communion followed by further acts of homage.CONSTANTINE VII PORPHYROGENITUS, DE CERIMONIIS AULAE BYZANTINAE, I, 38 (ed. Reiske, I, pp. 191-6; ed. Vogt, II, pp. 1-5, cc. 47-8; ) From the moment of his coronation, Byzantine emperor was regarded as holy; while the Patriarch was holding the crown over the emperor's head, the attending people repeatedly cried: Holy! In later centuries, after receiving their crown from the Patriarch, Byzantine emperors placed it upon their own head, symbolizing that their dominion came directly from God.See also Tacitus, Ann., XV, 29. Anointing was added to the ritual after the eleventh century, with the monarch receiving the Sign of the Cross on their forehead from the Patriarch. The purple chlamys also disappeared from the rite during this time, being replaced with the mandyas, or cope. Childebert III (r.694-711). The Byzantine coronation ceremony begins to influence the Barbarian kingdoms in the West with their Christianization. The Iron Crown of Lombardy is traced in legend to Constantine himself (but more likely dates to the 8th or 9th century). In Spain, the Visigothic king Sisenand was crowned in 631, and in 672, Wamba was the first occidental king to be anointed as well, by the archbishop of Toledo. Two prayers for the coronation of Byzantine emperors are found in the Byzantine Archieratikon (Slavonic: Chinovnik). The second of these prayers is proceeded by the diaconal command: \\"Bow your heads to the Lord\\" and the assembly's response: \\"To you, O Lord.\\" This pattern of two prayers corresponds to the ritual form found in the Byzantine liturgy for the ordinations of bishops, priests and deacons and also for major blessings, such as the Great Blessing of Waters on the Feast of the Theophany. In some texts, the first prayer is associated with the act of clothing the emperor in the chlamys and the second with the act of crowning him.De Cerimoniis, Book 2, cc.1-2. Although the Byzantine coronation ritual underwent various changes throughout the centuries, these two prayers are found consistently in every version. They also occur in the Russian ritual for the crowning of the Tsar, beginning with Ivan IV, and also in the ritual for the coronation of an emperor beginning with that of Catherine I.

Coronations in the Americas were held in the following countries:  By country  = Brazil = Emperor Pedro I of Brazil Emperor Pedro II of Brazil Brazilian emperors, of which there were two (Pedro I and Pedro II), were crowned with the Imperial Crown of Brazil in a Catholic Coronation Mass. The constitution required the monarch to have reached their eighteenth birthday before the ceremony could take place. Brazil abolished its monarchy in 1889. Pedro I was crowned on 1 December 1822 and Pedro II was crowned on 18 July 1841. Both ceremonies were held in the Old Cathedral of Rio de Janeiro, that then served as the Court's Imperial Chapel. The coronation of Pedro I was presided by the then Bishop of Rio de Janeiro and Major Chaplain of the Imperial Chapel. The coronation of Pedro II was presided by the then Archbishop of S√£o Salvador da Bahia and Primate of Brazil. Pedro II's coronation was a lavish event. In both ceremonies, the coronation rite prescribed in the Roman Pontifical of Pope Benedict XIV, then in force, was used. = Haiti = Emperor Faustin I of Haiti at his coronation. Jean-Jacques Dessalines, one of the founding fathers of Haiti, proclaimed himself Emperor of Haiti soon after its independence. He was crowned on 6 October 1804 in Le Cap, but was assassinated two years later. A Kingdom of Haiti was established in 1811 by Henri Christophe, another leader in the Haitian independence struggle. He was crowned in June 1811 in a lavish ritual presided over by Archbishop Corneil Breuil of Milot, but committed suicide in 1820. Faustin-√âlie Soulouque later proclaimed himself to be Emperor Faustin I of Haiti; he was crowned in an extremely elaborate ceremony held in Port-au-Prince on 18 April 1852, but was forced to abdicate in 1859, bringing his nascent Haitian imperium to an end. = Mexico = thumbleft200px Agust√≠n I of Mexico Maximilian I of Mexico by Albert Gr√§fle, Chapultepec Castle, Mexico City. Mexico has twice been a monarchy ruled by emperors. Agust√≠n I ruled from 1822 to 1823 after Mexico's independence from Spain; he was crowned in a lavish ceremony on 21 July 1822 at the Catedral Metropolitana de Mexico in Mexico City, placing the diadem on his own head in the manner of Napol√©on I . Agust√≠n I was overthrown in March 1823, and the Mexican monarchy abolished. Mexico's second monarch was Maximilian I, an Austrian archduke who was persuaded to take the newly revived Mexican throne in 1864 by Napol√©on III of France (whose troops, in conjunction with Mexican conservatives and nobility, had instituted it). His consort was Charlotte of Belgium, or Empress Carlota of Mexico. The second Imperial Crown of Mexico and a matching sceptre were manufactured for an intended coronation at the Catedral Metropolitana, but the ceremony was never carried out due to the instability of Maximilian's regime. The Second Mexican Empire lasted for over three years. Maximilian was defeated by Republican forces led by Mexican President Benito Ju√°rez and executed in 1867, bringing his empire to an end. = United States = James J. Strang, a would-be successor to Joseph Smith, Jr., in the leadership of the Latter-day Saint movement from 1844‚Äì56, openly established an ecclesiastical monarchy on Beaver Island, Michigan, in 1850. On 8 July of that year, he staged an elaborate coronation ceremony complete with a throne, wooden sceptre, breastplate and a crown described by one observer as \\"a shiny metal ring with a cluster of glass stars in the front\\". \\"King Strang\\" reigned over his followers until 16 June 1856, when he was assassinated by two disgruntled subjects. His people were driven from the island, and Strang's 'kingdom'‚Äîtogether with most of his royal regalia‚Äîvanished.Strang's sceptre is preserved in the Archives vault of the Community of Christ church in Independence, Missouri.

For coronations in the pre-annexation Kingdom of Hawaii, see Coronations in Oceania. Some observers compare the American presidential inauguration to a coronation, with the American constitutional requirement for a presidential oath congruent to the oaths required of the world's monarchs. Some historians and comparative government experts indicate that the former stems directly from the latter.

King Bhumibol of Thailand, 5 May 1950. Coronations in Asia in the strict sense are and historically were rare, as only few monarchies, primarily in Western Asia, ever adopted the concept that the placement of a crown symbolised the monarch's investiture. Instead, most monarchies in Asia used a form of acclamation or enthronement ceremony, in which the monarch formally ascends to the throne, and may be presented with certain regalia, and may receive homage from his or her subjects. This article covers both coronations and enthronement.  Coronations by country  = Bhutan = Kings of Bhutan are enthroned in a special Buddhist ceremony that involves the offering of various ritual prayers by the new king, the royal family and other notables. The king dons a special diadem known as the \\"Raven Crown\\", symbolic not merely of his own authority, but also of the raven-faced protector deity of Bhutan, Legoen Jarog Dongchen. As in neighboring Nepal (prior to 2008), the precise date for the ritual is selected by court astrologers. = Brunei = The Sultanate of Brunei crowns its ruler. The last such coronation was held on 1 August 1968, for the present Sultan, Hassanal Bolkiah in the Lapau, or ceremonial hall. Various items of royal regalia are exhibited at the Royal Regalia Building in the capital of Bandar Seri Begawan. = Cambodia = Norodom Sihanouk in coronation regalia, November 1941 The King of Cambodia is crowned in a ceremony that combines Brahmanic and Buddhist elements. The new monarch begins his coronation rite inside the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh by placing two wreaths of jasmine atop a golden pillow. Then, bowing before the offerings, he lights a bundle of incense sticks and placed them around the table before taking a seat on the red-carpeted floor. Prayers are read, punctuated by the sound of conch-shell horns. The ruler then enters the Tevea Venichhay Throne Hall, where he lights a stout candle encased in gold-gilded glass. This candle, which represents victory throughout the king's reign, is left burning until the final day of the coronation festival. Nine Buddhist monks then shower the King with jasmine buds. Finally, the monarch makes his way to the throne, bowing three times to it before retreating to his private area of the palace. The following day commences with the new king taking a ritual bath in water drawn from the Kulen Mountains, whose water is believed by Cambodian royals to be exceptionally pure. The bath is said to wash away the king's impurities, and increase his prestige. The new monarch is carried into the Preah Thineang Dheva Vinnichay, or Throne Hall, of the Palace on a gold chair, at the head of a large procession. Orange-clad Buddhist monks, one for every year of the king's life plus one, chant blessings. The king prays before statues of his ancestors inside the Hall. While priests blow on conch shells outside, the ruler next takes a formal oath to observe the constitution and to rule in the country's best interests. Following this, he receives various items of the royal regalia, including a calico cat, golden slippers, and the jewel-encrusted gold crown and sword. The last such ceremony was held in 2004 for the current monarch, Norodom Sihamoni. Unlike some previous Cambodian rulers, Sihamoni chose not to wear the crown during his coronation. = Iran = Mohammad Reza Shah crowning his wife, Empress Farah at their coronation ceremony in 1967. The Shahs of Persia (or Iran, after 1935) crowned themselves in an elaborate coronation ritual staged in Tehran, their capital. The last of these was the coronation of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran in 1967. The ceremony took place in the Grand Hall of the Golestan Palace, and commenced with the ceremonial entrance of the Crown Prince into the coronation hall. Moving past the assembled guests, the prince took his place in front of a throne set to the left of his father's, where he remained standing awaiting the arrival of his parents.Coronation of the Shah of Iran Next, the Empress Farah entered the room, followed by six maids of honor; these were followed in turn by the Shah, preceded by the heads of the Iranian army, navy and air force. He took his place in front of the Nadari throne, where his wife curtsied to him. The crowns of the Shah and empress were brought in next, together with a copy of the Qur'an; at this, the Shah seated himself on his throne, and invited everyone present to sit. The ceremony itself began with the Imam Djomeh reciting several verses from the Qur'an and offering a special coronation prayer, following which the Shah kissed the Muslim holy book. Following this, various items of the Iranian regalia were brought forward. The Shah first received the Emerald Belt, followed by the Imperial Sword and Robe. Finally, the Pahlavi Crown was presented, and the Iranian ruler placed it upon his own head in accordance with Iranian custom. After this, the Shah was given the Imperial Sceptre, after which he crowned his empress and listened to three speeches. The Shah then offered an address of his own, following which he received the homage of all male members of his family.Coronation of the Shah of Iran = Jerusalem = Maria and King John I of Jerusalem The first two Kings of Jerusalem, Baldwin I and Baldwin II, were crowned in the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. Between 1131 and 1186, coronations were held in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, was the only king crowned in Jerusalem in the 13th century. The new monarch was dressed in the palace by the chamberlain. The chamberlain, who bore the royal sword, then headed procession to the Church in which the coronation ceremony took place. The chamberlain then handed the crown, sceptre and the rest of the regalia to the monarch. The coronation was followed by a feast for the noblemen who attended the ceremony. The regalia possessed by the Kings of Jerusalem, as well as coronation ceremony itself, were influenced by those of Byzantine emperors. The coronation of Baldwin I of Constantinople was notably similar to the coronation of the Kings and Queens of Jerusalem. = Laos = Laos crowned its kings, with the last coronation being that of Sisavang Vong at the Royal Palace on 4 March 1905. These rites included rituals in which the king made a symbolic payment to representatives of his people for their land, with them in turn acknowledging his legitimacy. The last King of Laos, Savang Vatthana, was not crowned due to a communist insurgency which led to the abolition of the Laotian monarchy in 1975. = Myanmar = Kings of Burma were crowned in a way similar to its South-East Asian neighbors. There were huge Hindu and Buddhist influence on the coronations. = Nepal = Kings of Nepal were crowned in a Hindu ceremony whose date was determined by court astrologers. Prior to the actual coronation, eight different kinds of clay were ceremonially applied to various parts of his body, and the new king took a ritual bath in holy water. Afterwards he was sprinkled with clarified butter, milk, curd and honey by representatives of the four traditional Vedic varna ashrama dharma: a Brahman, a warrior, a merchant and a sudra, a laborer. Only then was he ready to be crowned. At precisely the \\"right\\" moment, the royal priest placed a jewel- studded crownA photo of the last Nepalese king, Gyanendra, in coronation regalia may be seen at Cross-Cultural Studies: Ethnographic Performances in Nepal (May 2004) . on the new king's head. The royals next rode on elephants through the streets of Kathmandu, together with other distinguished guests. = Thailand = King Bhumibol Adulyadej receiving the water of anointment on the Octagonal throne. Thailand holds a coronation ceremony for its king upon his accession to the throne. The last such ritual was held on 4 May 2019, upon the accession of the current monarch, Maha Vajiralongkorn. This ceremony included several ancient Buddhist and Brahmanic rites, including the presentation of a nine-tiered umbrella (symbol of royal authority) and other items of the royal regalia to the sovereign. Without this, no Thai king can assume the title of \\"Phrabat\\" or use the umbrella. Vajiralongkorn's coronation began with a ceremonial bath, following which the new king put on the white robes of a Brahmin monk, and had sacred water poured over his shoulders while a \\"gong of victory\\" was struck by the court astrologer. Afterwards, he received and is anointed from nine pitchers filled with sacred water, drawn from eighteen different sites in Thailand. The nine-tiered umbrella was then presented, followed by five other items of the royal regalia: the Great Crown of Victory, the Sword of Victory, the Royal Staff, the Whisk of the Tail Hairs of a White Elephant, a Small Flat Fan, and a pair of Golden Slippers. In accordance with Thai tradition, Vajiralongkorn placed the crown upon his own head, then received a special golden Ring of Kingship. After this, the new Thai ruler seated himself upon the Bhatarabit Throne at the Grand Palace, where he pronounced the Oath of Accession, promising that he would reign for the benefit and happiness of his people. He also poured ceremonial water to symbolize his complete dedication to his royal responsibilities, in accordance with the \\"Tenfold Moral Principles of the Sovereign\\": alms-giving and charity, strict moral standards, self-sacrifice, honesty and integrity, courtesy and kindness, austerity in his habits, harboring no anger or hatred, practicing and promoting non-violence, exuding patience, forbearance and tolerance, and displaying impartiality to all. After this, Vajiralongkorn elevated his wife, Suthida, to be the Queen of Thailand. Finally, the royal couple visited the Temple of the Emerald Buddha where he made a solemn vow to protect the Buddhist religion.  Enthronements by country  = China = The only monarch in Chinese history to have been formally crowned () was Qin Shihuang, who later became the First Emperor. Although he had acceded to the throne of Qin at the age of 13, when he reached the age of majority at 22, he was additionally crowned in 238 BC. The coronation symbolised that he would take charge of the affairs of state himself, instead of the regents who had ruled in his name since his accession. However, this coronation did not equate to accession, and no other emperor was ever \\"crowned\\". Enthronement ceremonies in dynastic China varied throughout the ages. In the Ming and Qing dynasties, the ceremony generally began with the Emperor offering prayers to Heaven, from which, according to the imperial state theology, the Emperor derives his mandate to rule. The emperor then proceeds to the main hall of the Forbidden City, where he is ceremonially enthroned on the imperial dragon throne. The imperial court enter the throne hall in order of seniority, and offer memorials of congratulation. Finally, the Emperor's accession edict is read out. In later enthronements, this was the most elaborate part of the ceremony, with the edict carried out of the Meridian Gate accompanied by a stately procession, and finally carried by a litter to the top of the Gate of Heavenly Peace, where it is read out to the nation. The last widely recognised enthronement ceremony of the Qing Dynasty occurred in 1908 with the enthronement of Puyi. In 1915, Yuan Shikai, then President of the Republic of China, declared his intention to be enthroned as the Emperor of the Empire of China. Yuan had staged a dress rehearsal for the proposed enthronement ceremony, but then the attempt at monarchy was abandoned in the face of overwhelming public opposition. In 1917, Puyi was again enthroned without ceremony during the short-lived Manchu Restoration. Finally, in 1934 Puyi was enthroned as Emperor of Manchukuo, a Japanese-controlled puppet state in northeastern China, which was largely unrecognised internationally and which ceased to exist at the end of World War II in 1945. =India= enthronement of Shivaji In Indian monarchy, the royal enthronement ceremony is called rajyabhishek. = Japan = The enthronement ceremony of Japan consists of three main parts. The first takes place immediately after the death of the preceding sovereign. The new emperor is given two of the Three Sacred Treasures of Japan: (1) a replica sword representing the sword Kusanagi-no- Tsurugi (lit. \\"Grasscutter Sword\\") (ËçâËñôÂäç)--the original being enshrined in the Atsuta Shrine in Nagoya; and (2) the Yasakani no magatama (ÂÖ´Â∞∫ÁìäÊõ≤Áéâ), a necklace of comma-shaped stone beads. Unlike other monarchies, Japan has no crown for its ruler. The second part of the ceremony is the enthronement ritual itself, previously held in Kyoto, the former capital of Japan. The most recent enthronement of Emperor Naruhito in 2019 was held in Tokyo instead. The ritual is not public, and the regalia itself is generally seen only by the emperor himself and a few Shinto priests. The Daijo-sai or the Great Thanksgiving Festival is the final inauguration ritual, involving sacred rice, sake, fish and a variety of other foods from both land and sea that are offered to the Sun-goddess Amaterasu-≈çmikami. This ceremony effects a singular union with the goddess, thus making the new emperor (in Shinto tradition) the immediate intermediary between Amaterasu-≈çmikami and the Japanese people. = Korea = A record of the 1724 coronation of Korean Emperor Yeongjo of the Joseon Dynasty has been preserved. According to this account, Yeongjo began his crowning ritual at noon on 26 October, by entering the funeral chamber where his deceased predecessor, Gyeongjong, lay in state. Having announced to his departed brother that he was assuming the royal mantle, Yeongjo burned incense before his remains, then entered the Injeongjeon Hall, where he was seated upon his throne. In the courtyard below, ranks of servants and bureaucrats bowed to him four times, shouting in unison each time: \\"Long live the king\\"! Following this, the new monarch left the throne room and changed back into mourning clothes for the reading of his accession edict. The decree contained the new emperor's pledge to rule justly and benevolently; it equally promised reductions in criminal sentences, provisions for the needy, and gifts for all of Yeongjo's loyal officials. The edict closed with a plea for help and cooperation throughout the reign to come. The Empire of Korea ended in 1910 with annexation by Japan, with the country subsequently splitting into a communist state (North) and republic (South) after the events of World War II. = Malaysia = The nine royal rulers of Malaysia elect one of their number every five years to serve as Yang di-Pertuan Agong, or King of Malaysia. The new ruler is enthroned in a special ceremony after his election, which involves usage of several items of regalia including the Tengkolok Diraja, or Royal Headdress‚Äîas opposed to a crown. According to legend, the first Sultan of Perak swore off the wearing of any diadems after the miraculous refloating of his ship, which had run aground during his journey to establish his reign in Perak. Hence, while Malaysian coronations are rather elaborate affairs, they do not involve the imposition of a crown. Instead, a special headdress is worn by the new king that since 1957 is in the style of the rulers of the self electing ruler state of Negeri Sembilan. The new king proceeds into the Istana Negara Throne Hall at the head of a large procession also consisting of his spouse, specially-picked soldiers carrying the royal regalia, and other notables including the Grand Chamberlain, or Datuk Paduka Maharaja Lela. The king and his wife are seated upon their thrones, and the regalia are brought forward. Following this, the Datuk Paduka Maharaja Lela brings forward a copy of the Qur'an, which the new monarch reverently receives, kisses, and places on a special table located between his throne and the queen's. A formal proclamation of the new king's reign is read, followed by the taking of a special coronation oath. The Prime Minister gives a special speech, which is followed by an address by the new king from the throne. A prayer is said, the Qur'an as returned to the Chamberlain, and the ceremony is completed.

Coronation of Emperor Nicholas II of Russia and Empress Alexandra Feodorovna in 1896 Coronation of Pope Celestine V Coronations in Europe were previously held in the monarchies of Europe. The United Kingdom is the only monarchy in Europe that still practices coronation. Current European monarchies have either replaced coronations with simpler ceremonies to mark an accession (e.g. Denmark) or have never practiced coronations (e.g. The Netherlands and Belgium). Most monarchies today only require a simple oath to be taken in the presence of the country's legislature.  By country  = Albania = King Zog I, self-proclaimed monarch of Albania, was ritually crowned on 1 September 1928. His coronation attire included rose-colored breeches, gold spurs, and a gold crown weighing . Europe's only Muslim king swore a required constitutional oath on the Bible and the Qur'an, symbolizing his desire to unify his country. Zog was forced into exile by Italian invaders in 1939, and the monarchy was formally abolished in 1945. = Austria = Emperors of Austria were never crowned (unlike their predecessors in the Holy Roman Empire), as a coronation was not viewed as being necessary to legitimize their rule in that country. However, they were crowned in some kingdoms within the Austrian Empire. Ferdinand I was crowned as King of Hungary with the Crown of Saint Stephen in 1830, as King of Bohemia with the Crown of Saint Wenceslas in 1836, and as King of Lombardy and Venetia with the Iron Crown of Lombardy in 1838. After the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, the Emperors of Austria were only crowned as King of Hungary (again with the Crown of Saint Stephen): Franz-Joseph I in 1867 and Charles I (as Charles IV of Hungary) in 1916. = Bavaria = In 1806, the German duchy of Bavaria was upgraded to full \\"kingdom\\" status. The former Duke of Bavaria, who now became King of Bavaria, Maximilian I, commissioned a set of crown jewels to commemorate Bavaria's elevation. However, there was no coronation ceremony, and the king never wore the crown in public. Rather, it was placed on a cushion at his feet when displayed on occasions. The Bavarian monarchy was abolished in 1918. = Belgium = Following the Belgian Revolution from 1830‚Äì31 and the subsequent establishment of an independent Kingdom of Belgium from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, Leopold I and his successors have never been crowned in a coronation rite. Belgium has no regalia such as crowns (except as a heraldic emblem); the monarch's formal installation requires only a solemn oath to \\"abide by the Constitution and the laws of the Belgian people, maintain the country‚Äôs independence and preserve its territory\\" before members of the two chambers of parliament.article 91, constitution During the enthronement of Baudouin, one legislator, Julien Lahaut, cried \\"Vive la R√©publique\\", only to be shouted down by others, who cried \\"Vive le Roi\\", with the entire chamber rising to applaud the king. Lahaut was found dead a week later. During the enthronement of Albert II, legislator Jean-Pierre Van Rossem cried \\"Leve de republiek, Vive la r√©publique europ√©enne, Vive Lahaut!\\" Van Rossem was also shouted down by the others, but did not suffer the same fate as Lahaut. = Bohemia = Coronation of King Ferdinand V of Bohemia in 1836 Vratislaus II of Bohemia was the first crowned ruler of Bohemia. During the Middle Ages, it was held that enthronement would make a person Duke of Bohemia and that only coronation would make a person King of Bohemia.Lisa Wolverton, Hastening Toward Prague: Power and Society in the Medieval Czech Lands, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2001 St. Vitus Cathedral was the coronation church. Monarchs of Bohemia were crowned with the Crown of Saint Wenceslas and invested with royal insignia, among which a cap or mitre and a lance (symbols of Saint Wenceslas) were specific for Bohemian coronations. Maria Theresa, the only female monarch of Bohemia, was crowned king in order to emphasize that she was the monarch and not consort. The last King of Bohemia to be crowned as such was Emperor Ferdinand of Austria.The New Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 1974 The Abbess of the St. George's Abbey had the privilege to crown the wife of the King of Bohemia.The Catholic Encyclopedia, 1913 In 1791, the right to crown the Queen of Bohemia was transferred to the Abbess of the Damenstift (a post always filled by an Archduchess of Austria). = Bosnia = The first crowned ruler of Bosnia was Tvrtko I. His coronation, held on 26 October 1377, created the Kingdom of Bosnia. It was traditionally held that Stephen Tvrtko I was crowned in the Mile≈°evo monastery by its metropolitan bishop,John Van Antwerp Fine, The Late Medieval Balkans, A Critical Survey from the Late Twelfth Century to the Ottoman Conquest, University of Michigan Press, 1987 but it has been proposed that he was crowned in the monastery of Mile, where most Bosnian coronations were held, with a crown sent by King Louis I of Hungary.Malcolm D. Lambert, The Cathars, Blackwell Publishing, 1998Mitja Velikonja, Religious separation and political intolerance in Bosnia- Herzegovina, Texas A&M; University Press, 2003 Tvrtko I's coronation served as an example to subsequent such rites. The details of the Bosnian coronation ceremony are unclear. The Catholic Church, the Bosnian Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church competed in Bosnia, and it is not even known which church's officials performed the coronation. The Bosnian Church is considered least likely to have led the ceremony, as its elders frowned upon such rituals. The liturgical aspect of the ceremony was important, but not primary. A specific crown was revered and deemed indispensable for a proper coronation. Dethroned rulers had to undergo another coronation upon restoration to the throne.Pavo ≈Ωivkoviƒá, Tvrtko II Tvrtkoviƒá: Bosna u prvoj polovini XV stoljeƒáa, Institut za istoriju, 1981, page 84. The coronation was sometimes delayed, but monarchs could exercise full authority immediately after their election.ƒÜirkoviƒá, Sima (1964). –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—ò–∞ —Å—Ä–µ–¥—ö–æ–≤–µ–∫–æ–≤–Ω–µ –±–æ—Å–∞–Ω—Å–∫–µ –¥—Ä–∂–∞–≤–µ (in Serbo-Croatian). Srpska knji≈æevna zadruga. Page 225. The last coronation in Bosnia was held in the St. Mary's Church in Jajce, November 1461. Although all kings of Bosnia were at least formally Roman Catholic, only the last king, Stephen Toma≈°eviƒá, was crowned with the Pope's approval and with a crown sent by Pope Pius II. The coronation was performed by the papal legate. = Bulgaria = The rulers of the Second Bulgarian Empire were crowned in the same manner as Byzantine emperors, while the manner of coronation of the rulers of the First Bulgarian Empire remains unknown. Modern Bulgaria was a monarchy from its independence in 1878 until 1946. The modern hereditary Bulgarian kings were pronounced heads of state by the Parliament and anointed at the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in Sofia, but did not pass the formal coronation ritual known in the western countries. = Croatia = King Tomislav of Croatia. Historians dispute whether the coronation actually took place. According to legend, the first crowned monarch of Croatia was King Tomislav. He was allegedly crowned on the Plain of Duvno in 925. However, it is disputed whether Tomislav was ever crowned; some sources identify Dr≈æislav as the first crowned King of Croatia, ignoring the legend of Tomislav's coronation. Zvonimir was crowned as King of Croatia and Dalmatia on 8 October 1076 at Solin in the coronation Basilica of Saint Peter and Moses (known today as the Hollow Church) by Gebizo, a representative of Pope Gregory VII (1073-1085). In 1102, upon the death of the last member of the House of Trpimiroviƒá, Croatia entered a personal union with Hungary. It was agreed that every King of Hungary would come to Croatia for a separate coronation as King of Croatia. This second coronation was required to soothe Croatian sensibilities, by demonstrating that Croatia remained an independent state. The last King of Croatia to be crowned in Croatia was King Andrew II of Hungary. His son and successor, King B√©la, refused to be crowned in Croatia in 1235, and the custom afterwards died out. Some scholars claim that B√©la IV's father was never crowned as King of Croatia either. The issue remains unsettled, because there are no documents on either of Andrew II's supposed coronations. In 1941, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was occupied and partitioned by the Axis powers. A puppet state, the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), was formed on a part of occupied Yugoslav territory and Aimone, 4th Duke of Aosta, was installed as King by fascist Italy. The Italians planned to have Aimone crowned as \\"Tomislav II\\" at the Field of Duvno, where King Tomislav was allegedly crowned. The coronation was never held, due to Italy taking Yugoslav coastal territory that was claimed by the NDH. = Denmark = Coronation of Christian VIII of Denmark, from a contemporary engraving, 1840. Danish enthronements may be divided into three distinct types of rituals: the medieval coronation, which existed during the period of elective monarchy; the anointing ritual, which replaced coronation with the introduction of absolute monarchy in 1660; and finally the simple proclamation, which has been used since the introduction of the Danish Constitution in 1849. The coronation ritual (as of 1537) began with a procession of the ruler and his consort into St. Mary's Cathedral in Copenhagen, followed by the Danish crown jewels. The monarch was seated before the altar, where he swore to govern justly, preserve the Lutheran religion, support schools, and help the poor. Following this, the king was anointed on the lower right arm and between the shoulders, but not on the head. Then the royal couple retired to a tented enclosure where they were robed in royal attire, returning to hear a sermon, the Kyrie and Gloria, and then a prayer and the Epistle reading. Following the Epistle, the king knelt before the altar, where he was first given a sword. After flourishing and sheathing it, the still-kneeling monarch was crowned by the clergy and nobility, who jointly placed the diadem upon their ruler's head. The sceptre and orb were presented, then returned to attendants. The queen was anointed and crowned in a similar manner, but she received only a sceptre and not an orb. A choral hymn was then sung, and then the newly crowned king and queen listened to a second sermon and the reading of the Gospel, which brought the service to an end. In 1660 the coronation ritual was replaced with a ceremony of anointing: the new king would arrive at the coronation site already wearing the crown, and he was then anointed. This rite was in turn abolished with the introduction of the Danish Constitution in 1849. Today the crown of Denmark is only displayed at the monarch's funeral, when it lies on top of their coffin. The present Queen, Margrethe II, did not have any formal enthronement service; a public announcement of her accession was made from the balcony of Christiansborg Palace, with the new sovereign being acclaimed by her Prime Minister at the time (1972), Jens Otto Krag, then cheered with a ninefold \\"hurrah\\" by the crowds below. = France = Coronation of Louis VIII of France and Blanche of Castile at Reims in 1223; a miniature from the Grandes Chroniques de France, circa 1450. Following perhaps the Byzantine or Visigothic formula, the French coronation ceremony called Sacre primarily included the anointing or unction of the king. It was first held in Soissons in 752 for the Carolingian king Pepin the Short to legitimise his deposition of the last of the Merovingian kings, who had been elected by an assembly of nobles inside the royal family and according to hereditary rules. A second coronation of Pepin by Pope Stephen II took place at the Basilica of St Denis in 754; this is the first recorded by a Pope. The unction served as a reminder of the baptism of king Clovis I in Reims by archbishop Saint Remi in 496/499, where the ceremony was finally transferred in 816 and completed with the use of the Holy Ampulla found in 869 in the grave of the saint. Since this Roman glass vial, containing the balm due to be mixed with chrism, was allegedly brought by the dove of the Holy Spirit, the French monarchs claimed to receive their power by divine right. The French coronation ritual was similar to that used in England, from 925 and above all 1066, with the coronation of William the Conqueror. The last royal coronation was that of Charles X, in 1825. Heirs to the French throne were also sometimes crowned during their predecessors' reigns during the Middle Ages, but this was discontinued as laws of primogeniture became stronger. The coronation regalia like the throne and sceptre of Dagobert I or crown and sword of Charlemagne, were kept in the Basilica of Saint-Denis near Paris, and the liturgical instruments, like the Holy Ampulla and Chalice, in Reims, where they are still partly preserved as well as in the Louvre and other Parisian museums. The coronation of Charles VII of France During the First French Empire, Emperor Napoleon I and Empress Josephine were crowned in December 1804 in an extremely elaborate ritual presided over by Pope Pius VII and conducted at the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. Napoleon III chose not to be crowned. The French republican government broke up and sold off most of the Crown Jewels, in the hope of avoiding any public sentiment for a restoration of the monarchy after the collapse of the Second French Empire in 1871. = Greece = Although Greece retains a set of crown jewels given to it by its first king, Otto I, no Greek king was ever crowned with them. The Greek monarchy was abolished in 1973 by a military junta. = Holy Roman Empire = The coronation of Charlemagne by Pope Leo III. Since Charlemagne in 800, Holy Roman Emperors were crowned by the pope until 1530, when Charles V became the last Holy Roman Emperor to be crowned by the Pope, at Bologna. Thereafter, until the abolition of the empire in 1806, Imperial coronations were held in Frankfurt and were performed by the Spiritual Princes-Electors, the Archbishops of Cologne, Mainz and Trier.See also Guy Stair Sainty, The Holy Roman Empire: Introduction . From the Almanach de la Cour website. Retrieved on 14 September 2008. Later rulers simply proclaimed themselves Electus Romanorum Imperator or \\"Elected Emperor of the Romans\\", without the formality of a coronation by the Pontiff. Coronations were held in Rome (under the pope), Milan (the Kingdom of Italy), Arles (Burgundy) and Aachen (Germany). Although the Roman ceremony was initially the most important, it was eventually eclipsed by the German ritual. The custom of the emperors going to Rome to be crowned was last observed by Frederick III in 1440; after that only the German coronation was celebrated. = Hungary = King K√°roly IV of Hungary taking his coronation oath Rulers of Hungary were not considered legitimate monarchs until they were crowned King of Hungary with the Holy Crown of Hungary. As women were not considered fit to rule Hungary, the two queens regnant, Maria I and Maria II Theresa, were crowned kings of Hungary.Bernard Newman, The New Europe, 1972 Hungarian coronations usually took place at Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r, the burial place of the first crowned ruler of Hungary, Saint Stephen I, except years 1563 ‚Äì 1830, when did coronations took place in St. Martin cathedral in Bratislava, because of Ottoman occupation of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r. . The final such rite was held in Budapest on 30 December 1916, when Kaiser Karl I of Austria and Empress Zita were crowned as King K√°roly IV and Queen Zita of Hungary. The Hungarian monarchy perished with the end of the First World War, although the nation would later restore a titular monarchy from 1920-45‚Äîwhile forbidding King K√°roly from resuming the throne. A communist takeover in 1945 spelled the final end of this \\"kingdom without a king\\". = Italy = The modern Kingdom of Italy, which existed from 1861 to 1946, did not crown its monarchs. = Liechtenstein = The sovereign Princes of Liechtenstein have never undergone a coronation or enthronement ceremony, although Prince Hans-Adam II attended a mass by the Archbishop of Vaduz, followed by a choral display. In 1719 the Liechtenstein family finally attained the long-sought rank of Princes of the Holy Roman Empire, and had a coronet made of diamonds, pearls and rubies. However, as the subsequent princes always resided in Vienna, and until modern times did not even visit their principality, the original princely coronet may never have been brought there, and is now lost. On the occasion of his seventieth birthday, Franz Joseph II, Prince of Liechtenstein, the first monarch of Liechtenstein to dwell in his own realm, was given a princely coronet edged in ermine, a replica of the original, as a gift from his people, which is kept on display in the principality. But it has never been used in a coronation nor worn by a reigning prince. Typical of princely coronets, it lacks \\"royal\\" arches, and is surmounted by a tassel instead of a royal orb or cross. = Luxembourg = Luxembourg's sovereign Grand Dukes have never been crowned. Instead, the sovereign is enthroned at a simple ceremony held in the nation's parliament at the beginning of his or her reign to take an oath of loyalty to the state constitution as required by the constitution.article 5 of the constitution The sovereign then attends a solemn mass at the Notre-Dame Cathedral. No crown or other regalia exists for the rulers of Europe's last sovereign Grand Duchy. = Monaco = The Principality of Monaco does not possess any regalia, and thus does not physically crown its ruler. However, the Prince or Princess does attend a special investiture ceremony, consisting of a festive mass in Saint Nicholas Cathedral, followed by a reception where the new sovereign prince meets his people. = Netherlands = The Netherlands have never physically crowned its monarchs. The Dutch monarch, however, undergoes a \\"swearing-in and investiture\\" ceremony. Article 32 of the Dutch constitution states that as soon as the monarch assumes the royal prerogative, he is to be sworn-in and inaugurated in Amsterdam at a public joint session of the two houses of the States General. This ritual is held at the Nieuwe Kerk, in the capital city of Amsterdam. Regalia such as the crown, orb and sceptre are present but are never physically given to the monarch, instead they are placed on cushions, on what is called a credence table. The royal regalia surround a copy of the Dutch constitution. Two other regalia‚Äìthe sword of state and the standard of the kingdom bearing the coat of arms of the Netherlands‚Äìare carried by two senior military officers. During the ceremony, the monarch, wearing a ceremonial robe, is seated on a chair of state with his or her consort on a raised dais opposite members of the States General. The ceremony consists of two parts. In the first part, the monarch is sworn-in: he takes his formal oath to uphold the kingdom's fundamental law and protect the country with everything within his power. After the king has taken his oath, he is invested by the States General and the States of the other countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands: members of the States General pay homage to the monarch. The President of the Joint Session of the States General will first make a solemn declaration while all members of the States General and members of the States of Aruba, Cura√ßao and St Maarten will then, in turn, swear or affirm this declaration. = Norway = King Haakon VII and Queen Maud of Norway wearing their coronation crowns and robes in 1906. The first coronation in Norway, and Scandinavia, took place in Bergen in 1163 or 1164. The Christ Church (Old Cathedral) in Bergen remained the place of coronations in Norway until the capital was moved to Oslo under King Haakon V. From then on some coronations were held in Oslo, but most were held in Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim. In 1397, Norway, Sweden and Denmark united in what is referred to as the Kalmar Union, sharing the same monarch. During this period the kings were crowned consecutively in each of the three countries until the union was dissolved in 1523. Following this dissolution, Norway entered into a union in 1524 with Denmark which would eventually evolve to an integrated state that was to last until 1814. No coronations were held in Norway during this time. Meanwhile, the monarch underwent a coronation and later, with the introduction of absolutism in 1660, an anointing ceremony in Denmark. Following the dissolution of Denmark-Norway, Norway declared its independence and elected the Danish heir as its own king. Christian Frederick would \\"abdicate\\" this position following the Swedish-Norwegian War and Norway would be forced into a union with Sweden and elected the King of Sweden as King of Norway. The Norwegian constitution of 1814 required the King of Norway to be crowned in Trondheim. King Karl Johan was subsequently crowned in Stockholm and Trondheim after acceding to the thrones of Sweden and Norway in 1818. Succeeding monarchs would also be crowned separately in Sweden and Norway. In 1905, the personal union between Sweden and Norway was dissolved. Haakon VII was subsequently elected Norway's monarch. Haakon and his wife Queen Maud were the last to be crowned in Nidaros Cathedral in 1906. Following this, the constitutional provision requiring the coronation was repealed in 1908. Thereafter, the monarch has only been required to take his formal accession oath in the Council of State and then in the parliament, the Storting. King Olav V, desiring a religious ceremony to mark his accession to the throne in 1957, instituted a ceremony of royal consecration, known as . This \\"blessing\\" rite took place again in 1991, when King Harald V and Queen Sonja were similarly consecrated. Both consecrations were held where the coronation rite had formerly taken place: Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim. = Poland = Poland crowned its rulers beginning in 1025; the final such ceremony occurred in 1764, when the last Polish King, Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski, was crowned at St. John's Cathedral, Warsaw. Other coronations took place at Wawel Cathedral in Krak√≥w, and also in Pozna≈Ñ and Gniezno Cathedral. Though many of the Polish Crown Jewels were destroyed by Prussian King Frederick William III, a few pieces are exhibited at the National Museum in Warsaw. Polish coronations were whenever possible conducted as close as possible to the date of the previous sovereign's funeral; this was a concept expressed by Joachim Bielski in the sixteenth century: osoba umiera, korona nie umiera (the royal person dies, the crown dies not).M. Bielski, Kronika polska, 1st ed. (1597, reprinted Sanok, 1856), 3:1207. = Portugal = King Manuel II of Portugal and the Algarves, wearing the Mantle of Lu√≠s I, with the Crown of Jo√£o VI, on the day of his Acclamation. In 1646, immediately after his Coronation, King Jo√£o IV of Portugal and the Algarves consecrated the Crown of Portugal to the Virgin Mary, proclaiming her to be the Queen and patroness of his nation. After this act, no Portuguese sovereign ever wore a crown. The Portuguese monarchy was abolished in 1910. Jo√£o IV's Coronation followed a pattern similar to the Coronation of the Kings of France and pre-reformation England, as laid out in the Roman Pontifical. The Habsburg monarchs that preceded Jo√£o IV as Kings of Portugal were also not crowned; during the Iberian Union, the practice of not having a coronation ceremony was extended to Portugal. Before the assumption of the Portuguese Throne by the Habsburgs, Kings of Portugal used to be anointed and crowned in the Jeronimos Monastery in Lisbon, in a manner similar to the Coronation of Jo√£o IV. Thereafter, Portuguese monarchs have only been acclaimed. = Prussia = King Wilhelm I of Prussia King Wilhelm I was crowned in 1861 as King in Prussia, prior to the establishment of the German Empire (1871). He was crowned with great pomp, becoming the first king to be crowned in Prussia since the coronation of King Friedrich I in 1701, although a significant number of politicians opposed the idea. Wilhelm I took the crown with his own hands from the altar and crowned himself, while saying that he was receiving the crown from God's hands. These words were intended as a warning to Prussian Constitutionalists and Liberals.George Barnett Smith, William I. and the German empire. A biographical and historical sketch, London, S. Low, Marston, Searle, & Rivington, 1887 Both coronations took place at the church at K√∂nigsberg Castle having been the last capital of the Ordenstaat, and capital of the Duchy of Prussia. The King of Prussia was also Kaiser of Imperial Germany from 1871 to 1918. Although a design and model for a German State Crown were made, no final diadem was ever produced, and none of the three German emperors were ever formally crowned. = Romania = King Carol I of the Romanians The Kingdom of Romania used a coronation ceremony during its monarchical period (1881‚Äì1947). Its crown was rather unusual, being made of steel rather than gold or some other precious metal.Compare the Iron Crown of Lombardy, which despite its name is in appearance a small gold circlet to be worn on the top of the head. It is traditionally supposed to take its name from the inner ring on which it is mounted - long thought to be iron, and venerated as a nail from the true cross, scientific tests in 1993 proved it to be silver. The crown may also have once had a true iron arc bisecting the circlet. In 1922, King Ferdinand I of the Romanians and Queen Marie were crowned in the courtyard of the newly opened \\"Coronation Cathedral\\" in Alba Iulia, an important city in the new Romanian province of Transylvania. Ferdinand crowned himself and then crowned his wife.http://www.visitalbaiulia.com/visiting-the-coronation- cathedral/ The coronation service was interdenominational rather than Romanian Orthodox (the majority religion and then the state church), in part because Ferdinand was Roman Catholic, while his wife was Anglican at the time. Ferdinand's son, Carol II, intended to be crowned in September 1930, but abandoned his plans due to marital difficulties with his wife, Queen Helen, which included an ongoing affair with Magda Lupescu. Upon his abdication, his son, Michael I, was crowned and anointed on 6 September 1940 at the Romanian Patriarchal Cathedral in Bucharest by Patriarch Nicodim Munteanu. \\"The Joys of Suffering,\\" Volume 2, \\"Dialogue with a few intellectuals\\", by Rev. Fr. Dimitrie Bejan ‚Äî Retrieved 9 June 2007 Coronation of Emperor Alexander III of Russia and Empress Maria Fyodorovna in 1883 = Russia = Following the tradition of the Byzantine Emperors, the Tsar of Russia placed the crown upon his own head. This left no doubt that, in the Russian system, the imperial power came directly from God. The prayer of the Metropolitan, similar to that of the Patriarch of Constantinople for the Byzantine Emperor, confirmed the imperial supremacy. A few days prior to the crowning service itself, the Tsar made a processional entry into Moscow, where coronations were always held (even when the capital was in St. Petersburg). Following this, the Imperial regalia were brought from the Kremlin armory into the Tsar's Kremlin palace, where they would accompany the new emperor on his procession to the Dormition Cathedral on the morning of his coronation. This procession commenced at the Red Porch and ended at the church doors, where the presiding prelate and other bishops blessed the Tsar and his consort with holy water and offered them the Holy Cross to kiss.Last Coronation of a Russian Tsar . Retrieved on 2009-12-31. After the Tsar entered the cathedral, he and his spouse venerated the icons there and took their places on two thrones set up in the center of the cathedral. After the sovereign had recited the Nicene Creed as his profession of faith, and after an invocation of the Holy Spirit and a litany, the emperor assumed the purple chlamys, and the crown was then presented to him. He took it and placed it on his head himself, while the Metropolitan recited: \\"In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.\\" The Metropolitan would then make the following short address: :\\"Most God-fearing, absolute, and mighty Lord, Tsar of all the Russias, this visible and tangible adornment of thy head is an eloquent symbol that thou, as the head of the whole Russian people, art invisibly crowned by the King of kings, Christ, with a most ample blessing, seeing that He bestows upon thee entire authority over His people.\\" Following this, the new Tsar crowned his consort, first briefly with his own crown (by touching it momentarily to her head before putting it back on his own), then with a smaller crown of her own. Further prayers and litanies were read, then the Emperor was anointed just prior to reception of Holy Communion during the Divine Liturgy. He was invited to enter the altar area through the Royal Doors (normally reserved solely to the clergy) and partake of Communion as a priest would, in both kinds. Further prayers and blessings concluded the service, which was followed by a special feast held in the Kremlin's Palace of Facets. Russia's last coronation was in 1896, for Tsar Nicholas II and Empress Alexandra.

He is being greeted by the ollamh r√≠gh, the royal poet. :This section describes coronations held in Scotland prior to its unification with England. For coronations after that time, see below under \\"United Kingdom\\". Kings of Scotland were crowned at Scone Abbey, in the town of Scone, a few miles north of Perth. Prior to 1296, the king was seated upon the famed Stone of Scone throughout the ceremony; this was considered an essential element of the ritual.Philip Coppens, The Stone of Destiny: Sacred Kingship in the 21st Century. From the personal website of Philip Coppens. Retrieved on 21 September 2008. Following the removal of the stone to England by Edward I, coronations continued to be staged at the abbey or at Stirling. The Honours of Scotland, the oldest Crown jewels in Britain, were used in all coronation ceremonies up to that of Charles II, the final king to be crowned in Scotland. One feature of Scottish coronations was the ollamh r√≠gh, or royal poet, who addressed the new monarch with Beannachd D√© R√≠gh Alban, or \\"God Bless the King of Scotland\\". The poet went on to recite the monarch's genealogy back to the first ever Scotsman. It was traditional in Gaelic-speaking cultures like Scotland that a king's legitimacy be established by recitation of the royal pedigree. Scottish rulers did not necessarily have to wait for any certain age to be crowned: Mary I was crowned at nine months of age, while her son, James VI, was crowned at thirteen months. Mary's father, James V, was barely seventeen months of age at the time of his coronation. After the unification with England, the Scottish coronation rite was subsumed into the British. = Serbia = King Peter I of Serbia immediately after his coronation The first crowned King of Serbia, Stefan Nemanjiƒá, was crowned twice. In 1217, he was crowned in a Roman Catholic ceremony by papal legate with crown sent by the Pope. However, Stefan and the Serbian people were Eastern Orthodox, so he appealed to the Patriarch of Constantinople. The Patriarch elevated Stefan's brother Sava to the rank of archbishop and authorized Stephan's second coronation, performed by Sava himself in 1222. His successors were also crowned kings at the monastery of ≈Ωiƒça. Stefan Du≈°an had himself crowned emperor by patriarchs of Bulgaria and Serbia, as he was aware that the Patriarch of Constantinople would not bestow the imperial title upon ruler of a Balkan country. Nevertheless, the coronation ceremony was an elaborate replica of Byzantine coronation. Serbia's last coronation was in 1904, when King Peter I was crowned in an Orthodox Christian ceremony at the Cathedral of the Host of Holy Archangels in Belgrade.The Coronation of King Peter I of Serbia. Retrieved 2009-10-28. Serbia became a part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia after the First World War, but Peter did not hold a second coronation and neither of his two successors, Alexander and Peter II, were crowned. = Sicily and Naples = The exact coronation customs of the Kings and Queens of Sicily are disputed. According to a Cassino manuscript of c. 1200, the coronation of the Kings of Sicily was based on a German model, though variations were made to adapt it to Sicilian tradition. Several different parts were included in the coronation ceremony. First, the new monarch was asked whether he wished to be the defender of the Church and a just ruler of his kingdom. After that, the people were asked whether they wish to submit themselves to the person who was to be crowned. The king or queen were then anointed on their hands, head, chest and both shoulders. The monarch was then girded with sword and vested with armillas, pallium, and ring. The sceptre was put in their right hand and the orb in their left hand. Finally, the presiding archbishop placed the crown on the monarch's head. The Kings and Queens of Naples were crowned in the City of Naples. The Pope was the only person entitled to crown the monarch of Naples. = Spain = No monarch of Spain has been crowned as such since John I of Castile (1379), Ferdinand I of Aragon (1414), and Catherine of Navarre with her husband John III of Navarre (1494). Joan III of Navarre was crowned as late as 1555, although she ruled Navarre beyond the Pyrenees. Instead, the new monarch appears at the Cortes, where he or she takes a formal oath to uphold the Constitution.As required by article 61 of the constitution Although the crown is evident at the ceremony, it is never actually placed on the monarch's head. Historical Castilian coronations were performed at Toledo, or in the Church of St Jerome at Madrid, with the king being anointed by the archbishop of Toledo. The monarch assumed the royal sword, sceptre, crown of gold and the apple of gold, after receiving his anointing. Aragonese coronations were performed at Zaragoza by the Archbishop of Tarragona. Five days after his visit to the Cortes, King Juan Carlos I attended an \\"Enthronement Mass\\" at the Church of San Jer√≥nimo el Real in Madrid. Accompanied by his wife Sofia, he was escorted beneath a canopy to a set of thrones set up near the high altar. Following the service, the king and queen returned to the palace, where they greeted the people from the balcony, reviewed troops and attended a formal banquet. = Sweden = Coronation of King Gustav III of Sweden Swedish monarchs were crowned in various cities during the 13th and 14th centuries, but from the middle of the 15th century on in either the Cathedral in Uppsala or Storkyrkan in Stockholm, with the exception of the coronation of Gustav IV Adolf, which took place in Norrk√∂ping in 1800. Earlier coronations were also held at Uppsala, the ecclesiastical center of Sweden. Prior to Sweden's change into a hereditary monarchy, the focus of the coronation rite was on legitimising an elected king. Nineteenth-century coronations of Swedish monarchs followed a rite last used during the coronation of Oscar II in 1873: The king and queen proceeded to the Cathedral in separate processions. The king was met at the front portal by the Archbishop of Uppsala, highest prelate in the Church of Sweden, together with other bishops in their copes. The Archbishop greeted the king: \\"Blessed be he who cometh in the Name of the Lord\\", while the Bishop of Skara said a prayer that the king might be endowed with the grace to govern his people well. The Archbishop and bishops then escorted the king to his seat on the right-hand side of the choir, with the Royal Standard on his right side and the banner of the Order of the Seraphim on his left. The Bishop of Str√§ngn√§s and the rest of the bishops then awaited the approach of the queen; when she arrived the Bishop of Str√§ngn√§s greeted her with: \\"Blessed is she who cometh in the Name of the Lord\\", while the Bishop of H√§rn√∂sand said a prayer virtually identical to the one previously said for the king. The Bishop of Str√§ngn√§s and the other bishops then escorted the queen to her seat on the left hand side of the choir where the king and queen both knelt for a few moments of private prayer while the regalia were deposited upon the altar. The Archbishop began the service by singing: \\"Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Sabaoth\\", the normal beginning of the Swedish High Mass.I.e., only the first half, the liturgy of the word. The Bishop of Skara recited the Creed before the altar and the hymn \\"Come, thou Holy Spirit, come\\" was sung. The Litany and then an anthem were sung during which the king went to his throne on a dais before the altar with the Royal Standard being borne on his right and the banner of the Order of the Seraphim on his left. Following this, the Regalia was brought forward. The king's mantle and Crown Prince's coronet were removed and placed on the altar, and the kneeling king was vested in the Royal Mantle by a state minister while the Archbishop read the first chapter of the Gospel of St. John. The Minister of Justice recited the oath to the king, which he took while laying three fingers on the Bible. Following this, the Archbishop anointed the king on his forehead, breast, temples and wrists, saying: > The Almighty everlasting God pour out His Holy Spirit into your soul and > mind, plans and undertakings, by whose gift may you so rule land and kingdom > as to redound to the honour and glory of God, maintain justice and equity > and be for the good of the land and people. The king then rose and resumed his seat on his throne, where the Archbishop and the Minister of Justice crowned him conjointly, the Archbishop praying a prepared prayer that the king's reign might be good and prosperous. The king was then invested with the Sceptre by Archbishop and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, while the Orb was given him by Count Hamilton, the Archbishop reading set prayers for both of these events. A Key was then delivered to the king by the Major-General of Nordin, as the Archbishop said the following prayer: > God the Almighty who of His divine providence hath raised you to this royal > dignity, grant you to unlock treasures of wisdom and truth for your people, > to lock out error, vices and sloth from your kingdom and to provide for the > industrious prosperity and increase, relief and comfort for the suffering > and afflicted. The unsheathed coronation sword was then placed in the king's hand as the Archbishop said a prayer that the king might use his power well and justly. The Archbishop returned to the altar. With the king seated on his throne, crowned and bearing the Sceptre in his right hand and the Orb in his left, the State Herald standing behind the throne now cried out: > Now has (name) been crowned king over the lands of Swedes, the Goths and the > Wends. He and no other. A hymn was then sung, following which the Archbishop said a prayer and gave the king is his blessing. As a second anthem was sung, the queen now left her seat in the choir and proceeded to her throne on the dais before the altar. She knelt, was invested in her Royal Mantle, anointed by the Archbishop on her forehead and wrists, and crowned by the Archbishop. Taking her seat on her throne, she was next invested with her Sceptre and Orb, the Archbishop using the forms used for the king, but appropriately adapted for the queen. Then the State Herald, standing behind her throne, proclaimed her queen and the choir sung \\"Prosperity to the Queen\\", followed by the singing of a hymn. The Archbishop next said a prayer similar to the one he said for the king and gave the queen his blessing. Homage was now done, following which the procession left the cathedral during the singing of the hymn, \\"Now thank we all our God\\".Coronation Rites, by Reginald Maxwell Woolley, B.D. Cambridge: at the University Press. 1915. This rite was last used to crown Oscar II in 1873; subsequent kings of Sweden elected not to be crowned, though there is no law or constitutional provision preventing a coronation. The current monarch, Carl XVI Gustaf, simply took the then-required regal assurance (Swedish: Konungaf√∂rs√§kran) during a meeting of the cabinet and afterwards, was enthroned in a simple ceremony at the throne room of the Royal Palace in Stockholm on 19 September 1973. The crown jewels were displayed on cushions to the right and left of the royal throne, but were never given to the king. Carl Gustaf made an accession speech, which comprised the main purpose of the undertaking. = United Kingdom = Victoria Edward I of England invests his son with the title of Prince of Wales The United Kingdom is the only country in Europe that still practises coronations. All other countries have either become republics, never practiced coronations, or replaced the coronation with an inauguration ceremony. The Coronation of the British monarch takes place in Westminster Abbey. , which is a Royal Peculiar (a church directly under the monarch). The king or queen enters the abbey in procession, and is seated on a \\"Chair of Estate\\" as the Archbishop of Canterbury goes to the east, south, west and north of the building asking if those present are willing to pay homage to their new ruler. Once the attendees respond affirmatively, the Archbishop administers the Coronation Oath, and a Bible is presented by both the Archbishop (representing the Church of England) and, since 1953, the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. Once this is done, the actual crowning can take place. The monarch is crowned while seated upon the ancient St. Edward's Chair, or Coronation chair, which would include the Scottish Stone of Scone, currently kept in Edinburgh Castle. A canopy is held over the new ruler's head, while the Archbishop anoints him or her with holy oil on the hands, breast and head, concluding with a special blessing. Spurs and the Sword of State are presented, followed by the Sovereign's Orb (which is immediately returned to the altar), the Sceptre with the Dove and the Sceptre with the Cross. Once this is done, the Archbishop of Canterbury places the Crown of St. Edward upon the monarch's head. If a queen consort is present, she is crowned at this point in a simple ritual.This applies to female consorts only. If the new monarch is a female, her husband (if any) is not crowned. Afterwards, the new ruler is seated upon the throne, and receives homage from various members of the British clergy and nobility. Holy Communion is given to the sovereign, who then enters St. Edward's Chapel as the Te Deum is sung, where he or she exchanges St. Edward's Crown for the Imperial State Crown and exits the church wearing the crown and carrying the Sceptre with the Cross and Orb as \\"God Save the King (or Queen)\\" is sung. The ceremony as conducted in 1953 also functioned as the coronation rite for the realms within the Commonwealth which recognise Elizabeth II as their monarch, by the text of the administered oath including the seven separate Commonwealth kingdoms in existence as the time, as well as a general statement regarding other territories. The Prince of Wales, a title traditionally held by the heir to the British throne, may go through a ceremony of his own known as the Investiture of the Prince of Wales, though such a ritual is not required to hold this title or the privileges that come with it. The ceremony, when held, may take place in Wales or in England (the most recent investiture took place at Caernarvon Castle, Wales), and includes the placement of a coronet upon the prince's head. = The Vatican = From 1305 to 1963 the Popes were crowned with the Papal Tiara in a coronation ceremony in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. Following the decision of the last crowned Pope, Saint Paul VI, to lay the Papal tiara on the high altar of the Basilica as a symbol of humility, the next four popes declined to wear it, and instituted a ceremony of papal inauguration rather than a formal coronation. While the popes John Paul I, John Paul II (who also completely abandoned the use of the sedia gestatoria, a portable throne), Benedict XVI and Francis opted for an inauguration instead of a coronation, any future pope can, in theory, opt for the coronation ritual.

It sits uneasily between the ancient genres of geography and lexicography, taking elements from both but serving as a member of neither.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 106. It is, according to many, the most important book for the study of the Land of Israel in the Roman period.R. Steven Notley and Ze'ev Safrai, Eusebius, Onomasticon - A Triglott Edition with Notes and Commentary, Introduction Background Eusebius' description of his own method, who wrote: \\"I shall collect the entries from the whole of the divinely inspired Scriptures, and I shall set them out grouped by their initial letters so that one may easily perceive what lies scattered throughout the text,\\"Onomasticon p. 2.14ff., qtd. and tr. Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 107. implies that he had no similar type of book to work from; his work being entirely original, based only on the text of the Bible.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 106‚Äì7. Others have suggested that Eusebius had at his disposal early Roman maps of the Roman Empire with which to work, and which allowed him to record the precise distances between locations in Roman miles.Yoel Elitzur, Ancient Toponyms in Eretz-Israel as Preserved among the Arabs - The Linguistic Aspects, Hebrew University: Jerusalem 1992, Introduction Needless to say, this innovation has been very useful to modern research. Of the approximate 980 Biblical and New Testament names of places contained in those works, Eusebius identifies some 340 with locations known in his own day and age. The primary source for the Onomasticon is Codex Vaticanus, Gr. 1456 which dates from the 11th or 12th century. Klostermann published a scientific edition of the manuscript in 1904, using in addition four other manuscripts. Dependent upon the Codex Vaticanus manuscript is Codex Parisinus Gr 464 which dates from the 16th century. These two manuscripts were edited and published by Lagarde in 1870. Eusebius organizes his entries into separate categories according to their first letters. The entries for Joshua under Tau, for example, read as follows:Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 107. > Tina (Kinah, 15:22): of the tribe of Judah. > Telem (15:24): of the tribe of Judah. > Tessam ([Azem] 15:29): of the tribe of Judah. > Tyre ([Zer] 19:35): of the tribe of Naphthali. Under each letter, the entries are organized first by the book they are found in, and then by their place in that book. In almost all of the entries in his geographical opus, Eusebius brings down the respective distances in Roman \\"milestones\\" (semeia) from major points of reference, such as from Jerusalem, Beit Gubrin (Eleutheropolis), Hebron, Ptolemais, Caesarea, etc. In Eusebius' Onomasticon, distances between each \\"milestone\\" were usually 1,600 meters‚Äì1,700 meters, although the standard Roman mile was 1,475 meters. Since most villages in the Onomasticon are far removed from Roman-built roads, scholars have concluded that Eusebius did not glean the geographical information from maps based on a milestone survey, but rather collected the information from some other source.Benjamin Isaac and Israel Roll, Roman Roads in Judaea I ‚Äì The Legio-Scythopolis Road, B.A.R. International Series, Oxford 1982, p. 12 Where there is a contemporary town at the site or nearby, Eusebius notes it in the corresponding entry. \\"Terebinth\\", for example, describes Shechem as \\"near Neapolis\\", modern Nablus, and \\"Tophet\\" is located \\"in the suburbs of Jerusalem\\". = Date = The Onomasticon has traditionally been dated before 324, on the basis of its sparse references to Christianity, and complete absence of remarks on Constantine the Great's buildings in the Holy Land. The work also describes traditional religious practices at the oak of Mamre as though they were still happening, while they are known to have been suppressed soon after 325, when a church was built on the site.Barnes, \\"Onomasticon\\", 413. Eusebius references the encampment of the Legio X Fretensis at Aila (in southern Israel, near modern Aqaba and Eilat); the X Fretensis was probably transferred from Jerusalem to Aila under Diocletian (r. 284‚Äì305).Barnes, \\"Onomasticon\\", 413 n. 4. Jerome provided a Latin translation of Eusebius' Onomasticon, which Jerome translated in anno 388 CE while living in Bethlehem. Jerome's Latin edition includes various designations, based on the different manuscripts available to him. This Latin version of Eusebius' Onomasticon became the main source for research of Palestine in the west. The edition published by Paul de Lagarde includes the Latin work compiled by Jerome under the title, Hieronymi de situ et nominibus locorum hebraicorum liber. = Language = Eusebius compiled his work in Greek, although a Latin translation of the Onomasticon was made by Jerome in little over half-a- century later. Greco-Roman referents are used by Eusebius in his Onomasticon for Hebrew names, such as Ailia for Jerusalem, Nicopolis for Emmaus, Diospolis for Lydda (Lod), Eleutheropolis for Beit Gubrin, Azotus for Ashdod, Jamnia for Yavne, Neapolis for Shechem, Scythopolis for Beit Shean, Diocaesarea for Sepphoris, Philadelphia for Amman, and Ptolemais for Acco.

European-style coronation of Queen SƒÅlote Tupou III, 11 October 1918. Coronations in Oceania are, or were, held in the following countries:  By country  = Fiji = Bau island chief Seru Epenisa Cakobau used Western cannons and muskets to subdue most of Fiji. He was crowned as Fiji's sovereign by European traders and residents, who desired a stable government in Fiji in order to safeguard their investments. Cakobau was crowned in May 1867 as King of Bau, and recognized as King of Fiji in 1871. Later, sovereign authority over Fiji passed to the British crown, until Fiji regained its independence in 1970. Fiji is now a republic, though it recognizes Elizabeth II as Paramount Chief. = Hawaii = Hawaii. The Kingdom of Hawaii held a coronation ritual for King KalƒÅkaua and Queen Kapiolani on February 12, 1883, nine years after his accession. KalƒÅkaua's accession in 1874 saw no ceremony due to the political unrest at the time and his unpopularity with the Emmaites, supporters of Queen Emma. He was speedily sworn in as monarch at Kƒ´na ªu Hale, the chamberlain's quarter next to the Iolani Palace. Prior to this, the three previous monarchs were inaugurated at Kawaiahao Church, where the feather cloak of Kamehameha was placed upon their shoulder. Two golden crowns were manufactured in England for KalƒÅkaua's subsequent crowning ceremony, and a large pavilion was erected in front of the newly completed Iolani Palace, into which the royals proceeded accompanied by bearers carrying the kahili, the ancient symbols of Hawaiian royalty. Given the diadem by a Reverend McIntosh, KalƒÅkaua crowned himself, since no one was deemed sacred enough to crown an alii. He then crowned his queen. When the crown was unable to sit on Kapiolan's elaborate hair, it was forced on, bringing the queen to tears. KalƒÅkaua's sister Liliuokalani reported that at the moment of his crowning, the sun was obscured by a cloud which gave way to reveal a single bright star. Since this incident occurred during daylight, it caused a sensation among the assembled witnesses. Liliuokalani, who succeeded KalƒÅkaua in 1891, did not have a coronation prior to her overthrow in 1893 and the abolition of the Hawaiian monarchy. = Niue = Unlike the other islands of Polynesia, Niue had no nationally organized government or single ruling chief until the beginning of the 18th century. Before then, chiefs and heads of families exercised authority over different segments of the population. Around 1700 the concept of kingship appear to have been introduced through contact with Samoa or Tonga, and from then a succession of patu-iki (kings) ruled the island, the first of whom was Puni-mata who bathed in Papatea, near Hakupu. The island was ceded to the British Crown by the eighth Patu-iki, Togia-Pulu-toaki in 1900. Niue's kingship system was non-hereditary, leaders being elected by the population from among the heads of influential families. Following their election they were ceremonially anointed using traditional rituals, rather than European-style coronations. The new king was required to bathe or ceremonially cleanse himself by washing his body with scented (manogi) oils. A senior chief would then anoint (fakauku) the new ruler by dipping a lau-mamƒÅlu leave in a cup of coconut oil, then striking the king's head three times. Songs (lologo) were composed and sung at the feast (katoaga) held to honor the king after his anointment; many examples survive through oral traditions to this today. Each village would send representatives to attend the ceremony; others performed various services, such as providing the stone against which the king sat to be anointed, called a pepe. Two stones are in the village of Alofi where Tui-toga and Fata-a-iki were anointed. They are rough flat coral rocks, about four feet high and two feet wide. One other pillar-like stone lies at Tuapa; it was twelve feet high, sixty feet long, and fifty feet wide, although history doesn't record which kings were anointed there. Seventy or eighty yards away were stone seats reserved for the council of chiefs. Only the last three Niuean monarchs' anointment were recorded by Westerners: Tui-toga, the first Christian king, was anointed on March 2, 1875, Fata-a-iki was anointed on November 21, 1888, and Togia-Pulu-toaki, the last king, was anointed on June 30, 1898.S. Percy Smith, Niuƒì-fekai (or Savage) Island and its People, 1903, pp.38-42 = Rarotonga = The Kingdom of Rarotonga in reality had many Arikis or kings ruling at once. The Ariki of Rarotonga was ceremonially anointed upon pillar stones similar to the Niuean kings, although their traditions were much older. In Arai Te Tonga, a marae, the spiritual center of the island, the pillar called Tau-Makeva was the location of many anointments in the island's history. = Samoa = Chiefs of Samoa were anointed in traditional ceremonies. Malietoa Talavou Tonumaipe‚Äôa was anointed at Mulinu'u, the royal seat, on May 24, 1879. Malietoa Laupepa was anointed on March 19, 1880, according to the Samoan custom, and installed at Mulinu'u. Malietoa Mataafa was anointed on September 9, 1888, at Faleula, Upolu.http://www.janesoceania.com/samoa_chron_history/ The Malietoas were recognized as Kings of Samoa by the Europeans during the 19th centuries even though they were not the only chiefs of the island. = Tahiti = Crown of Tahiti. The crown was a gift from the London Missionary Society to King P≈çmare III for his coronation in 1824. The original is housed in the Museum of Tahiti and the Islands in Punaauia. Tahiti was ruled by native kings (and one queen) of the P≈çmare dynasty from 1788 to 1880, when the last monarch, P≈çmare V, ceded his country to France. Details from the coronation ritual of P≈çmare II, second King of Tahiti (1791), have been preserved. The rite centered upon the maro ura, a sacred girdle symbolizing P≈çmare's status and power, composed of yellow and red feathers, five yards long by fifteen inches wide. Black feathers bordered the garment's top and bottom. This robe also contained the auburn hair of Richard Skinner, one of the mutineers from the H.M.S. Bounty who had elected to stay in Tahiti when Fletcher Christian set out for Pitcairn Island. As the ship's barber, Skinner commanded special prestige among Tahitians, who valued his red hair and wove some of it into their maro ura. Also incorporated into the girdle was a red British pennant, which Samuel Wallis of the H.M.S. Dolphin had raised on Tahiti when he took possession of it for the British crown in 1767. The Tahitians had torn down this flag, and woven it into their royal robe as a symbol of their own sovereignty over their island.Possessing Tahiti.

To receive this cloak, P≈çmare went to his sacred marae, donned the cloak, then took the left eyes of certain sacrificial victims and acted as if he were going to eat them. He also listened to the cries of sacred birds and to a volley of musketry fired in his honor by certain Bounty mutineers who were on the scene. Following this, the new king was treated to a dance, with Tahitian men pretending to cover him with excrement and semen as a kind of honor.Possessing Tahiti.

By 1824, when his son P≈çmare III was crowned, the Tahitian coronation ritual had changed significantly, under the influence of foreign Christian missionaries. This time, a European-style rite was enacted, with the new king escorted to the Royal Chapel in Papeete behind a procession of flower-strewing girls accompanied by governors, judges and other civil servants. After being anointed and crowned, P≈çmare was given a Bible and had a sermon preached to him. The festivities concluded with the proclamation of an amnesty and a coronation banquet. Similar coronation ceremonies were performed by Prostestant missionaries, not just in Tahiti, but in the other French Polynesian islands, including the Leeward kingdoms of Huahine, Raiatea, and Bora Bora, and even the Austral Island of Rurutu. = Tonga = The ancient kings of Tonga were always crowned at Kanakubolu, near Hihifo, where they took the title of Tui Kanakubolu. The tree under which they sat was torn down in a gale in the 1890s; George Tupou II had pieces of wood from the fallen tree inlaid into the throne of Tonga. George and his successor, SƒÅlote Tupou III, were crowned on 17 March 1893 and 11 October 1918, respectively. A European coronation ceremony had been introduced to the islands by Western missionaries, where it followed a centuries-old traditional Tongan rite involving the ritual drinking of kava by the new king, together with the receipt of dozens of cooked pigs and baskets of food. In 1967 Tonga crowned king TƒÅufa ªƒÅhau Tupou IV, while George Tupou V was crowned in 2008 and Tupou VI in 2015. All rulers participated in elaborate ceremonies complete with a large gold crown, sceptre, and throne. The Christian character of Tonga's monarchy was reiterated in the 2008 event--together with Tonga's former ties to Great Britain--as Anglican Archbishop of Polynesia Jabez Brice anointed King George Topou V with sacred chrism, just as in the British rite. However, the Master of the Royal Household, the Honourable Tu'ivauavou, described the kava ritual (as opposed to the Western-style ceremony) as \\"the true coronation\\", a sentiment echoed by royal spokesman Ma'u Kakala. = Wallis and Futuna =  Alo   Sigave   Uvea   See also  * Monarchies in Oceania  References  External links * Footage of the \\"Couronnement du Roi d'Uvea\\".

The TAS-NY was formed by Grace Hoadley Dodge in 1907 to protect native-born and immigrant women from the moral dangers, especially \\"white slavery\\", that were thought to be rampant at urban train stations and piers. Upon Dodge's death in 1914, Orin Baker became the face of the Travelers Aid movement in New York and the United States. He criss-crossed the country to promote travelers' aid as a legitimate subfield of the emerging social work profession. While in California, he helped establish the Travelers Aid Society of California for the purpose of providing travelers' aid to the female visitors of the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition. Under his leadership, local Travelers Aid Societies and similar organizations were federated to form the National Travelers Aid Society in 1917. That same year he published the first travelers' aid textbook, Travelers Aid Society in America. Baker abruptly resigned from both the Travelers Aid Society of New York and the National Travelers Aid Association in 1919 when he thought Board members were attempting to undermine his authority within the movement.

Music Aerial view of Reading Festival 2007 Every year, Reading hosts the Reading Festival, which has been running since 1971. The festival takes place on the Friday, Saturday and Sunday of the August bank holiday weekend. Since 1999, Reading has been twinned with a simultaneous festival in Leeds, with the same acts appearing at both festivals on different days. In 2005, the main festival spawned the Reading Fringe Festival. Set up by a group of musicians, promoters, film- makers and artists, it helps showcase acts and performers in the town's venues in the run-up to the main festival. For some twenty years until 2006, Reading was also known for its WOMAD Festival. However, the event eventually outgrew its Rivermead site. As of 2007, amid much controversy, the event relocated to Wiltshire in the form of Womad Charlton Park. The Head of Culture, Chris Smith ‚Äì tasked with keeping WOMAD in Reading ‚Äì was on holiday at the time of the announcement that WOMAD was to move. He later took a senior job with WOMAD. WOMAD Festival Reading 2003 Perhaps the most notable home-grown artist is Mike Oldfield of Tubular Bells fame. Slowdive, The Cooper Temple Clause, Stuart Price, Morning Runner, My Luminaries, Does It Offend You, Yeah?, OK Tokyo, Pete & The Pirates, SixNationState, Blueboy, Pure Reason Revolution, Exit Ten, Sylosis, Malefice, The Arusha Accord, Bennet and Mr Fogg have had some degree of success. Left-field experimental pop band Lemon Kittens also started life there in the late 1970s, and 60s folk-blues artist turned avant-gardist Mike Cooper also. David Byron, first and most famous singer of hard rock band Uriah Heep, lived his last years in Reading before he died in 1985. The Chemical Brothers attended Reading Blue Coat school.

Rock singer Nathan James, finalist from Andrew Lloyd Webber musical theatre revival search show Superstar, is from Sonning- on-Thames in Berkshire. Reading plays host to semi-professional and amateur choirs and choral societies. Reading Festival Chorus has celebrated its 60th anniversary. RFC sings a diverse music programme, with works like Mozart's Requiem, Karl Jenkins' The Armed Man in 2005 to Beethoven's Missa Solemnis and a summer programme of English and American folk songs by Tippett and Aaron Copland. Reading has several orchestras. The long-established Reading Symphony Orchestra (RSO) is one of the town's amateur orchestras, led by a professional conductor and leader. It presents four main concerts a year, and is often engaged to work in collaboration with other musical organisations and for private functions. The Aldworth Philharmonic Orchestra (APO), founded in 2002 and named after Richard Aldworth, the founder of Reading Blue Coat School, rehearses and plays most of its concerts at the school. APO's remit is to be as innovative as possible, giving local people the chance to play by rehearsing exclusively at weekends, attracting a wider audience to classical music (especially younger people) through its 'Concert Virgin Scheme' and education projects, and championing the music of talented young composers. Reading Youth Orchestra (RYO) provides an opportunity for younger musicians. The Berkshire Maestros organisation provides music making opportunities for young people in Berkshire and is based at Stoneham Court in Tilehurst, Reading. The trust supports hundreds of young musicians across the county, offering teacher-run groups such as regional and local choirs, orchestras and bands - many of which regularly perform at national and international level.

The Hexagon is a multi-purpose venue in the heart of Reading that provides rock, pop, comedy, classical music and dance as well as theatre. Performances have included Reel Big Fish and their mix of ska-punk as well as comedy from Russell Howard. South Street presents performing arts from both the professional and community sectors, including fringe theatre, comedy, music, dance and live literature. Amateur theatre venues in Reading include Progress Theatre, a self-governing, self-funding theatre group and registered charity founded in 1947 that operates and maintains its own 97-seat theatre.

Reading is also home to the Rep College. Established in 1997 it is based at the Rising Sun Arts Centre in Silver Street. It is a professional training college for actors and produces 14 public shows each year. Arts The remaining Huntley & Palmers building was an arts centre for a while Reading has a history of grassroots arts movements. The unoccupied 21 South Street, previously a school and an unemployment (dole) office, was temporarily squatted by artists in March 1985 and this action eventually led to its becoming a council run arts centre. Similarly, an occupation of the condemned former Huntley & Palmers building in 1989 took place by a collective of artists, calling it the Biscuit Base, in an attempt to put pressure on Reading Borough Council to provide more art space. This action did not secure it as art space, but did eventually lead to it being recognised by the Council as a historic building. The facade was reprieved from demolition and converted to housing. In 1990, participants in the failed Biscuit Base action occupied a former temperance house in Silver Street which became the town's independent art centre, The Rising Sun Arts Centre. There are a number of works of public art in Reading. =Media= Reading has three local newspapers, The Reading Chronicle published weekly, on Thursdays and The Reading Post published on Wednesday and Fridays. A local publishing company, the Two Rivers Press, has published over 70 book titles, many on the topic of local history and art.

Local television news programmes are the BBC's South Today and ITV's Meridian Tonight. Literature Reading Gaol, one-time home to Oscar Wilde Reading's best known literary connection is with Oscar Wilde, who was imprisoned in Reading Gaol from 1895 to 1897. While he was there, he wrote De Profundis, which was published in 1905. After his release, he lived in exile in France and wrote The Ballad of Reading Gaol, based on his experience of an execution carried out in Reading Gaol whilst he was imprisoned there. It was first published in 1898 under the pseudonym C.3.3, Wilde's erstwhile cell number. Abbey Gateway, where Jane Austen went to school Other authors lived in and around Reading.

Blessed Dominic of the Mother of God, born Dominic Barberi (22 June 1792 - 27 August 1849), an Italian theologian and author, died in Reading. On 27 August 1849 he was travelling from London to Woodchester when, at Pangbourne, he suffered a heart attack. On being taken to the Railway Tavern at Reading (later the Duke of Edinburgh Hotel, now demolished) he died after being given absolution. He was beatified by Pope Paul VI in 1963.Dominic Barberi Several authors have written about Reading. Thomas Hardy painted a rather disparaging picture of the town, lightly disguised as Aldbrickham, in his 1895 novel Jude the Obscure. Jerome K. Jerome also did not warm to the town on his famous journey up the Thames in Three Men in a Boat (1888). He does, however, recognise the historical significance of Reading. Jasper Fforde set his series of Jack Spratt literary crime novels in this town. The comic novel A Melon for Ecstasy by John Fortune and John Wells is set in and around Reading. T. E. Lawrence lost the first draft of his Seven Pillars of Wisdom at Reading railway station. Charles Dickens was asked to stand as MP for Reading, but declined.

Patrick Hamilton set his 1953 novel, Mr. Stimpson and Mr. Gorse, in Reading. Other Entrance to the Reading Old Cemetery at Cemetery Junction in East Reading When Ricky Gervais (born in Reading) used to perform a stand-up comedy segment on the British TV show The 11 O'Clock Show, he would often (comically) describe the residents of the Reading suburb Whitley as the lowest members of society. This turned Whitley into a household name for the duration of the series. His film Cemetery Junction although filmed elsewhere in the UK, is based in 1970s Reading and is named after a busy junction in East Reading. The roadside chain of restaurants Little Chef began in the town back in 1958. Its first branch was a small venue that could house eleven patrons. A Reading edition of Monopoly is available (see Localized versions of the Monopoly game). Reading is not officially a city, having missed out during the millennium celebrations when the Queen instead granted Brighton and Hove city status in 2000.

The show, considered to one of the first reality television shows, followed the lives of the Wilkins family. Reading is the location of the musical comedy television show Beautiful People, which is a fictional adaptation of the writings of Simon Doonan, who grew up in the town. In a 2007 poll by Readers Digest, Reading was named the worst place in Britain to live for families. However the methodology of the survey was questioned by some of the locals, with only three towns of population greater than 40,000 included amongst the \\"winners\\". The demonym for a person from Reading can be any of Readingensian, synonymous with the local league Rugby team Redingensians based in Sonning, Readinger or Readingonian. The Canadian news and public affairs radio show As It Happens, on CBC Radio One, frequently refers to the town in stories and interviews from the UK, noting the location of the piece by its distance from Reading. The reference is usually in both standard lengths (miles and/or kilometres) and some strange measurement linked to the story, such as the number of garden gnomes, laid end-to-end. This now-traditional joking practice began in the 1970s when a British-born producer noted on a script that a small village mentioned in a story was located 'nine miles from Reading'. It was intended to clarify the location for staff and listeners, but most were unfamiliar with the town, and it quickly became a running joke on the show to identify any story location in the UK, no matter how well-known or how far from Reading, by its distance from the town. The practice has been given credit for boosting Reading's profile in North America and also for drawing Canadian tourists who are fans of the program to visit Reading while in England. Reading Carnival is an annual event that has been held on the May bank Holiday Monday for several years. The carnival celebrates the large West Indian community that has resided in Reading since the 1950s and its integration into the town.

Muhammad said to Fatimah: \\"I have married you to the dearest of my family to me.\\". This family is glorified by Muhammad frequently and he declared them as his Ahl al- Bayt in events such as Mubahala and hadith like the Hadith of the Event of the Cloak. They were also glorified in the Qur'an in several cases such as the Verse of Purification.. Ali had four children born to Fatimah, the only child of Muhammad to have progeny. They are Hasan, Husayn, Zaynab and Umm Kulthum bint Ali. Their two sons (Hasan and Husain) were cited by Muhammad to be his own sons, honored numerous times in his lifetime and titled \\"the leaders of the youth of Jannah\\" (Heaven, the hereafter.)See:  Their marriage lasted until Fatimah's death eight years later. Although polygamy was permitted, Ali did not marry another woman while Fatimah was alive, and his marriage to her possesses a special spiritual significance for all Muslims because it is seen as the marriage between two great figures surrounding Muhammad. After Fatimah's death, Ali married other wives and fathered many children.  Marriage  Many of Muhammad's companions asked for Fatimah's hand in marriage including Abu Bakr and Umar. Muhammad turned them all down saying that he was awaiting a sign of her destiny.\\"Fatimah\\", Encyclopaedia of Islam. Brill Online. Ali, Muhammad's cousin, also had a desire to marry Fatimah but did not have the courage to approach Muhammad due to his (Ali's) poverty. Even when he mustered up the courage and went to see Muhammad, he could not vocalise his intention but remained silent. Muhammad understood the reason for his being there and prompted Ali to confirm that he had come to seek Fatimah in marriage. He suggested that Ali had a shield, which if sold, would provide sufficient money to pay the bridal gift (mahr).Fatimah bint Muhammad . Muslim Students' Association (West) Compendium of Muslim Texts. Muhammad put forward the proposal from Ali to Fatimah who remained silent and did not protest which Muhammad took to be a sign of affirmation and consent.Amin. Vol. 4. p. 100. The marriage took place on Friday, 1 Dhu al- Hijjah AH 2 (24 February AD 624) when Fatimah was eighteen years old (she was born on Friday, 20 Jumada al-Thani, 10 September 605). Ali was 22.Ordoni (1990) pp. 42-45. Her age at marriage is sometimes given as nineteen - this is a result of mechanically subtracting 605 (the year of her birth) from 624 (the year she was married). Muhammad told Ali that he had been ordered by God to give his daughter Fatimah to Ali in marriage. Muhammad said to Fatimah: \\"I have married you to the dearest of my family to me.\\" Ali sold his shield to raise the money needed for the wedding, as suggested by Muhammad. However, Uthman ibn Affan, to whom the shield was sold, returned it back to Ali saying it was his wedding gift to Ali and Fatimah. Muhammad himself performed the wedding ceremony and two of his wives, Aisha and Umm Salama, prepared the wedding feast with dates, figs, sheep and other food donated by various members of the Medinan community. According to Hossein Nasr, their marriage possesses a special spiritual significance for all Muslims because it is seen as the marriage between the greatest saintly figures surrounding Muhammad. Some reports say that Fatimah was born on Friday, 20 Jumada al-Thani, 19 September 615. This is not possible, given that her mother was then a few months shy of her sixtieth birthday. Her age at marriage is given as nine years, again wrong as her wedding day was eight years and five months after her supposed date of birth. Again, her son Hasan was born nine months after the marriage, when she would have barely turned nine years of age. Fatimah's marriage lasted over eight years and ended when she died. Although polygamy is permitted by Islam, Ali did not marry another woman while Fatimah was alive.  Poverty  After her marriage to Ali, the wedded couple led a life of abject poverty in contrast to her sisters who were all married to wealthy individuals. Ali had built a house not too far from Muhammad's residence where he lived with Fatimah. However, due to Fatimah's desire to be closer to her father, a Medinan (Haritha bin al-Numan) donated his own house to them. At the beginning they were extremely poor. For several years after her marriage, she did all of the work by herself. The shoulder on which she carried pitchers of water from the well was swollen and the hand with which she worked the handmill to grind corn were often covered with blisters.Ashraf (2005), pp. 42-43. Fatimah vouched to take care of the household work, make dough, bake bread, and clean the house; in return, Ali vouched to take care of the outside work such as gathering firewood, and bringing food.Ordoni (1990), p. 140. Ali worked to irrigate other people's lands by drawing water from the wells which caused him to complain of chest pains. Their life was a simple life of hardship and deprivation. Throughout their life together, Ali remained poor because he did not set great store by material wealth. To relieve their extreme poverty, Ali worked as a drawer and carrier of water and she as a grinder of corn. According to a famous Hadith, one day she said to Ali: \\"I have ground until my hands are blistered.\\" and Ali answered \\"I have drawn water until I have pains in my chest.\\". According to another hadith, one day as they were fasting a beggar came by asking for food, so they gave him their dry bread. The next day of fasting, an orphan came by and they gave him that day's meal. The third day a prisoner of war knocked their door asking for food, (Due to this incident a verse in Surat al-Insan was sent down about them) \\"For their love of Allah they fed a beggar an orphan and a prisoner of war\\"., See also: Al-Qadir vol. 3, p. 107-111, Ihqaq-al-Haqq vol. 3, p. 157-171. Their circumstances were akin to many of the Muslims at the time and only improved following the Battle of Khaybar when the produce of Khaybar was distributed among the poor. When the economic situations of the Muslims became better, Fatimah gained some maids but treated them like her family and performed the house duties with them. Another reference to their simple life comes to us from the Tasbih of Fatimah, a divine formula that was first given to Fatimah when she asked her father for a kaneez (servant girl) in order to help her with household chores. Her father asked her if she would like a gift instead that was better than a servant and worth more than everything in the world. Upon her ready agreement, he told her to recite at the end of every prayer the Great Exaltation, Allahu Akbar 34 times, the Statement of Absolute Gratitude, Alhamdulillah 33 times and the Invocation of Divine Glory, Subhan'Allah 33 times, totalling 100. This collective prayer is called the Tasbih of Fatima.  Relationship with Ali  An indication of their special relationship is found in the fact that Ali never married another woman as long as Fatima was alive. A few Sunni sources explain this curiosity in a tradition in which Ali allegedly asks for Abu Jahl's daughter in marriage, but Muhammad does not allow him to marry her because it would upset Fatima. The three most popular versions of this tradition are related by al-Miswar b. Makhrama, a Companion who was about nine years old when Muhammad died.Denise L. Soufi, \\"The Image of Fatima in Classical Muslim Thought,\\" PhD dissertation, Princeton, 1997, p. 51-52. On one occasion, a member of the house of Hisham ibn al-Mughirah proposed that Ali marry a woman from their clan. Ali did not immediately reject the proposal and when word reached Muhammad he is reported to have said, \\"Fatima is a part of me and whoever offends her offends me.\\"al- BalƒÅdÃ≤hÃ≤urƒ´, AnsƒÅb, i, 403; TirmidÃ≤hÃ≤ƒ´, ii, 319, etc. From \\"Fatimah\\", Encyclopaedia of Islam. Brill Online. However Ali did not marry another woman during his marriage to Fatima and there is strong doubt among both Sunni and Shia scholars as to if this event was authentic. It is also said upon saying this Muhammad obtained the truth from Ali who by then had no intention of marrying another woman. According to Denise L. Soufi, the purpose of the narration -in which Ali allegedly asks for Abu Jahl's daughter's hand- is to denigrate Ali or to establish the Sunni orthodoxy that the fourth Khalif, i.e. Ali, is lower in rank than the earlier ones.Denise L. Soufi, \\"The Image of Fatima in Classical Muslim Thought,\\" PhD dissertation, Princeton, 1997, p. 52. Ali was given the name of Abu Turab (the man of dust) by Muhammad. Although some sources explain this by linking it to the disputes with Fatimah where, instead of arguing with Fatimah, Ali would go and put dust on his head,A·∏•mad b. ·∏§anbal, Musnad, Cairo 1313, iv, 326; BukÃ≤hÃ≤ƒÅrƒ´, ed. Krehl, ii, 440, etc From \\"Fatimah\\", Encyclopaedia of Islam. Brill Online. other sources such as Ibn Hisham and Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal say this name was given to Ali before marriage.Ÿáÿ≤ÿßÿ± Farsi text can be accessed thru the provided link Ÿà €å⁄© ÿØÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜ ÿßÿ≤ ÿ≤ŸÜÿØ⁄ØÿßŸÜ€å‚Äå ÿßŸÖÿßŸÖ ÿπŸÑ€å‚Äåÿå ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖÿØ ÿ±ÿ∂ÿß ÿ±ŸÖÿ≤€å ÿßŸàÿ≠ÿØ€åÿå ŸÇÿßÿ®ŸÑ ÿØÿ≥ÿ™ÿ±ÿ≥€å‚Äå ÿØÿ± ÿß€åŸÜÿ¨ÿß According to the Encyclopedia of Islam, Fatimah had occasional disputes with her husband and often sought the intercession of her father who showed signs of great satisfaction upon reconciling the couple's differences. Denise L. Soufi on the other hand finds such tradition as \\"mere a narrative device to prais Ali\\". For example, she says: ((...her complaints about Ali elicit high praise from the Prophet for him. In fact, whenever Fatima has any troubles or worries in her life, it is usually praise for Ali which is used to comfort her.)) In her view, these traditions are kept for the purpose of the Sunni-Shia debate over the Caliphate, even though they are in contrast with what she describes the Shia picture of the marriage to be \\"harmonious and divinely ordained\\".Denise L. Soufi, \\"The Image of Fatima in Classical Muslim Thought,\\" PhD dissertation, Princeton, 1997, pp. 64-65, p. 202. Shia acknowledge the saying of Muhammad, \\"Fatimah is a part of me and whoever offends her offends me\\", however the context of the reporting in reference to Ali is disputed. \\"Among the many fabricated stories told against Imam Ali was that he had asked for Abu Jahl's (the chief of infidels) daughter's hand in marriage. When this news reached Fatimah (A), she rushed to her father who found out the falsity of the story.\\"\\\\- Fatimah ['a] The Gracious by Abu Muhammad Ordoni Published by: Ansariyan Publications Qum, The Islamic Republic of Iran. Shia say this statement was used by Fatimah herself when she spoke to Abu Bakr and Umar, stating that they had both displeased her.

It is used within the fields of cognitive psychology and neuroscience. In a standard dichotic listening test, a participant is presented with two different auditory stimuli simultaneously (usually speech), directed into different ears over headphones. In one type of test, participants are asked to pay attention to one or both of the stimuli; later, they are asked about the content of either the stimulus they were asked to attend to or the stimulus that they were not told to ignore. History Donald Broadbent is credited with being the first scientist to systematically use dichotic listening tests in his work. In the 1950s, Broadbent employed dichotic listening tests in his studies of attention, asking participants to focus attention on either a left- or right-ear sequence of digits. He suggested that due to limited capacity, the human information processing system needs to select which channel of stimuli to attend to, deriving his filter model of attention. In the early 1960s, Doreen Kimura used dichotic listening tests to draw conclusions about lateral asymmetry of auditory processing in the brain. She demonstrated, for example, that healthy participants have a right-ear superiority for the reception of verbal stimuli, and left-ear superiority for the perception of melodies. From that study, and others studies using neurological patients with brain lesions, she concluded that there is a predominance of the left hemisphere for speech perception, and a predominance of the right hemisphere for melodic perception. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Donald Shankweiler and Michael Studdert-Kennedy of Haskins Laboratories used a dichotic listening technique (presenting different nonsense syllables) to demonstrate the dissociation of phonetic (speech) and auditory (nonspeech) perception by finding that phonetic structure devoid of meaning is an integral part of language and is typically processed in the left cerebral hemisphere. A dichotic listening performance advantage for one ear is interpreted as indicating a processing advantage in the contralateral hemisphere. In another example, Sidtis (1981) found that healthy adults have a left-ear advantage on a dichotic pitch recognition experiment. He interpreted this result as indicating right-hemisphere dominance for pitch discrimination. During the early 1970s, Tim Rand demonstrated dichotic perception at Haskins Laboratories. In his study, the first stimuli: formant (F1), was presented to one ear while the second and third stimuli:(F2) and (F3) formants, were presented to the opposite ear. F2 and F3 varied in low and high intensity. Ultimately, in comparison to the binaural condition, \\"peripheral masking is avoided when speech is heard dichotically.\\" This demonstration was originally known as \\"the Rand effect\\" but was later renamed \\"dichotic release from masking\\". The name for this demonstration continued to evolve and was finally named \\"dichotic perception\\" or \\"dichotic listening.\\" Around the same time, Jim Cutting (1976), an investigator at Haskins Laboratories, researched how listeners could correctly identify syllables when different components of the syllable were presented to different ears. The formants of vowel sounds and their relation are crucial in differentiating vowel sounds. Even though the listeners heard two separate signals with neither ear receiving a 'complete' vowel sound, they could still identify the syllable sounds. Dichotic listening test designs =Dichotic fused words test (DFWT)= The \\"dichotic fused words test\\" (DFWT) is a modified version of the basic dichotic listening test. It was originally explored by Johnson et al. (1977) but in the early 80's Wexler and Hawles (1983) modified this original test to ascertain more accurate data pertaining to hemispheric specialization of language function. In the DFWT, each participant listens to pairs of monosyllabic rhyming consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) words. Each word varies in the initial consonant. The significant difference in this test is \\"the stimuli are constructed and aligned in such a way that partial interaural fusion occurs: subjects generally experience and report only one stimulus per trial.\\" According to Zatorre (1989), some major advantages of this method include \\"minimizing attentional factors, since the percept is unitary and localized to the midline\\" and \\"stimulus dominance effects may be explicitly calculated, and their influence on ear asymmetries assessed and eliminated.\\" Wexler and Hawles study obtained a high test-retest reliability (r=0.85). High test-retest reliability is good, because it proves that the data collected from the study is consistent. =Testing with emotional factors= An emotional version of the dichotic listening task was developed. In this version individuals listen to the same word in each ear but they hear it in either a surprised, happy, sad, angry, or neutral tone. Participants are then asked to press a button indicating what tone they heard. Usually dichotic listening tests show a right-ear advantage for speech sounds. Right-ear/left-hemisphere advantage is expected, because of evidence from Broca's area and Wernicke's area, which are both located in the left hemisphere. In contrast, the left ear (and therefore the right hemisphere) is often better at processing nonlinguistic material. The data from the emotional dichotic listening task is consistent with the other studies, because participants tend to have more correct responses to their left ear than to the right. It is important to note that the emotional dichotic listening task is seemingly harder for the participants than the phonemic dichotic listening task, meaning more incorrect responses were submitted by individuals. =Manipulation of voice onset time (VOT)= The manipulation of voice onset time (VOT) during dichotic listening tests has given many insights regarding brain function. To date, the most common design is the utilisation of four VOT conditions: short-long pairs (SL), where a Consonant-Vowel (CV) syllable with a short VOT is presented to the left ear and a CV syllable with a long VOT is presented to the right ear, as well as long-short (LS), short-short (SS) and long-long (LL) pairs. In 2006, Rimol, Eichele, and Hugdahl first reported that, in healthy adults, SL pairs elicit the largest REA while, in fact, LS pairs elicit a significant left ear advantage (LEA). A study of children 5‚Äì8 years old has shown a developmental trajectory whereby long VOTs gradually start to dominate over short VOTs when LS pairs are being presented under dichotic conditions. Converging evidence from studies of attentional modulation of the VOT effect shows that, around age 9, children lack the adult-like cognitive flexibility required to exert top-down control over stimulus-driven bottom-up processes. Arciuli et al.(2010) further demonstrated that this kind of cognitive flexibility is a predictor of proficiency with complex tasks such as reading. Neuroscience Dichotic listening tests can also be used as lateralized speech assessment task. Neuropsychologists have used this test to explore the role of singular neuroanatomical structures in speech perception and language asymmetry. For example, Hugdahl et al. (2003), investigated dichotic listening performance and frontal lobe function in left and right lesioned frontal lobe nonaphasiac patients compared to healthy controls. In the study, all groups were exposed to 36 dichotic trials with pairs of CV syllables and each patient was asked to state which syllable he or she heard best. As expected, the right lesioned patients showed a right ear advantage like the healthy control group but the left hemisphere lesioned patients displayed impairment when compared to both the right lesioned patients and control group. From this study, researchers concluded \\"dichotic listening as into a neuronal circuitry which also involves the frontal lobes, and that this may be a critical aspect of speech perception.\\" Similarly, Westerhausen and Hugdahl (2008) analyzed the role of the corpus callosum in dichotic listening and speech perception. After reviewing many studies, it was concluded that \\"...dichotic listening should be considered a test of functional inter-hemispheric interaction and connectivity, besides being a test of lateralized temporal lobe language function\\" and \\"the corpus callosum is critically involved in the top-down attentional control of dichotic listening performance, thus having a critical role in auditory laterality.\\" Language processing Dichotic listening can also be used to test the hemispheric asymmetry of language processing. In the early 60s, Doreen Kimura reported that dichotic verbal stimuli (specifically spoken numerals) presented to a participant produced a right ear advantage (REA). She attributed the right-ear advantage \\"to the localization of speech and language processing in the so-called dominant left hemisphere of the cerebral cortex.\\" According to her study, this phenomenon was related to the structure of the auditory nerves and the left-sided dominance for language processing. It is important to note that REA doesn't apply to non-speech sounds. In \\"Hemispheric Specialization for Speech Perception,\\" by Studdert- Kennedy and Shankweiler (1970) examine dichotic listening of CVC syllable pairs. The six stop consonants (b, d, g, p, t, k) are paired with the six vowels and a variation in the initial and final consonants are analyzed. REA is the strongest when the sound of the initial and final consonants differ and it is the weakest when solely the vowel is changed. Asbjornsen and Bryden (1996) state that \\"many researchers have chosen to use CV syllable pairs, usually consisting of the six stop consonants paired with the vowel \\\\a\\\\\\\\. Over the years, a large amount of data has been generated using such material.\\" Selective attention In selective attention experiments, the participants may be asked to repeat aloud the content of the message they are listening to. This task is known as shadowing. As Colin Cherry (1953) found, people do not recall the shadowed message well, suggesting that most of the processing necessary to shadow the attended to message occurs in working memory and is not preserved in the long-term store. Performance on the unattended message is worse. Participants are generally able to report almost nothing about the content of the unattended message. In fact, a change from English to German in the unattended channel frequently goes unnoticed. However, participants are able to report that the unattended message is speech rather than non-verbal content. In addition to this, if the content of the unattended message contains certain information, such as the listener's name, then the unattended message is more likely to be noticed and remembered. A demonstration of this was done by Conway, Cowen, and Bunting (2001) in which they had subjects shadow words in one ear while ignoring words in the other ear. At some point, the subject's name was spoken in the ignored ear, and the question was whether the subject would report hearing their name. Subjects with a high working memory (WM) span were more capable of blocking out the distracting information. Also if the message contains sexual words then people usually notice them immediately. This suggests that the unattended information is also undergoing analysis and keywords can divert attention to it. Sex differences Some data gathered from dichotic listening test experiments suggests that there is possibly a small-population sex difference in perceptual and auditory asymmetries and language laterality. According to Voyer (2011), \\"Dichotic listening tasks produced homogenous effect sizes regardless of task type (verbal, non-verbal), reflecting a significant sex difference in the magnitude of laterality effects, with men obtaining larger laterality effects than women.\\" However, the authors discuss numerous limiting factors ranging from publication bias to small effect size. Furthermore, as discussed in \\"Attention, reliability, and validity of perceptual asymmetries in the fused dichotic words test,\\" women reported more \\"intrusions\\" or words presented to the uncued ear than men when presented with exogenous cues in the Fused Dichotic Word Task which suggests two possibilities: 1) Women experience more difficulty paying attention to the cued word than men and/or 2) regardless of the cue, women spread their attention evenly as opposed to men who may possibly focus in more intently on exogenous cues. Effect of schizophrenia A study conducted involving the dichotic listening test, with emphasis on subtypes of schizophrenia (particularly paranoid and undifferentiated), demonstrated that paranoid schizophrenics have the largest left hemisphere advantage ‚Äì with undifferentiated schizophrenics (where psychotic symptoms are present but the criteria for paranoid, disorganized, or catatonic types have not been met) having the smallest. The application of the dichotic listening test helped to further the beliefs that preserved left hemisphere processing is a product of paranoid schizophrenia, and in contrast, that the left hemisphere's lack of activity is a symptom of undifferentiated schizophrenia. In 1994, M.F. Green and colleagues tried to relate \\"the functional integration of the left hemisphere in hallucinating and nonhallucinating psychotic patients\\" using a dichotic listening study. The study showed that auditory hallucinations are connected to a malfunction in the left hemisphere of the brain.  Emotions/Dichotic Listening  Dichotic listening can also be found in the emotion-oriented parts of the brain. Further study on this matter was done by Phil Bryden and his dichotic listening research focused on emotionally loaded stimuli (Hugdahl, 2015). More research, focused on how lateralization and the identification of the cortical regions of the brain created inquiries on how dichotic listening is implicated whenever two dichotic listening tasks are provided. In order to obtain results, a Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used by Jancke et al (2001) to determine the activation of parts of the brain in charge of attention, auditory stimuli to a specific emotional stimuli. Following results on this experiment clarified that the dependability of the provided stimuli (Phonetic, emotion) had a significant presence on activating the different parts of the brain in charge of the specific stimuli. However, no concerning difference in cortical activation was found.

He is remembered for the Ericksen‚ÄìLeslie Theory which he developed with Jerald Ericksen to describe the viscosity of mesophases associated with liquid crystals. The parameters of this theory are viscosities called \\"Leslie coefficients\\", and the angle at which a (flow aligning) nematic orientates with respect to the direction of flow in a steady shear flow is called the \\"Leslie angle\\". Life Frank Leslie was born in Dundee on 8 March 1935, the son of William Oglivy Leslie and his wife Catherine Pitkethy Matthews. His maternal grandfather Frank Rollo Matthews (1860 to 1921) was a bibliophile, acquiring a considerable library that the family treasured. Frank Leslie attended Harris Academy and University College, Dundee where he was awarded the B.Sc. in 1957. With a scholarship from the legacy of James Key Caird, he entered the University of Manchester for graduate study. Leslie's gifts for communication were soon appreciated as he became assistant lecturer in 1959. The mathematics department at University of Manchester was led by James Lighthill who had pioneered an understanding of thermosyphons. Leslie extended the work with his thesis \\"Problems of flow in the open thermosyphon and viscoelasticity of liquids\\" (1961). The external examiner was James G. Oldroyd, an authority on viscoelasticity. As a post-doctoral student, Leslie continued his education at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Being interested in anisotropic fluids, he wrote to Jerald Ericksen who was at Johns Hopkins University. The collaboration with Ericksen grew from that time. A position at Newcastle University provided the setting for Leslie to begin communicating his ideas. In December 1965 his important paper \\"Continuum theory of Liquid Crystals\\" appeared in Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society (60:949-55) in which he posited a \\"director\\" vector field characterizing an anisotropic fluid. In 1965 Leslie married Ellen Reoch; husband and wife crossed the Atlantic so Leslie and Ericksen could continue their collaboration at Johns Hopkins. Frank and Ellen had a daughter Sheena (born 1969) and a son Calum (born 1974). Frank and Ellen enjoyed playing golf. Frank Leslie took up his permanent position at Strathclyde University in 1968, becoming a reader in 1971 and holding a personal chair from 1979 and an established chair from 1982. There he was able to host academic visitors such as Ericksen. As Chandrasekhar writes, \\"...the formulation of general conservation laws and constitutive equations describing the mechanical behaviour of the nematic state is due to Ericksen and Leslie. Other continuum theories have been proposed, but it turns out that the Ericksen-Leslie approach is the one that is most widely used in discussing the nematic state.\\"Sivaramakrishna Chandrasekhar (1992) Liquid Crystals, 2nd edition, Ericksen-Leslie theory, pages 85 to 98, Cambridge University Press In the mid 1970s he consulted for Defence Evaluation and Research Agency at Malvern, Worcestershire with Cyril Hilsum in support of British LCD industries. Leslie demonstrated his commitment to mathematics education by serving as tutor for 20 years for the Open University. He was Justice of the Peace (JP) for 15 years representing Bearsden and Milngavie. Leslie supported the Scottish National Party and was treasurer of the party for 14 years. Further, in 1971 Leslie was elected Elder in the Church of Scotland. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1995. His proposers were George Eason, Robin Knops, Donald Pack, David Butler, John N. Sherwood and Ian Sneddon. Frank Leslie died 15 June 2000, of a pulmonary embolism after a hip replacement operation.

History  Lakhon Khol is a traditional theater performance of Cambodia. Mask theater of Cambodia having its origins during the Angkor period. It is believed to have begun during the 10th century through the inscription K.99 Sambor Prei Kuk temple in the reign of King Jayavarman V (CE 968-1001) Sambor Prei Kuk stone inscription K.99 Talk about the 50 people sent to Angkor City for a servant at Royal Palace and only 6 people in group move to home dance Khol. Lakhon Khol is believed to be a derivative of the Drama, acronym in the High Priest's Dictionary Chuon Nath. That short forms can be interpreted as a form of drama, played out in a series of short stories. The word Khol Is encountered in a number of other rocks, such as K.566-a rock above the Stung Sreng Siem Reap province inscribed at the end of the 10th century Which refers to wearing a mask dance. The theatrical drama was developed from the Khmer shadow theater called \\"Lakhon Sbeak Thom; ‚Äù. \\"Steong-Sreng\\" Siem Reap stone inscription K.566-a said the face Khol theater.(Saka 901 = A.D.979) Lakhon Khol was recorded by Henri Mouhot at a restaurant dinner with a dance performance in the Royal Palace in the city Oudong with King Ang Duong in 1856. Henri Mouhot: \\"Travel in Indochina 1848-1856, The Annam and Cambodia\\" Until the Royal King Sisowath, the royal dance in the form of dance was frequently performed for French diplomats or anthropologists to be entertained by the love of Khmer classical dance.George Groslier compiled the diary \\"Danseuses Cambodgiennes, Anciennes & Modernes\\" 1913. Royal dance in the form of Lakhon Khol means that the king royal dance is a form of dance masks. The evolution of Cambodian dance art is linked to nature, social class, and Brahmin religion, the original religion of the country India, Hindu religion, which is related to the story incorporated into the art of Cambodian dance, the liveliness of Cambodian dances are recorded by George Coedes (La dance du Cambodge) in 1944. Lakhon Khol reappeared once again in the 20th century in King Sisowath and continued to King Norodom Sihanouk in 1948, after the end of the World War II by organizing a rehearsal Initially, he visited the Vegetable History at (Lakhon Khol Wat Svay Andet) in Kandal Province, which performed theatrical theater for rainfall and peace to the community every year. The visit to Norodom Sihanouk 's Wat Svay Andet masked dance theater was published in 1948 as the first magazine in the journal \\"Kampuchea Soriya\\" by \\"Tep Pitur Chhem Krassem\\" or Duke of (Krosem Kuntheak Bondit).. Cambodia scholarship of Cambodia culture Founder Buddhist Institute of Cambodia 1930 In the Soriya Magazine (March 3, 1948), the 3rd edition was published in March 1948, titled \\"The Lakhon Khol Wat Svay Andet\\" and stated in the NPL \\"The theater is limited to the only thing related to Hinduism. Which only plays for the divinities of divisions, such as Reamker and some other things.\\" Later, there was a Giant with Hanuman statue iconic Lakhon Khol In Phnom Penh in 1954, after independence from France, but the statue lost and instead the Chuon Nath statue still remains. Another specific story of the theatrical performance is the Reamker, the Khmer legend of the Ramayana. The performance includes an introduction to storytellers who play an important role in the performance and classical music of the Pin Peat. The theater was popular in the Lon Nol era, and then became King Sihanouk's favorite wife. There were 8 teams of specialist theater and then ravaged by war, but now only one group is at Wat Svay Andet, 15 km away from Phnom Penh. Two new groups started in the war, including the Kampong Thom and National Theater troupes from the Department of Fine Arts and the Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts.

The aim may just be to show that gender relations will probably affect the solution, or to show how they will affect the solution and what could be done. Gender analysis frameworks provide a step-by-step methodology for conducting gender analysis. Concepts In many societies, although not in all, women have traditionally been disadvantaged compared to men. Until recently, studies of these societies for the purpose of planning development covered women narrowly in terms of population, health and family planning. Relatively little was known about other concerns such as domestic violence or involvement in economic activities. Gender analysis provides more information, bringing benefits to women and to society as a whole. The Women in Development (WID) approach emerged in the 1970s, calling for treatment of \\"women's issues\\" in development projects. Later, the Gender and Development (GAD) approach proposed more emphasis on gender relations rather than seeing women's issues in isolation. An example of the effect of skipping gender analysis is provided by a project that introduced handcarts to a village for use in collecting firewood. It was thought that the men would use the carts to collect the wood, freeing up the women for other activities. In fact, the men collected the wood for sale, keeping the money. As they depleted supplies near the village, the women had to travel further to collect wood. Gender analysis has commonly been used as a tool for development and emergency relief projects. The socially constructed roles of men and women must be understood in project or program design, as must roles related to class, caste, ethnicity and age. The techniques are also important in understanding management of natural resources. Gender analysis is relevant to education, although the frameworks used for development projects must be adapted to meet the needs of educational projects. Frameworks =Harvard Analytical Framework= The Harvard Analytical Framework, also called the Gender Roles Framework, was developed by the Harvard Institute for International Development in collaboration with the Women In Development office of USAID, and was first described in 1984 by Catherine Overholt and others. It was one of the earliest of such frameworks. The starting point for the framework was the assumption that it makes economic sense for development aid projects to allocate resources to women as well as men, which will make development more efficient ‚Äì a position named the ‚Äúefficiency approach\\". =Moser Framework= Caroline Moser developed the Moser Framework for gender analysis in the 1980s while working at the Development Planning Unit of the University of London. Working with Caren Levy, she expanded it into a methodology for gender policy and planning. The Moser framework follows the Gender and Development approach in emphasizing the importance of gender relations. As with the WID-based Harvard Framework, it includes collection of quantitative empirical facts. Going further, it investigates the reasons and processes that lead to conventions of access and control. The Moser Framework includes gender roles identification, gender needs assessment, disaggregating control of resources and decision making within the household, planning for balancing the triple role, distinguishing between different aims in interventions and involving women and gender-aware organizations in planning. =Gender Analysis Matrix= Rani Parker developed the Gender Analysis Matrix (GAM) in collaboration with other development practitioners to support their grassroots work for a Middle Eastern NGO. Participatory planning is a basic theme of the framework, which is flexible enough to handle situations where data collection is severeley handicapped. =Capacities and Vulnerabilities Analysis Framework= The Capacities and Vulnerabilities Analysis (CVA) was developed in a research project at Harvard University, with some of the authors having also worked on the Harvard Analystic Framework. The CVA is based on an analysis of 30 case studies of NGOs responding to disaster situations, and is designed to help in emergency aid planning to meet immediate needs while considering longer-term development needs. =Longwe's Women's Empowerment Framework= The Women's Empowerment Framework, or Longwe Framework, was developed by Sara Hlupekile Longwe, a consultant based in Lusaka, Zambia specializing in gender and development issues. The framework helps planners understand the practical meaning of women's empowerment and equality, and then to evaluate whether a development initiative supports this empowerment. The basic premise is that women's development can be viewed in terms of five levels of equality: welfare, access, \\"conscientization\\", participation and control. Empowerment is essential at each of these levels. Welfare addresses basic needs, and access addresses ability to use resources such as credit, land and education. \\"Conscientization\\" is a key element of the framework: recognition that discrimination creates gender-related problems and women may themselves contribute to this discrimination. With participation, women are equal to men in making decisions, and with control the balance of powers between the genders is equal. =Social Relations Approach= The Social Relations Approach applies a socialist feminist philosophy to gender analysis, and has been used by various government department and NGOs as a planning framework. It was developed by Naila Kabeer at Sussex University in the United Kingdom. The approach centers on the interchange between patriarchy and social relations. Unlike the Harvard Framework and the Gender Analysis Matrix, it does not focus on roles, resources and activities, but instead looks at the relations between the State, market, community and family. Relationships between women may be relevant, such as the relationship between a female servant and her mistress. Discussing the players in the process, Naila Kabeer proposes that \\"planning for women's empowerment is most likely to succeed when the process is seen as the responsibility of those who are planned for; when social action groups and grassroots movements help to counter the top-down logic of the planning process...\\" References Sources    Category:Women's rights ","title":"Gender analysis"},{"id":"32036475","text":"Petr Obdr≈æ√°lek (born September 26, 1986) is a Czech professional ice hockey left winger for HC Nov√© Z√°mky in the Tipsport Liga.

Gameplay The game is essentially a professional wrestling-style of video game that was remade into more of a \\"tournament\\" fighter. Each fight is a \\"death match\\" and seven of these must be fought in order to be crowned the champion. While this game feels like a Street Fighter II clone with a wrestling theme, it manages to capture the spirit of having the fighter with the best 2-out-of-3 rounds win the fight. Players can use land mines that are the replicas used by the Imperial Japanese Army during the Second World War; these mines can blow a rock into pieces of dirt that fly up to away from the blast site.

The first basalt hoes in the Near East would have looked similar to these. Chinese hoes made of wood Modern Hoe Hoe or \\"Al\\" is repeated excessively in the song for literary effect The Song of the hoe or the Creation of the pickax is a Sumerian creation myth, written on clay tablets from the last century of the 3rd millennium BCE. Disputations Seven debate topics are known from the Sumerian literature, falling in the category of disputations; some examples are: The Debate between sheep and grain; The Debate between bird and fish; the Debate between Winter and Summer; and The Dispute between Silver and Copper, etc. These topics came some centuries after writing was established in Sumerian Mesopotamia. The debates are philosophical and address humanity's place in the world. Some of the debates may be from 2100 BC.Sumerian literature The song of the hoe stands alone in its own sub-category as a one-sided debate poem. Compilation Three tablets of the myth are held by the British Museum, numbers 80170, 132243 (unpublished) and 139993. Two tablets of the myth are held by the Louvre in Paris, number AO 7087 & AO 8898. One is held in the Vorderasiatisches Museum Berlin, number 17378 and three at the Yale Babylonian collection, numbers 5487, 7070 and 11941. Lines of the myth were discovered on the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, catalogue of the Babylonian section (CBS), from their excavations at the temple library at Nippur. Tablets from this collection, numbers 8111, 13122, 13382 and 13864 were documented by Edward Chiera in \\"Sumerian Epics and Myths\\". Samuel Noah Kramer included CBS tablets 8531, 10310, 10335, 29.16.23, 29.16.436. He also included translations from tablets in the Nippur collection of the Museum of the Ancient Orient in Istanbul, catalogue numbers 1117, 2337, 2473, 2742. Other tablets were added from the \\"Ur excavations texts\\" in 1928 along with several others to bring it to its present form, which is virtually complete. The latest composite text and translation was produced in 1996 by H. Behrens, B. Jagersma and Joachim Krecher.The song of the hoe - Bibliography - The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature, Oxford 1998-. Story The poem is composed of the frequent use of the word \\"al\\", which means hoe. The verb-forms and nouns also frequently start with, or contain the syllable \\"al\\" (or \\"ar\\"), suggesting the writer intended it for humour as a satirical school text or as a tongue-twister. The song starts with a creation myth where Enlil separates heaven and earth in Duranki, the cosmic Nippur or 'Garden of the Gods'. The myth continues with a description of Enlil creating daylight with his hoe; he goes on to praise its construction and creation. Enlil's mighty hoe is said to be made of gold, with the blade made of lapis lazuli and fastened by cord. It is inlaid with lapis lazuli and adorned with silver and gold. Enlil makes civilized man, from a brick mould with his hoe ‚Äì and the Annanuki start to praise him. Nisaba, Ninmena, and Nunamnir start organizing things. Enki praises the hoe; they start reproducing and Enlil makes numerous shining hoes, for everyone to begin work. Enlil then founds the Ekur with his hoe whilst a \\"god-man\\" called Lord Nudimmud builds the Abzu in Eridug. Various gods are then described establishing construction projects in other cities, such as Ninhursag in Kesh, and Inanna and Utu in Zabalam; Nisaba and E-ana also set about building. The useful construction and agricultural uses of the hoe are summarized, along with its capabilities for use as a weapon and for burying the dead. Allusions are made to the scenes of Enkidu's ghost, and Urshanabi's ferry over the Hubur, in the Epic of Gilgamesh: Ninmena is suggested to create both the priestess and king. The hymn ends with extensive praisings of the hoe, Enlil, and Nisaba: Discussion Modern society may have trouble comprehending the virtue of extolling a tool such as the lowly hoe, for the Sumerians the implement had brought agriculture, irrigation, drainage and the ability to build roads, canals and eventually the first proto-cities. One of the tablets from the Yale Babylonian Collection was published by J.J. Van Dijk which spoke of three cosmic realms; heaven, earth and kur in a time when darkness covered an arid land, when heaven and earth were joined and the Enlil's universal laws, the me did not function. Two of the major traditions of the Sumerian concept of the creation of man are discussed in the myth. The first is the creation of mankind from brick moulds or clay. This has notable similarities to the creation of man from the dust of the earth in the Book of Genesis in the Bible (). This activity has also been associated with creating clay figurines. The second Sumerian tradition which compares men to plants, made to \\"break through the ground\\", an allusion to imagery of the fertility or mother goddess and giving an image of man being \\"planted\\" in the ground. Wayne Horowitz notes that five Sumerian myths recount a creation scene with the separation of heaven and earth. He further notes the figurative imagery relaying the relationship between the creation of agricultural implements making a function for mankind and thereby its creation from the \\"seed of the land\\". The myth was called the \\"Creation of the Pickax\\" by Samuel Noah Kramer, a name by which it is referred in older sources. In Sumerian literature, the hoe or pickaxe is used not only in creation of the Ekur but also described as the tool of its destruction in lament hymns such as the Lament for Ur, where it is torn apart with a storm and then pickaxes. The cosmological position of the hoe does not fit into Charles Long's categorization of cosmogenic myths. Creation has been suggested to have been the responsibility of different gods via different processes. Creation via a cosmological agricultural implement seems to occupy a unique place in the creation myth genre. The song was meant to be sung aloud with the repetition of the word hoe or \\"al\\" a total of forty five times in the text with common use of the two syllables together \\"al\\"/\\"ar\\". A cosmological link is suggested between the hoe's being and its doing; making everything prosper and flourish within a community. Gary Martin discusses the sociological benefits of singing songs to a hoe, to remind people that they wield the implement of Enlil and of creation. That they can participate in creativity and work well to preserve and improve society. He suggests that \\"perhaps by praising the simple tool of an extremely important group of laborers, and imbuing it with cosmological significance, those wielders of the hoe are themselves brought into a grand cosmological drama.\\"http://faculty.washington.edu/garmar/CosmologicalHoeSumer.pdf Martin, Gary., The Cosmological Hoe, University of Washington, 2005.

Designed by architect Albert Winslow Cobb in 1910 and constructed in the Renaissance Revival style, The Hotel Kimball is famous as the site of the United States' first-ever commercial radio station, Westinghouse's WBZ, and also for hosting celebrated guests, including many U.S. Presidents, dignitaries, and film stars. The Kimball is located in the Apremont Triangle Historic District, with its main entrance on Chestnut Street, between Bridge and Hillman Streets. Since 1983, the Kimball has been protected by the Apremont Triangle Historic District, which is on the National Register of Historic Places. During 2012 and 2013, renovations will be carried out in accordance with the Historic Preservation Certification. History During the first decade of the twentieth century, Springfield‚Äîat the time one of the United States' wealthiest cities‚Äîhad a surfeit of wealthy travelers but only one first-class hotel, (i.e. the Hotel Worthy, constructed in the nineteenth century.) In 1910, wealthy businessman William Kimball commissioned architect Albert Winslow Cobb‚Äînotable for his advocacy of Shingle style architecture‚Äîto design a luxury hotel in the style of Cobb's admirers, McKim, Mead, and White, atop one of Springfield's prominent bluffs. On its opening in 1911, the Springfield Republican described Kimball's and Cobb's building as \\"representing an outlay of approximately $1,000,000, the Kimball stands as an example of all the latest ideas in hotel evolution. ‚Ä¶ Everywhere there is splendor, yet it is splendor with refinement.\\" Cobb's exterior design for the Hotel Kimball included a rusticated stone base; arched window openings with stone voussoirs; vertical stone banding; and a detailed cornice profile. The interior featured grand function rooms, including an elegant ballroom and world-class lounge, as well as ample guest accommodations. On its opening in 1911, it was reviewed by the New York Times as \\"ranking with the finest [hotels] in the country. A magnificent hotel, modern and metropolitan in every appointment.\\"Hotel Kimball Springfield, MA. Cardcow.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-21. At the time, guest-rooms featured \\"solid mahogany floors and chairs with upholstery of hand tooled-leather, bearing the Kimball coat-of- arms.\\" Built in what was the affluent residential neighborhood of Chestnut and Bridge Streets, the Kimball offered 309 rooms, a dining-room capacity for 450, a -high grand ballroom for 350 guests, and, in 1912, room rates from \\"$1.50 to $3.50 per day\\". Proms, wedding receptions, conventions, banquets, and weekly Rotary and Kiwanis meetings kept Kimball facilities fully booked for decades. For decades following its 1911 opening, The Kimball was \\"the leading hotel in Western Massachusetts.\\" Hotel Kimball Springfield, MA. Cardcow.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-21. During the 1940s, it was the first grand hotel purchased by Sheraton Hotels and Resorts, (which was then based in Springfield.) After its purchase, the Kimball was renamed the Sheraton-Kimball Hotel and remained a 4-star property until the early 1980s, when it began a long conversion into The Kimball Towers Condominiums.Valley Radio Reading Service sets art show and sale fund-raiser. masslive.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-21. In its time as a hotel, the Kimball hosted U.S. Presidents like Calvin Coolidge, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy, among many movie actors, actresses, kings, and wealthy industrialists. During the late 1960s, the construction of Interstate 91 and the resulting white flight of wealthy and upper-middle class Springfielders to Western Massachusetts' suburbs had a detrimental effect on the city's Metro Center and the Sheraton-Kimball Hotel, as it did on most U.S. cities and their urban hotels. During the 1970s and early 1980s, many gilded age hotels like the Kimball were torn down in the United States. In 1983, the Kimball was spared the wrecking ball by the National Register of Historic Places. Soon after, two developers purchased it to develop condominiums. Amidst the renovation of the 309-room Hotel Kimball into the 132-room Kimball Towers, its developers filed for bankruptcy. Later they were imprisoned for a different development. For nearly a decade thereafter, the Kimball Towers were managed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Many of the Kimball's units were left unfinished or bare by the developers, who had completed only the top three floors of the ten-story building, (floors 6, 7, and 8.) During this period, many Kimball units were sold to absentee landlords, as the building's (and Springfield's) future seemed uncertain. During the new millennium, the Kimball staged a comeback. It achieved financial and managerial stability, which had eluded it since its days as the Sheraton-Kimball Hotel. The \\"Millennium Room\\"‚Äîoriginally part of the Kimball's famous Pickwick Lounge restaurant and bar, which played host to numerous Kennedy family campaign meetings‚Äîwas renovated and now features regular art shows and entertainment by artists and musicians. In 2011, the Kimball celebrated its 100th anniversary on St. Patrick's Day, 2011. As of 2012, the Kimball Towers is primarily owner-occupied, and currently undergoing extensive renovations in accordance with its Historic Preservation Certificate. =Westinghouse's WBZ= The Kimball is famous as the site one of the United States' first-ever commercial radio station, Westinghouse's WBZ.

These entertainers were drawn by the hotel's reputation as much as the radio station's, and Springfield's.

Robinson, Texts, documents, and Artefacts, (BRILL, 2003), 265. Rawandi was encouraged and supported in his endeavour by Shihab al-Din al-Kashani. Written in Persian and originally dedicated to S√ºleymanshah II, Rawandi re-dedicated his work to the Sultan of Rum, Kaykhusraw I.Richards, 265. Content The early history of the Seljuqs written in the Rahat al-sudur, relies heavily upon the Saljuq-nama. However, events after 1175 are directly witnessed by Rawandi since he was a member of Toghrul III's court, making the Rahat al- sudur an invaluable source for Toghrul's reign.Richards, 265. According to the Rahat al-sudur(p91), the Seljuqs held the Ghaznavids in contempt due to their slave origins.G.E. Tetley, Ghaznavid and Seljuk Turks: Poetry as a Source for Iranian History, (Routledge, 2009), 28. Rawandi appears to have intended the Rahat al-sudur to be a historical work, yet the book contains chapters on backgammon, chess, calligraphy, horsemanship, hunting and feasting.Meisami, Julie Scott, Persian historiography to the end of the twelfth century, (Edinburgh University Press, 1999), 239. The final two chapters encompass the sultanate of Toghrul III, the last Seljuq beys and the Khwarazmian invasion. Rawandi viewed the Sultanate of Rum as champions of the Sunni faith and deplored the Khwarazmians. The final section consists of Hanafi legal works and courtly accomplishments. A final chapter was to cover anecdotes and jest, was never written. The book, as a whole, is written in a moralizing nature.Spuler, Bertold and M.

Life and career Newman had become sexton of Christ Church, now known as Old North Church, in 1772. He lived with his mother in 1775, and she was renting part of their home to British officers. After pretending to go to bed on the night of April 18, Newman snuck out of his house undetected by the officers and joined vestryman John Pulling and Thomas Bernard, who assisted him with the signal. Bernard served as a lookout while Pulling and Newman went to the belfry, the tallest structure in the area. Using a code devised by Revere, Newman hung two lanterns in the church's belfry to warn Patriots that the British were about to descend upon Lexington via the Charles River. The signal was spotted across the river, and allies began spreading the word. Newman returned home after the signal was set, and though he was later arrested, nothing could be proven against him.Waters, Henry Fitz-Gilbert (1877).

Trauma also causes rupture of some periodontal fibres and this leads to loosening of the tooth. However, the force is not strong enough to cause displacement of the tooth from its socket. Sometimes, the trauma might cause pulpal damage and there is a minimal risk of pulpal necrosis, thus follow-up is essential  Diagnosis  A tooth that has been subluxated shows symptoms of being tender to percussion (tapped using the end of the mirror) and tender to palpate around the area and/or sulcus as it has been slightly mobilised yet remains undisplaced. To begin with, any sensitivity testing of the pulp may provide a negative response; in which case it is important to continue monitoring until a pulpal response is received. Radiographically, there are no unusual features to note in a subluxated tooth. However, it is important to focus on the full image and scan for any other areas which may have also been affected; something which the patient may not actually have noticed or complained of. If there is any suspicion of a root fracture, it is recommended to take an occlusal exposure radiograph to allow for a definitive diagnosis. Taking radiographs is useful as they can be referred to in case of any future complications.  Management  When a patient presents to the dentist following any form of dental trauma, a full and thorough clinical assessment should be carried to exclude more serious injuries that may require urgent management. The first stage of the clinical assessment is to take a complete history to rule our head injury or inhalation of particles. Questions to obtain this information include: ¬∑ Did the patient lose consciousness? ¬∑ Were there any witnesses? ¬∑ Has the patient had any nausea or vomiting since the incident? ¬∑ Is there any loss of memory? ¬∑ Can all particles be accounted for ¬∑ Is the patient experiencing any change in vision? If there is any doubt of head injury or aspiration, the patient should attend the nearest accident and emergency service prior to receiving dental treatment. Having ruled out serious injuries, it is then important to undertake a full trauma, dental and medical history. This will include understanding if the patient is currently having symptoms, has a history of dental trauma, and their tetanus status. Following a complete history, a clinical examination is then undertaken. Extra-oral examination includes: ¬∑ Cleaning cuts with saline solution and removal of foreign bodies ¬∑ Palpation of the entire facial skeleton to rule out fractures ¬∑ Assessment for abnormalities in mandibular opening ¬∑ Checking for bruising Intra-oral examination includes checking for: ¬∑ Bruising ¬∑ Blood clots ¬∑ Cuts/ lacerations ¬∑ Tooth mobility ¬∑ Fractured teeth ¬∑ Changes to occlusion = Primary teeth = Following subluxation of a primary tooth there is no active treatment required. The patient should be advised to keep the area as clean as possible by swabbing with 0.12% chlorohexidine twice daily. Clinical follow up will be carried out at 1 week and 6‚Äì8 weeks after injury. Follow up radiographs are not required unless complications occur. = Secondary teeth = Management is similar to primary teeth. No active treatment is usually required however a flexible splint may be placed for up to 2 weeks if the patient is experiencing extreme discomfort. Follow up to check for complications is more frequent. Radiographical and clinical exam should be carried out at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6‚Äì8 weeks, 6 months and 1 year  Epidemiology  Dental trauma is a major global health issue and it affects 17.5% of children and adolescents. It is most commonly seen in school children. Dental Subluxation is one of the most common traumatic injuries in primary dentition. Maxillary central incisors are the commonest affected teeth. Some studies have proposed that the resilience nature of periodontium favours dislocation than fracture of the tooth itself. However, the exact prevalence is difficult to be assessed because dental subluxations are often asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic, and even overlooked by caregivers when treating more serious dental traumas in adjacent teeth.

The area borders with China and Laos. The principal town is Mong La. It is situated between Kyaingtung, Mongyan, Mongyaung. Sharing a long border with China, the Mongla area is a center for the production and traffic of narcotics and illegal wildlife trade. It offers gambling and prostitution to Chinese tourists an unregulated environment outside Myyanmar government control.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xqbw_7Vo_eA Name Mongla, Mengla or Meungla are different Romanizations of the same Tai word, and both the e and the o here should be pronounced like the Scottish accent pronunciation of u in bucks. Thus, to differentiate Mengla County in China and Mong La Township/settlement in Myanmar the locals call the former Greater Mengla/Mongla while the latter Lesser Mongla/Mengla. History Mong La or the Mongla region was the Special Region #4 of Shan before the new constitution (2008). It hosts the National Democratic Alliance Army (NDAA) and its leader Lin Mingxian aka Sai Leun. It was the #815 War Zone of the former Communist Party of Burma (CPB). In 2008 the United Wa State Army (UWSA) strongly opposed the move to give away the adjacent area of Mong Pawk from its control because it serves as a link with its ally, the NDAA in Mongla. In the 2010 General Election, the Mong La constituency for the People's Assembly (Pyithu Hluttaw) was cancelled.
