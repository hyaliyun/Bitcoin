It involves a heterogenous and divisible resource, such as a birthday cake, and n partners with different preferences over different parts of the cake. It allows the n people to divide the cake among them such that each person receives a piece with a value of at least 1/n of the total value according to his own subjective valuation. The procedure was developed by Hugo Steinhaus for n=3 people. It was later extended by Harold W. Kuhn to n>3, using the Frobenius-Konig theorem. A description of the cases n=3, n=4 appears in and the general case is described in .  Description  For convenience we normalize the valuations such that the value of the entire cake is n for all agents. The goal is to give each agent a piece with a value of at least 1. Step 1. One player chosen arbitrarily, called the divider, cuts the cake into n pieces whose value in his/her eyes is exactly 1. Step 2. Each of the other n-1 partners evaluates the resulting n pieces and says which of these pieces he considers \\"acceptable\\", i.e, worth at least 1. Now the game proceeds according to the replies of the players in step 3. We present first the case n=3 and then the general case. = Steinhaus' procedure for the case n=3 = There are two cases. * Case A: At least one of the non-dividers marks two or more pieces as acceptable. Then, the third partner picks an acceptable piece (by the pigeonhole principle he must have at least one); the second partner picks an acceptable piece (he had at least two before, so at least one remains); and finally the divider picks the last piece (for the divider, all pieces are acceptable). * Case B: Both other partners mark only one piece as acceptable. Then, there is at least one piece that is acceptable only for the divider. The divider takes this piece and goes home. This piece is worth less than 1 for the remaining two partners, so the remaining two pieces are worth at least 2 for them. They divide it among them using divide and choose. = The procedure for any n = There are several ways to describe the general case; the shorter description appears in and is based on the concept of envy- free matching - a matching in which no unmatched agent is adjacent to a matched piece. Step 3. Construct a bipartite graph G = (X+Y, E) in which each vertex in X is an agent, each vertex in Y is a piece, and there is an edge between an agent x and a piece y iff x values y at least 1. Step 4. Find a maximum-cardinality envy-free matching in G. Note that the divider is adjacent to all n pieces, so NG(X)= n ‚â• X (where NG(X) is the set of neighbors of X in Y). Hence, a non-empty envy-free matching exists. Step 5. Give each matched piece to its matched agent. Note that each matched agent has a value of at least 1, and thus goes home happily. Step 6. Recursively divide the remaining cake among the remaining agents. Note that each remaining agent values each piece given away at less than 1, so he values the remaining cake at more than the number of agents, so the precondition for recursion is satisfied.

Diabetes mellitus  Diabetes mellitus, also known as type II diabetes, is a disease that affects over three million people in the U.S. per year. This disease affects the glucose levels in the body by causing them to rise higher than normal. In type II diabetic patients, the body develops an insulin resistance that initiates an increase in blood glucose levels.  Exercise and diabetes  One danger for diabetes patients is cardiovascular disease, including lipids and blood glucose levels. Poor aerobic exercise has also been linked to cardiovascular diseases, and by improving the level of aerobic activity, and therefore decreasing plasma insulin levels, the danger of cardiovascular disease significantly decreases. The main risk for diabetes patients is controlling glucose levels. There has been lots of research done on the positive effects of physical activity on lowering glucose levels. Physical exercise can include walking or swimming and does not have to be cardio intensive. If patients are able to perform 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week, they can significantly lower their chances of having type II diabetes. Resistance exercise has been shown to improve insulin and glucose levels greatly by helping to manage blood pressure levels, cardiovascular risk, glucose tolerance, and lipids.  Exercise and diabetes studies  The New England Journal of Health performed a study on the effect of physical activity on men with diabetes mellitus. The study was one in which questionnaires were given to 5,990 males who had attended the University of Pennsylvania. These men were chosen based on their lifestyles and their risk for getting diabetes. The men ranged from ages 39 to 68 and their body mass indexes ranged from 14.1 to 46.0. To measure physical activity, their kilocalories per week were measured. The energy expenditure in kilocalories was measured, and the results showed that the more physical activity done, the lower the chance of diabetes. About 50 percent of the men who increased their kilocalorie rate by increasing their physical activity were able to avoid getting the disease. The Journal of the American Association looked at the effect that physical activity had on diabetic patients who took diabetes medications. The patients were all assigned a personal trainer who helped them perform routine exercises five to six times a week and keep a stable diet for the duration of the 12-month study. Doctors monitored these patients and slowly started reducing their medications. If their glucose levels remained stable, the medication continued to decrease, but if it increased, the medication was added back to keep the patient‚Äôs diabetes controlled. At the end of the 12 months, 73 percent of the participants were on a reduced medication list as a result of this lifestyle change. 56 percent of the patients had made so much progress that they could be taken off all their previous medications and control their diabetes by maintaining this new, healthier regime. The improvement of the patients‚Äô lifestyle by keeping active and eating correctly was shown to help manage diabetes mellitus.

The process began after the French and Indian War when Britain obtained sovereignty of lands west of the Appalachians from the French, and a trickle of frontiersmen from Britain's colonies in the New World began to migrate west. The French policy of trading and cooperation for mutual benefit was replaced with one of conflict and conquest as squatters claimed and settled on Indian lands. A series of boundary lines between Indian lands and Whiteman's lands were established by Treaty to reduce conflict, pushing the Indians northwestward. This resulted in the Northwest Indian War in Ohio Country, and the Cherokee-American wars in the Southwest Territory following the diversion of the American Revolution. After United States victory in the Indian War in Ohio, Indian reservations were created in the wake of usurpations. Later, reservations were quickly dismantled and (mostly beyond Ohio), Indians were forcibly relocated to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi. The reservations and relocations were a policy of extirpation rather than preservation that became a genocide of aboriginal American peoples. The process of obtaining sovereignty over Indian lands was complete in Ohio by 1818, but continued in Indiana and beyond through at least 1840. Background =The Indians of Ohio= Before the American Revolution, Ohio Country was populated by tribes of Shawnee (southwest), Miami (far west), Wyandot (northeast), Senecas (far northeast), and others. Ottawas (north) =Boundary lines= The Royal Proclamation of 1763 reserved what was then Ohio Country and lands beyond west of the Appalachians for Indians, and settlement by colonists was forbidden. The Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1768) defined the Ohio River as the boundary between Indian lands and whiteman's lands west of the Appalachians. The Treaty of Fort McIntosh in 1785 circumscribed an area of central northern and northwestern Ohio Country as Indian land, essentially creating the first Indian reservation west of the Appalachians. The boundaries of that treaty followed natural landmarks and colonial forts, and became a blueprint for later treaties. Neither Indians nor settlers observed the boundaries of the treaty, resulting in the Northwest Indian War. The Treaty of Fort Harmar in 1789 which essentially reiterated the terms of earlier treaties, was a last attempt to placate the parties. Major United States army campaigns to assert sovereignty over the frontier ensued, culminating in the Unites States victory at Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794. The beginning The United States dictated terms of the peace following the War, circumscribing a boundary line around state territories of Connecticut Western Reserve and Virginia Military District, along with the Symmes and Ohio Company land purchases to include most of southern and eastern Ohio in an area reserved to settlers. The Treaty of Greenville 1795 superseded and nullified all older treaties that conflicted with the new one. The treaty acquired about 2/3 of the future state of Ohio, leaving only the northwestern portion of Ohio Country for the Indians. Northwestern Indian lands were subsequently reduced by the Treaty of Fort Industry 1805 which moved the eastern boundary of Indian lands west to coincide with the western boundary of the Firelands, part of the Connecticut Western Reserve in northeastern Ohio. The process continued with: *Treaty of Detroit 1807 *Treaty of Brownstown 1808 *Treaty of Greenville (1814) (not a land cession treaty) *Treaty of Fort Meigs 1817 Completion and continuance In fall of 1818, six treaties were part of the Treaty of St. Mary's (1818), including Treaty with the Miami, that ceded the final piece of Ohio between the Greenville Treaty Line and St. Mary's River, completing the acquisition of Ohio for the Whiteman. At the same time, the process of acquisition of lands and removal of Indians continued in Indiana with the other 5 treaties, acquiring nearly 1/3 of the land of Indiana thereby. Removals Indian treaties through 1818 in Ohio didn't require removal from the state, but Indians voluntarily relocated to Ohio reservations defined in the treaties. Treaties after 1818 involved purchase or cession of reservations, and Indians were removed to out of state Indian Territory. The last Indians in Ohio were removed in 1843 via Treaty with the Wyandots (1842) by which the reservation at Upper Sandusky was ceded to the United States, and the Wyandots relocated to Oklahoma in 1843. As of the 20th Century, there are no Indian reservations in Ohio, and no federally recognized Indian tribes in Ohio.

Background In October 1641 the Irish Rebellion erupted in Ireland. During the early stages of the eleven years of conflict much of the fighting occurred in the northern province of Ulster between Irish Catholic Confederates and Scottish forces. After ten months of fighting with few victories, the Confederation placed Owen Roe O'Neill, an Irish Catholic patriot and skilled military officer, in charge of their poorly trained Ulster Army hoping that he could reverse their fortunes. O‚ÄôNeill attempted to train and strengthen his army over the autumn and winter of 1642-1643 in war torn Ulster, but ultimately determined that he needed to temporarily move his fledgling force to a safer place until they were fully ready to fight. Belligerents =Owen Roe O'Neill and the Irish Confederate Army= Owen Roe O'Neill, born in 1585, was a descendent of Ancient Irish royalty. As a young boy he grew up amidst the Irish struggles for freedom against Queen Elizabeth in the Nine Years' War. After the Irish defeat and the Treaty of Mellifont in 1603, O‚ÄôNeill did like many other young Irishmen leaving his home to participate in the Eighty Years‚Äô War in Flanders as a part of an Irish regiment associated with the Spanish military. O‚ÄôNeill spent over thirty years on the continent as a military officer in the service of the Spanish. During that time, while he learned the art of war and earned acclaim as an excellent general, notably for his defense of Arras in 1640. He actively communicated with fellow expatriates and watched the affairs of England and Ireland with a desire of returning and participating in a rebellion. O‚ÄôNeill formed a brotherhood with his compatriots in the Irish regiment and they encouraged him to return to Ireland and lead a rebellion. In July of 1642, approximately seven months after the start of the Irish Rebellion, O‚ÄôNeill returned to Ireland with arms, munitions, and a cadre of 200 experienced soldiers and officers from the Irish regiment in the Flanders. By that time, the Catholic leaders of Ireland had formed the Irish Catholic Confederation to carry on the fight that the rebels had started regarding Catholic rights. Within a two-month period, the Confederates made O‚ÄôNeill the commander of their army in Ulster. O‚ÄôNeill was expected to enhance not only recruiting, but more importantly, training and military discipline. It was the belief and expectation of the Confederates that O‚ÄôNeill would be able to create a true army in Ulster as opposed to the corps of rabble that his predecessor Felim O‚ÄôNeill had taken to war with disastrous results. O‚ÄôNeill chose the stronghold of Charlemont in Ulster as his base of operations and immediately began building his army in the late summer of 1642. Also garrisoned in Ulster at that time, however, was a Scottish Covenanter expeditionary force under the command of General Robert Monro. The Scottish Covenanters had sent troops to Ireland in April with the knowledge and permission of King Charles to protect Scottish settlers. This Scottish force was headquartered at Carrickfergus and had taken control and occupied several counties in eastern Ulster. Beginning in September of 1642 and continuing into the spring of 1643, the Covenanters conducted four military campaigns attempting to conquest Charlemont and destroy O‚ÄôNeill‚Äôs army. During that time, O‚ÄôNeill‚Äôs forces in Ulster were also harassed and attacked by the Laggan Army, a Scottish settler militia based in County Donegal. Because of the threat of these attacks on his untrained army and the lack of provisions in Ulster, O‚ÄôNeill made the decision to move his troops west to the interior counties of Ireland where the countryside was controlled by the Confederates. On 9 June, O‚ÄôNeill sent messengers to his commanders throughout Ulster telling them of his plan and instructing them to rendezvous with him at Clones in County Monaghan. =Robert Stewart and the Laggan Army= At the outset of the rebellion, thousands of Protestant settlers were evicted from their lands. Their homes were burned and their possessions taken. The settlers became homeless refugees and were mercilessly hunted down and murdered by Irish rebels. Thousands of the Protestant refugees sought safety and protection in Royalist strongholds or attempted to leave Ireland and return to England and Scotland. At that time, wealthy Protestant landowners in northwest Ulster such as Sir William Stewart and his brother Sir Robert Stewart chose to defend their properties by organizing militias. The Stewarts were Scottish settlers who had served the English Crown in the military and were rewarded with large tracts of escheated land in Ireland during the colonization of Ulster. The Stewarts were held in such high regard that immediately after the outbreak of the rebellion, King Charles authorized both of the Stewarts to establish a regiment of 1,000 foot and a troop of horse for the king‚Äôs service. The military force that the Stewarts created came to be known as the Laggan Army. Originally the unit was formed to protect the Laggan Valley in eastern Donegal along with the northwest portions of counties Tyrone and Derry. As the war progressed, the Laggan Army became the most dominant Royalist militia in Ulster, defending and relieving Protestant strongholds; escorting refugees to safe havens; conducting reprisal attacks on the Irish rebels; and supporting other Royalist militias in numerous conflicts. William Stewart served as the nominal leader of the Laggan Army in the beginning as he had greater seniority and landed interests than his brother. Fairly quickly, however, Robert Stewart was selected for overall command based upon his extensive experience in the Thirty Years' War on the European continent. Robert Stewart was resourceful and proved to be adept at recruiting men and training military units. His troops were better equipped than the Confederates, especially with respect to muskets. Battle O‚ÄôNeill‚Äôs Ulster Army convoy was estimated to be as large as 3,100 individuals when it gathered at Clones. Included in the group were 1,600 fighting men, their families, supply wagons, baggage carts, livestock, and nomadic creaghts with their cattle herds. Of the fighting men in the group, most were untrained, poorly armed foot soldiers. The cavalry units attached to the group were small. As the Ulster Army was traveling to Clones, Stewart learned of their movement. Upon receipt of the intelligence, Stewart assembled his force estimated to be as large as 3,000 men including both infantry and cavalry units and made plans to intercept O‚ÄôNeill. O‚ÄôNeill reached Clones before the Laggan Army and continued his march to the south towards Scotshouse. As he was beginning to cross the River Finn at Cumber Bridge, O‚ÄôNeill became aware that Stewart was approaching from the north. O‚ÄôNeill wanted to try and get as much of his army across the river and avoid a head-on confrontation with Stewart‚Äôs army but in a Council of War it was decided that the Irish would take defensive positions north of the river and fight the Laggan Army. With no time to construct defensive fortifications, O‚ÄôNeill positioned his men along a stone portion of the roadway where for the most part the passage was bordered by bogs. At the narrowest portion of the roadway closest to the approach of the Laggan Army O‚ÄôNeill placed 100 musketeers. He then placed the bulk of his infantry in defensive positions along the roadway to the south. As his infantry was getting into position, O‚ÄôNeill led a cavalry detachment north to reconnoiter the advance of Stewart‚Äôs army and slow them down if possible. As he did so, O‚ÄôNeill and his small force came upon the cavalry vanguard of Stewart‚Äôs army. A short clash of arms occurred with O‚ÄôNeill quickly retreating back to the safety of his army. As the Laggan Army continued to advance toward the Confederates, Stewart sent a cavalry detachment to attack O‚ÄôNeill‚Äôs musketeers. Stewart‚Äôs force drove off the musketeers and then retreated to prepare for a full cavalry attack upon the Irish army. Before Stewart's cavalry could coordinate their attack, O‚ÄôNeill sent his cavalry out to confront the Royalists. For a short while, the cavalry battle was a stalemate. As the cavalry battle continued, an Irish commander, Shane Og O‚ÄôNeill ordered his brigade of infantry out of their defensive positions intending to attack the Laggan infantry. His advance was against his orders to stay in position, but nevertheless, he made the move hoping to catch the enemy‚Äôs infantry off- guard. Shane O‚ÄôNeill‚Äôs brigade didn‚Äôt reach their objective, however, as the Laggan cavalry quickly turned and attacked the Irish infantry. After approximately a half-hour of fighting the Irish infantry began to break and retreat in disorder. At that time, Stewart pressed forward with the Laggan infantry. As the fleeing Confederates were pursued by the Royalists they collided with the remainder of their own army creating chaos and confusion which caused all the Irish, infantry and cavalry to flee. Seeing what was happening, O‚ÄôNeill broke off the fighting and organized a more disciplined retreat. Many of his men continued to flee in a haphazard manner as they were pursued by the Laggan cavalry. In the short battle, the Irish lost most of their materials and an estimated 150 men including many of the experienced officers who had returned with O‚ÄôNeill to Ireland from Flanders. Laggan Army casualties were reported to be quite low, six men killed and 23 injured. Aftermath Many of the Irish scattered and hid in the countryside till O‚ÄôNeill was able to regroup them and press on with his march to the interior of Ireland. Stewart could not afford to leave his operations base in County Donegal unprotected and pursue O‚ÄôNeill any deeper into Ireland so he simply confiscated the resources left behind by the Confederates and returned home. Although O‚ÄôNeill was able to replace the lost men, his timetable was significantly impacted due to the loss of the experienced officers and soldiers that he had introduced into his army from the Irish Regiment. County Ulster was then held totally by the enemies of the revolution ‚Äì the Laggan Army, the Covenanters, and the English.

She was Chief Executive officer of the Post Office Limited from 2012 to 2019 before assuming the chair of Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust in London. Early life and education Vennells was born in 1959, and grew up in Denton, Lancashire. Having won a funded place, she was educated at the Manchester High School for Girls, an all-girls independent school in Manchester. She then studied Russian and French at the University of Bradford, graduating in 1981 with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. Career Vennells began her career as a graduate trainee at Unilever in 1981. She went on to work for L'Oreal, Dixons Retail, Argos, and Whitbread. In 2007, she joined the Post Office as Group Network Director. On 1 April 2012, she became its Chief Executive Officer. During her time as CEO, the Post Office went from losing ¬£120 million a year to making a profit. In February 2019, it was announced that she would step down from her Post Office role and in April that year took over as chair of Imperial College Healthcare Trust, which runs St Mary's, Hammersmith, Queen Charlotte's, Charing Cross and the Western Eye Hospital in north-west London. She also became a non-executive board member of the Cabinet Office. In December 2019, the Post Office paid out ¬£58 million to sub- postmasters who were awarded compensation for past false prosecutions of monetary theft that had been based on faulty evidence from the Horizon IT system. The judge presiding on the case, Mr Justice Fraser, described the Post Office's approach to the case as \\"institutional obstinacy\\" that: Vennells subsequently apologised to workers affected by the scandal, saying: In January 2020, as the High Court case against the Post Office ended, Vennells‚Äôs tenure as CEO was strongly criticised by Conservative peer Lord Arbuthnot, who said: ‚ÄúThe hallmark of Paula Vennells‚Äô time as CEO was that she was willing to accept appalling advice from people in her management and legal teams. The consequences of this were far-reaching for the Post Office and devastating for the subpostmasters. However, there seem to have been no consequences for her‚Äù. He described the behaviour of the Post Office under her leadership as ‚Äúboth cruel and incompetent‚Äù, and said that ‚Äúshe was faced with a moral choice and she took the wrong one, the one which allowed hundreds of subpostmasters to be falsely accused, humiliated and ruined by the organisation she ran‚Äù. In early March 2020, she resigned from her Cabinet Office position.Horizon Settlement: Future Governance of Post Office Ltd ‚Äì in the House of Commons at 3:30 pm on 19th March 2020 On 19 March 2020, Vennells was harshly criticised in the House of Commons, particularly by Kevan Jones, MP for North Durham, who said: In a BBC Panorama programme screened on 8 June 2020, reporter Nick Wallis is seen phoning Vennells, who terminates the call rather than answer his questions. Wallis says \\"this is one of the biggest frustrations of covering this story...the consistent refusal of the Chief Executive and the people at the top to answer serious questions about what has been happening\\". Vennells was due to appear before a parliamentary select committee to answer questions about the scandal on 24 March 2020, but this was cancelled due to the Coronavirus crisis and MPs' questions are being dealt with in writing. The Care Quality Commission is due to discuss concerns about her continuing role in the NHS on 8 July 2020. =Ordained ministry= From 2002 to 2005, Vennells trained for Holy Orders on the St Albans and Oxford Ministry Course. She was ordained in the Church of England as a deacon in 2005 and as a priest in 2006. Since ordination, she has served as a non-stipendiary minister at Church of St Owen, Bromham in the Diocese of St Albans. On 14 June 2020 Vennells‚Äôs handling of the Post Office scandal and the relationship with her role as a priest were highlighted by the BBC‚Äôs morning religious radio programme. A convicted former postmaster called for the Bishop of St Albans to strip Vennells of office, Labour MP Chi Onwurah said she must be held accountable, and journalist Nick Wallis reported ‚Äúreal anger‚Äù that Vennells appeared to have been protected by ‚Äúthe establishment‚Äù including the Church of England, which many see as immoral. The church refused to take part but a statement from the Bishop said that he would consider acting if he received conclusive evidence of her wrongdoing. Honours In the 2019 New Year Honours, she was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) \\"for services to the Post Office and to charity\\".

The primary advantage for parents is not having to give away ownership of the images and videos they post. The site also includes additional privacy features not typical of larger social media sites. Founded in Sydney, Australia in 2012, Tinybeans has a large user base in over 200 countries, with a majority of users residing in the United States.  History  Stephen O'Young built the first version of the website to track his 3 children's milestones and an app to share their photos with his family. In March 2012, Stephen founded Tinybeans with Sarah-Jane Kurtini to make the site and app publicly available. Tinybeans competes directly with other social media companies by letting users own the rights to the images and videos they upload. Additionally, user privacy is maintained by not including a search function to find users. A parent must directly invite the users they share content with. This makes it harder for strangers to obtain family photos. Parents are encouraged to overshare on the app in ways that may get them labeled with pejoratives like \\"Instamum\\", \\"sharenting\\", or \\"baby spam\\" on other social media platforms. In April 2017, Tinybeans was listed on the Australian Securities Exchange as TNY. The listing press cited a user base of 1.6 million parents and family members in 200 countries. The Tinybeans app is free to download and use. Prior to their public listing, Tinybeans raised $2 million in private capital funding Revenue comes from a paid premium version, photo printing, and site advertising.

It is a deciduous, multi- stemmed shrub or rarely a tree of 4 to 8 meters tall, which may be found on hills as well as plains. The type material was obtained south of Humbe, Angola. E. rangei of southern Namibia is now considered a synonym. Range and status It is native to Tanzania, Malawi, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, northern South Africa, southern Angola and northwestern Namibia. An isolated population is present in southern Namibia. The species is not threatened. Description The stems and branches are smooth and reddish-brown. During spring or early summer, while still leafless, long, sulphur-yellow flower spikes decorate the plants. Large pods are formed in autumn. The seeds are prominently enveloped by the valves, which are dark brown when ripe. The valves split open and curl back, after detaching from the thickened margins. The large feathery leaves, reminiscent of Jacaranda leaves, appear in summer. They are bipinnate with up to 31 pairs of pinnae, each carrying up to 50 pairs of very small leaflets. The latter are very asymmetric with the midrib running along their extreme inner edge, rather than the middle, hence its vernacular name. E. rangei Elephantorrhiza rangei Harms was named for Paul Range (1879-1952), a naturalist and geologist who travelled extensively in Namibia. In 1908 he collected material of an isolated population in dry savanna beside the L√∂wen River, at Naute in southern Namibia. The Naute Dam, one of Namibia's largest dams, may have submerged a part of this local population's habitat after its construction in 1970-1972. E. rangei was feared extinct until a single plant was located near the dam wall in 2005. Its features and measurements were however determined to fall within the known variation of E. suffruticosa, and it was placed in synonymy with the latter.

It was successfully tested with take-offs from rivers, sea and land but no government funding followed and only one was completed. Design and development Water-based gliders are rare but several were flown in the 1920s snd 1930s. In Germany the Akaflieg M√ºnchen M√º1 Vogel Roch was first flown in 1924 and the DFS Seeadler in 1935. Like them the Polish Muraszew-Tomaszewski MT 1, which flew in 1936, was a flying boat. Its designers, Aleksander Muraszew and Kazimierz Tomaszewski, were students of Warsaw Technical University who were informed by the work done there by Czes≈Çaw Witoszy≈Ñski on the aerodynamics and hydrodynamics of floats and hulls. Their 1935 studies were refined in the wind tunnel at the Warsaw Aerodynamic Institute and construction was funded by the Naval and Colonial League (LMK) and the Riflemen's Association. Work by the Scout's Glider Workshops (HWS) in Warsaw began in August 1935 and was completed the following spring. Its first flight was on 1 May 1936. The MT 1 was a wooden open frame (uncovered flat girder fuselage) aircraft with its wing mounted on top of the fuselage. The two-part wing was built around two spars and was rectangular in plan out to rounded tips. The leading edge was plywood-covered, the rest fabric-covered. A pair of parallel struts braced the spars to the lower longeron on each side. Stability on the water was provided by a short float mounted not far below each wingtip. The fuselage girder had a straight, horizontal upper longeron or chord and a curved lower longeron, braced together with a series of diagonal and vertical members. At the front there was a wood-framed, ply-covered nacelle which contained the open, single-seat cockpit. It was divided into three sealed compartments for buoyancy and had a single-step planing bottom. Wire-braced fixed rear surfaces were ply-covered and the control surfaces fabric-covered. Its triangular fin stretched above and below the upper longeron, carrying a straight-edged, round-topped rudder which ran down to the lower longeron. Its triangular tailplane was mounted on the upper longeron with ground-adjustable incidence. The MT 1 was easily converted for land use by adding a rubber-sprung landing skid to the hull underside. The floats were designed to be rapidly removable. Operational history The first flight on 1 May 1936 was followed by land-based flight testing, flown by Wac≈Çaw Ulass and Mieczy≈Çaw Szczud≈Çowski. After twenty flights the MT 1 was moved to the Warsaw Yacht Club on the River Vistula where it was tow-launched behind a hydroplane. These trials showed that the MT 1 handled well on both land and water as well as in flight. Later in 1936 the glider was moved to a government base on the Augustowskie lakes, then, with growing interest from the Navy, to Puck for sea-worthiness trials. These led to the fitting of larger floats and with them many satisfactory take-offs and flights were made in 1937 in a range of sea states. Three pilots were trained as sea-glider instructors; there were thoughts of a sea-gliding club but no government support followed. In 1938 it returned to Warsaw, notionally for land-based trial with the Suwa≈Çki Gliding Circle, though they showed little interest in it.

Originally developed in 1918 by Ronald Fisher, it is based on the idea that variation in a quantitative trait is influenced by an infinitely large number of genes, each of which makes an infinitely small (infinitesimal) contribution to the phenotype, as well as by environmental factors. In \\"The Correlation between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance\\", the original 1918 paper introducing the model, Fisher showed that if a trait is polygenic, \\"then the random sampling of alleles at each gene produces a continuous, normally distributed phenotype in the population\\". However, the model does not necessarily imply that the trait must be normally distributed, only that its genetic component will be so around the average of that of the individual's parents. The model served to reconcile Mendelian genetics with the continuous distribution of quantitative traits documented by Francis Galton. The model allows genetic variance to be assumed to remain constant even when natural selection is occurring, because each locus makes an infinitesimal contribution to the variance. Consequently, all decline in genetic variance is assumed to be due to genetic drift. It also relies on the assumption of normal distributions, an assumption which breaks down if a trait is influenced by a finite number of loci. According to one research group, the model \\"...is obviously not an exact representation of the genome of any species, but is a useful assumption to make in genetic evaluation.\\" Similarly, the model's assumption of infinitely many genes each with an infinitely small effect on the phenotype has been described as \\"practical but biologically unrealistic\\", and the genetic basis of evolutionary adaptation, contrary to the prediction of the model, often involves a modest number of loci of large effect.

Benson was a steam tanker built in 1920‚Äì1921 by Oscar Daniels Shipbuilding Co. of Tampa for Tide Water Oil Co., a subsidiary of Standard Oil, with intention of operating between New York and oil-producing ports of the southern United States and Mexico. The ship was named after Byron D. Benson, founder of Tide Water Pipe Co. Design and Construction Early in 1920 Tide Water Oil Co. decided to add another tanker to expand their fleet of four vessels operating between the southern oil ports and New York and New Jersey. The contract for the new vessel was awarded to the Oscar Daniels Shipbuilding Co. and the ship was laid down at the shipbuilder's yard in Tampa (yard number 11) on 29 June 1920, and launched on 15 September 1921, with Miss Jane Benson of New York, granddaughter of Byron D. Benson, serving as the sponsor. The ship was built on the Isherwood principle of longitudinal framing providing extra strength to the body of the vessel, had two main decks and a shelter deck. Byron D. Benson had electric lights installed along the decks, and was also equipped with wireless of De Forest type. The sea trials were held on 12-13 January 1922 in the Gulf of Mexico off Tampa during which the steamer performed satisfactorily and was able to exceed her contract speed. Following an inspection, the steamer was transferred to her owners and departed for an oil storage site of Puerto Lobos, near Tamiahua, in ballast on January 28. As built, the ship was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam, a depth of . Byron D. Benson was assessed at and and had deadweight of approximately 12,920. The vessel had a steel hull with double bottom, and a single 596 Nhp oil-burning quadruple expansion steam engine, with cylinders of , , and diameter with a stroke, that drove a single screw propeller and moved the ship at up to . Operational history After completion of sea trials the tanker was transferred to her owners and departed for her maiden trip on January 28 1922 to Puerto Lobos, a large oil storage facility on the Mexican Gulf coast. Byron D. Benson continued carrying crude oil between the Mexican ports of Puerto Lobos, Tuxpan and Tampico and New York through the end of September. Following a decline in the production of Mexican oilfields around that time, the tanker along with many other vessels, was rerouted to carry oil from Californian oilfields instead. The tanker passed through the Panama Canal on October 30 on her first trip to San Pedro and again on her return journey on November 24 with 12,000 tons of oil destined for New York. The tanker continued sailing on the California to New York route through mid 1928, with occasional trips to and from Galveston. For example, she made six round-trip journeys between August 1924 and July 1925 season each time carrying between 10,000 and 12,000 tons of crude oil on her eastward trips. During the first six months of 1927 she was briefly put on the Gulf coast to New York route, carrying oil from ports of Galveston, Texas City and Baytown to New York and New Jersey. In June 1928 the tanker was chartered for one trip to Asia, carrying 11,386 tons of crude oil from Houston to Yokohama. Following her return from Japan Byron D. Benson was reassigned to the Gulf to New York route carrying crude oil from the terminals of Magnolia Petroleum Company in Beaumont and Sinclair Oil Corporation and Texas Company in Port Arthur to the refineries in the Northeast ports of New York and Philadelphia, including Tidewater Oil own refinery in Bayonne. The vessel continued serving that route, as well as transporting crude and fuel oil from Houston to the ports of the Northeast through the remainder of her career. On January 10, 1942 Byron D. Benson was returning from Port Arthur to Bayonne when around 19:30 in foggy weather she rammed Canadian coastal freighter Continent four miles south of Scotland Lightship, off New Jersey coast. The vessel quickly filled with water and sank, leaving her entire fourteen men crew in icy waters. The tanker stood by for two hours and was able to rescue all but one of the crew men before landing them at Staten Island. The ship received only slight damage and could continue her operations. =Sinking= SS Byron D. Benson on fire after being torpedoed by U-552. Byron D. Benson departed Port Arthur on March 27, 1942 for Bayonne transporting 91,500 barrels of crude oil. The vessel was under command of captain John MacMillan and had a crew of eight officers and twenty nine men. The tanker started the travel on her own, but in early April she eventually caught up with a small convoy consisting of another tanker, Gulf of Mexico, escorted by two navy ships, and . During the night of April 4, 1942 as the convoy slowly moved north along the coast at approximately it was spotted and followed by German submarine . At 22:47 local time on April 4, when the convoy was about off the Carrituck Inlet, just past Kill Devil Hills, U-552 fired a single torpedo from approximately 1,000 yards which struck Byron D. Benson on the starboard side amidships, between #7 and #8 holds. The explosion sent crude oil several hundred feet up in the air, and it started pouring out with the fire spreading rapidly. The panic spread among the crew as it started quickly abandoning the burning vessel but failing to shut down the engines in the process. Due to the loss of all starboard side lifeboats, only two port side lifeboats were launched. One, containing the captain and nine other men, drifted into flames and was never seen again. The men in the second boat were rescued by Hamilton, while Norwich City picked up a lone man clinging to a raft. All survivors were safely landed in Norfolk, but because of the running engines Byron D. Benson continued moving and burning for the next three days before finally sinking on 8 April in an approximate position .

The company offers financial initiatives, such as rent-to-own, on a pay-as-you-go basis to help poorer households afford their own solar panels. Studies indicate that as few as one in a hundred rural households in Sierra Leone have access to electricity. Since the company was established Easy Solar claims to have provided 30,000 households with electricity. The company plans to expand the business soon into neighbouring Liberia and Guinea. Mosia is also an advocate for expanding opportunities for African women.

Wood (1822 ‚Äì July 9, 1858) was an American poisoner and serial killer who was executed for murdering his wife, brother and sister-in-law, as well as attempting to poison his brother's two children. Biography Isaac Wood was born in New Jersey as one of three children. At one point, his brother, David, had moved to Dansville, New York, where he had married a woman named Rhoda and had become a well-respected citizen. Isaac, who was in a dire financial situation, then moved to Dansville himself, with David helping him purchase a plot of land and even endorsing his newly founded produce speculation business. Around June 10, 1855, while Rhoda was out of town, Isaac poisoned David, who died a few days later. While the death initially perplexed doctors, it was later pronounced as cholera morbus. After hearing this, Rhoda immediately returned home and was appointed as the owner of David's estate, jointly shared with another brother. Only a few days after, Rhoda and both of her children were struck with the same deadly symptoms. She died, but her children had managed to recover. Following this, Isaac became their parental guardian and inherited his deceased brother's estate. However, a note supposedly written by David to Isaac was discovered in which a check for $2500 was stored. It was later revealed that the check was a forgery made by Isaac, who had changed it so that he would be the creditor and David, the debtor. Not only that, but traces of arsenic were found in a building owned by David. Suspecting that the family were deliberately poisoned, authorities dug up David and Rhoda's bodies for a medical analysis, finding large amounts of the poison in both of their stomachs. Although Isaac was suspected of murdering the couple, by then he had travelled back with his family to New Jersey, where it was discovered that his wife had also died under suspicious circumstances back in May, allegedly due to arsenic poisoning. Police pursued Isaac for about two years. He was finally captured in January 1857, after it was discovered that he had been working as a farm laborer on a desolate prairie in Illinois. Trials and execution Isaac was initially tried for murdering Rhoda in Genesee County court, but the jury was unable to secure a verdict. The reason was that one of the jurors, Moses Long, refused to give a verdict because of his reservations towards the death penalty. Isaac's second trial was scheduled for a later date. While in prison, Isaac was visited and questioned by a reporter for the New York Daily Tribune. During the interview, Isaac fiercely proclaimed his innocence, claiming that he'd never done such a deed and that the state was going to execute an innocent man, saying it with such emotion that he almost cried. The reporter also noted that Isaac's tiny cell, composed of only a table and chair, had some papers on it, supposedly for the convict to write down his thoughts; it was also speculated that the mentally exhausted Isaac couldn't piece his mind together enough to write them down. After his second trial, Isaac Wood was convicted of poisoning Rhoda and was sentenced to death. He initially tried to appeal the sentence, but the presiding judge refused the application. A crowd of around sixty persons attended his execution, including the two children he had tried to poison, as well as a Mr. Barnard, who had married Isaac's niece. During the preparation process, Isaac vehemently proclaimed his innocence and said that only God could be his judge. When put on the scaffold, Isaac began a long speech about how mortal men made errors, but was interrupted by the Sheriff, who began reading his death warrant. After finishing, the prisoner was allowed to read three chosen scriptures from the Bible, knelt for a prayer with the preacher, gave another speech about God, and shaking hands with everyone close to him. Soon after, Isaac hung from the scaffold, finally suffocating after eight minutes. His body was put in a coffin by his sister and then transported to Avon, where sometime later it would be moved to New Jersey.

Life Lutton was born in Moira in County Down in 1791. She was the last child of a large family and although she never went to school she learnt a wide range of languages from Latin and Greek to Persian and Samaritan. Her father was a linguist too. She was a loyal follower of established religion but she was intrigued by Methodism and followed this denomination in addition to her own. She recorded her conversion as 14 April 1815. She became a leader within the Methodists although she was confirmed at a Church of Ireland ceremony. The early Methodists had encouraged women preachers. The Methodist leader John Wesley had reassured another Irish preacher, Alice Cambridge, that she should follow her heart if she was inclined to preach, but she should not preach near a male preacher as she may take some of his audience, but the church changed their policy in 1803. However they did allow women to preach to other women. Before 1831, she preached at 27 northern Irish locations on nearly 160 occasions starting in 1818. In 1829 she published Poems on Moral and Religious Subjects. It was reported that men dressed as women so that they could join the large groups who went to hear her revivalist enthusiasm. Bristol From 1832 she was an increasingly frequent visitor to Bristol in the west of England. After five years to leading classes there she left Ireland behind her. She continued to write letters and her prose and poetry were published. She lost her sight in 1863. Lutton died in 1881 in her adopted home at 12 Cotham Road in Bristol.

It is somewhat woody at its base, roots at the nodes if these contact the soil, and has ascending branches. The leaves are oppositely arranged along the stems at and just above a branching fork, further up. The flower heads sit individually on up to long stalks. They are in diameter and consist of about twelve to twenty five heavenly blue ray florets that surround many yellow disc florets. Three subspecies have been recognised, that differ in width of the leaves and the involucral bracts, the size of the heads and number of ray florets and in having glandular hairs. These can be found in coastal sands and inland areas in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces of South Africa. Flower heads can be found from June till October.  Description  Felicia amoena subsp. amoena is an upright, up to high, biennial, possibly sometimes perennial, sometimes near its base a bit woody herb, that mostly branches copiously. The branches are often crowded near the plants foot, while the nodes that rest on the ground easily develop roots, the more distant parts of the side branches ascend. The arrangement of the leaves on the stem changes from opposite to alternating. At the foot the leaves are in several opposite leaf pairs, and further upwards the leaves alternate, but after each branching, the lower one or two pairs are again opposite. The size of the leaves varies greatly, depending on the circumstances, and may be up to long and 2 mm (0.1 in) wide, linear to lance-shaped, bristly hairy, sometimes hairless with age, thick, with curled-down margins. The flower heads sit individually on, up to long, near the top densely felty hairy, stalks, and emerge mostly with three together at the top of the branches. The involucre is up to in diameter and consists of a double row of bracts. The involucral bracts are line- to lance- shaped, about long and adorned with a brush-like tuft of hairs at their tips. The outer bracts are wide and carry arched bristles. The inner bracts are wide, slightly bristly and have a prominent midrib. The flower heads have up to twenty five dark blue, female ray florets with straps of about long and wide. These surround many bisexual disc florets with a yellow corolla up to long. In the center of each corolla are five anthers merged into a tube, through which the style grows when the floret opens, hoovering up the pollen on its shaft. At the tip of both style branches is a triangular appendage. Surrounding the base of the corolla are many, white, serrated pappus bristles of about long. The eventually dark brown, dry, one-seeded, indehiscent fruits called cypsellae are inverted egg-shaped, about long and wide, with a prominent ridge along the margin, with some scales on its surface and short, forked hairs. Felicia amoena subsp. latifolia is a diploid having eight sets of homologue chromosomes (2n=16). = Differences between the subspecies = Felicia amoena and its three subspecies are among the most variable taxa in the genus. Subsp. amoena is mostly a biennial, has linear to lance-shaped leaves of up to long and 2 mm (0.1 in) wide, with a blunt or slightly pointy tip. Its involucres are relatively large, about in diameter and bracts of about long and wide. It has up to twenty five ray florets of about 12 mm long and 2 mm wide surrounding yellow disc florets. Subsp. latifolia has broader leaves, that are lance-shaped to inverted egg-shaped, 4‚Äì1 cm long and 4‚Äì10 mm wide. It also has wider involucral bracts at about 5 mm long and wide. The disc florets often turn dark red with age. Subsp. stricta is always a perennial with a woody base, slightly sticky because it has glandular hairs, and has small and narrow, pointy leaves of 1‚Äì1 cm long and wide, almost all of which are opposite. Its involucres are relatively small, about in diameter, with bracts only long, with only about twelve ray florets of 8 mm long and 1 mm wide.

It is now assigned to the subspecies latifolia. A plant collected by Johann Franz Dr√®ge at Riebeek-Kasteel, was described by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle in 1836, who called it Agathaea stricta, is now assigned to subsp. stricta. The first specimen now assigned to subspecies amoena was collected from Hout Bay on the west coast of the Cape Peninsula by Christian Ferdinand Friedrich Krauss in 1838. It was described in 1843 by Carl Heinrich 'Bipontinus' Schultz, who named it Agathaea amoena. In 1865, William Henry Harvey, who was a lumper, sunk Agataea in Aster, creating the combination Aster amoenus. He distinguished a slightly different specimen, that had been collected by Karl Wilhelm Ludwig Pappe, and named it after him Aster pappei. Harvey further distinguished Aster elongatus var. spathulaefolius in the same publication. Finally Harvey regarded De Candolle's specimen as a variety that should be placed under Christian Friedrich Lessing's species Aster adfinis (now Felicia dubia), creating the combination Aster adfinis var. stricta. In 1948, the eminent South African botanist Margaret Levyns created the combination Felicia amoena, that is still in use today. In his 1973 Revision of the genus Felicia (Asteraceae), J√ºrke Grau distinguished three subspecies: F. amoena subsp. amoena, F. amoena subsp. stricta, and his new taxon F. amoena subsp. latifolia. The species is considered to be part of the section Neodetris. The species epithet amoena means \\"beautiful\\" or \\"pleasing\\" and is said to refer to the attractive flower heads.  Distribution, habitat and ecology  Felicia amoena subsp. amoena has the smaller distribution of the three subspecies. It is restricted to the sandy soils around the Cape Peninsula and near Gordons Bay. Subsp. latifolia has the largest area and occurs along the coast from the Cape Peninsula in the very west to the mouth of the Sundays River in the east. An isolated population also occurs in the southern Cedarberg. Subsp. stricta can be found inland, from the Cedarberg in the north, via the Piketberg along the western edge, around Ceres, near Worcester and Swellendam on the eastern edge to Bredasdorp in the south.  Conservation  The continued survival of all three subspecies of Felicia amoena is considered to be of least concern because their populations are stable.

It belongs to the family Microcotylidae. Studies dealing with Microcotyle sebastis Microcotyle sebastis was first described by Goto in 1894, based on specimens obtained from the gills of rockfish, Sebastes sp. In the original description, the author also illustrated the various stages of spermatogenesis of the species. Bychowsky (1957) provided a brief description of the oncomiracidium; his study was completed by Thoney who described the post-larval growth and morphological changes during development. It has been subsequently recorded on several host species, mostly from the genus Sebastes. Bonham & Guberlet (1937) redescribed this species based on ten mature specimens from Sebastodes spp collected from Puget Sound, United States. Yamaguti redescribed Microcotyle sebastis based on two specimens from the gills of Sebastes schlegelii from Mutsu Bay, Japan. Yamaguti noted that the framework of the posterior clamps differed from Goto's representation, and that his specimens had lateral branches from the oesophagus, not mentioned by Goto. Bonham & Guberlet noted that their specimens were rather intermediate in both characters. Yoon et al. studied the seasonality and the microhabitat of Microcotyle sebastis from the gills of farmed Sebastes schlegeli. Radujkovic & Euzet reported one specimen of M. sebastis from the gills of Helicolenus dactylopterus.Branko M. Radujkovic, Louis Euzet, Parasites des poissons marins du Mont√©n√©gro: Monog√®nes, in: B. M. Radujkovic, A. Raibaut (Eds.),Faune des parasites de poissons marins des c√¥tes du Mont√©n√©gro (Adriatique Sud), Acta Adriatica, 30, 51‚Äì135. Ayadi et al. suggested that the species of Microcotyle collected from Helicolenus dactylopterus from off Montenegro and identified as M. sebastis by Radujkovic & Euzet was probably a different species, based on extremely geographically distant localities (Pacific Ocean vs Mediterranean Sea), absence of detailed morphological evidences of identity, and absence of molecular information. Ayadi et al., suggested that species of Microcotyle from scorpaeniform fish on the Eastern side of the Pacific (USA coast) might be the same as M. sebastis (for which the type-locality is off Japan) and emphasised the need for a detailed morphological and molecular study of specimens from different localities and hosts. Morphology Microcotyle sebastis has the general morphology of all species of Microcotyle, with a slender symmetrical body. The body comprises an anterior part which contains most organs and a posterior part called the haptor. The haptor bears 58 clamps, arranged as two rows (29 on each side). The clamps of the haptor attach the animal to the gill of the fish. There are also two buccal septate suckers at the anterior extremity. The digestive organs include an anterior, terminal mouth, a pharynx, and a posterior intestine with two branches provided with only a few short branches towards the median side, the left branch is longer than the right, and both branches extends for a certain distance into the haptor. Each adult contains male and female reproductive organs. The reproductive organs include a genital atrium opening a little in front of the point of bifurcation of the alimentary canal, armed with conical slightly curved spines, unarmed vagina opening middorsally behind the common genital opening, a single ovary, with an anterior portion shaped as in inversed V and a posterior portion somewhat S-shaped, about 40 small testes posterior to the ovary and occupying a little less than one-fifth the whole length of the body. Information on the surface topography of Microcotyle sebastis is available in the study of Alyousif (1986).Alyousif M.S., 1986. Surface topography of Microcotyle sebastis (Trematoda Monogenea) by scanning √©lectron microscopy. Annals of Zoology (Agra), 24, 1-18. Post-larval growth During post-larval development of Microcotyle sebastis, the ciliated epidermal jacket, ocellus, and larval opisthaptor are lost, and the clamps and genitalia develop. Microcotyle sebastis is protandrous and the genital elements develop in a specific order, following that of M. mormyri. The larval ciliated epidermal jacket and the four pairs of lateral hooks were shed by the \\"2 clamp-pair stage\\". The other hooks remain on the haptor and are lost between the 3 and 5 clamp-pair stage. As the clamps are then added, the genitalia develop and the intestinal branches extend. The 20 clamp-pair stage is reached within 12 days after hatching. Etymology The specific epithet sebastis is derived from the generic name of the type-host Sebastes sp. Molecular information Park et al. provided the complete mitochondrial genome of Microcotyle sebastis, which is 14,407 bp in size, and considered one of the largest flatworm mitochondrial genomes published However, Ayadi et al. pointed that Park et al. did not indicate any deposition of material in a Museum collection. Hosts and localities The Korean rockfish Sebastes schelegelii is reported as host of Microcotyle sebastis The black rockfishSebastes melanops is also recorded as host of Microcotyle sebastis The Copper rockfish Sebastes caurinus is another Sebastidae recorded as host of Microcotyle sebastis Sebastes maliger, also known as Quillback Rockfish, is reported as host of Microcotyle sebastis as well The yellowtail rockfish Sebastes flavidus, another Sebastidae reported as host of Microcotyle sebastis The Blackbelly rosefish Helicolenus dactylopterus, host of Microcotyle sebastis The type-host is Sebastes sp.

Microcotyle sebastis was first described from fishes caught off Hakodate off Japan. It was also reported from farms in Korea, off California, Puget Sound, off Japan, off Montenegro, Southeast Atlantic, and from the Pacific coast of North America. Note that Tongyoung is considered an endemic area of M. sebastis. When Stanley & Lee investigated parasites of yellowtail rockfish, Sebastes flavidusfrom the Pacific coast of North America as potential biological tags for stock identification, they revealed that only Microcotyle sebastis showed a latitudinal cline with a prevalence increasing from 0- 10% in samples from central British Columbia, to 80 and 100% in those off and Oregon respectively. Pathology of fish and treatment Microcotyle sebastis is a major parasitic disease agent for Sebastes schlegeli in Korea, responsible for a high mortality rate of juveniles in Summer. Ki Hong Kim & Eun Seok Choi evaluated the oral administration of mebendazole or bithionol for the control of Microcotyle sebastis and suggested that a single dose of 50 mg mebendazole/kg B.W., 100 mg bithionol/kg B.W. or 200 mg bithionol/kg B.W. significantly reduces the numbers of this monogenean on the gills of the host fish. Kim & Cho also suggested that feeding a praziquantel-adsorbed diet significantly reduces the abundance of M. sebastis infestation, and that bathing in 100 ppm praziquantel for 4 min is effective for controlling infestations in practical rockfish cultures. Kim et al. investigated the influence of the temperature on the rate of egg production and on the embryonic development of Microcotyle sebastis to determine the precise time of a second treatment.Kim, K. H., Choi, E. S., Cho, J. B., Hwang, Y. J., & Park, S. I. (1998). Influence of temperature on the egg production and hatching of Microcotyle sebastis (Monogenea: Microcotylidae), parasitic on Rockfish, Sebastes schlegeli. Journal of Fish Pathology, 11(2), 113-117. PDF It was suggested that treatment of M. sebastis with medicated feed was more practical than bath treatment in netpen farms. However, the authors noted that these chemicals should be administered to only juveniles until pharmacokinetic characteristics of these compounds in fish are investigated.

It depicts the death of Dag Hammarskj√∂ld in the 1961 Ndola United Nations DC-6 crash and proposes a theory that a white supremacist organization attempted to spread HIV/AIDS among black Africans. The film investigates the possibility that Hammarskj√∂ld's plane, which crashed in Northern Rhodesia, was shot down by Belgian-British mercenary pilot Jan van Risseghem. After unsuccessful attempts to conclusively prove that theory, the film veers off to investigate the mysterious mercenary organization South African Institute for Maritime Research (SAIMR), managing to contact two new witnesses that claim to have been involved with the organization. Parts of the movie are meta- cinematic, reflecting upon theatrical methods used (role playing, dressing up and employment of two African secretaries) and the true motivations of the filmmaker. Synopsis Mads Br√ºgger teams up with G√∂ran Bj√∂rkdahl, who received from his father a metal plate believed to be a part from the Albertina, Hammarskj√∂ld's Douglas DC-6B aircraft. They develop and investigate the theory that a Fouga CM.170 Magister opened fire on the Albertina near Ndola and brought it down, possibly after an attempt to detonate a bomb after take-off had failed in Lubumbashi. Their revelations trigger a new investigation into Hammarskj√∂ld's death; as a part of this new investigation Bj√∂rkdahl's metal plate is examined and determined to not be authentic. Near Ndola Airport, Br√ºgger and Bj√∂rkdahl locate what they believe to be the burial site of the wreckage of the Albertina, and they make a comical attempt at excavating it, but are soon stopped by local authorities. The film moves to South Africa, where in 1998 the Truth and Reconciliation Commission revealed a document with an outline for the assassination of Hammarskj√∂ld. Br√ºgger and Bj√∂rkdahl want to trace the SAIMR, the organization behind this document, through its believed leader, Keith Maxwell. Maxwell is rumored to have operated a number of medical clinics in the townships of South Africa, even though he was not a medical doctor. The investigators believe SAIMR to have been a mercenary organization operating by order of MI6 and the CIA, and involved in the Hammarskj√∂ld assassination, but they cannot prove this, despite recovering the first part of Maxwell's fictionalized autobiography. They also cannot explain the medical clinics, apart from Maxwell's strong interest in AIDS. The final part of the film brings forward two new witnesses, claimed to be former SAIMR members or close relatives. These witnesses allege that SAIMR existed, and was a major clandestine mercenary organization. They claim SAIMR served the interests of white supremacy in Africa, and that it ran operations to administer the HIV virus to black people in South Africa, Mozambique, and other countries through the fake clinics, with the goal of depleting the black population to a point where whites were in the majority. Br√ºgger and Bj√∂rkdahl recover the second part of the autobiography of Maxwell, which alleges the involvement of SAIMR in the Hammarskj√∂ld assassination. The first witness claims the playing card depicted in one of the photos of Hammarskj√∂ld's corpse is a covert signal of CIA involvement. Release The film was entered in the World Cinema Documentary Competition at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival where it won \\"Directing Award: World Cinema Documentary\\". It then opened in US movie theaters on 16 August 2019. Reception Dr. Salim Abdool Karim claimed in an article published in The New York Times that spreading the HIV virus would not have been technically feasible at the time. The article labels this claim a conspiracy theory, although previous reports during the South African government trial of Dr. Wouter Basson, head of the South African Defence Force's secret germ and biological warfare Project Coast, revealed Basson's weaponization of HIV by freeze-drying. The New York Times article also stated that the filmmakers' notes indicated that the man depicted as the whistleblower of the virus spreading in the film was not aware of it until asked by the filmmakers, and that his testimony evolved over the course of their correspondence. In July 2019, Cold Case Hammarskj√∂ld was nominated for a European Parliament Lux Prize, the third time in the Prize's history that a documentary is among the three finalists.

Shait pasha, underestimating the quality of the fortification, as well as his military strength, arrived on July 13, with only 4,000 soldiers. Stanoje Glava≈° and Vule Iliƒá, who at the time commanded the fortification, saw the enemies on time and easily forced them to withdraw. The Turks decided to await for reinforcement on a nearby hill but the Serbian rebels gathered people from the surrounding fortifications and with the help of peasants from nearby villages, surrounded the Turks and managed to throw them out of the highlands.The Revolt of the Serbs Against the Turks: (1804-1813), Cambridge University Press, 16 f√©vr. 2012304x304px The Siege of Belgrade started before daybreak on the 12th of December 1806. That morning Karageorge assembled in Vraƒçar with 15,000 rebels, he had decided with the commanders that the attack should be carried out on St. Andrew's Day, during the Muslim feast of Eid al- Fitr, when the attention of the guards would be lower. The rebels separated into groups to attack the different entrances to the city. Miloje Petroviƒá, Sima Markoviƒá, Vasa ƒåarapiƒá, Stanoje Glava≈° and Vule Iliƒá each leading a group. A Greek Albanian named Konda, who had switched allegiance, was well aware of the functioning of the Ottoman guard, he and Uzun-Mirko were in charge of taking over the Sava gate with a group of 6 volunteers, they climbed over the rampart and fell upon the guards. Four of the rebels were killed but the two remaining Serbs broke open the gate with an axe and the rest of the commando rushed in. At the same time Vule Iliƒá Kolarac and Stanoje Glava≈° attacked the Vidin Gate penetrating from the other side with their men.

Albanian forces attempted to regroup and attack the revolutionaries; however they were met with fierce gun fire from the Serbian cannons and infantry. In the midst of the fighting and poor visibility due to the fog, Vule Iliƒá Kolarac began to yell out in Turkish ‚Äúour forces have retreated‚Äù in order to fool the Albanians into retreating.

Early life Hedworth was baptized on 10 July 1683, the eldest surviving son of Ralph Hedworth of Chester Deanery and his wife Eleanor Lambton, daughter of Henry Lambton of Lambton Hall, county Durham. His family were leading coal owners in Sunderland. He matriculated at Lincoln College, Oxford on 18 March 1700, aged 16, and was admitted at Middle Temple in 1700. In 1705 he succeeded to the estates, and notably the coalfields, of his father. He married by a settlement dated 28 August 1714, Susanna Sophia Pleasant, daughter of William Pleasant, merchant, of London. Career In 1711 coal owners from Northumberland sought the support of their Durham counterparts in opposing a bill in Parliament to prevent combinations in the coal trade and specifically approached Hedworth as a leading figure. He was then returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for County Durham at the 1713 general election. He was not very active MP but voted against the expulsion of Richard Steele on 18 March 1714. He was lobbied to oppose a petition proposed by William Wrightson to make the way-leaves on the Tyne free and was involved in helping to draft a bill enabling the endowment of poor vicarages. His politics seem to have been somewhat unfathomable, as he was classed in various lists as a Whig, as a Tory, and as a Whig who often voted with the Tories. Hedworth was returned as a Whig at the 1715 general election but continued to show himself as of an independent mind. In that Parliament, he voted with the Opposition in almost all recorded divisions. He was Mayor of Hartlepool for the year 1716 to 1717. He was returned to Parliament again at the general elections in 1722 and 1727, and his only recorded vote was against the Government on the excise bill in 1733. He was Mayor of Hartlepool again for the year 1728 to 1729 and became a freeman of Newcastle upon Tyne in 1731. After he was returned at the 1734 general election, he voted for the Government on the Spanish convention in 1739 and against them on the place bill in 1740. He was Mayor of Hartlepool for a third time for the year 1740 to 1741 and was returned as MP for County Durham at the 1741 general election. He supported the Government with regard to the chairman of the elections committee on 16 December1741, and in October 1742 was put down as a Pelham supporter. He voted for the Hanoverians in only one of the divisions in 1744 and was classed as Old Whig in 1746. Later life and legacy Hedworth married as his second wife Margaret Ayton (died 1731), daughter of Samuel Ayton of West Herrington, county Durham on 14 August 1729. He died ‚Äòof a violent colic‚Äôon 31 May 1747. He had one daughter by each of his two wives, Eleanor and Elizabeth, respectively, and his estate passed to them. The elder married Sir Richard Hylton, 5th Baronet, formerly Musgrave, whose only surviving daughter, Eleanor married William Jolliffe, and was mother of Hylton Jolliffe. The younger married Sir Ralph Milbanke, 5th Baronet MP.

LiPetri graduated from Albany Law School in 2015 and was employed as an Assistant Corporation Counsel for the New York City Law Department representing the city and municipal officials. See e.g. John DAVIS and Joyce v. Davis, Plaintiff, v. THE CITY OF NEW YORK and New York City Department of Transportation, Defendants., 2016 WL 11602976 (N.Y.Sup.)

In 2018, LiPetri defeated incumbent Assemblywoman Christine Pellegrino in the general election 56% to 44%. Assemblyman LiPetri is a member of the Committee on Environmental Conservation, Committee on Corporations, Authorities, and Commissions, Committee on Housing, Committee on Racing and Wagering, and the Committee on Social Services.  Career  = New York State Assembly = Following a string of attacks on New York Police using water buckets, Assemblyman LiPetri introduced a bill to make it felony to assault a police officer with water or any other liquid. This followed concerns that these attacks could escalate to use gasoline or acid. Assemblyman LiPetri participated in a ride-along with ICE officers on Long Island. Those operations by ICE \\"resulted in the removal of violent gang members, drug dealers, and sex offenders from our communities\\" according to the Assemblyman. Assemblyman LiPetri has criticized New York's bail reform law, which eliminates cash bail for certain misdemeanors and allows people charged with nonviolent crimes to be released without bail pending a court appearance. LiPetri was one of two Assemblymen to sponsor a bill to increase penalties for sex crimes involving a minor. LiPetri has sponsored a bill in the Assembly to ban the usage of products that contain 1,4-dioxane: a carcinogen found in tap water on Long Island. LiPetri voted in favor of the bill in the Environmental Conservation Committee. The bill was passed and signed into law. LiPetri also cosponsored and voted for a bill make it easier for public water suppliers to sue polluters for contaminating water supplies. This bill was also passed and signed into law. LiPetri cosponsored legislation to let college students deduct college supplies‚Äîincluding textbooks‚Äîfrom their taxes. LiPetri also cosponsored the \\"Learning for Work\\" Act to establish a youth apprenticeship program and incentivize businesses to participate for occupations which do not require a college education. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Governor Andrew Cuomo and the New York State Department of Health ordered nursing homes to accept patients who tested positive for COVID-19. As a result, over 4,500 COVID-19 patients were sent to New York nursing homes. Mike LiPetri has called for New York Health Commissioner Jeff Zucker to be fired as a result of this policy, and has called for a federal investigation of this policy, alleging that it has resulted in New York's higher levels of COVID-19 cases and deaths. = 2020 Congressional Race = Following the announcement that 14-term Congressman Pete King would not be running for re-election in 2020, Assemblyman Mike LiPetri announced his intention to run for Congress in New York's 2nd Congressional District. He ran against Assemblyman Andrew Garbarino, in the Republican primary.

Plot After their wedding and a romantic honeymoon, Laura (Rashida Jones) and Dean (Marlon Wayans) start a family in New York with Dean starting to become a successful businessman and entrepreneur. They are raising two girls, one in preschool and the other in grade school and attending ballet class. They seem to be getting ahead in the world as a family but Laura is feeling the years going by. She is approaching 40 and has not fulfilled many of her professional career dreams of becoming a writer. Dean at the same time seems to be a growing success in his office and is surrounded by young and attractive co-workers. One night, Dean approaches her in their own bedroom after the children's bedtime to start a romantic kiss when she suddenly ambiguously says \\"hello friend\\" to him, which he takes as a signal that she is not receptive to him at that moment and he backs away and goes to bed. The next day she is confused by her own feelings about why she was unresponsive to him and seems to feel that something has not been the same in their marriage for a least several months. She starts to wonder if she is now adequate to their marriage and Dean's growing success. Apparently starting to doubt herself she calls her successfully rich though wayward playboy father (Bill Murray) for advice and he agrees to stop by her apartment to pick her up for lunch in order to talk. At lunch at an expensive restaurant, her father casually flirts with the waitresses and other female customers at the restaurant at random. Laura tells him her story and he asks her if she suspects that Dean is being unfaithful. She says she does not think so but that Dean does work with an attractive and young co-worker, Fiona, with whom he seems to spend a lot of extra time. Her father warns her that all men are the same and not to be trusted. He tells her that he will prepare to investigate the situation and will report to her. He advises her to check Dean's phone log on his mobile to see if he has been calling any phone numbers of women more than once or twice a day. Reluctantly, Laura does check Dean's phone and finds no abnormal pattern of phone call behavior. She later meets again with her father who says he has news from his investigation. They meet again and her father says he has photographs which he has hired a photographer to take of Dean which he is prepared to show her. He says that the 8-by-10 glossy photographs are in a plain manila envelope which he hands to her. She opens the envelope and finds a glossy photograph of Dean eating a hamburger by himself at his office desk, and another glossy photograph of Dean standing on the street by himself and hailing a cab. She tells her father that these photographs are meaningless and he agrees but tells her that his investigator also saw Dean go shopping on Fifth Avevue in New York at Cartier's exclusive jewelry store and asks her if Dean has recently given her a gift from Cartier. She says no and her father adds that the investigator has found out that Dean is planning a trip to a Mexican resort soon. She admits that she knows nothing about the Mexico trip at all and that Dean has told her nothing about it. Her father is doubly suspicious now and tells her to redouble her observations of her husband's activities. The next day Dean announces to her that he forgot to tell her of a trip to Mexico which has come up and that he will be out of town for a few days. After Dean departs, Laura's thoughts ignite with suspicion when she hears that Dean is leaving for the Mexico trip with his co-worker Fiona as his assistant on the \\"business trip\\". Laura calls her father again, who tells her they must secretly depart for Mexico to spy on Dean and find out once and for all if Dean is cheating on her. They soon arrive in Mexico after Laura leaves the children with her mother and continue their investigation of Dean, now in Mexico. At the end of the first day in the evening, they spot a female figure standing in her robe at the window in Dean's room at the resort. Laura goes ballistic in anger and tells her father that she must go to confront Dean with the discovery that there is a woman in his room at night. When she arrives at Dean's room, however, Fiona comes out and with surprise welcomes Laura to Mexico asking her why she is in Mexico. Laura asks where Dean is and Fiona tells her that Dean left early from the business trip to go back to New York in order to be with her for Laura's birthday. When Fiona came out of her room, Laura could see that she was with her LGBT partner with whom she was staying during the Mexico trip. Laura heads back to New York. She finds Dean back home, and Dean has figured out that her secret trip to Mexico could only have occurred because she was harboring suspicions about him. They manage to patch things up and go out to a nice restaurant to bring things back to normal. During the diner, Dean surprises her with a fancy gift in a small red box. It is Cartier watch with a gold bracelet which she puts on immediately. In the process of putting on Dean's watch, she takes off the vintage watch her father had previously given her as a recognition that Dean is the main man in her life now. Cast * Rashida Jones as Laura * Bill Murray as Felix * Marlon Wayans as Dean * Jessica Henwick as Fiona * Jenny Slate as Vanessa * Barbara Bain as Gran Production On November 15, 2018, it was announced that Apple had entered into a multi-year agreement with entertainment company A24 to produce a slate of original films in partnership with their worldwide video unit. On January 15, 2019, it was announced that the first film produced under that partnership would be directed by Sofia Coppola and titled On the Rocks. Alongside the film's initial announcement, it was confirmed that it would star Bill Murray and Rashida Jones. In April 2019, Marlon Wayans joined the cast of the film. In June 2019, Jessica Henwick joined the cast of the film. By July, Jenny Slate had been announced as joining the cast.Legend Marlon Wayans Setting Up at Laugh Out Loud This Weekend Principal photography for the film began in June 2019 in New York City. Release On the Rocks had its world premiere at the New York Film Festival on September 22, 2020. It was released in a limited theatrical release on October 2, 2020, by A24, followed by digital streaming on October 23, 2020, by Apple TV+.  Reception  On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 88% based on 144 reviews, with an average rating of 7.32/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"On the Rocks isn't as potent as its top-shelf ingredients might suggest, but the end result still goes down easy -- and offers high proof of Bill Murray's finely aged charm.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 73 out of 100 based on 43 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film a \\"B+\\" and said that \\"On the Rocks isn't destined to achieve the same kind of iconic status as some of Coppola's previous work. It isn't disposable, but it also doesn't offer anything to obsess about, which is a real change of pace for a filmmaker who launched a zillion Tumblrs and Pinterest boards and gave humanity the gif of Emma Watson saying 'I wanna rob.'\\" Owen Gleiberman of Variety said that \\"On the Rocks turns into a boozy humanistic hang-out caper movie, one that's light-spirited and compelling, mordantly alive to the ins and outs of marriage, and a winning showcase for Murray's aging-like-fine-whisky brand of world-weary deviltry.\\" A. A. Dowd of The A. V. Club gave the film a B, praising Murray's performance as \\"an irresistible star turn, loose and funny and comfortable\\" but calling it weak among Coppola's work.

He has been called \\"a master at creating alternate black universes.\\"  Career  Macharia did not initially pursue a commercial career in photography. His path to photography began through a failure. In 2010 he was still studying for his Bachelors in Architecture. Then he failed his last unit in his fourth year of studying to gain a degree in architecture. In his year long gap, he found the work of New York-based photographer Joey L. Macharia is completely self- taught, relying heavily on online tutorials and research to build his skills in photography. Macharia primarily works with an 80mm lens with the Medium Format camera system and Phocus Software and Lightroom. He also relies heavily on Photoshop. His artwork has been featured by many brands, including Vogue, Marie Claire, Coke, Afro Punk, and BBC. He was commissioned to create original artwork for the film Black Panther and the US television drama Queen Sugar. In 2017, he spoke at the Design Indaba Conference. In 2018, he was chosen to be on the judging team at the Art Director's Club of New York Awards. In 2018, Macharia was commissioned to promote the film Black Panther by designing and creating a collection of Afrofuturistic inspired photographs This project was titled \\"Ilgelunot\\", which means the \\"Chosen Ones\\" in Maasai. In 2018, Macharia was selected as one of \\"Five Creative Revolutionaries\\" of African art by One Source Live. In a creative showcase of their work, each artist selected depicted a different Afrofuturistic alterego. Macharia's was \\"The Eye\\" a virtuoso who can record and play back what he sees with a digital eye. This is a metaphor for African people seeing their own culture and heritage as beautiful.  Works  When describing his Afrofuturistic work, Macharia stated that \\"it is a post-colonial narrative about the continents, where you embrace history, present culture, and future aspirations of people of color through art... music... fashion ‚Äì and just tell a different narrative about the continent.\\" Macharia cites artist Malick Sidib√© as one of his African heroes in art. = Kippiri Women = One of Macharia's photographic collections is based on the legend of the Kipipiri Women who lived in the Kipipiri forest. The Kipipiri women were four warriors, wives of the four generals of the Mau Mau, who found innovative ways to incorporate their culture and hairstyles in the efforts to defeat British imperialist rule of Kenya. Every full moon, the women would dress themselves in elaborate hairstyles that would be useful in their revolutionary efforts. Their leader, Bobo, had hair twisted in elaborate knots and curls that mirrored the map the women would use to navigate the caves in which their husbands would hide at night to plan. The second in command, Chep, was skilled in weaponry and combat and had the extraordinary ability to see in the dark. Her hair was woven into large curls so that she could hide knives and other weapons in it. The third warrior, Achi, was the most skilled chef in the village. Her job was to prepare and carry large amounts of food to and from the village in her basket- weaved hair. She is depicted as having a strong neck, so as to always keep her head level and the food stored in her hair upright. The last warrior, Mwende, was the entertainer of the village. She never ventured into the forest but instead prepared the women at home to welcome the men back from war when they returned. Her hair resembled large sound amplifiers, and she wore a mouth- piece connected to pipes that allowed her vocals to travel to the amplifiers in her head. = Kenya's League of Extravagant Grannies = This photographic collection depicts three older women, retired from their jobs as government ministers and business women.

Hyosun and Misun were two middle school students who were killed by the U.S. military vehicle, known as the Yangju highway incident. Their death and the reaction of the U.S. government's with the incident made South Koreans go to the street. This 2002 candlelight vigils shaped the national identity of South Korea, created new protest culture of peaceful candlelight vigils in South Korea.  Background  =Yangju highway incident = On June 13th, 2002, two 14-years-old girls, Shin Hyo-sun and Shim Mi-seon were killed by U.S. military vehicle on the Yangju Highway 56, in an accident known as the Yangju highway incident. American soldiers were training with the Armored Vehicle Launched Bridge on the highway where they hit the two girls, which caused their immediate deaths. South Korea and the U.S. have the Status of the Forces Agreement (SOFA) which meant the U.S. had jurisdiction over this incident. The drivers of the military vehicle were pronounced innocent in 2002 under the U.S. military tribunal. This angered South Koreans and incited them to create the candlelight vigils. = Controversy= The early controversial issue in this incident was whether the vehicle driver saw the girls or not. The U.S.' 2nd Infantry Division emphasized that the incident was \\"the tragic incident which was never intentional or malicious.\\" The U.S. military authority insists that the structure of the vehicle causes a blind spot in its right side, and that the controller saw the girls and tried to inform the driver. Moreover, due to the communications disruption, the driver did not hear the radio and hit the two girls. The 2nd Infantry Division also reported that the vehicle was driving straight--not driving over the centerline--at a speed of 8 to 16 km per hour, and another armored vehicle that was facing each other stopped at a point 1m away from the accident vehicle. Some questions arose after this announcement such as that visibility may be secured depending on the direction of the driver's head, as well as disputing that it is difficult to have the alleged communication problems. In the case of an orbital vehicle, if driven at a speed of 8 to 16 km, it stopped immediately when the braking system was applied. This caused South Koreans to ask, how can the vehicle injure the victim to the point of crushing? Why did marks appear on the road that seemed like they were caused by the sudden change of track in an accident? = Public reaction = On June 26, 2002, many groups had protested in front of the U.S.' 2nd Infantry Division base. Some protestors cut the wire-fence. Furthermore two reporters who went inside the station were locked up and assaulted by the U.S. soldiers. There was a lot of criticism toward the U.S military in South Korea. The U.S. military chief of public affairs interviewed on the radio insisted that it was the Korean police who arrested the reporters. He also said that no one was responsible for the incident. This incited further anger in the South Korean citizens.  Candlelight vigils  = First stage = The 1st stage of the protest happened after the incident until November 30, 2002. The protests usually occurred in front of the U.S. military base or the U.S. embassy. Often, direct physical form of protest was prevalent such as attempts to enter the U.S. military base. People tried to publicize the incidents using online space more than regular broadcasting channels. The revision of the Status of the Forces Agreement (SOFA) was brought up not only to the public but also to politicians. = Second stage = The 2nd stage started on November 30th. Online, an anonymous person using the nickname \\"Angama\\" suggested that the public gather and do the candlelight protest in the Gwanghwamun and front of the City Hall. On November 30, 6pm more than 10,000 people gathered with the candles. After then, every weekend in downtown Seoul, people gathered and did the candlelight protest. Parents brought their children of all ages to the candlelight vigils. It was a peaceful demonstration. Middle school students and high school students have voluntarily participated. People made a speeches and sang the national anthems, as well as protest songs. Having music and dance performances, and festive atmosphere is the difference from the past mass protest which usually involved the physical clash with the police.  Impact of the social media  The 2nd Stage of the candlelight vigils was the very first case that online collective act brought to the offline candlelight vigils. The public emotions of anger emerges, and participation through the internet community rapidly spread after the trial of the military vehicle driver, bringing participants to the candlelight vigils. = Third stage = The 3rd stage started at the end of December through 2003 April. This stage had a different aspect from the former two stages. From the earlier of the year, the nuclear threats of North Korea brought a heated debate over the war crisis on the Korean Peninsula. Also, the U.S government was preparing the Iraq war. Bush administration asked South Korean government to send a troop. The 3rd Stage developed as an anti-war peace movement. Not only the commemorate the Hyosun-Misun, but the problems of anti-nuclear and anti-war have emerged within the protest leading groups. The focuses of the protest had been changed to opposition to the dispatch the troops to Iraq. After April in 2003, the popularity of the candlelight vigils seemed running out.  Aftermath  =Anti-American Movement = The incident contributed to Anti-American sentiments. In 2002, December 14, during the candlelight vigils, protesters tore the American flag in front of the City Hall. As a result, candlelight vigils evoke the Anti-American argument. Inside of the activist group, they tried not to be seen as Anti-Americanist, while protesting for the revision of the Status of the Forces Agreement (SOFA) and the anti-war movement. In the entertainment industry, Anti-American movement was happening. Psy and Shin Hae-chul did the performance that smashed a model armored vehicle. Psy also did the silent prayer for the Hyosun and Misun. Also, KBS announcer Hwang Jung-min, who said, \\"I feel ashamed\\" during a news broadcast of anti-American protests, resigned as an announcer for KBS 2TV due to criticism from viewers. = Korean Government = The South Korean government has provoked public outrage while dealing with the incident. The justice minister held a separate press conference, saying it is difficult to revise the SOFA. = The U.S. Government = In September 21, 2002, the U.S. authorities set up a memorial near the site of the accident and also paid 200 million won worth of compensation to the bereaved families. President George. W Bush sent the message through the U.S. ambassador to South Korea. It was a 'regret' at a time when the U.S. military's vehicle in Korea caused two middle school girls to be crushed to death after 5 months of the incident was happened. Nothing changed with the Status of the Forces Agreement (SOFA). = See also = ‚Ä¢ South Korea-United States relations ‚Ä¢ Status of forces agreement ‚Ä¢ 2008 US beef protest in South Korea ‚Ä¢ 2016‚Äì17 South Korean protests  References  Category:Protests in South Korea ","title":"Misun-Hyosun vigil"},{"id":"59679043","text":"Tate, 2017 Detail of Tate's \\"Endless Cycle\\" (2017) Tim Tate (born 1960) is an American artist and the co-founder of the Washington Glass School in the Greater Washington, DC capital area. The school was founded in 2001 and is now the second largest warm glass school in the United States. Tate was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1989 and was told that he had a year left to live. As a result, Tate decided to begin working with glass in order to leave a legacy behind. Over a decade ago, Tate began incorporating video and embedded electronics into his glass sculptures, thus becoming one of the first artists to migrate and integrate the relatively new form of video art into sculptural works. In 2019 he was selected to represent the United States at the sixth edition of the GLASSTRESS exhibition at the Venice Biennale. Tate was born and currently lives in Washington, D.C.  Press  In her 2003 review of Tate's first solo gallery exhibition, The Washington Times art critic Joanna Shaw- Eagle noted that visitors to the show \\"may not know exactly what draws them to Mr. Tate's art, but they'll find it mesmerizing. The more they examine it, the more they'll get back.\\" In reviewing that same show, The Washington Post's art critic Michael O'Sullivan observed that Tate's symbolic vocabulary, at least to O'Sullivan, suggested the iconography of martyrdom. In the 2007 Artomatic show, Tate‚Äôs artwork The Rapture disappeared under dramatic circumstances, and later a ransom demand (for Monopoly money) was sent to The Washington Post. The demands were met and parts of the artwork were returned by the thief, named \\"The Collector\\", along with his manifesto about society failing to value its art. Four years later, the Philadelphia Free Press was one of the first to try to categorize his work as \\"steampunk\\", and they also affirmed that Tate was a sculptor, a videographer, and a glass artist. In discussing his ground- breaking incorporation of video to traditional glass art, The Washington City Paper documented in 2008 that Tate hoped that his incorporation of new media, running on computer-processing power, would yield a new approach to glass blowing. Also in 2008 The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that two of Tate's pieces sold for $41,000 at auction. In 2009, the National Public Radio program All Things Considered put similar observations about his work in the context that the work occupied a \\"strange place between Old World art and New World technology.\\" In 2011, together with curator, art critic, and author William Warmus, Tate started a Facebook page devoted to \\"glass secessionism.\\" \\"In a controversial move, the secessionists posited that a new generation was moving beyond the technical and aesthetic ideals of the 20th-century postwar studio glass movement.\\" The backlash from the glass establishment was immediate; the new Facebook conversation was called uninformed and even mean-spirited. By 2014 Tate and Warmus had established themselves as the leaders of this new movement in contemporary glass. By 2013, American University, even while describing his growing artistic presence as \\"Washington, DC‚Äôs best known contemporary glass artist\\", also noted that the video component of his work was being recognized independently of the glass genre.

The essays in the book were written from 1952 to 1961, between the publication of his two most famous works, Black Skin, White Masks and The Wretched of the Earth. Fanon expands on the themes of colonization, racism, decolonization, African unity, and the Algerian Revolution in the essays, most of which come from his time writing for El Moudjahid, the official newspaper of the FLN.  Summary  The essays in Toward the African Revolution are split into five sections, roughly grouped by topic and manner of original publication. They help to trace the evolution of Fanon's thought over time, from his years working as a psychiatrist through the period when he actively worked for the FLN and his exile from Algeria in Tunisia. Most of the writing involves his political theory of opposition to colonialism as a dehumanizing force that cannot be reformed, as well as the ways in which he thought Africans ought to resist colonialism. = The Problem of the Colonized = The first section of the book (French: Le colonis√© en question) deals with the views that outsiders hold of North Africans. Fanon ostensibly wrote only two other essays on this topic, but one of them, \\"West Indians and Africans,\\" was actually written by Pierre Chaulet. Fanon did not want to write the article, but it was incorrectly attributed to him after it was published anonymously in El Moudjahid. In his essay \\"The North African Syndrome,\\" Fanon challenged the prejudices of French doctors against Algerians and other North Africans, whose complaints of illness or pain were often dismissed as whining or laziness. Many European psychiatrists had concluded that Africans were destined to be less intelligent and less emotionally stable than Europeans, and this approach tainted their professional practice. Written while Fanon was still studying to become a psychiatrist, he constructs the imagined, stereotypical Arab in the minds of the French doctors, who would have considered themselves more civilized: \\"Who are they, those creatures starving for humanity who stand buttressed against the frontiers (though I know them from experience to be terribly distinct) of complete recognition?\\" This is one of Fanon's early works, and it represents some of his original thinking on the institutional and societal nature of colonialism that was most dangerous to Africans, as well as a blend of the political thought and psychological expertise that he would blend throughout his life. = Racism and Culture = The second section, Racism and Culture (French: Racisme et culture), is a single speech given by Fanon in 1956 at the first Congress of Black Writers and Artists, and it was originally published in a special edition of Pr√©sence Africaine. His central point is that racism \\"is only one element of a vaster whole: that of the systematized oppression of a people.\\" His target is the attempts by many European colonial governments (notably the French) to prove that they do not hold racist prejudices while they continued to colonize foreign lands and export their own cultures as the superior choice. Fanon saw a logical impossibility in someone abandoning racist ideas while also participating in a system or institution built upon racism, like colonialism. = For Algeria = This brief section (French: Pour l'Alg√©rie) consists of a pair of letters that Fanon wrote to French residents of Algeria detailing the problems of how they viewed the country. The first, \\"Letter to a Frenchman,\\" explains the \\"essential ignorance\\" that the French had of native Algerians, whom they generally dismissed as helpless beasts and never formed close relationships with. This was likely sent to R. Lacaton, a French psychiatrist who worked at the same mental hospital as Fanon in Blida (the hospital has since been named for Fanon). The second half of this section is the letter of resignation that Fanon sent in 1956 to announce that he could no longer practice psychiatry for the French colonial government in good faith. The central problem he faced was, as one scholar put it, \\"the futility of practicing psychiatry in such a colonial situation.\\" Fanon did not see any practical benefit to helping individual Algerians when the colonial system he worked in was harming the mental health of the entire population. Working at the hospital likely sped up or influenced his decision to formally abandon the colonial enterprise and join the FLN outright, as his duties at the hospital forced him to see firsthand the mental and physical effects that the war, especially the torture used by the French forces, had on Algerian independence fighters. = Toward the Liberation of Africa = Twenty of Fanon's essays that explain the movement from opposing colonialism to actively working to end it, in Algeria and elsewhere, are collected in a section titled Toward the Liberation of Africa (French: Vers la lib√©ration de l'Afrique) that takes up most of Toward the African Revolution. Most of these essays were originally published anonymously in El Moudjahid, both to protect his identity and as \\"an expression of revolutionary solidarity.\\" Especially troubling to Fanon in this portion of the book is the use of torture by French colonial authorities against Algerians. He argued that torture was not an exceptional flaw of the war, but \\"an expression and a means of the occupant-occupied relationship.\\" Torture was an extreme feature of the colonial relationship, but there was no way to justify colonialism without tacitly accepting the use of torture, according to Fanon. He particularly criticized the French who opposed torture in Algeria on the grounds that it creates, in Fanon's words, \\"a vast dehumanization of French youth,\\" by turning French soldiers into monsters, instead of saying that the central problem of torture was the injustice wrought upon Algerians. This position was somewhat controversial when Fanon originally published it in El Moudjahid, as it would likely alienate many on the French left who might otherwise be more supportive of the revolutionaries in Algeria. Fanon warned in other essays of the dangers neocolonialism posed to nominally free states: European leaders exhibited \\"The acceptance of a nominal sovereignty and the absolute refusal of real independence\\" when their colonies tried to break away. Economic domination would replace the formal political control, so that the former colonies still survived at the mercy of the old powers, and this would be justified under preserving the rights of the settlers. The competition for resources and occasional military interventions by the powerful states in their former colonies justifies even more neocolonialism, as they perceive a strategic need to create and maintain spheres of influence. = African Unity = The final section, African Unity (French: Unit√© africaine), includes two works about the ways that African nations could work together militarily during and after the end of formal European colonialism. The first part is a log of Fanon's travels around Africa while working as a diplomat for the FLN during the Algerian War. He concludes that colonialism can only be fully defeated through a commitment to African unity and Marxist ideologies, or the powerful citizens in each newly independent country will start wars with each other: \\"The triumphant middle classes are the most impetuous, the most enterprising, the most annexationist in the world.\\" Fanon also discusses the overthrow and murder of Patrice Lumumba, the first prime minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The critical mistake in the African response to the Belgian-engineered rebel movement in the Congo was to work with the United Nations to maintain peace in the country, since the United Nations, in Fanon's words, \\"is the legal card used by the imperialist interests when the card of brute force has failed.\\" African nations needed their own instrument for military and diplomatic unity, so that they could respond to African problems without relying upon the institutions created and dominated by colonial powers.  Reception  Toward the African Revolution was published a few years after Fanon's death. He had become an especially popular thinker in the English-speaking world around this time, and the combination of his popularity and the revolutionary nature of his ideas led one contemporary commentator to title him \\"a modern Marx.\\" That reviewer particularly noted the evolution of Fanon's thought throughout the book, as the Algerian War progressed. His popularity was especially visible at American universities, as it remains today, and his works are primarily read in English. Another writer called him \\"a legendary hero\\" just three years after his death from cancer. The book itself was not highly praised, as it was more of a collection of loose essays than Black Skin, White Masks or The Wretched of the Earth, but reviewers noted that Fanon's writing was still excellent, and that the individual essays were still valuable. Others said that because the scope of this collection gave a more complete picture of Fanon and his growth throughout time, it would serve as a good primer on Fanon's life until an actual, comprehensive biography was written. Like Fanon's other works, Toward the African Revolution had influenced the thought of black leaders in the United States. Stokely Carmichael directly referenced Fanon's predictions about neocolonialism and the fundamental racism of colonialism in warning that individuals who were not themselves racist could not be trusted if they were still part of institutions built on racism. George Jackson and Bobby Seale also regularly quoted Fanon in their own work.

Alissa Wagner and Sabrina DeSousa founded the restaurant in 2013. There is also an associated deli, called Dimes Deli, and a store, Dimes Market, both in the same neighborhood as the restaurant. your bitcoinHistory The restaurant's founders, Alissa Wagner and Sabrina DeSousa, met while both employed at the restaurant Lovely Day, located in the Nolita neighborhood. Both lived near Dimes' original location, and sensed \\"a hole\\" in the neighborhood that they sought to fill with their restaurant. DeSousa has also said that their original ambition was to \\"[...] have a place where we could hang out with our friends.\\" The pair was also inspired by frequent trips to Whole Foods, the only location near their apartments with food prepared to be appetizing and healthy. The restaurant first opened a 20-seat location on Division Street, but moved and reopened in 2015 to a larger location 299 feet away on Canal Street. Upon reopening, the restaurant began serving alcohol and an expanded dinner menu. The original location is now Dimes Deli, which opened in September 2015. Dimes Deli serves takeout and a limited menu including salads, sandwiches, and bowls. Dimes Deli occupies a space next to Dimes Market. Although ostensibly a grocery store, Dimes Market also sells ceramics, books, and other household items. Menu staples at Dimes include a√ßai bowls with hemp granola, za‚Äôatar-spiced salmon, breakfast tacos and matcha buttermilk pancakes. Meals tend to be plant-forward, with influences from Mexican and Mediterranean cooking. The restaurant published its first cookbook in 2020. =Clientele and influence= Shauna Lyon, writing for The New Yorker, referred to Dimes' clientele as \\"cool kids\\". Wagner has said the restaurant is popular with members of the fashion industry and the art world. The presence of several Dimes-brand storefronts and its association with the gentrification of the surrounding portion of Chinatown has led to the area around the restaurant being referred to as \\"Dimes Square\\". The restaurant has also been credited with pioneering the concept of what the New York Times has referred to as the ‚Äúall-day [cafe]‚Äù. Other examples include Res Ipsa in Philadelphia and June‚Äôs All Day in Austin. Reception Reviews have noted that the restaurant fosters an atmosphere hostile to non-regulars.

Each stint was caused by the Oaxaca- born lawyer being exiled from his homeland for political reasons. His tenure in New Orleans was not particularly uncommon, as New Orleans has a long history of interaction with Mexico and Latin America in general.  Juarez's First Exile: 1853-1855  Juarez was the governor of his native Oaxaca for six years before being imprisoned by then-dictator Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna for his liberal stances and activism. He escaped his political incarceration and took refuge in the French Quarter of New Orleans. He made his living by working at a tobacco factory, rolling cigars and cigarettes. In 1855, seeking to spark a revolution, the base document of which, the Plan of Ayutla he wrote in New Orleans, he returned to Mexico. He was successful, obtaining a prominent posts in the Supreme Court of the newest iteration of the Mexican Republic.  Juarez's Second Exile: 1858  In 1858, a civil war began in Mexico, an expression of tension from the recent regime change, and Juarez was forced to leave for New Orleans again, for a brief period of time. He then returned to Mexico, fought to regain control, and in 1861 reaffirmed his status as president, a position he would hold for the next eleven years, until his death.  The Statue  The statue of Juarez was part of a project launched by New Orleans Mayor Chep Morrison in 1957, in which a median on Basin Street would become a monument to New Orleans' place in the geopolitical history of the Western Hemisphere, dubbed the \\"Garden of the Americas\\", which would also come to include monuments to Sim√≥n Bol√≠var and Francisco Moraz√°n. In 1965, the Mexican government gifted the city with the statue of Juarez, which was then placed in the neighborhood in which Juarez resided while exiled. On May 17, 1972, the one hundred year anniversary of Juarez's death, the statue was dedicated by the XII Mexico United States Inter-parliamentary Conference. The sculptor of the statue is Juan Fernando Olagu√≠bel. The statue is located at 1200 Conti St. Other statues of Juarez can be found in Washington D.C., New York City, and Chicago.  Historical Relevance  New Orleans has long been a multicultural hub in the Americas, well before it was incorporated into the United States. It has been a major center of exchange for the French, Spanish, and American empires, in addition to its relevance to Indigenous communities. Goods, cultures, and ideas met at the crossroads of New Orleans, be they from the waters of the Caribbean or upriver along the Mississippi. A place in which slavery was pervasive, the presence of a liberal revolutionary leader such as Juarez is notable. New Orleans was also a common place for free people of color from the Caribbean islands to go to, often from Haiti during the period in which France held the port city, but even after French rule ended. Certain families from the Caribbean set up cigar factories, a major component of New Orleans' industry and economy, even beyond Juarez's time working at one of those factories.  Implications Today  The statue of Benito Juarez sheds light on the continued presence of Mexican peoples and cultures in New Orleans. The multicultural nature of the city is apparent in even its most famous traditions, as Mardi Gras celebrations are fused with Mexican customs. Often considered solely in the context of its French colonial roots, the statue of Juarez offers a new perspective on the rich, diverse history of the Big Easy.

Thousands of Zimbabweans protested against the price increase, along with increasing levels of poverty, the poor state of the economy, and declining standards of living. The government responded with a coordinated crackdown that resulted in hundreds of arrests and multiple deaths. The protests stopped after three days; by 17 January, businesses started reopening as the protests ended.  Background  In an effort to improve the financial and fiscal situation of the country following the establishment of the Mnangagwa government in 2017, the government initiated a number of austerity policies in an effort to kick- start the moribund economy. By October 2018, foreign currency shortages led to large scale business closures and shortages of imported commodities, including fuel. This led to persistent fuel shortages, strikes by government workers, and a worsening economic environment. On 12 January 2019, the government of Emmerson Mnangagwa announced that the Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Agency would more than double fuel prices as of midnight that night. The price of diesel rose from US$1.38 to US$3.11 per litre (equivalent to $11.77 per US gallon or ‚Ç¨2.73 per litre) and that of petrol from $1.43 to $3.31 per litre ($12.53 per US gallon or ‚Ç¨2.91 per litre), for an increase of almost 130% overnight, making Zimbabwe's fuel the most expensive in the world at the time. Mnangagwa stated that the price increases were needed to reduce fuel shortages and illegal trading. The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions called for a three-day strike in protest at the price increases.  Protests  Presidents Vladimir Putin and Emmerson Mnangagwa. President Mnangagwa was in Russia during the protests. = During the protests = Protests began in Harare on 14 January 2019. In response, the police and military launched a coordinated response that involved raiding the homes of some residents. Beyond the capital, disturbances were also reported in the cities of Mutare and Bulawayo. By the end of the day, the government reported that three people, including one policeman, had died in the protests. Non-government sources reported that around 200 people had been arrested and that eight had been killed in the protests by police by the end of the first day of protests. The Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights (ZADHR) stated that 172 people had been injured, of which 68 were treated for gunshot wounds. Indiscriminate acts of violence by the police on both protesters and bystanders were also reported, along with acts of looting by some protesters in Harare, Bulawayo and Kadoma. By 18 January, the ZADHR had recorded 844 human rights violations that included 78 gunshot injuries, 466 arbitrary arrests and detentions, as well as 242 cases of assault and degrading treatment. On 15 January, internet monitoring group NetBlocks reported the blocking of over a dozen social media and messaging platforms in Zimbabwe including WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram followed by total internet blackouts. The first three days of the disruption cost the Zimbabwe's economy an estimated $17 million as the government extended its disruption to a full shutdown to prevent the use of VPN circumvention tools by demonstrators. The country's largest cellular provider, Econet, confirmed that the government issued a directive blocking all internet access during the protests. After the protests ended the Zimbabwean High Court ruled that the internet shutdown was illegal and ordered it to be restored. On the third day of the protests, civil society activist and pastor Evan Mawarire was arrested. Mawarire's lawyer stated that the government alleged that his inciting of violent protests on Twitter as the reason for the arrest. The Movement for Democratic Change ‚Äì Tsvangirai (MDC-T) stated that its party leadership had been detained by security forces during the protests. An unknown number of abductions by security personnel were reported during the crackdown on the protests. The government blamed the MDC-T for the protests. MDC-T offices were attacked and torched during the protests with the MDC-T alleging that ZANU-PF supporters were responsible. The government stated that government property and property owned by the ruling ZANU-PF party was damaged in the attacks and blamed MDC-T supporters. The government also stated that the protests were coordinated by opposition parties and compared the protests to terrorism. The MDC-T denied government accusations that they were responsible for violence committed by protesters and highlighted acts of violence committed by government forces against protesters and civilians. A large number of the police raids took place in opposition electoral strong holds in urban areas around Harare. On 17 January in Harare, the fourth and final day of fixtures in round three of the 2018‚Äì19 Logan Cup cricket tournament were both called off due to the protests. = After the protests = By Saturday the 20 January the security services set up a number of roadblocks throughout the country in an effort to arrest protesters and other individuals wanted by the government. A large number of people who disappeared during the government crackdown during the protests remain unaccounted for. On 21 January, human rights organizations in Zimbabwe claimed that a total of 12 protesters were killed by security forces and many more had been beaten.  Response  = Regional response = The MDC-T called on South Africa to intervene and criticise the government's violent response. Human Rights Watch stated that the use of unlawful lethal force by the government should be investigated and those responsible prosecuted. Zimbabweans in South Africa demonstrated to encourage South Africa to put pressure on the government to release arrested opposition leaders, restore internet access, and respect human rights. Protests by Zimbabweans against the Zimbabwean government response were also reported in Botswana and Namibia. South Africa's official opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, stated that the situation within Zimbabwe was so severe that the South African government should abandon its Mbeki-era quiet diplomacy policy and intervene. The Economic Freedom Fighters, a South African political party, issued a statement condemning the Zimbabwean government's violent response to the protests. The South African government said it was monitoring the situation in Zimbabwe and stated with confidence that \\"measures being taken by the Zimbabwean government will resolve the situation.\\" The South African Federation of Trade Unions condemned both the fuel price increase and the government's use of lethal force against the protesters.

In the first campaign of the Romans in the Second Macedonian War, in 200 BCE, the consul Sulpicius, after having invested this place, which submitted to him, returned to Dassaretia, and from thence regained Apollonia, the place from which he had departed on this expedition. The position is so remarkable that there is no difficulty in identifying it with the modern town of Kastoria. The lake, which bears the same name, is about six miles long and four broad (10 by 6 km). The peninsula is nearly four miles (6 km) in circumference, and the outer point is not fa6r from the centre of the lake. The later fortification of Kastoria consists only of a wall across the western extremity of the isthmus, which was built in the time of the Byzantine Empire, and has a wet ditch, making the peninsula an island. In the middle of the wall stands a square tower, through which was the only entrance to the town. The ruins of a parallel wall flanked with round towers, which in Byzantine times crossed the peninsula from shore to shore, excluding all the east part of it, in the 19th century divided the Turkish and Greek quarters of the town. The site of Celetrum is near the modern Kastoria.

He is the creator of the Twitter feed @Coldwar_Steve. His work typically depicts a grim, dystopian location in England populated by British media figures, celebrities, and politicians, usually with Eastenders actor Steve McFadden (in character as Phil Mitchell) looking on in disgust. His work has been described as having \\"captured the mood of Brexit Britain\\" and likened to earlier British political satirists Hogarth and Gillray. As of February 2020, his account has over 240,000 followers. Early life Spencer was born in Birmingham in 1975. He went to art college at Nuneaton in Warwickshire where his fellow students included film director Gareth Edwards. He then failed to get into three different universities and subsequently spent the next twenty years working a series of mundane jobs in factories and the public sector. Recovering after an attempted suicide, Spencer concentrated on his art creating the montages on his phone, often while travelling to work on the bus. Work McFadden's Cold War (the original title of the page) first appeared on Twitter in March 2016. As the title suggested, the work initially concentrated on the Cold War era, inserting Steve McFadden into photographs from the period often featuring Ronald Reagan or Mikhail Gorbachev. The EU referendum in June 2016 was a watershed in his career and led to his work taking on a more surreal tone. Speaking in December 2018 he said \\"rather than dealing with it as I've done in the past ‚Äì which would have been drink or drugs or whatever ‚Äì I channelled it more into my art. I incorporated other characters, so it's slowly become more satirical and political.\\" The work expanded to include politicians such as Theresa May, Donald Trump, Kim Jong-un in incongruous settings such as a run-down British working men's club or a derelict flytipping site alongside British celebrities such as Noel Edmonds, Cliff Richard, Danny Dyer or Cilla Black. Steve McFadden is the one constant in his montages. He held his first exhibition A Brief History of the World (1953-2018) at The Social in London between October and December, 2018. The show was attended by comedian Al Murray and Guardian cartoonist Martin Rowson. In November 2018 his first public work, The Fourth Estate, commissioned by RRU News, was unveiled in Williamson Square in Liverpool. The work measuring is inspired by the third panel of Hieronymus Bosch's The Garden of Earthly Delights. Other large scale outdoor artwork followed at Glastonbury 2019 (a collaboration with Led By Donkeys) and a piece for the National Galleries of Scotland 'Harold, The Ghost of Lost Futures' as part of their 'Cut and Paste' exhibition.

It saw combat in World War II as well as service in other Soviet allied countries after the war. Design and production = Object 237 KV-85 and IS-85/IS-1 = KV chassis with the removal of the hull machine-gunner/ radio operator's station with one operated by the driver, and the driver's station slightly centered at the front; a staple design of all IS-series tank. D-5T gun. Later IS-2 converted models were replaced with the 122mm D-25T gun whilst retaining the same hull. The KV-1 was criticized by its crews for its poor mobility and the lack of a larger caliber gun than the T-34 medium tank. It was much more expensive than the T-34, without having greater combat performance. Moscow ordered some KV-1 assembly lines to shift to T-34 production, leading to fears that KV-1 production would be halted and the SKB-2 design bureau, led by Kotin, closed. In 1942, this problem was partially addressed by the KV-1S tank, which had thinner armor than the original, making it lighter and faster. It was competitive with the T-34 but at the cost of no longer having the heavier armor. Production of the KV-1S was gradually replaced by the SU-152 and ended in April 1943. The capture of a German Tiger tank in January 1943 led to a decision to develop a new heavy tank, which was given the codename Object 237. Before Object 237 had time to mature, intense tank fighting in the summer of 1943 demanded a response. Dukhov's team was instructed to create a stopgap KV tank, the KV-85, which was armed with the 52-K-derivative gun of the SU-85, the 85 mm D-5T, that proved capable of penetrating the Tiger I from . The KV-85 was created by mounting an Object 237 turret on a KV-1S hull. To accommodate the Object 237 turret, the KV-1S hull was modified, increasing the diameter of the turret ring with fillets on the sides of the hull. The radio operator was replaced with an ammunition rack for the larger 85 mm ammunition. The hull MG was then moved to the opposite side of the driver and fixed in place to be operated by the driver. From September to October 1943, a total of 130 KV-85s were produced, before the assembly lines began to shift over. Like the KV-1S, the KV-85 served in dwindling numbers and was quickly overshadowed by the superior IS series. The Object 237 prototype, a version of the cancelled KV-13, was accepted for production as the IS-85 heavy tank. First deliveries were made in October 1943, and the tanks went immediately into service. Production ended in January 1944. Its designation was simplified to IS-1 after the introduction of the IS-122, later renamed as IS-2 for security purposes. =Object 240 IS-2=  Gun  By 1943, engineers had succeeded in mounting the 85 mm gun to the T-34 medium tank, making it as well-armed as the KV-85 heavy tank. Efforts to up-gun the IS-85 began in late 1943. Two candidate weapons were the D-25 122 mm tank gun, the ballistic characteristics of which were identical to the A-19 122 mm gun, and the D-10 100 mm gun, which was based on a naval dual-purpose gun. The D-10 had been designed for anti- tank fire and had better armor penetration than the A-19, but the smaller caliber meant it had a less useful high explosive round. Also, the D-10 was a relatively new weapon in short supply, while there was excess production capacity for the A-19 and its ammunition. Compared to the older F-34 76.2 mm tank gun, the D-25 delivered 5.37 times the muzzle energy. After testing both the D-25 and D-10 on the IS-122, the former was selected as the main armament of the new tank. The D-25 used a separate shell and powder charge, resulting in a lower rate of fire compared to the single-piece ammunition used in most tanks, a serious disadvantage in tank-to-tank engagements. Soviet proving- ground tests showed that the D-25 could penetrate the front armor of the German Panther at while the D-10 could do so at a maximum range of . It was therefore considered an adequate anti-tank gun. First deliveries of IS-122s mounted with this gun were in December of 1943. Projectiles and charges of the separate-loading ammunition of the A-19/D-25T 122mm gun. Left to right: cartridge case, high-explosive/ fragmentation shell OF-471, armor-piercing high explosive shell BR-471, armor-piercing ballistic capped shell BR-471B. All shells are shown from two sides. A Wa Pruef 1 Report dated 5 October 1944 has data on the penetration ranges of the 122 mm A-19 gun against a Panther tank angled at 30 degrees; this estimated that the A-19 gun was unable to penetrate the upper glacis plate of the Panther from any distance, could penetrate the lower glacis plate from , could penetrate the mantlet from and could penetrate the front turret from . The side armour of the Panther was comparatively weaker and could be pentrated at according to the same Wa Pruef 1 report. Testing with captured Tiger Ausf Bs in Kubinka showed that the 122 mm D-25T was capable of penetrating the Tiger Ausf B's turret from and the weld joint or edges of the front hull plates at ranges of . In 1944, the BR-471 was the sole armor-piercing round available. An improved version, the BR-471B () was developed in spring 1945, but was available in quantity only after World War II ended. According to the same Wa Pruef 1 report, it was estimated that at 30 degree obliquity the hull armor of the Soviet IS-2 model 1943 would be defeated by Tiger I between at the driver's front plate and nose, while the IS-2's 122 mm gun would penetrate the Tiger's front armor from between . A Panther had to close to to guarantee penetration of the IS-2's frontal armor (The Panther's 75 mm gun could penetrate the IS-2 model 1943's mantlet from , front turret from , and driver's front plate from ), while the IS-2 could penetrate the Panther at ranges of .The German military intelligence journal for tank crews \\"Nachrichtenblatt der Panzertruppen Nr.12, June 1944 p. 34\\" reported that the IS-2 could be successful attacked at approximately at the angle of 30 degrees. This calculation was derived from firing tables \\"Pz. Beschusstafel\\" created against the KV-85. Steven Zaloga makes therefore an unfavorable comparison (30¬∞ to 90¬∞ for the range of destruction) for the Panther over its adversary However, in the summer of 1944, the Germans experienced a shortage of manganese and had to switch to using high-carbon steel alloyed with nickel, which made armor very brittle, especially at the seam welds. The performance of the 122 mm AP shells of the IS-2 against the Panther improved considerably. The reports from the front described cases where the BR-471 APHE round 122 mm projectile fired from ricocheted off the front armor of a Panther, leaving huge breaches in it. According to Steven Zaloga, the IS-2 and Tiger I could knock each other out in normal combat distances below . At any range, the performance of each tank against each other was dependent on the crew and combat situation. Line drawing of IS-2 The large 122 mm HE shell was its main asset, proving highly useful and destructive as an infantry-killer. In extremis, the IS-2 engaged enemy heavy armor with OF-471 () high explosive projectiles. These shells had a mass of , a muzzle velocity of , and were equipped with a TNT charge. The explosive power could blow off an enemy tank turret, drive sprocket and tread off the heaviest German tank even if it could not penetrate the armor. Mechanical shock and explosion was often enough to knock out enemy heavy tanks. The most recognizable disadvantage of the D-25T gun was its slow rate of fire due to the large size and weight of the shells; only one to one and a half rounds per minute could be fired, initially. After some design improvements, including a semi-automatic drop breech over the previously manual screw breech, the rate of fire increased to 2‚Äì3 rounds per minute. According to other sources, the increase may have amounted to 3‚Äì4 rounds per minute. Another limitation imposed by the size of its ammunition in a relatively small vehicle was the ammunition stowage: only 28 rounds could be carried inside the tank, with a complement of 20 HE rounds and 8 AP rounds the norm.  Production  The IS-122 prototype replaced the IS-85 and began mass production as the IS-2. The 85 mm guns could be reserved for the new T-34-85 medium tank and some of the IS-1s built were rearmed before leaving the factory and issued as IS-2s. It was slightly lighter and faster than the heaviest KV model 1942 tank, with thicker front armor and a much-improved turret design. The tank could carry thicker armor than the KV series, while remaining lighter, due to the better layout of the armor envelope. The KV's armor was less well-shaped and featured heavy armor even on the rear, while the IS series concentrated its armor at the front. The IS-2 was slightly heavier than the Panther, much lighter than the Tiger I and Tiger II and had a lower silhouette than both. Western observers tended to criticize Soviet tanks for their lack of finish and crude construction. The Soviets argued that it was warranted, considering the need for wartime expediency and the typically short battlefield life of their tanks. Armor plan of IS-2, models 1943 (top) and 1944 (bottom). Early IS-2s can be identified by the 'stepped' front hull casting with its small, opening driver's visor. The early tanks lacked gun tube travel locks or anti-aircraft-capable machine guns and had narrow mantlets. In late 1944, the stepped hull front was replaced with an improved single casting of 120 mm thickness angled at 60 degrees. This new nose lacked the opening driver's visor. It is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the IS-2M, but that designation actually refers to a much later modernization program from the 1950s. Other minor upgrades included the addition of a travel lock on the hull rear, wider mantlet and, on very late models, an anti- aircraft machine gun. In comparison to the Tiger I, the IS-2 had modest advantages in armour, even though it was 10 tons lighter. In 1944, the latter was the only large-scale Allied tank whose armor provided some protection from the well-known Tiger 88mm long-barreled guns and Panther 75mm L/70 guns. In the mid-1950s, the remaining IS-2 tanks (mostly model 1944 variants) were upgraded to the IS-2M standard, which introduced fittings such as external fuel tanks on the rear hull (the basic IS-2 had these only on the hull sides), stowage bins on both sides of the hull and protective skirting along the top edges of the tracks.  Combat history  The IS-2 tank first saw combat in early 1944, equipping elite Guards Heavy Tank Regiments of the Red Army. Initial German contact was made by Otto Carius with a pair of Tiger Is. After knocking out a column of T-34's, Carius moved into the nearby village of Malinava where he came face to face with the new IS-2. It was quickly destroyed, however as Carius moved further into the village, he discovered a platoon of eight additional IS-2s. Carius and the 2nd Tiger dispatched all eight tanks without a loss. This was due to the fact that in order to reload the IS‚Äôs 122mm cannon, the barrel had to be lowered to allow a new shell to be inserted into the breach. A regiment had 21 IS-2 tanks in four companies of five tanks each and one being used by the regimental commander. The special tank regiments were reserved for important attacks, often to spearhead attempts to break through fortified German positions like anti-tank defence lines and bunkers. The tanks supporting infantry in the assault by destroying bunkers, buildings, dug-in weapons and engaging German armoured vehicles. Once a breakthrough was achieved, lighter and more mobile tanks were used for exploitation and mopping-up. The IS-2 tank first saw action in Ukraine in early 1944 and claimed to have destroyed more than forty Tigers and Elefants for the loss of only eight tanks. While the German heavy tanks could knock out the IS-2, they had no real answer to its gun, which easily outgunned them. = Oglƒôd√≥w = On the morning of 11 August 1944, the 16th Panzer Division attacked the 53d Guards Tank Brigade reinforced by the 71st Independent Guards Heavy Tank Regiment in the town of Oglƒôd√≥w, toward Stasz√≥w. The extremely sandy terrain forced the eleven King Tigers to keep to the roads, whilst the defending Soviet forces positioned their tanks and assault guns in ambush positions and concentrated on the known German avenues of approach. When the attack started, three Tiger IIs were destroyed by fire from Soviet IS-2 tanks and one more Tiger II was knocked out a few hours later by a T-34/76 at a range of less than 400 meters. Later in the day, Soviet forces counter- attacked and seized the town of Oglƒôd√≥w and found three abandoned Tiger IIs. The capture of these tanks allowed the Soviets to conduct tests at Kubinka and to evaluate its strengths and weaknesses. Over the next two days the Red Army advanced on Stasz√≥w and in several counter-attacks, Heavy Tank Battalion 501 lost seven more Tiger IIs. Virtually all of these were destroyed by Soviet tanks occupying a defensive position against those German attacks. In three days of fighting, Soviet forces destroyed or captured 14 of 30 Tiger IIs to an approximately equal number of Soviet IS-2s and T-34s. = Post World War II = By the 1950s, the emergence of the main battle tank concept‚Äîcombining medium-tank mobility with the firepower and armor of the heavy tank‚Äîhad rendered heavy tanks obsolete. In the late 1960s the remaining Soviet heavy tanks were transferred to Red Army reserve service and storage. The IS-2 Model 1944 remained in service much longer in the armies of Cuba, China and North Korea. A regiment of Chinese IS-2s was available for use in the Korean War but saw no service there. After the Korean War, China attempted to reverse- engineer the IS-2/IS-3 as the Type 122 medium tank.

She produced prose, poetry, children's fiction, and translations. Lee contributed many short stories and poems to The Rosebud and other publications. Early years and education Mary Elizabeth Lee was born at Charleston, South Carolina, March 23, 1813. She was the daughter of William Lee and niece of Judge Thomas Lee. She belonged to an old family of high social rank and intellectual culture of South Carolina. On account of an extremely delicate organization and sensibility, Lee was carefully shielded from all rough contact with the world, not even being allowed to enter school until she was ten years of age. She was then placed in charge of Mr. A. Bolles, a successful teacher of young ladies, in Charleston. The advantages of the school-room seemed to unfold to her a new world of resource. Books became her passion. She made rapid progress in her studies, and gathered a store of varied knowledge for future use. About this time, she began to develop also great aptitude for the acquisition of languages, but her health gave way under the pressure of close application, and she was obliged to pursue a less systematic and rigorous course within the quiet precincts of her own home. But no obstacles checked her advancement in knowledge. Career At the age of twenty, Lee became a contributor to The Rose Bud, a periodical edited by Mrs. Gilman, and gradually growing into marked favor with the public. At the same age, she began contributing to The Southern Rose, attracting attention. She also became a frequent contributor to Graham's Magazine, Godey's Lady's Book, and the Southern Literary Messenger. Lee used the pen names \\"M.E.L.\\" and \\"A Friend\\". Her first volume, entitled Social Evenings, or Historical Tales for Youth, was published in 1840 by the Massachusetts Board of Education School Library Association, and proved to be one of the most attractive in the collection. \\"Correggio's Holy Family\\" was one of her best, but possibly \\"The Hour of Death\\", and \\"The Death Bed of Prince Henry\\" better show her characteristics as a writer. The best known of her poetical pieces is thought to be \\"The Blind Negro Communicant.\\" She produced a number of translations. Determined to maintain herself in strict independence, she continued to write for northern and southern periodicals, until her health utterly failed. That she was possessed of an indefatigable and truly heroic spirit, may be learned from the fact that when her right hand became helpless from paralysis, she grasped the pen firmly with the left hand, acquired a new style of chirography, and continued to write. After years of slow physical torture, Lee died in the midst of her family, at Charleston, September 23, 1849. The Poetical Remains of the late Mary Elizabeth Lee, with a Biographical Memoir by S. Gilman, D. D., was published after her death in 1851 (Charleston). Style She published many poetical translations from the French, German and Italian, besides original poems, chiefly in the balled style, founded on Southern traditions. Regarding The Poetical Remains of the late Mary Elizabeth Lee, with a Biographical Memoir by S. Gilman, D. D., a review by The Christian Examiner and Religious Miscellany (1851) commented:‚Äî \\"Lee's poems are characterized by heartiness and simplicity rather than by any brilliancy or genius.

The hospital was built in the converted stable block of The Crescent. The building is now known as the Devonshire Dome and it is the site of the Buxton Campus of the University of Derby.  Buxton Bath Charity  The Buxton Bath Charity was founded in 1779 to pay for poor people to have access to the healing waters of Buxton, for the treatment of rheumatism, gout and various other conditions. All visitors to Buxton's hotels and lodging houses were expected to contribute one shilling to the charity and sign the subscription book. In 1822 there were nearly 800 patients admitted through the charity, which paid for board and lodging, medicines and water treatments for up to five weeks. By the 1850s the numbers exceeded 1000. In 1859, the Buxton Bath Charity had persuaded the Duke of Devonshire to allow part of the building (by then accommodating nothing like the 110 horses for which it was designed) to be converted to a charity hospital for the use of the ‚Äòsick poor‚Äô coming in for treatment from the ‚ÄòCottonopolis‚Äô of Lancashire and Yorkshire. The Devonshire estate architect, Henry Currey (who designed St Thomas's Hospital in London), converted two thirds of the Great Stables (built by John Carr of York) into a hospital with 120 beds for the poor. The charity became The Devonshire Hospital and Buxton Bath Charity. Sir Charles Scudamore and Dr William Henry Robertson were both honorary physicians for the charity and in 1865 Dr Robertson became chairman of The Devonshire Hospital and Buxton Bath Charity.  Devonshire Dome  In 1879, the Buxton Bath Charity trustees persuaded William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire to give them the use of the whole building in exchange for providing new stables elsewhere in the town. Local architect Robert Rippon Duke was commissioned to design a hospital to rival Bath's and Harrogate's facilities for charity medical care. The stables on the ground floor were converted into hospital rooms by 1882. Included in Rippon Duke's design was the world's largest unsupported dome with a diameter of , now known as the Devonshire Dome. 300 hospital beds \\"for the relief of the poor\\" were now accommodated in the building. The Cotton Districts Convalescent fund put up ¬£25,000 for the conversion. By 1882 the hospital had its own baths building in George Street, although these were closed in 1914 when new mineral baths were built on the hospital site. Further changes were undertaken, with the clock tower (a tribute to the hospital's chairman Dr William Henry Robertson) and lodge completed in 1882, the Jubilee surgical wards in 1897 and the dining room and kitchens extension in 1921. King Edward VII (a friend of the 8th Duke of Devonshire) and Queen Alexandra came to Buxton in 1905 to tour the Devonshire Hospital and Buxton Bath Charity. The royals also visited the Thermal and Natural Baths and the Pavilion Gardens. VAD nurse Vera Brittain Vera Brittain (author of Testament of Youth) trained as a Voluntary Aid Detachment nurse at the Devonshire Hospital in 1915, caring for soldiers wounded during World War I. Over 5,000 soldiers were treated in Buxton. In 1934 the establishment was give permission by King George V to become known as the Devonshire Royal Hospital.  National Health Service  The Buxton Bath Charity was incorporated into the National Health Service in 1948 and from then the Devonshire Royal Hospital provided treatments for acute conditions, rheumatism and allied diseases, orthopaedics and rehabilitation. The Devonshire Royal Hospital was the last of the eight hydropathic hospitals in England to close, in 2000. There are currently two hospitals in Buxton: the Cavendish Hospital (opened in 1967) for various services including geriatric healthcare and the Buxton Cottage Hospital (opened in 1912) for minor injuries.

The Winter Sports Building was finished in 1936 for a total cost of $46,000 and was initially used by many UND programs, including the track and football teams.

It has between three and eight leaves in a fan-like arrangement on each shoot and up to three hundred tiny cream-coloured or greenish flowers arranged in whorls around the flowering stem. It is endemic to eastern Australia. Description Oberonia complanata is an epiphytic, clump-forming herb. Each shoot has between three and eight fleshy, oblong to lance-shaped, yellowish green leaves long and about wide with their bases overlapping. Between 150 and 300 cream-coloured or greenish flowers about long and wide are arranged in whorls on an arching flowering stem long. The sepals and petals are egg-shaped to triangular, spread widely apart from each other and about long. The labellum is green, about long and wide with three obscure lobes, the middle lobe with a notched tip. Flowering occurs between February and July. Taxonomy and naming The southern green fairy orchid was first formally described in 1839 by Allan Cunningham who gave it the name Dendrobium complanatum and published the description in Edwards's Botanical Register. In 1989 Mark Clements and David Jones changed the name to Oberonia complanata. The specific epithet (complanata) is a Latin word meaning \\"flattened\\". Distribution and habitat Oberonia complanata grows on trees and rocks in rainforest between Gympie in Queensland and Coffs Harbour in New South Wales. Conservation This orchid is classed as \\"endangered\\" in New South Wales under the Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016. It has recently been seen in the Lismore district and near Mount Warning but has not been seen near Coffs Harbour since 1961. The main threats to the species are land clearing, habitat degradation and illegal collecting.

In 2013, Welty was interviewed by Steve Kroft for a CBS 60 Minutes segment on the impact of robots in the workplace. In 2012, Amazon.com acquired Kiva Systems for $775M. In 2014, Amazon notified Quiet that it was reserving use of the Kiva robotics system for its own operations and would not be renewing Quiet's existing agreement signed with Kiva Systems prior to Amazon's acquisition of Kiva. Welty and Johnson began searching for a next-generation warehouse robot. Unable to find one that met their requirements, they began developing their own and founded Locus Robotics in 2015.

He was a graduate of the Iranian Military Academy and later served as commanding officer of Iran's flight academy. In 1977 he was the Shah's Vice Minister of War and led Project Flower, which entailed an economic deal between Iran and Israel which would have built cooperation and exchanged Iranian oil for an Israeli missile system, but which collapsed in 1979 during the Iranian Revolution.Bergman, Ronen.

His father was a tailor. Toufanian was the oldest of five sons and two daughters. He graduated from Dar al-Funun in high school and briefly attended a small medical school before pursuing a career in the air force. He received a military commission in 1936. After graduating from the academy, Toufanian married Fatemeh Zerehi and they had four sons and two daughters.Milani, Abbas.

During the 1940s, he also spent 18 months in England. from 1950 to 1952 he attended military training in the United States. He claimed no role in the August 1953 Iranian coup d'√©tat, but was a pilot involved in escorting the Shah's return at its end. He then worked as a teacher at the Officers Academy. By the end of the 1950s, he was the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's Office of Planning. He was involved in designing defense against perceived threats from the Soviet Union and Iraq. This duty brought him closer to the Shah, and in 1961 he was named one of the shah's special adjutants, responsible for notifying the shah in his quarters if an emergency arose during off house. In 1963, Toufanian became arms purchaser for the Iranian Armed Forces. In this role, Toufanian was involved in many deals, during which he received kickbacks and became quite wealthy. He also became undersecretary in the Ministry of War and the director of Iran's main military industrial corporation. He hired promising officers and scientists to run the organization and its Research and Development Department, greatly improving the efficiency of the cooperation. Under his supervision, the military saw success reverse engineering weapons technologies and licensing agreements with Western companies. Although a member of the Shah's inner circle, Toufanian worked with the United States CIA as an informant.Bergman, Ronen.

Simon and Schuster, 2008. p5-7 =Project Flower and Iranian Revolution= In 1977 Toufanian traveled to Israel and negotiated a multi-billion-dollar exchange of oil for Israeli Jericho missiles. He was also involved in a separate project named Tzier which sought to increase the range of Iran's own missiles using Israeli technology. In February 1979, the monarchy of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi was overthrown in the Iranian Revolution, and Project Flower ended. In the early days of the Revolution, Toufanian was announced to have been arrested, but was escaped from prison in a secret deal, going into hiding in Tehran for nine months. He eventually moved to the United States where he lived the rest of his life in exile. After the fall of the Shah, Toufanian moved to Chevy Chase, MD, which is in the Washington, D.C. suburbs.

Her work has won numerous awards including a UK Music Video Award and a Glass Lion at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity.  Career  Gehrig was born in Sydney, Australia, and moved to London to study at Central Saint Martins, University of the Arts London. The first eight years of her career were spent as a Creative at advertising agency Mother. One of her first major works as a director was the 'You are Powerful' video for Amnesty International, released on the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. For this she won a Silver Lion at Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity 2010 and a broadcast award by the Young Director Awards. In a collaboration with Australian musician Kirin J. Callinan, Gehrig directed a video challenging toxic masculinity and pressure for men to look like bodybuilders in Australia, overlaid with Callinan covering Divine's 'You Think You're a Man'. Gehrig works for Somesuch advertising productions, who were awarded Advertising Age's 2018 Production Company of the Year for their work in promoting social justice through advertising. = This Girl Can (Sport England) = Gehrig directed the multi award-winning advert for the This Girl Can campaign by Sport England to encourage more women to take part in sport. The video features personal and unfiltered clips of women exercising as they would be normally. The advert was praised for its bold and empowering message, winning awards including a Glass Lion for Good at Cannes Lions 2015. Sport England estimated that an additional 2.8 million women decided to take up a sport after the advert's release. The first advert was followed by 'Phenomenal Women', showcasing women from all walks of life engaging in sport set to Maya Angelou's recital of Phenomenal Woman. Gehrig stated in 2018 that 'This Girl Can' is the video she is most proud of. = Man on The Moon (John Lewis) = Later in 2015 Gehrig premiered the first John Lewis Christmas advert to be directed by a woman; 'Man on The Moon'.

The video was set to a cover of Oasis' 'Half the World Away' by Aurora. = Viva la Vulva (Libresse) = Gehrig directed the award- winning 'Viva la Vulva' advert for Libresse, a celebration of the vagina and women body confidence. The video contains many items from normal life which resemble vaginas as well as puppetry and outfits resembling genitalia. It was set to the music of Camille Yarbrough's 'Take Yo‚Äô Praise'.. = The Best Men Can Be (Gillette) = Gehrig again rose to prominence in 2019 for 'The Best Men Can Be' advertising video by razor company Gillette, which challenges its earlier tagline of \\"The Best a Man Can Get\\" and the effects of toxic masculinity. The advert was praised by some for its message against the traditional concepts of how men should be, and how this impacts mental health as well as women. However, the advert was criticised by others for its negative portrayal of men. Multiple commentators, such as Piers Morgan, were incensed by the campaign and vowed to boycott the company. Marketing Week saw the backlash towards the ad as backfiring on Gillete following declining sales metrics for the brand. Gehrig responded to some of the criticism by saying: \\"The project had actually been conceived, written and edited by men. But because I‚Äôm a female director, it fitted neatly into a troll‚Äôs narrative.\\" = Music Videos = Gehrig has directed numerous music videos in addition to her advertising work. She won 'Best Urban Music Video' at the 2009 UK Music Video Awards for Wiley 's 'Cash in My Pocket', and was nominated in 2018 for her music video for Chaka Khan's 'Like Suga'.

Saules was a free black sailor who was shipwrecked off the Oregon Coast in 1841 while working in the United States Exploring Expedition. He settled in what is now Washington state, near Cape Disappointment and married; his wife was Chinook. A couple years later he moved to Oregon's Willamette Valley near what is now Oregon City, where he was involved in the Cockstock Incident. This incident is believed to be a major factor in the 1844 passage of Oregon's Black Exclusion Law. After the incident Saules was arrested and tried for allegedly causing local Native Americans to be violent against a white man. He was forced to move back to Cape Disappointment. Saul continued to experience difficulties in Washington, including the death of his wife, until his eventual death, believed to be in the early 1850s.  Early life  There is no definite birthplace of Saules. Some historians have cited his birthplace as Peru, which is the place he was first documented, but others think it is more likely he is from the United States. This is because he would most likely have needed to produce proof of US citizenship to join the US Navy, and Silas B. Smith, a child when he met Saules, cited his origin as America, and more specifically Virginia. In addition, it is assumed Saules was a sailor before joining the United States Exploring Expedition because there is evidence he lived in New Haven in 1833. It is also uncertain if he was born enslaved or free.  Cockstock Incident  The Cockstock Incident was named after a Wasco Indian named Cockstock. This incident involved Cockstock, George Winslow, Dr. White, La Breton, Anderson, and James Saules himself. Savage, W. Sherman. ‚ÄúThe Negro in the History of the Pacific Northwest.‚Äù The Journal of Negro History, vol. 13, no. 3, 1928, pp. 255‚Äì264. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/2713979. Accessed 20 Feb. 2020. Of these men, La Breton was a member of the Provisional Government of Oregon. The problem started when Saules bought a horse from Winslow that was initially promised to Cockstock after working for him. After learning his horse was gone, Cockstock confiscated the horse and continued to make threats towards the men. This prompted the sub-Indian agent, Elijah White to get involved and remove Cockstock from the Willamette Valley. Ultimately Henderson and Saules killed the Indian out of defense for Anderson. Dr. White paid off the Cockstock‚Äôs family to ease tension after the Indian was murdered by Henderson and Saules. Savage, W. Sherman. ‚ÄúThe Negro in the History of the Pacific Northwest.‚Äù The Journal of Negro History, vol. 13, no. 3, 1928, pp. 255‚Äì264. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/2713979. Accessed 20 Feb. 2020. In March of 1844 a skirmish erupted in Oregon City leaving Cockstock and others mortally wounded. This conflict brought to light the possibility of an inter-racial Indian-black alliance against white settlers. This led members of the Oregon Provisional Government to pass the regions first Black Exclusion Law's in June of 1844. Though the laws received various revision, the Cockstock Incident most notably evoked the Oregon Lash Law. In 1847, The Waillatpu riot was initiated by free black men Winslow Henderson and James D. Saules. Under this new set of laws, no black male or female could reside in Oregon for more than 3 years. Blacks were subject to public beatings and threatened with arrest for those who did not cooperate. These criminals were sold as indentured servants to any common citizen in need of labor force.  Maritime work  Saules began his maritime career early in life. According to US Navy Lieutenant Neil M. Howison, Saules started sailing when he was about 15 years old, about 20 years before arriving on the Oregon Coast. In 1833, Saules joined a whaling crew on the Winslow in New Haven, in which he served as a mate, just below captain. There is a strong chance that Saules deserted during his deployment, possibly on Cocos Island. Nine deserters from the Winslow were picked up by another whaling ship, the Almira, and were taken to Paita, Peru. In July 1839, he joined the United States Exploring Expedition, also known as the US Ex. Ex. or the Wilkes Expedition after the commander US Navy Lieutenant Charles Wilkes. Saules' opportunity was rare for black men in Antebellum America. He joined the expedition's second year of 1839, when they stopped in Callao, Peru. He became a cook, a job with relative independence and separation from the crew. There is also a possibility Saules was a musician on the US Ex. Ex. as a fiddler or violinist. On this ship, he visited, Tuamotu Archipelago (Tuamotus), Tahiti, Samoa, Sydney, Fiji, Hawaii, and Utiroa of the Drummond Islands.  Place- names controversy  In 2016 Washington Senator Pramila Jayapal proposed an effort to change 36 place names in the state that contained racial slurs. Three of these names were \\"Jim Crow\\" place names, thought by historians to be a reference to, James (Jim) Saules, who lived in the direct vicinity of the place names. However, some locals said the names were not racist, but instead the \\"Jim Crow\\" names were derived from an Indian Chief, logger, or for birds near the location. Although Pramila Jayapal had proposed renaming the locations \\"Jim Saules\\" in the end the locals chose three different names.

The ticket office, toilets and waiting room were situated on the up platform, consisting of a rough-cast and brick built single-storey structure, with round-headed windows at the front and a central covered area. The shelter on the down platform was a typical GNoSR design with wooden slatted sides and at the eastern end of this platform stood the signal box. A pedestrian footbridge linked the platforms and a road overbridge stood at the western end of the station. A large stone built goods shed was provided, served by a siding that also served a loading dock; another siding ran parallel to it and a final siding ran behind the down platform.

It was the first school for African Americans in Gainesville and Alachua County, and provided a free quality education to African Americans when public schools in Alachua County were struggling. The Union Academy was eventually absorbed into the county school system, and remained in operation until 1923. At the beginning of the Civil War, African Americans, mostly slaves, were 54% of the population in Alachua County, but few lived in Gainesville, only 46 out of a population of 269 in 1860. At the end of the war, in May 1865, a company of the 3rd United States Colored Infantry Regiment were stationed in Gainesville. They were replaced in October by a company of the 34th United States Colored Infantry Regiment. In December the 34th Regiment company was replaced by troops from the 7th Infantry Regiment. The presence of black troops in Gainesville in 1865 encouraged freed men to settle there. At the same time black farm laborers were recruited from Georgia and South Carolina to help harvest what was expected to be a very large cotton crop, but heavy rain ruined the cotton, and the recently arrived blacks were left without work. Black residents soon outnumbered whites in Gainesville, which had had 223 white residents in 1860. By 1870, Gainesville had a population of 1,444, of which 765 were black. School opens It had been illegal for slaves to learn to read before the end of the Civil War. The Freedmen's Bureau encouraged the creation of schools for the newly freed slaves, providing plans and building materials, and coordinating funds provided by northern churches and private charities. Two white female teachers from New England were sent to Gainesville in late 1865 by the National Freedmen's Relief Association of New York, with support from the New York Bureau of the Freedmen's Union Commission. They initially taught 60 black students in an unfinished church without windows or doors. The teachers were ostracised by the white community of Gainesville, and white boys harassed the classes they conducted. The school did make progress. The Freedmen's Bureau agent in Gainesville, Joseph Durkee, reported that the ceremonies at the end of the school year in 1867 were attended by some prominent white leaders. Original Union Academy, 1867‚Äìmid-1890s In the fall of 1867 a group of blacks in Gainesville organized a board of trustees to open a school for freedmen. Property was acquired as the site for the school, which was to be called the Union Academy. Using plans and construction materials provided by the Freedmen's Bureau, the school was built by freedmen who volunteered their labor (the 1870 census found more than a dozen black carpenters in Gainesville). The building had one floor, and a \\"piazza\\". It was topped by a tall belfry, which was equipped in 1870 with a bell. Only one other school built for black students by the Freedmen's Bureau in Florida was larger. Initial furnishings for the school apparently were sparse, although a parlor organ for music lessons was added in 1872. In 1868 instruction at the Union Academy was divided into primary and grammar departments. The first teachers left the school by 1870, and were replaced by two white teachers sent by the American Missionary Association, with two black assistants. The school was partially supported by the newly organized Alachua County Board of Public Instruction and by the Peabody Education Fund, and was serving 179 students, 8 of whom were above the primary level. While reporting on their success with students, the teachers also complained about inadequate supplies and books, absentee students, and crowded classrooms. Public schools There were no publicly supported schools in Gainesville and Alachua County before 1869. White students from families who could afford it attended the Gainesville Academy, a private school. The county commission did provide funds to pay the tuition of students whose families could not afford to do so, and who were not capable of teaching themselves, but few families were willing to be classified as paupers, and school-age children from poor families generally did without formal education. The Gainesville Academy had 67 students and 3 teachers in 1866. That year, J. H. Roper, who owned the school, offered the school building and grounds to the state if they would move the East Florida Seminary to Gainesville. The Seminary had been established by the state in 1853 in Ocala to serve Florida students from east of the Suwannee River, but it had closed during the Civil War due to lack of funds. Two other private schools opened in Gainesville within a year, Spencer's Academy, and a school for \\"young ladies and children.\\" The Alachua County Board of Public Instruction had been established in 1869, and there were 22 public schools in the county by 1870, but each school had its own board of trustees. Those schools were unpopular with much of the white population. Almost all of the boards of trustees had at least one black member, and the textbooks used were often pro- Union in sentiment. The schools were poorly equipped, lacking many necessities (only 15 schools had brooms), and qualified teachers were hard to find. The county superintendent reported, \\"About half the school buildings in use are comfortable and convenient.\\" Republicans, including blacks, held many elected offices in Florida during Reconstruction, but by 1877 white Democrats were regaining control in the state, including the Alachua County school system. Support for the Union Academy from the Freedmen's Bureau and most northern charities had dried up by 1874 (some support from the Peabody Fund continued until 1882). The white public had begun to accept that attending free public schools was not a sign of paupery. A segregated public school system was established, with most of the available resources going to white schools. The change in control of the schools brought a cut in spending, and the school year for county supported schools, which had been five months long, was reduced to three months. In contrast, the Union Academy had \\"well-educated teachers\\", was in session for eight months of the year, and was the only public school in the county with students divided into grades and using standard textbooks. The Union Academy received $3,000.00 a year from the state for support of the normal department. The last white teachers had left the school in 1873, and it had an all-black staff after that. Graduates of the Academy's normal department also taught in the black schools throughout Alachua County. Expansion Enlarged Union Academy, mid 1890s‚Äì1923 A bond issue was approved by the voters of Gainesville in 1883 to fund improvements at the East Florida Seminary (which was a state school, not under the county school system) and the Union Academy. The bond issue was not popular with white voters, but was carried with support from black voters. As the city could not spend funds on property it did not own, the trustees of the Union Academy sold it to the city for $2,000, which was spent on repairs and improvements to the school needed to expand the normal department. The East Florida Seminary received $6,000 from the bond issue, which was used on construction of a new building. In the mid-1890s a second story was added to the Union Academy building, at a cost of $1,100. The school now had eleven classrooms and could hold 700 students. By 1903 a neighboring house had been added to the school for the primary department. Electric lights had been installed in the main school building by 1919, but the primary department building still used kerosene lights. In 1920 another bond issue was passed for the construction of two new high schools in Gainesville, one for whites and one for blacks. Both were built of brick, were of similar size, and had similar features. By 1922 the Union Academy was serving 500 students in grades 1‚Äì9 with eleven teachers under Principal A. Quinn Jones. The new high school, Lincoln High School was completed in 1923, and the privies from the old school were moved to the new school that summer.

During the Second World War, her codename was Sissy, and she was in a section of the Red Three Swiss resistance movement. Personal life D√ºbendorfer was born in Warsaw, Poland in 1900. She was the daughter of Adolf Hepner, and was Jewish. She moved to Germany in the 1920s and moved to N√ºrensdorf, Switzerland in 1933. She was married twice: first to German lawyer Kurt Caspary in c.1921, then to Swissman Henri D√ºbendorfer, which allowed her to gain Swiss citizenship in 1934. She divorced in 1946 and became the lover of Paul B√∂ttcher. She died in 1973 in East Berlin, East Germany. Career In 1918, D√ºbendorfer joined the Communist Party of Germany. In 1927, D√ºbendorfer joined the Soviet Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), where she worked alongside Paul B√∂ttcher. At the start of the Second World War, she worked as a secretary at the League of Nations International Labour Organization and also led a group of Swiss communist informants in Geneva, Switzerland. D√ºbendorfer began receiving sensitive information from sources in the organisation. She received intelligence reports from German refugee Rudolf Roessler (nicknamed Lucy) in return for not revealing his identity. Their operation was known as the Lucy spy ring. In 1942, D√ºbendorfer received German military information about the planned Case Blue invasion of the Soviet Union (USSR), which was eventually transmitted to the Soviet Union. In 1941, D√ºbendorfer met Alexander Rad√≥ for the first time. In 1942, she was in a section of Rado's Red Three resistance movement. Others in the movement included Georges Blun and Otto P√ºnter. Initially, D√ºbendorfer did not mention to Rad√≥ the name of Roessler, her most important informant. In November 1943, D√ºbendorfer became the lone Red Three member after leaders, including Rad√≥, were arrested and imprisoned. D√ºbendorfer tried unsuccessfully to contact Moscow through Hermina Rabinovitch, a friend who lived in Montreal, Canada. Afterwards, D√ºbendorfer refused to co-operate with Soviet leader Joseph Stalin and did not want to send information back to Moscow. She provided information to MI6 officers in Switzerland, under the proviso that this information was not shared with Moscow. In April 1944, D√ºbendorfer and B√∂ttcher were captured. She was imprisoned in the USSR and later East Germany from 1946 until 1956 and so she never became a leader.

Founded in 1978 as the Mid-Columbia Sinfonietta, the CGOA was created in 2005 and now encompasses six ensembles: Sinfonietta (community orchestra), Voci Choir, Jazz Collective (big band jazz), String Quartet (classical), Stages (musicals), and Youth Choir. As of 2020, Mark Steighner is the artistic director of the association. History =Early musical groups in Hood River= The earliest musical group in the Hood River Valley was the Hood River Music Association (HRMA), founded in 1942 by parents and members of the local community. The HRMA would come to be led by Boris Sirpo, the founder of the Portland Chamber Orchestra, who dreamed of turning Hood River into the \\"Salzburg of America\\". Under Sirpo, the association would twice put on the Hood River Music Festival, a four-day event held in 1948 and 1951, and sponsored the Hood River Symphony, a children's orchestra, and junior and senior choirs. Sirpo would break ties with the HRMA in 1956 due to contract disputes, and would be replaced by a string of conductors over the next 22 years. =Mid-Columbia Sinfonietta= On May 14, 1978, the Mid- Columbia Sinfonietta presented its first concert, held in Hood River under the auspices of the Chamber Music Society of Oregon. Dorothy McCormick, a Hood River native who had studied violin under Sirpo in the 1940s, served as the first director of the sinfonietta. The orchestra became a member of the Portland Chamber Music Society, but remained as an amateur ensemble. The local youth orchestra would also be brought into the fold, being renamed as the Mid- Columbia Junior Orchestra and also being conducted by McCormick. McCormick passed away in 2004 after suffering a stroke while conducting the junior orchestra in concert. She was replaced in the role of conductor by Mark Steighner, who directed his first concert in charge of the Sinfonietta on March 4, 2005. Steighner, the music director at Hood River Valley High School, led the charge to \\"increase the professionalism\\" of the Sinfonietta, highlighted by a name change to the Columbia Gorge Sinfonietta and the June 2005 formation of the Columbia Gorge Orchestra Association (CGOA). =Columbia Gorge Orchestra Association= The CGOA was officially formed as a nonprofit organization on June 25, 2005, with Faith Ackerman named as the first president of the board of directors. Upon the founding of the CGOA, the Sinfonietta began to collaborate with artists from outside the Columbia River Gorge area, including Storm Large, Stephen Seifert, Blair Tindall, and the Vienna Boys' Choir. The association also began expanding beyond orchestra, originally with the addition of the VOCI choir in December 2006. A youth choir, a big band, and a theatre ensemble were all added over the next ten years. In 2016, Steighner founded the Performing Arts Initiative (PAI), an all-volunteer effort to develop a dedicated performing arts building in the Columbia River Gorge. The PAI signed a land lease agreement to build a 600-seat multi-use facility for performing arts in Hood River; architectural renderings of the complex were released in 2019. Ensembles The founding ensemble of CGOA is the Columbia Gorge Sinfonietta, the largest and oldest of the association's six ensembles. It typically has about 45 musicians, with five to nine being paid, professional musicians from the Portland metropolitan area. The Sinfonietta existed alone until the creation of CGOA, when VOCI was created in 2006. The choir performs both alone and with the Sinfonietta, and after years of flux has settled to become a mixed-gender group of about 50 singers. The CGOA also includes the Gorge Youth Chorus, open to children ages eight to 13. It had been created in the early years of the CGOA but went on hiatus before returning as an active ensemble. Two more ensembles were added to CGOA in 2015: The Gorge Jazz Collective and the Hood River String Quartet. The Jazz Collective is a contemporary big band, but also has collaborated with local banda and marimba groups. The string quartet is the only one of the six CGOA ensembles that does not perform public shows, but instead plays private house concerts, weddings, and special occasions. Professional violinist Chari Bickford, also a member of the Sinfonietta, became the first leader of the quartet. The newest CGOA ensemble is Stages Theatre, added to the association in 2016. The theatre group presents both musical theatre and nonmusical productions, including Murder Ballad, and is the only CGOA ensemble that is not solely a musical group.

(September 28, 1898 ‚Äì December 28, 1953) was an American Catholic priest and Jesuit who held senior positions at several Jesuit universities in the United States. Born in New York City, he was educated at Jesuit institutions, before entering the Society of Jesus. He then became a professor of chemistry at Georgetown University, and continued his higher studies at Jesuit universities in the United States and Rome. He became the acting dean of Georgetown College in 1935, and then vice president and dean of studies at Loyola College in Maryland, before being appointed president of Georgetown University in 1942. His tenure was largely shaped by World War II, which necessitated his admittance of women into the Graduate School of Arts and Science. A proponent of racial integration, he instructed administrators to admit the first black undergraduate students. While this did not materialize until shortly after his presidency, the university did begin admitting black students in several of its graduate schools during his term. He also joined the presidents of other local universities in agreeing to allow medical students from Howard University to train at Washington, D.C.'s public hospital. During his presidency, Gorman constructed the new Georgetown University Hospital building, and raised funds for the construction of McDonough Gymnasium. Following the end of his term of office, he became vice president and dean of studies at the University of Scranton, where he died in 1953.  Early life and education  Lawrence Clifton Gorman was born on September 28, 1898, in New York City, to Lawrence P. Gorman and Anna Teresa Gorman n√©e Nagle. He enrolled in Xavier High School (where he was later inducted into their hall of fame) and graduated in 1916, proceeding to Fordham University, where he received his Bachelor of Arts in 1920. Upon graduation, he entered the Society of Jesus on September 28, 1920. In 1926, he was awarded a Master of Arts from Boston College. = Academic career = That year, he was appointed an assistant professor of chemistry at Georgetown University, where he remained until 1929. He then went to Woodstock College in Maryland, where in 1932, he was ordained by Archbishop Pietro Fumasoni Biondi, the Apostolic Delegate to the United States, as a subdeacon on June 19, a deacon on June 20, and a priest on June 21. He celebrated his first Solemn Mass on July 3 in St. Philip Neri's Church in The Bronx. In 1933, he was awarded a Licentiate of Sacred Theology from Woodstock. He then returned to Georgetown in 1933, where he was made director of the department of chemistry. Replacing George F. Strohaver, Gorman was named the acting dean of Georgetown College in 1935, until a permanent replacement was found in John E. Grattan. The following year, he became the vice president and dean of studies at Loyola College in Maryland, and held this position until 1942. During this time, he also completed his education at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, where he received his Doctor of Philosophy in 1938. Later in life, Gorman was eventually awarded an honorary Legum Doctor degree.  Georgetown University  alt=Lawrence C. Gorman in his later years Gorman succeeded Arthur A. O'Leary as president of Georgetown University on December 17, 1942, upon being appointed by Zacheus J. Maher, the American assistant to the Jesuit Superior General. The first half of his presidency was principally shaped by World War II; since so many male students had left to fight the war, Gorman decided to admit women to the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, with the first eleven enrolling in 1943. On December 18, 1944, Gorman broke ground on the new Georgetown University Hospital, which was located on Reservoir Road and held 400 beds. In order to build the hospital, on March 24, 1945, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed a law granting a special exception to the Height of Buildings Act of 1910, which limits the height of buildings in the District of Columbia. The Georgetown University Hospital became one of seven buildings to have been specifically exempt from the height restrictions in the history of the law. In addition to construction of the hospital, Gorman undertook a campaign that raised the bulk of the funds necessary for the construction of McDonough Gymnasium, which broke ground in 1950. The main Georgetown University Hospital building was constructed during his presidency. At the commencement ceremony of 1945, Gorman awarded President Harry S. Truman an honorary Doctor of Laws degree, and hailed him as the \\"chosen son of destiny\\" who was working to bring forth peace in the midst of World War II. Truman was unable to attend the ceremony, and sent Senator Dennis Ch√°vez in his stead; an honorary doctorate was also awarded to Ross T. McIntire, the Surgeon General of the Navy. He also presented Crown Prince Abdul Ilah, the regent of the Kingdom of Iraq, with an honorary Doctor of Laws degree. Gorman directed administrators in 1947 to include at least one black student in the following year's freshman class. The administrators did not follow this directive, but did begin to admit black students to the Graduate School, Medical School, and Law School. Eventually, in 1950, the first black undergraduate student was admitted to the School of Foreign Service. In 1948, along with the president of Howard University, Mordecai Wyatt Johnson, and Cloyd Heck Marvin, the president of George Washington University, Gorman signed an agreement allowing students and faculty from Howard University College of Medicine to practice at Gallinger Municipal Hospital on equal footing with Georgetown and George Washington. This agreement was then ratified by the District of Columbia Board of Commissioners. Following the end of World War II, the number of students at Georgetown doubled. Gorman's presidency came to an end on February 18, 1949, and he was succeeded as president by J. Hunter Guthrie.  Later years  Following the end of his presidency at Georgetown, Gorman became vice president and dean of studies at the University of Scranton in Pennsylvania, where he was also a member of the board of trustees and the board of regents. Gorman died suddenly of a heart attack on December 28, 1953, at the University of Scranton. His body was returned to Georgetown, where he was buried in the Jesuit Community Cemetery. In 1959, Georgetown opened the Lawrence C. Gorman Diagnostic and Research Building on the Medical Center campus, which was used by medical and dental students. The building contained an outpatient dental department that doubled the number of patients the Dental School could treat.

Situated in the Tonquin Valley, Oubliette Mountain is part of The Ramparts in the Canadian Rockies. Its nearest higher peak is Dungeon Peak, to the northwest. Not coincidentally, an oubliette is a secret dungeon with access only through a trapdoor in its ceiling. The descriptive name was coined by Cyril G. Wates. History The first ascent was made in July 1932 by William Hainsworth and Max Strumia, with guide Hans Fuhrer. The first ascent of the East Buttress was made July 27, 1962 by Fred Beckey, Brian Greenwood, and Don Gordon. This climbing route is included in Beckey's book titled \\"Fred Beckey's 100 Favorite North American Climbs\\". Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Oubliette Mountain is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below -20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below -30 ¬∞C. In terms of favorable weather, July and August present the best months for climbing. However, these months coincide with mosquito season, which requires effective defenses. Precipitation runoff from Oubliette Mountain drains into tributaries of the Athabasca River on its east side, and the headwaters of the Fraser River from the west side. Geology Oubliette Mountain is composed of quartzite laid down during the Cambrian period. This rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny.

Oliveira, 586 U.S. ___ (2019), was a United States Supreme Court case dealing with the classification of employees hired as contractors in relation to exceptions to arbitration set forth in the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). The Court ruled unanimously that the exceptions set forth in the FAA, principally for those involved in foreign and interstate commerce such as truck drivers, do apply to contractors as they would to regular employees.  Background  The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) of 1925 () allows employers in the United States to include binding arbitration language in their employment contracts that require employees to agree to use designated arbitration methods to resolve disputes with the company rather than seeking action in the court system. Section 1 of the FAA sets out exemptions for employees involved in foreign or interstate commerce activities, leading that \\"nothing herein contained [within the Statute] shall apply to contracts of employment of seamen, railroad employees, or any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce.\\"9 U. S. C. ¬ß1. In the present case, Dominic Oliveira sought employment with New Prime Inc., an American trucking company. When he was hired, he first had to drive 10,000 miles as an unpaid \\"trainee\\", followed by 30,000 miles as an \\"apprentice\\" working at an hour. Oliveira was then brought into the company proper, he was given the option to be hired as an employee, or as an independent contractor, which the company asserted would be more economical for Oliveira. Oliveira opted to be hired as a contractor. However, because he was an independent contractor, this allowed New Prime to charge Oliveira and other drivers through leasing of the New Prime vehicles and to pay for their own fuel and equipment through deductions from their paychecks, items that the company would normally pay for if the person was an employee. Oliveira frequently found these costs exceeded his base rate, effectively paying New Prime for his employment. While the terms of his independent contract allow him to drive for other companies, Oliveira found that his schedule was heavily dictated by New Prime. Oliveira eventually dropped the independent contractor and was rehired as an employee of New Prime, where his work duties and commitment were essentially identical to what he had done as an independent contractor, but taking home much more from his paycheck. In 2015, Oliveira started a class-action lawsuit against New Prime, representing all other contracted drivers they had hired, arguing the company was not paying fair wages to its independent contractors. New Prime attempted to stop the lawsuit by referring to their company's arbitration agreement; while the FAA as written allows for exceptions for employees involved in commerce, New Prime argued that Oliveira was a contractor, and thus not covered by the \\"contracts of employment\\" exception, and thus his complaints must be heard by arbitration. This led to the case first hearing in District Court, where the court could not answer the question of whether Oliveira's time as an independent contractor fell within the Section 1 exception of the FAA, and thus ordered a discovery phase to evaluate the nature of his employment. The District Court thus refused to issue a summary judgment in the lawsuit as requested by New Prime. New Prime appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, believing that the question of Section 1 of the FAA applicability should be decided by the arbitrator and not the court system. The First Circuit held in favor of Oliveira in two parts, first by asserting that it was the court's responsibility to determine if Section 1's exceptions applied in this case, and second that Oliveira, even as an independent contractor, fell within these exceptions, which would allow the class-action suit to proceed.  Supreme Court  New Prime petitioned for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court in September 2017 to challenge both facets of the First Circuit's decision. The Court accepted the case for its 2018 term, and oral hearing was held on October 3, 2018; this date was prior to Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the court, so he took no part in any of the case's proceedings. It was the first of three cases the Court agreed to hear during the term related to arbitration. Some observers to the Court feared that the case would weigh in favor of New Prime, as the Court's recent decisions related to arbitration had favored employers, and with Kavanaugh, a conservative, set to join, further cases related to arbitration would continue to weigh in favor of employers. The Court issued its decision on January 15, 2019. In a unanimous decision, the Court upheld the findings of the First Circuit, affirming that judgment of whether Section 1 exceptions applied or not was a role for the courts and not arbitration, and that within Oliveira's case, the written intent of the FAA covered any type of employer-employee agreement, including the independent contractor construct, and thus Oliveira was not bound by the FAA to seek arbitration. Justice Neil Gorsuch, writing the majority opinion, explained that the way that the FAA was written used the term \\"contracts of employment\\"; reviewing dictionaries and other works published around 1925, it was clear that Congress' intent was not specifically tailored to the specific term \\"employees\\" but instead to a broader classification of \\"workers\\", which would readily cover independent contractors. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote a concurring opinion, mirroring Gorsuch and noting the importance of language evolution in law. The decision briefly hit the stocks of several transportation companies, as the use of the independent contracting mechanic for employment has been a common practice in the industry; the Court's ruling would mean these companies would need to be able to prepare to treat these contractors as employees, which will impact their operating costs. This would then have a ripple effect on the US economy since the price of shipping goods would likely increase to cover these costs.

Volunteers from the Provisional IRA's (IRA) Belfast Brigade shot dead three off-duty soldiers from the British Army who had been lured to a house by two females on the Antrim Road in Belfast, Northern Ireland. A fourth soldier survived the shooting.http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch73.htm#23373http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi- bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&day;=23&month;=03&year;=1973 Background This was not the first time the IRA used such a so-called \\"honey trap\\" tactic to kill British soldiers. In March 1971 three young Scottish soldiers were shot dead at the side of a road after they had been lured out of a Belfast bar by a female Republican who said she would take them to a party. The three soldiers, members of the Royal Highland Fusiliers, were brought in a van to the White Brae, Squire's Hill, off the Ligoniel Road in North Belfast; when they went to urinate at the side of the road they were shot in the back of the head by IRA volunteers.http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch71.htm#10371 This was only the fourth incident during The Troubles in which British soldiers were killed; the first was the shooting of Robert Curtis just a month earlier on 6 February.Peter Taylor, Behind The Mask: The IRA & Sinn Fein p.110 http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch71.htm#6271 However this was the first time off-duty soldiers were killed in Northern Ireland since the conflict began, as the other three incidents happened during gun battles and rioting. The killings of the three Scottish soldiers brought more cries from the Unionist community to introduce internment without trial, which was eventually introduced in August 1971 as Operation Demetrius. However instead of decreasing violence, internment had the opposite effect‚Äîviolence increased tenfold and support for the IRA grew stronger as the army and government reacted more harshly.Peter Taylor, Behind The Mask: The IRA & Sinn Fein pp.113‚Äì115 Killings About a week before the killings two females met and befriended four British Army sergeants in a Belfast pub. The two women told the soldiers, who were stationed at British Army Headquarters at Thiepval Barracks in Lisburn, that they were having a party on 23 March and the six arranged to meet up. On 23 March the four off-duty sergeants, unarmed and in civilian clothes, met the two women at the Woodlands Hotel in Lisburn and later on that night the six drove 12 miles from Lisburn to a flat on the Antrim Road near the New Lodge area in Belfast, where the supposed party was taking place. The flat had food and drink laid out inside to allay any suspicions the soldiers may have had. Shortly after they arrived one girl said she was going out to bring more women back with her. The one soldier who survived the shooting said that about half an hour after they had arrived two masked gunmen burst into the flat; one had a Thompson submachine gun and the other was carrying a pistol. The soldiers were taken into a bedroom and ordered to lie face down on a bed as the gunmen fired shots into their heads one at a time. Two of the sergeants died instantly, one died a few hours later in hospital and one survived, despite serious injuries to his spine as well as having part of his tongue and jaw shot off. Aftermath Later that night Loyalists shot dead a 28-year-old man outside his house in Durham Street, Belfast, from a passing car.http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/sutton/chron/1973.html See also * Corporals killings * 1988 Lisburn van bombing References Category:Deaths by firearm in Northern Ireland Category:The Troubles in Belfast Category:Provisional Irish Republican Army actions Category:1973 in Northern Ireland Category:Conflicts in 1973 Category:British Army in Operation Banner Category:Military actions and engagements during the Troubles (Northern Ireland) Category:20th century in Belfast ","title":"Provisional IRA Honey Trap killings"},{"id":"59680809","text":"The Ostrobothnian Chamber Orchestra (Finnish: Keski-Pohjanmaan Kamariorkesteri) is an ensemble based in Kokkola, Western Finland.

The company operated factories in Ibadan, Zaria and Port Harcourt. The company's key products were Benson and Hedges, State Express, Three Rings, Gold Leaf and Sweet menthol. The firm was founded in 1951 as a partnership between British American Tobacco (BAT) and the Nigerian government to acquire the assets of British American Tobacco in Nigeria. BAT had been trading in Nigeria since 1911 until the operations became the Nigerian Tobacco Company (NTC). In 1966, the firm employed 2,700 Nigerians and dominated the cigarette market with a market 90% share.  History  = Business operations = Distribution and sale of cigarettes in Nigeria began in the 1890s and in 1911, cigarette consumption was dominated by products manufactured by British American Tobacco company. To liaise with distributors and monitor product sales and promotion by trading firms who were the importers and distributors of the products, BAT sent a trade representative to Nigeria. A few years later, it established its own depots and began importing products into the country for onward delivery to expatriate firms for local distribution. In the early 1930s, BAT began its own investigations into developing a local industry that will be supplied by quality tobacco leaves, this occurred after an earlier collaboration with the department of Agriculture on experimental cultivation of some varieties. In 1933, the firm established a pilot factory in Osogbo using imported tobacco leaves as raw material. To develop a local supply source, the firm distributed seedlings to farmers in nearby settlements within Oyo province. Many farmers embraced tobacco farming and chose tobacco as their main crop instead of crop rotation. To ensure supply of its raw materials, NTC invested in the training of tobacco farmers and invested in research and development of new methods to cultivate tobacco. When demand grew, production from the pilot factory was insufficient to meet demand and British American Tobacco established a larger factory in Ibadan in 1937, production at the factory was expanded after World War II. In 1956, the firm opened a new factory in the Eastern region of the country at Port Harcourt and three years later it opened another one in Zaria, Northern Region. Production of cigarettes by NTC was estimated to be 700 million per month in 1970. Beginning in 1962, the firm shifted its distribution strategy from dealing with multinationals and moved towards building relationships with independent Nigerian retailers. = Tobacco cultivation = NTC was involved in the cultivation of tobacco particularly in the grasslands of Northern Oyo Province working directly with farmers organized into agricultural cooperatives with the support of NTC. Experiments with various varieties of Virginia tobacco begun much earlier than 1933 but British American Tobacco pilot's project at an old cotton ginnery in Osogbo set the stage for the growth of commercial tobacco farming. In the early 1930s, BAT distributed free seeds of the Virginia variety and in 1934 about 83 acres of land were cultivated gradually rising to an average of 935 acres between 1944 and 1946 and 11,200 between 1960 and 1962. The firm facilitated the use of fertilizers and mechanized inputs through credit extension to tobacco farmers. NTC's relationship with farmers grew into the 1950s and it began to advancing loans to farmers to enable them grow flue-cure tobacco and build curing barns at the onset of cultivation. Contracts were signed with farmers that ensured NTC bought produce from the farmers. = Ownership = NTC was formed in 1951 to acquire the trading assets of British American Tobacco company's operation in Nigeria. In 1960, ownership was opened Nigerians when shares of the firm were among the foundation firms listed on the Lagos Stock Exchange. After a period of decline, NTC and BAT merged in 2000.

He died in South Hanson, Massachusetts in 1935 and is buried in his birthplace of Newbury, Vermont.  Early Life  Chamberlin was born in Newbury, Vermont, the youngest child of Abner and Mary (Haseltine) Chamberlin. The Chamberlins were descendants of one of Newbury's founding families.Wells, Frederic P. History of Newbury, Vermont, 1704-1902. St. Johnsbury, VT: The Caledonian Company, 1902, 18. Joseph Edgar's early years were spent in Spring Prairie, Wisconsin, where his father, a farmer, moved in 1857. The Chamberlins were staunch and vocal abolitionists, frequently housing itinerant abolitionist speakers and politicians at their home. Chamberlin, Joseph Edgar (1937). Nomads and Listeners. Cambridge: Riverside. pp. 12‚Äì13. Young \\"Ed\\" was educated in a one-room schoolhouse, and though he wanted to attend college, the family could not afford it, so he was forced to find a trade. He followed his older brother, Everett Chamberlin, already established in the newspaper business, to Chicago in 1868.Chamberlin, Joseph Edgar (1937). Nomads and Listeners. Cambridge: Riverside. pp. xi - 24. While there, he provided himself with what he called a \\"classical\\" education by reading extensively at the nearby Chicago Public Library.  Career  Chamberlin began his newspaper career as a seventeen-year-old proofreader for the Chicago Evening Post, where his brother Everett was employed. In October, 1871 he was one of the first eyewitnesses on the scene of the Great Chicago Fire and his reports were some of the first to go out to the world.Murphy, Jim (2006). The Great Fire.

Together they had five children and one adopted son. Several of their children died in infancy or childhood.Chamberlin Family Papers. In 1888, through his Transcript writing and advocacy for the Perkins School for the Blind, Chamberlin began a friendship with Helen Keller and her teacher Anne Sullivan. Keller and Sullivan began visiting Chamberlin and his family at their home called Red Farm in Wrentham, Massachusetts when Helen was nine years old.Keller, Helen (1921). The Story of My Life. Doubleday, Page & Company. p. 55. She often spent weekends and holidays with the Chamberlins and lived with them for a year in 1896-97.

This includes such phenomena as not noticing plants in the surrounding environment, not recognizing the importance of plant life to the whole biosphere and to human affairs, a philosophical view of plants as an inferior form of life to animals and/or the inability to appreciate the unique features or aesthetics of plants. Scientists have suggested that the reason some people don't notice plants is because a majority of them are stationary and similarly coloured, although other research has suggested that plant blindness is affected by cultural practices. A US study looked at how plants and animals are perceived using \\"attentional blink\\" (the ability to notice one of two rapidly presented images). This showed that participants more accurately detected images of animals than plants and suggested possible strategies for characterizing and overcoming zoocentrism.

It was released commercially in the United States and Canada on March 6, 2020. Criticism The film faced some criticism for excising the role of investigative journalists Robyn Doolittle and Kevin Donovan in exposing the scandal, instead replacing them with a fictional novice male journalist.Amanda Arnold, \\"Female Reporter Slams Movie For ‚ÄòRewriting‚Äô History By Casting Male Actor\\". The Cut, April 10, 2018. Donovan was critical of the film's portrayal of the media, particularly scenes depicting a reporter paying for the Rob Ford video. Allison Smith stated that Doolittle's replacement with a male journalist was problematic, and the film \\"would have been more interesting if it had followed Doolittle\\". She stated that Doolittle may have been replaced because her book Crazy Town: The Rob Ford Story had been optioned for a film or television production. Joe Mihevc, formerly a councillor on Toronto City Council, stated that the film misrepresents Ford's character, portraying him as a mean-spirited individual and omitting the \\"humanness of Rob\\" and the traits that attracted those who voted for him. The film was also praised by Donovan for its correct portrayal of the backroom politics, and by Smith for the depiction of reporters reconstructing a timeline of Rob Ford's activities based on postings to his social media accounts. Awards The film received three Canadian Screen Award nominations at the 8th Canadian Screen Awards, for Best Art Direction/Production Design (Chris Crane), Best Sound Editing (Nelson Ferreira, Dashen Naidoo, J.R. Fountain and Dustin Harris) and Best Makeup (Emily O'Quinn, Steve Newburn and Neil Morrill).\\"√âcrans canadiens : Song of Names, The Twentieth Century et Antigone en t√™te des nominations\\".

Vancouver Sun, September 15, 1987. Born in Toronto, Canada, Gibson was touring Canada and Europe with various bands shortly after leaving school. Although he wrote songs, none were considered good enough to perform by the bands he fronted, nor were club goers interested in hearing unknown music. After a year of playing covers 6 nights a week, Gibson realized the key to earning a living was in writing and performing original music. While on the road, Gibson continued to hone his songwriting skills but found that while music and melody came easy, words did not, Gibson began writing with Robert Uhrig. In the mid 1980s, after recording a six-track demo of original songs written with Uhrig, Gibson was offered a recording deal with Loose End Records in London, England after impressing producer Pete Waterman. Loose End subsequently dissolved during contract negotiations due to the break up of the labels two principal partners, Waterman and Peter Collins. Returning to Canada, Gibson met guitarist/producer Domenic Troiano.\\"Troiano a hot shot with TV themes\\". Toronto Star, April 18, 1987. Upon signing with Troiano's Black Market label, \\"Lock Up My Heart\\" was recorded and released in the summer of 1986, accompanied with a video, directed by Stephen Reynolds. The track did well enough to garner Gibson the Juno Award nomination in March of 1987 .\\"New 45s worthy of note\\". Nanaimo Daily News, July 18, 1986. Black Market/A&M; Records then issued Gibson's self-titled album in 1988. The album's singles received modest radio airplay, as did the videos on MuchMusic and Video Hits for tracks such as \\"Easy Street\\", \\"Lying to Me\\" and \\"We Close Our Eyes\\". The album was supported by a cross-Canada tour.\\"Audience in millions mall singer's choice\\". Edmonton Journal, July 6, 1989. \\"Rhythm Method\\" was Gibson's follow up release in early 1990, again with Black Market, however the distribution deal with A&M; was no longer in place, and the albums impact was minimal at best. Over the next few years, Gibson's music was featured heavily on several TV shows in the US, Canada, the UK and France. In 1996, \\"I Don't Know\\", a Gibson/Uhrig (credited erroneously as R.Varig) penned song that was recorded by Escapade from Chicago. Several DJ's were tasked with issuing various mixes of the track and it was a breakout hit throughout the world, particularly in dance clubs, during the summer of 1997. The track was well reviewed and charted in Billboard Magazine. The track appeared on several dance mix compilations. Gibson has been inactive within the music industry for the past several years.

Giregire was born at Gimisaveh village in the Asaro Valley. He began his education at the Asaroka Lutheran School before moving to Finschhafen in Morobe Province in 1946 to train as a teacher at Heldsbach Lutheran School. He returned to the Asaro Valley in the mid-1950s, worked as a mechanic and an agricultural assistant and set up a sawmill. He then purchased land and began planting coffee, eventually coming to hold three coffee plantations and a coffee factory and owning what was believed to be the largest coffee plantation then owned by a Papua New Guinean at a time when farming was dominated by white expatriates. He was the first secretary of the local Farmers' Association in 1956. He was then elected to the first Asaro Watabung Local Level Government Council with the introduction of local government and became its first president, although sources differ on the year that occurred. He was elected to the colonial House of Assembly of Papua and New Guinea at the 1964 election, the first election to be held in Papua New Guinea. He was assistant administrator for services in the first parliament, and in 1966, he initiated a bill which successfully banned playing cards in Papua New Guinea, the first successful legislation by a black member. In 1967, he co-founded the conservative Compass Party, the forerunner of the United Party. He was re-elected in 1968, becoming ministerial member for agriculture, stock and fisheries, later being shifted to post and telegraphs until 1972. He was re-elected for the final time in 1972. In the leadup to independence, Giregire was the only member on all three constitutional development and planning committees between 1964 and 1975. He supported the Australian colonial role in Papua New Guinea and was a strong opponent of independence. He formed the PNG Country Party in 1974, but was defeated by Gai Duwabane at the first post-independence election in 1977. He had nominated to become the first Governor-General of Papua New Guinea in 1975, but had been defeated 53-38 by John Guise. After his political defeat, he became president of the Highlands Farmers and Settlers Association in 1984, having become the first Papua New Guinean member of the formerly all-white organisation in 1958. His early coffee processing business ran into difficulties, but he continued to own a coffee plantation and factory and held various other business interests up until his death. He revived the Country Party after a long period of inactivity in 2001 and contested the 2002 election, but was narrowly defeated in his bid to re-enter parliament. He was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 2000. He was knighted in 2006. He died in January 2012 and was buried at his first plantation the following month.

Hippospongia communis is a brown or darker color and very porous, due to its many oscules, and is commonly found in shallow waters of the Mediterranean. Throughout history, H. communis has been used for a variety of different things; such as cleaning, medicine, and cooking. Along with being used for domestic purposes, the bath sponge has been used in many scientific studies.  Environment  The most common areas that Hippospongia communis inhabit are marine waters, mostly in the western Mediterranean or the south Aegean Sea. Specifically in the Mediterranean, the Hippospongia communis is the most common sponge. The sponge settles on rocky or muddy bottoms and it is common to find them in ocean caves. Hippospongia communis like being in shallow water, around 15 m deep. The few individual H. communis that are found at the deeper depths are typically older. = History = Hippospongia communis has many oscules that are scattered and grouped along the top of the sponge. It‚Äôs porous structure and spongey exterior made it perfect for people throughout history, as far back as 1900 BC, to use it as a household item. In particular, the honeycomb bath sponge was used for things like cleaning, hygiene, cooking and agriculture in Rome. In Greek civilization, having the Hippospongia communis was an important status symbol. They included in their pottery and in their literature. The Egyptians also used the Hippospongia communis many ways. They used the sponge to create texture on walls when painting. Other ways that Hippospongia communis was put to use were in medicine. H. communis was used for contraception, surgery and waking people from anesthesia. H. communis was also used in cosmetics. Due to its popularity, the sponge community was threatened due to fisheries harvesting these sponges. Fishermen were overfishing these sponges were causing harmful diseases to their populations. They were fished to the point of extinction, and the waters of the Mediterranean are still feeling the repercussions. = Characteristics = Hippospongia communis is usually a large, rounded sponge that has a yellowish brown color. The size of the bath sponge varies but the larger they are, the more expensive they can be. H.communis has a skeleton that is made out of elements such as O, I, Al, Cl, and Si. It has many oscules, making the sponge very porous. It is likely that the H. communis sponges have other organisms living within these oscules. Many organism such as crustaceans and worms are typical organisms found within the sponge. These sponges are a great habitats to sustain other kinds of life. Hippospongia communis has a bioactive compound that makes it anti-fungal. This is due to untensopongin B, making the sponge perfect for its uses in old medicine.  Reproduction  Hippospongia communis sexually reproduces year round. The sponge is also hermaphroditic, meaning it has both male and female reproductive organs at the same time. It has been found that during its sexual reproduction, regardless of the location, the Hippospongia communis eggs will fertilize at the same time. The bath sponge reproduction times are all synced throughout different locations that the H. communis inhabit. The larva has a planktonic, free-living stage then the sponge larvae eventually adjusts on the sea floor, usually on rough surfaces. Many times, the larvae does not survive these first few stages.  Research  Because of the abundance and absorbency of these sponges, Hippospongia communis has been used on a variety of different studies. One study looked how the sponge was able to immobilize laccase due to ocean pollution. It is very important that the spongin in the Hippospongia communis could do this and not degrade, like other materials had.

As a part of the zooplankton, it is incapable of sustained horizontal movement and relies on its tentacles to encounter and capture smaller organisms for food (feeds mainly on copepedites, selecting against naupilar stages).Purcell, J.E., Nemazie, D.A. ‚ÄúQuantitative Feeding Ecology of the Hydromedusan Nemopsis-Bachei in Chesapeake Bay‚Äù.

Zooplankton of the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts: a Guide to Their Identification and Ecology. The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2012. Its most notable characteristic are the 4 ribbon-shaped gonads which extend down the bell along the radial canals at times all the way down to the base. They also have two short, distinct, club- like tentacles extending from each of their 4 marginal bulbs. These marginal bulbs also contain ocelli or light sensing organs. On each of the marginal bulbs they have 14-18 longer thin tentacles that extend downward.  Feeding  Cnidaria are often studied to investigate their grazing rates in terms to smaller zooplankton because cnidarian‚Äôs are subject to large blooms. While they do consume a substantial amount of zooplankton when at peak abundance, due to the regeneration rate of copepidite stocks, N. bachei were not found to have a lasting effect on the overall population. They do display some amount of predatory behavior, in studies they have been shown to seek out new areas of prey when the rate at which they encounter prey starts to get decrease.Frost, J.R., Jacoby, C.A., Youngbluth, M.J. ‚ÄúBehavior of Nemopsis bachei L.

Games =Shadow Fight= Shadow Fight was a Facebook- based fighting game developed by Nekki. It was released on February 12, 2011. They could play against other players in online battles. Shadow Fight was available on Facebook in English, Russian, German, French, Italian, Portuguese and Turkish. The game continued to be available to play until months leading up to the global release of Shadow Fight 3. On August 16, 2017, the developers announced on Twitter that the servers for the original Shadow Fight will be shut down on September 29, 2017, and that in-game transactions would no longer be accepted and players who open the game will receive 900,000 rubies as a farewell gift. Due to popular demand, however, Nekki delayed the shutdown by one month to October 27, 2017, and the game was no longer playable after then. =Shadow Fight 2= Shadow Fight 2 is the second installment of the Shadow Fight trilogy. Released worldwide in 2014 for mobile devices and ported to computers and eighth-generation consoles years later, the sequel is more story-driven and its plot concerns a great warrior seeking to reverse a curse that turned him into a shadow after he accidentally opened the Gate of Shadows, unleashing powerful demons into his world whom he now must defeat after gathering strength, skills and equipment. =Shadow Fight 3= Shadow Fight 3 is an action-RPG fighting game developed by Nekki.

It is extinct over much of its former range, including the North Island.  Discovery  C. juncea was first identified botanically by the British explorer and botanist Sir Joseph Hooker. In 1839 he joined the Antarctic expedition led by Sir James Ross as assistant surgeon and naturalist on board the Erebus. During the southern winter of 1841 he spent three months based in the Bay of Islands collecting plants. Once he had returned to England he corresponded with many New Zealand plant collectors, encouraging them, sending news and advice and in return receiving specimens to add to his collection. His first book on New Zealand plants Flora Novae-Zelandiae was published in 1853. Originally several species similar to Carmichaelia juncea were described. One of these species was found growing on lake shores along the east coast of the South Island. By 1993 (along with most other members of this group) it had not been seen or collected in over 50 years and was presumed extinct. Amazingly that year it was \\"re-discovered\\" growing in a rock garden at the Edinburgh Botanical Gardens. In 1995 this small group of Carmichaelia species were all combined together as one species, C. juncea. The epithet juncea means 'rush-like' in Greek.  Description  C. juncea is a low growing prostrate shrub that forms a sprawling mat (20 cm high and up to 1.5m wide), looking very like a clump of dying rushes. The switch-like branchlets are light green to light brown, with very few leaves. The flowers are small and white with purple highlights. The seed pods are short and black, the seeds probably wind distributed. C. juncea flowers between October and January and fruits between November and March.  Habitat and ecology  New Zealand has 23 Carmichaelia species and 14 are listed as threatened or at risk. C. juncea is generally found in rocky areas where there is little competition from other plants; along open river flats, on sandy or stony lake shores and also on exposed rocky outcrops along the coast. Surviving in these tough conditions makes it an excellent plant for rock gardens or for growing in containers. C. juncea was once widespread over both the North and South Island but was probably never very common because of its specific habitat requirements. It is now considered extinct in the North Island while in the South Island it is only found in two areas; Puponga in North-West Nelson and in a few locations in South Westland from Franz Josef to Haast. Like many New Zealand natives the survival of C. juncea is threatened by introduced mammals. At Franz Josef heavy browsing by hares has almost completely prevented seed production in mature plants. It is also under threat from habitat loss; in particular the modification of braided rivers and because of its prostrate habit, introduced weeds. C. juncea is most closely related to C. compacta and C. curta although it is easily distinguishable by its prostrate habit.

Biography Rooted in modern post- bop, Jim Gailloreto has been active on the Chicago jazz and creative music scene since the 1980s. A prolific composer and arranger he has six recordings as a leader to his credit with three instrumentally diverse groups, and has recorded as a sideman with several notable artists and record labels. Chicagojazz.com describes Gailloreto's compositions as \\"genre bending\\". On his Jazzformation and The Insider recordings, Gailloreto's tenor saxophone is heard with a more conventional small jazz ensemble of guitar, piano, bass, and drums while his Jazz String Quintet recordings feature his soprano sax improvisations backed by a string quintet. Each of these string quintet recordings features standout compositions by Gailloreto along with guest singers Kurt Elling, Patricia Barber, and Cheryl Wilson. Gailloreto's tenor sax also leads the Metropolitan Jazz Octet having taken the reigns from Tom Hilliard, his former professor at DePaul University, 57 years after the group was founded. Hilliard left Gailloreto the group's music library when his health began to fail. The music sat in Gailloreto's basement for years before he resurrected the MJO in 2014. The octet format of the MJO features a small big band, a standard jazz rhythm section of piano, bass, and drums with alto, tenor, and baritone saxophones, trumpet, and trombone. Gailloreto along with saxophonist John Kornegay added charts to the library, which was largely written by Hilliard from the 1950s through the 1980s, and recorded the first new MJO recording The Road to Your Place in 2018. Chameleon-like as a player, Gailloreto is equally at home performing jazz, blues, fusion, funk, classical, and Latin. He's performed and recorded for singers Patricia Barber and Kurt Elling on Blue Note Records, performed the Chicago premier of Marc Anthony Turnage's Scorched with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and John Scofield, recorded with New York Latinjazz vibraphonist Mike Freeman, guitarist John McLean, pianists Jeremy Kahn and Fred Simon, and vocalist Grazyna Auguscik. Gailloreto has performed five times at the Chicago Jazz Festival with various ensembles. Gailloreto graduated DePaul University in 1981 with a bachelor's degree in music composition having studied with George Flynn, and received a master's degree in music composition from Northwestern University in 1983 having studied with Alan Stout. He's a recipient of the New Works: Creation & Presentation Program Grant from Chamber Music America and was recognized in Jazziz Magazine's Woodwinds on Fire jazz select disc. Gailloreto is an associate professor of music at Roosevelt University's Chicago College of Performing Arts.

It has between four and six leaves in a fan-like arrangement on each shoot and a large number of whitish to yellowish flowers arranged in whorls of between six and eight around the flowering stem. It is endemic to Queensland. Description Oberonia flavescens is an epiphytic or lithophytic herb that forms large clumps. Each shoot has between four and six fleshy, sword-shaped, green to reddish leaves long and wide with their bases overlapping. A large number of whitish or yellowish, non-resupinate flowers about long and wide are arranged in whorls of between six and eight on an arching flowering stem long. The sepals and petals are egg-shaped, about long and turned back towards the ovary. The labellum is about long with three fringed lobes. Flowering occurs between February and July. Taxonomy and naming Oberonia flavescens was first formally described in 2006 by David Jones and Mark Clements who published the description in Australian Orchid Research. The type specimen was grown in the Australian National Botanic Gardens from a plant collected in the McIlwraith Range. The specific epithet (flavescens) is derived from the Latin word flavus meaning \\"golden-yellow\\" or \\"yellow\\" with the suffix -escens meaning \\"beginning of\\" or \\"becoming\\". Distribution and habitat The northern green fairy orchid usually grows on trees and rocks in rainforest, sometimes in other humid, sheltered places such as mangroves. It is found between the Iron and Clarke Ranges in Queensland.

It began forming in August 1941 in the Urals Military District. It was moved to the front northwest of Moscow while still trying to complete its training and went straight into action in mid-December during the winter counteroffensive. Until May 1943, it was involved in the bloody fighting around the Rzhev salient. After a period in reserve for rebuilding, the division's combat path shifted southward when it was assigned to 52nd Army, where it remained for the duration of the war. It won a battle honor in eastern Ukraine, then fought across the Dniepr River late that year, and was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for its successes. Following this it advanced through western Ukraine in the spring of 1944, then into Romania in the summer, where it played a major role in the second encirclement and destruction of the German 6th Army. After again moving to the reserves the division shifted northwards with its Army to join 1st Ukrainian Front, fighting through Poland, eastern Germany and into Czechoslovakia. By then the 373rd had compiled an enviable record, and went on to serve briefly into the postwar era. Formation The division began forming in August, 1941 in the Urals Military DistrictWalter S.

Glantz, Colossus Reborn, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2005, p. 206 Its order of battle was as follows: * 1235th Rifle Regiment * 1237th Rifle Regiment * 1239th Rifle Regiment * 931st Artillery Regiment * 243rd Antitank Battalion (added in early 1942)Charles C.

Col. Vasilii Ivanovich Khmylyov was not assigned to command of the division until September 19, and he would remain in command until August 11, 1942. In November the division was assigned to the 39th Army, which was forming in the Arkhangelsk Military District,Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 94 and began moving by rail to join this command while it was still short of training and equipment.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 99 The Army consolidated in the Torzhok area, and in late December it was assigned to Kalinin Front. Beginning on January 8, 1942, 39th Army took part in the Sychevka-Vyasma Offensive Operation, which was planned \\"to encircle, and then capture or destroy the enemy's entire Mozhaisk - Gzhatsk - Vyasma grouping\\",Svetlana Gerasimova, The Rzhev Slaughterhouse, ed. & trans. S. Britton, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2013, pp. 26-27 that is, what later became known as the Rzhev salient. Battles for Rzhev During the January advance, 39th Army bypassed north of Rzhev itself in an effort to get behind the city and encircle the forces of German 9th Army holding there. It advanced into a gap between Bely and Olenino and by the third week of the month was fighting for Sychevka from the west, even taking the town's railway station. 29th Army and the 11th Cavalry Corps also entered the gap, but despite bitter fighting and reinforcements from 39th Army, the 29th was unable to liberate Rzhev. On January 23, a German counterattack from Olenino and Rzhev constricted the gap, worsening an already critical supply situation for the two Armies. A further attack on February 5 cut the 29th off from the 39th. Despite urgent efforts, including paratroop operations, the German cordon could not be pierced, and the survivors of 29th Army trickled through to the lines of the 39th and 30th Armies during the rest of the month.Gerasimova, Rzhev Slaughterhouse, pp. 28-30, 37, 39-40 As of February 28 the 373rd was recorded as having a total of 2,274 personnel, 21 percent of its authorized strength.Glantz, Colossus Reborn, p. 206 During the following months 39th Army held its positions, always under severe supply constraints, especially during the spring rasputitsa. In May and June, Army Group Center began planning a limited offensive to eliminate the smaller Soviet salients to its rear. Operation Seydlitz began on July 2, and faced heavy resistance, but by July 5 the Army's commander, Lt. Gen. I. I. Maslennikov, had decided to withdraw from the salient. On July 9, the escape corridor was more-or-less sealed, and the remaining troops of 39th Army began emerging much as had the men of the 29th Army months earlier. During July, 39th Army recorded 23,647 total personnel losses, including 22,749 missing-in-action. The remnants of the 373rd were withdrawn for reforming.Gerasimova, Rzhev Slaughterhouse, pp. 56-57, 59-60, 62-64, 69 As of August 1, 39th Army consisted of only \\"Cavalry Detachment Stepanov\\" and the cadre of the 373rd, and by September 1 the division was in the reserves of Kalinin Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942, pp. 143, 167 Due to this rebuilding, the 373rd was unavailable for the First Rzhev‚ÄìSychyovka Offensive Operation. On August 12, Lt. Colonel Khmylyov was replaced in command by Lt. Col. Matveii Sergeevich Yeroshkin, but on September 11 he was in turn replaced by Col. Kuzma Ivanovich Sazonov, who would be promoted to the rank of major general on September 13, 1944, and would remain in command for the duration of the war. The division returned to active operations, back in 39th Army, in time for the Second Rzhev‚ÄìSychyovka Offensive Operation, also known as Operation Mars. =Operation Mars= By late November, 39th Army held positions at the northern apex of the salient, and the 373rd had the 1235th and 1237th Rifle Regiments north of the village of Kazakovo, while the 1239th faced the east side of the German bridgehead at the town of Molodoi Tud. The Army, now under command of Maj. Gen. A. I. Zygin, was on a secondary sector, with the mission to \\"attack and seize the high road running from Molodoi Tud to Rzhev... and then, in cooperation with 22nd Army... seize the key city of Olenino.\\" The terrain in the sector was difficult, and the German forces had heavily fortified the south bank of the Molodoi Tud River, but in mitigation they had only one division, the 206th, in the line, although 14th Motorized Division was known to be in reserve. Zygin saw his immediate objective as the town of Urdom, which would encircle the 206th. He planned to attack across the river with the 158th, 135th and 373rd Rifle Divisions after a one-hour artillery preparation, supported by the 81st and 28th Tank Brigades. The 348th Rifle Division was in reserve.Glantz, Zhukov's Greatest Defeat, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 1999, pp. 67-69 The attack began at 1000 hours on November 25, but it quickly became apparent that the artillery had failed to destroy or suppress many of the German strongpoints, and the 373rd, along with the 158th and 135th,Glantz, After Stalingrad, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2009, p. 477 were forced to retreat to the north bank. Zygin ordered them to regroup to renew the attack the next day. Meanwhile, the forces on 39th Army's flanks gained some successes and seemed to be making the German position untenable until the arrival of elements of the Panzer-Grenadier-Division Gro√üdeutschland at 1800 hours partly restored the situation. Early on the morning of November 26 Zygin ordered Colonel Sazonov to narrow his attack sector and be prepared to commit his second echelon regiment as soon as the lead regiment was across the Molodoi Tud. A slightly stronger artillery preparation was laid on, with much improved observation as the weather cleared, which also allowed air support. During the day the 1237th Rifle Regiment established itself on the south bank, being joined by the 1235th Regiment on the next day and driving the German forces from the village of Malye Bredniki. On the same day the 1239th Regiment assisted in the liberation of the town of Molodai Tud.Glantz, Zhukov's Greatest Defeat, pp. 153-57, 159 On November 28, 39th Army continued to assail the second-line positions of the 206th Infantry. Following yet another artillery preparation the 373rd took Briukhanovo, but this did not breach the German line. By nightfall on the 29th, although small groups of Soviet tanks and infantry had approached the key position at Urdom, they had all been repulsed with heavy losses, in large part due to further intervention by Gro√üdeutschland. In an overnight conference, Colonel Sazonov, Colonel Malygin of the 81st Tank Brigade, and Colonel Kovalenko of the 135th Rifle Division, planned a concerted attack on Urdom, to begin the next morning. By this time the two divisions had lost about half of their men. Given these losses, General Zygin got approval to release the 348th Rifle Division from reserve into the attack. Under the new plan, while the 135th and 348th struck the German defenses on either side of the town, one regiment of the 373rd, with Malygin's remaining tanks, would attempt to envelop it. The battle on November 30 lasted all day, but was successful. A handful of remaining KV-1 tanks reached the town's outskirts and systematically reduced the German pillboxes. By nightfall Urdom had been liberated, but the defenders still held out along the road east and west of the ruined town and their overall defense line was still intact. Moreover, 39th Army had taken such severe losses that it would have to pause for regrouping and reinforcements.Glantz, Zhukov's Greatest Defeat, pp. 160-62, 218 39th Army was ordered to return to the offensive on December 8 as the offensive was collapsing on other sectors. However, the 373rd had been redeployed westward, to positions directly south of Molodoi Tud, and played little role in this renewed fighting.Glantz, Zhukov's Greatest Defeat, pp. 226, 268 In a STAVKA directive (No. 11029) of January 4, 1943, the chief of staff of Kalinin Front was notified of several shortcomings in the organization of its defenses, including the use of ski troops: Into Ukraine In February, the division was moved to 4th Shock Army, and then in March to 43rd Army, both still in Kalinin Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, pp. 60, 83 In May the 373rd was removed to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command for a substantial rebuilding, after which it was shipped south to join the 52nd Army in Steppe Front. The division would remain in this Army for the duration of the war. From Steppe Front the 52nd would be moved to Voronezh Front, and would take part in the Belgorod-Kharkov Offensive Operation under that command.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 99 As of September 1 the division was assigned to the 78th Rifle Corps.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 222 On September 18, the division took part in the liberation of Mirgorod, and was recognized as follows: By the end of the month 52nd Army had reached the Dniepr River, and its 254th Rifle Division soon forced a crossing in the Kreshchatik area. During October the Army was moved back to Steppe Front, which became 2nd Ukrainian Front on October 20. As of November 1, the 373rd was the only division in its Corps, and was defending a sector of more than 110 km on the east bank from the mouth of the Dolgun River to Chigurin Dubrova.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of the Dnepr, ed. & trans. R. W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2018, pp. 291-92 =Battle of Cherkassy= Following the liberation of Kiev on November 6, 1st Ukrainian Front was ordered to halt its offensive on November 12. In conjunction with this, 52nd Army, on that Front's left (south) flank, had been ordered to launch an operation to liberate the west bank city of Cherkassy, as well as the important rail junction of Smela, beginning on November 13. At this time the Army had only three rifle divisions under command, with the 254th and 294th in the Kreshchatik bridgehead. The Army was being reinforced, and by this time the divisions mustered 6,000 to 6,300 personnel each. The Army also had crossing means (boats, ferries and pontoons) enough to carry 300-400 men, with their weapons, in one trip, with more in reserve. 52nd Army faced the German 57th, 332nd, 72nd and 167th Infantry Divisions and the 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking, which had very few tanks and was operating as infantry. These divisions had between 4,000-5,000 men each under command. Overall, the terrain, with a large river to cross, much broken and wooded ground, and many inhabited localities, including substantial buildings and factories in the vicinity of Cherkassy, would make this a difficult operation. In the event, what was planned as a two-day offensive stretched on for 31 days.Soviet General Staff, Battle of the Dnepr, pp. 290-93, 295, 309 The 254th Division, experienced in river crossings, had been pulled out of the Kreshchatik bridgehead under cover of darkness. The plan was to have it capture a new bridgehead at Svidovok, northwest of Cherkassy. The 373rd would simultaneously attack across the Dniepr on the secondary axis southeast of the city with the 1239th and 1235th Rifle Regiments, while the 1237th continued to hold the Dniepr line. The division was strong in artillery, with 54 mortars, 44 45mm antitank guns, 8 76mm regimental guns, 19 76mm divisional guns and 12 divisional 122mm howitzers, although there was no artillery preparation, to preserve surprise. The joint attack began at midnight. The 2nd Battalion of the 1239th made a landing north of Dakhnovka and by 0600 hours had pushed forward as much as a kilometre. German tanks and infantry reserves counterattacked and drove the battalion back to the shore, from where it was evacuated after nightfall, having suffered significant losses, including in crossing equipment. The crossing forces of the 1235th's 1st Battalion were contained to an island near the west bank, and was eventually joined there by the 3rd Battalion.Soviet General Staff, Battle of the Dnepr, pp. 297-98, 310-11 Despite these failures, the 254th Rifle Division had managed to get two regiments across at Svidovok and to hold off the enemy counterattacks. Colonel Sazonov was ordered to cross the 1239th and the 2nd Battalion of the 1235th into this bridgehead the next night. By the end of November 15 this bridgehead was 7 km wide and 5 km deep. However, German reinforcements continued to arrive and tilt the balance of forces in their favor. The battle for the bridgehead went on for several days, as antitank units and the few tanks and self-propelled guns of 52nd Army crossed the river on pontoons, and by the end of November 18 the 373rd had taken Vasilitsa and Sosnovka, and the bridgehead had been expanded to 16 km in width and nine km in depth.Soviet General Staff, Battle of the Dnepr, pp. 310-12, 314-15 By the morning of November 20, the strategic situation indicated that the enemy would be receiving new reserves, so to retain offensive momentum the Army headquarters ordered a new effort to capture the city. The division was to attack with the 1239th Regiment from the Sosnovka area towards the northwestern outskirts of Cherkassy, while the two battalions of the 1235th crossed from the island they occupied to attack the eastern outskirts. This attack was organized hastily, and the Soviet forces had no advantage in manpower. In the early going the 1239th captured the Shevchenko Collective Farm. This was followed by heavy counterattacks, and by nightfall the Regiment, along with the rest of the Army's forces, had to fall back to their jumping-off positions. By now the 1239th in particular was significantly under strength. A further attack on the city overnight on November 21-22 was also unsuccessful. On November 24 the Army finally received reinforcements, with the 7th Guards Airborne Division crossing into the bridgehead, and the 62nd Guards Rifle Division moving up to join 78th Corps after receiving replacements.Soviet General Staff, Battle of the Dnepr, pp. 316-21Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 308 A new assault began at 0600 hours on November 26, following a 50-minute artillery preparation. By this time the 1239th Regiment had been subordinated to 294th Division, while the 1235th was to again attack from the island in the direction of the sugar factory in the southeastern part of the city. By 1100 hours on November 28 the German forces in Cherkassy were surrounded, but rejected an ultimatum to surrender. At the end of the day the 1235th Regiment was still fighting in the vicinity of the sugar factory. The fighting in the city and its approaches continued the next day, at which time it was learned from prisoner interrogations that the 3rd Panzer Division and other reinforcements had arrived at Smela to restore contact with the Cherkassy garrison.Soviet General Staff, Battle of the Dnepr, pp. 323-26 The counteroffensive began at 0900 hours on November 30. It fell mainly on 7th Guards Airborne, whose external encirclement front was soon penetrated, and counterblows were unsuccessful. The German attack continued on December 1 and managed to break through to the garrison, in the process encircling two regiments of the 7th Guards. 52nd Army scraped up all possible reserves and on the morning of December 4 reestablished contact with one regiment. Meanwhile the 373rd's 1235th Regiment was engaged in further fighting around the sugar factory to tie down enemy forces. By December 5 the rest of the airborne troops escaped encirclement and the situation stabilized.Soviet General Staff, Battle of the Dnepr, pp. 326-28 The final attack to clear Cherkassy began at 0830 hours on December 9, following an artillery preparation better organized than previous efforts. The 1239th Regiment was fighting in the vicinity of the railway station near the river and repelled several German counterattacks. The 1235th Regiment, now aided by elements of the 1237th, finally pushed past the sugar factory. A regrouping was carried out overnight on December 12/13. During the final push on the 13th the 1235th and one battalion of the 1237th beat off counterattacks and captured three city blocks. At this time the German command realized its position in the city was untenable and ordered its troops to pull out towards Smela, which was not liberated until February 3, 1944.Soviet General Staff, Battle of the Dnepr, pp. 330-32 On December 14, the division was recognized for its general service, especially in regard to the fighting around Cherkassy, with the award of the Order of the Red Banner. Jassy-Kishinev Offensives Following the successful conclusion of the Battle of the Korsun‚ÄìCherkassy Pocket, 52nd Army joined the general advance through western Ukraine towards the Dniestr River. As of April 1, 1944, the 373rd was still in 78th Rifle Corps, which also commanded the 252nd and 303rd Rifle Divisions.Glantz, Red Storm Over the Balkans, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2007, p. 56 On April 8 the division was further honored with the award of the Order of Suvorov, 2nd Degree, for its part in an assault crossing of the Dniestr and the capture of the Romanian city of Beltsy. By this time the offensive had run to the end of its logistical support given the spring thaw, and the division remained in its positions due north of Ia»ôi until late May.Glantz, Red Storm, p. 329 =Operation Sonja= By that time Marshal Konev had devised a new plan for the capture of Ia»ôi, which involved the transfer of 27th Guards Rifle Corps from 7th Guards Army, to the west, into positions behind 73rd Rifle Corps, which now included the 373rd.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 168 All of this was preempted on May 30, when German 8th Army launched a limited offensive north of the city. Operation Sonja began with a strong aviation and artillery preparation against the rifle divisions of 52nd Army, followed by attacks from tanks and infantry. Battlegroups of the 23rd and 24th Panzer Divisions moved northwards on both sides of the Enache Forest and after running a gauntlet of Soviet artillery fire penetrated the defenses at the junction between the 373rd and 294th Rifle Division and lunged forward towards the village of Stanca, some 8 km beyond. The battlegroup of 24th Panzer reached the approaches to Hill 198, which was held by the second echelon rifle regiment of the 373rd. Reinforced by tanks the German force overcame this resistance, wheeled to the northwest, but was halted on the outskirts of Stanca by dug-in Soviet antitank guns and rifles, backed by withdrawing elements of the division. The second battlegroup captured Hill 165, about 2.5 km into the 373rd's defenses, before its supporting elements of the 79th Infantry Division faltered in the face of strong Soviet resistance. Despite this, by 2000 hours the German forces had taken Stanca and the division was driven back to the outskirts of Carpiti. At about this time the 254th Rifle Division was ordered from 52nd Army reserves to reinforce the badly shaken 373rd. By the following day 73rd Corps had regained its balance and the enemy made no further gains. As well, elements of the 6th Tank Army were ordered forward to support 52nd Army and repel the offensive; 5th Mechanized Corps backed the 73rd Corps and restored the situation.Glantz, Red Storm, pp. 328-331, 339-45 =Second Jassy-Kishinev Offensive= In the buildup to the new summer offensive the 373rd remained in 73rd Rifle CorpsCombat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 228 but was removed from the front line to the reserve echelon of the Corps. The offensive began in the early morning of August 20 with an artillery preparation of one hour and 40 minutes duration which wreaked significant destruction on the German and Romanian defenses and forces, although some strongpoints remained relatively intact. 52nd Army broke through the Axis defense along a 12 km front and advanced 16 km during the day, forcing the Bahlui River in the process, and by the end of the day was engaged in fighting in the area of the Ia»ôi railway station. The 373rd remained in reserve despite its Army not reaching its first day objective, which was the complete occupation of the city.Soviet General Staff, The Iasi-Kishinev Operation, ed. & trans. R. W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2017, pp. 74, 97-98 That task was assigned to 73rd Corps for August 21. During most of the day the 116th Rifle Division was engaged in stubborn fighting for the village of Galata, where enemy reserves were concentrated to hold open an escape route to the south. While the 294th Division with the third battalion of the 223rd Tank Brigade cleared Ia»ôi by 1230 hours, the 373rd had to be committed to the fighting for Galata, which was seized by the end of the day. This day's battles used up the slender Axis reserves across the front, as well as any hope of countering new Red Army advances. On the next day the 52nd Army crushed the enemy resistance along the south bank of the Bahlui as a preliminary for an advance on Hu»ôi. 73rd Corps was tied up in heavy fighting for an enemy strongpoint referred to as the \\"Little Fortress\\" height about 2 km south of Ia»ôi which dominated the surrounding terrain. When this was overcome at day's end the Corps continued to move through the night on the paved road to Vaslui.Soviet General Staff, Iasi-Kishinev Operation, pp. 99, 104-05, 110-11 The ultimate objective for 52nd Army on August 23 was to link up with forces of 3rd Ukrainian Front and complete the encirclement of the Axis' Kishinev group of forces. By this time those forces were in full retreat. During the day the army finished off enemy units that had been scattered by the advance of 18th Tank Corps and by the end of the day 73rd Rifle Corps had reached a line from »òerbote»ôti to »òerbe»ôti, but the pocket remained open. The next day the 52nd and the 18th Tank Corps were ordered to seize and hold Hu»ôi. During this day Romanian units began dropping out of the fighting. Through the day the 73rd Corps, with tank support, fought for the city against a disorganized but desperate defense. By 1900 hours Hu»ôi was taken, and 73rd Corps continued its advance to the south and east to complete the encirclement.Soviet General Staff, Iasi-Kishinev Operation, pp. 112, 119-20, 124, 126 The trapped Kishinev group occupied a pocket of about 60 km by 50 km in area, and would have to seize crossings over the Prut River to escape. While the other forces of 2nd Ukrainian Front began to exploit to the west, 52nd and 4th Guards Armies were assigned to eliminate the encircled group in cooperation with elements of 3rd Ukrainian Front. The Axis force was estimated at between 60,000 - 70,000 men. During August 25, 73rd Corps was in a difficult situation. During the day it was forced to continue fighting in the Husi area with part of its forces while another part was to reach the Prut; meanwhile the 1239th Rifle Regiment was ordered to eliminate enemy remnants in the Curteni area southwest of Husi. German troops, pressed from the north by 48th Rifle Corps, broke into the northeastern outskirts of Husi in regimental strength, backed by four armored cars, but were counterattacked and defeated by elements of the 373rd and 294th Divisions, backed by the 110th Tank Brigade and army artillery. The 1235th and 1237th Rifle Regiments reached the Prut on an 8 km front and linked up with 3rd Ukrainian Front forces. Overall the 52nd Army was unable to create a continuous front along the right bank of the Prut.Soviet General Staff, Iasi- Kishinev Operation, pp. 127, 129, 131-34 Overnight on August 25/26 a composite group of about 10,000 men of the LII Army Corps moved towards Husi and got into fighting with elements of 73rd Corps, with little success. Throughout the day the Corps continued in heavy fighting with an increasingly disorganized enemy. By the end of the day 52nd Army's forces had killed up to 12,000 enemy soldiers and officers and captured more than 8,500. Despite these heavy losses, enemy pressure on 52nd Army grew on August 27 as more of their forces crossed the Prut, almost entirely without vehicles or heavy weapons. By the end of the 28th the 21st Guards and 373rd Divisions had basically cleared the area west of Vutcani. On August 29 the 373rd managed to inflict heavy losses on the German group in the woods southwest of Husi. Overall, 52nd Army claimed up to 6,000 killed and more than 10,000 captured during the day. At day's end two of the division's rifle regiments were on a line from Ruska to just outside Voloseni. From August 30 to September 5 the 52nd Army mopped up the remnants of the Kishinev group, following which it was moved to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command.Soviet General Staff, Iasi-Kishinev Operation, pp. 138-40, 142, 144. The 373rd is misidentified as the 73rd on page 142. Into Germany In October the 52nd Army was reassigned to 1st Ukrainian Front and the 373rd was moved back to the 78th Rifle Corps. It would fight under these commands for the duration of the war.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 99 During the Vistula-Oder Offensive, by January 28, 1945, 52nd Army reached the Oder River on a 60 km front north and south of Breslau with the 73rd and 78th Corps in first echelon, and gained two bridgeheads over the river southeast of the city. Over the following week the Front carried out a complicated regrouping in the Breslau area. On February 1, 78th Corps was preparing for its relief from its bridgehead; German forces noticed the movement during daylight hours and launched an attack which drove the Corps back several kilometres towards the river. At the start of the Lower Silesian Offensive on February 8 the Army made its main attack on the 20-km-wide Luben - Gross Kreidel sector with 48th and 78th Corps, and was backed by the 3rd Guards Tank Army.Soviet General Staff, Prelude to Berlin, ed. & trans. R. W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2016, pp. 344, 380-81, 384 The offensive began at 0930 hours, following a 50-minute artillery preparation. 78th Corps, supported by 7th Guards Tank Corps, made moderate progress, advancing 6 km and capturing enemy strongpoints at Muhlredlitz and Merschwitz. On February 9, 78th Corps advanced behind the tanks and overcame weak but unremitting resistance from the 19th Panzer and 408th Infantry Divisions, finally reaching the northern outskirts of Liegnitz. As the advance continued the next day the Corps was forced to deploy its divisions, including the 373rd, facing southwest to cover its Army's left flank along a sector of 40 km from Liegnitz to Rosenthal. This was a potentially dangerous situation as German forces built up in the Breslau area, so the Front commander, Marshal I. S. Konev, redirected the main forces of 3rd Guards Tank Army from its advance on G√∂rlitz to the east against the flank and rear of Breslau. This diversion slowed the pace of 52nd Army's main offensive and by February 15 it went over to the defensive along a 120km front.Soviet General Staff, Prelude to Berlin, pp. 402-04, 407, 411, 418-20 On February 19 the 373rd was recognized for its role in forcing the Oder River and capturing several German towns with the award of the Order of Kutuzov, 2nd Degree. 78th Corps resumed the offensive within 48 hours, and by February 19 its left flank forces, including the 373rd, reached the Neisse River north of Penzig, and by the 20th all of its main forces had reached the river as well. By February 25 the entire 52nd Army consolidated along the Neisse, where it would remain until the Berlin operation.Soviet General Staff, Prelude to Berlin, pp. 439, 443 On April 5 the division's rifle regiments were decorated for their parts in the capture of Bunzlau as follows: 1235th - Order of Bogdan Khmelnitsky, 2nd Degree; 1237th - Order of Aleksandr Nevsky; 1239th - Order of Kutuzov, 3rd Degree. =Berlin and Prague Offensives= At the start of the Berlin offensive on April 16 the forces of 52nd Army were split; four of its divisions formed part of 1st Ukrainian Front's auxiliary shock group, while the remaining five divisions, including the 373rd, were deployed on a 101 km defensive front along the Neisse from Penzig to Jauer. The Army had the 7th Guards Mechanized Corps in its second echelon. 73rd Rifle Corps, which formed the Army's share of the shock group, quickly forced a crossing of the river despite repeated counterattacks by the Brandenburg Panzergrenadier Division. This success pulled in the 373rd on the flank of the shock group, and by the end of the day had helped break through the German's main defense zone to a depth of up to 10 km. The division, along with its Army, continued to advance in the direction of Dresden until after the fall of Berlin.Soviet General Staff, The Berlin Operation, 1945, ed. & trans. R. W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2016, Kindle ed., ch. 11, 13 Following this, it took part in the drive on Prague in the final days of the war.

Early History  From the late 1950s to the 1980s Hilliard wrote many of the group's 150-plus charts. He also worked with Chicago‚Äôs top arrangers to expand the library. In 1959, the group recorded a single album on the Argo label called The Legend of Bix,a tribute to 1920s cornetist and composer Bix Beiderbecke. On the recording was Tom Hilliard - tenor sax, Ed Haley - trumpet, Ed Avis - valve trombone, Dave Edwards (musician) - alto sax, Ben Baileys - baritone sax, Angelo Principali - piano, Gerry Lofstrum - bass, Jim Gianas - drums. A professor at DePaul University School of Music in the 1970s, Hilliard left the MJO library to his former student tenor saxophonist Jim Gailloreto when his health began to fail.  Current History  The charts remained in Gailloreto‚Äôs basement for many years until 2014 (57 years after the group was formed) when Jim organized a group of musicians to read through some of the arrangements. Rehearsals took place at Andy's Music on Chicago's Northwest side. Realizing the treasure trove of music in this library, the group began performing and the Metropolitan Jazz Octet was brought back to life. In 2015 the group played a concert at Roosevelt University School of Music featuring the music from Tom Hilliard‚Äôs album The Legend of Bix. From 2014 to the present while exploring and performing the original MJO music, current members of the group began adding new arrangements of their own. In 2018 the MJO recorded The Road to Your Place a compilation of original compositions and upended arrangements of classics by Gailloreto, and alto saxophonist John Kornegay. In addition to Gailloreto and Kornegay, the group includes Peter Brusen - Baritone Sax, Doug Scharf - trumpet, Russ Phillips - trombone, Bob Sutter - piano, Doug Bistrow - bass, Bob Rummage - drums. \\"It's Too Hot For Words\\", an MJO recording with singer Dee Alexander, celebrates Billie Holiday and was released on Delmark Records in 2019. \\"It's Too Hot For Words\\" has received major jazz publication reviews including Jazztimes and Downbeat magazine, and was a Chicago Tribune pick for best jazz album in 2019.

As a member of the family Coreidae, it is a leaf-footed bug. As the common name implies, it is a large bug that feeds on mesquite trees of the American Southwest and Northwestern Mexico. Life cycle Thasus neocalifornicus is univoltine, meaning they have one generation of offspring annually. From January through July, the nymphs develop from first-fifth instars. Each subsequent instar more closely resembles an adult than the last. They often prefer the undersides of leaves and migrate towards the base of mesquite trees in summer. Adults lay eggs on the trees from August until October. Only the eggs survive the winter season. Distribution Thasus neocalifornicus inhabits the Sonoran Desert from southwestern Arizona to the Mexican state of Baja California Sur and can be plentiful depending on the season. They have also been found in the state of Texas and the Mexican states of Sinaloa and Sonora. Most populations in the United States occur in the Tucson area, and around the southern tip of Baja California Sur in Mexico. It is the only species in the genus Thasus known to occur in the United States. Morphology Illustration of an adult female This species is the largest terrestrial member of the suborder Heteroptera. Adults are around two inches in length. The flightless nymphs have more vibrant coloration and complex patterning. They have an aposematic white and red coloration, while adults are dark brown with crimson and black striped legs and antennae. The antennae are setaceous and feature a small disc-like nodule about two thirds of the way up. The hind femora of the adults are widened and feature spikes along the inner edge that are more pronounced in males. It is the lone member of this genus to have third and fourth antennal segments that are equal or subequal. Between the wing bases on the dorsal thorax lies a triangular structure called the scutellum. This species was mistaken for T. gigas or T. acutangulus until it was distinguished in 1995. Defense Adults rely on muted coloration and heavier armor for defense, while nymphs employ noxious chemicals. Nymphs produce (E)-2-hexenal and 4-oxo-(E)-2-hexenal while adults produce hexanal, hexyl acetate, and hexanol in their metathoracic glands from fatty acids acquired from plants. When distressed, they will release these compounds as a spray. 4-oxo-(E)-2-hexenal, a known cytotoxin and mutagen, is particularly toxic to insects, being known to cause death in mantids and tarantulas. A study by Becerra et al. found that individuals without the symbiotic bacteria Wolbachia were unable to produce alarm pheromones or defensive chemicals. Behavior These chemicals are also utilized by the giant mesquite bug to signal to others of the same life stage. As pheromones, they stimulate aggregations of giant mesquite bugs of the same life stage to disperse. However, nymphs do not respond to adult secretions and vice versa. 4-oxo-(E)-2- hexenal functions as both an alarm signal and a defense mechanism. Feeding The giant mesquite bug feeds on the sugary seedpods and sap of mesquite trees. Both adults and nymphs exhibit similar feeding habits, and both stages are often found congregated on the same tree. Species of mesquite trees the bugs feed on include Prosopis chilensis, Prosopis velutina, and Prosopis glandulosa. Digestive microbiota Research by Olivier-Espejel et al. suggests that the symbiotic bacterium Burkholderia is the dominant gut microbiota of this species, and may be an important factor in the species' survival. The study found that Burkholderia was present in neither the eggs nor all young nymphs, meaning the symbiont is acquired post-hatching. It was also determined that individuals without the bacteria experienced a lower survival rate. All nymphs that were raised in a sterile environment without exposure to Burkholderia died within two weeks. Acquired from the soil, Burkholderia occupy the lumen of crypts which lie along the midgut. Bacteria of the genus Wolbachia was also found in the gut, as well as the reproductive organs of adults. Predators A notable predator of Thasus neocalifornicus is the pallid bat. A study by Czaplewski et al. conducted near Tucson found that when nighttime temperatures dropped in late summer, the adult bugs became sluggish on the edges of trees. This made them easy prey for foraging pallid bats.

The name, derived from the numerous ferns in the district (or possibly Ferndale, Washington), appeared in the later 1920s. Adopted by the new school in 1931, and included as a settlement in Wrigley‚Äôs BC Directory for that year, the first newspaper reference was the following year.Prince George Citizen, 31 Mar 1932 In earlier times, the northern part was considered as Willow River, and the western part as Shelley. Although Ferndale once stretched as far south as Tabor Lake, the 1977 completion of the Blackburn Bypass of Highway 16 effectively created the southern boundary.Prince George Citizen: 3 & 31 Aug 1977 Comprising about 40 residences, it has a good-sized community hall, and the Ferndale-Tabor volunteer fire hall lies between the two localities. History =Railways & Speculation= Initially, the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (GTP) planned following the Fraser River between Willow River and Hansard. About north of the Willow River confluence, heavy grades exist in the Giscome Rapids country. To find an alternative route, a survey party in the 1906 winter reviewed the possibility of a Prince George-Ferndale alignment, south along the Willow, across the divide, and east to follow the Bear River to its confluence south of Hansard. Subsequently, the surveyors discovered the superior shortcut via Eagle (Eaglet) Lake and Aleza Lake.Prince George Post, 31 Jul 1915 Consequently, the booklet's claim that political pressure caused the GTP to abandon the Ferndale route is false. In fact, the GTP regularly ignored government directives. The chartered CB&WR; through the Willow River settlement proposed a line along the Willow River that never eventuated. Consequently, most of the early investors abandoned their properties. Apparently on speculation, Lord Londonderry had equally unwisely acquired a parcel of land . This would be Charles Vane-Tempest-Stewart, 6th Marquess of Londonderry (1852‚Äì1915), and Charles Vane-Tempest-Stewart, 7th Marquess of Londonderry (1878‚Äì1949). =Misidentified Pioneers= Although listed as pioneer settlers, Tom Sullivan, Elmer Cahoun, Mr. Bushell, George Teats, Bob McRorrie, and Ivor and Harry Guest, may have owned speculative properties, but no evidence of residence is apparent.

Premiering on video on demand before being released direct-to-video, the film stars Bryson Holl, Caroline Lassetter, Tim Sauer, and Emily Lynne Aiken as members of a dysfunctional family who run afoul of the mythological creature Krampus (Travis Amery) while spending Christmas with relatives in the Southwestern United States.  Plot  In 1898, a German outlaw named Erik Klaus allegedly buried treasure somewhere in the Arizona desert before disappearing, leaving behind an ominous warning to anyone who went looking for his stash. Years later, a group of cowboys discovers the loot, which turns out to be a coal-like \\"summoning stone\\" that releases Krampus when exposed to open flames. According to myth, Saint Nicholas left pieces of the stone in the shoes and stockings of his enemies, so that Krampus would kill them when the clothing was placed by a fire to dry. Krampus is accidentally summoned when the stone is dropped on a lantern, and it proceeds to massacre all of the cowboys save one, Cooper. While Cooper flees, the summoning stone falls into a stream, and is lost. Decades later, a family consisting of Will and Amber, and their children Tommy and Fiona, travels to Arizona to spend Christmas with Amber's parents, Dale and Alice Henderson. Also present are Amber's environmentalist brother, David, his wife, Vivian, and their delinquent son, Troy. While gold panning in a creek, Tommy finds the summoning stone, which brings forth Krampus when Troy accidentally burns it with a lit cigarette. Krampus runs amok through the area, murdering a pair of Bigfoot hunters, as well as the boyfriend of a woman named Bonnie. Bonnie seeks aid from the Hendersons, and uses their telephone to call 911. As they wait for the police to arrive, Will, Dale, Alice and Amber are all slaughtered by Krampus. David, Vivian, Fiona, Troy, Tommy and Bonnie try to flee in a car, but it crashes, killing Vivian. David attacks Krampus to buy the others time to run away, and is ripped to pieces. Bonnie, Fiona, Troy and Tommy make it to the home of Cooper, who has spent his life studying Krampus ever since he survived it all those years ago. Cooper reveals that Krampus is summoned by fire, but can be banished back to Hell by earth. Cooper, Bonnie, Fiona, Troy and Tommy lure Krampus into an abandoned mine shaft with the summoning stone, and Cooper sacrifices himself to collapse the cavern on Krampus with TNT while the others escape. In the morning, Bonnie, Tommy and Fiona and are found by Bonnie's ex- boyfriend, a state trooper named Dan. Troy, who had become separated from the others, is mauled by a baby Krampus that had hatched from the summoning stone.  Cast   Release  Krampus Unleashed premiered on video on demand on November 1, 2016 and was released on DVD by Uncork'd Entertainment on December 3, 2016. It was made available on the streaming service Hulu in December 2018.  Reception  Scott Foy of Dread Central, who awarded Krampus Unleashed a score of 1¬Ω out of a possible 5, commended the film's creature design and gore effects, but heavily criticized every other aspect of it, writing, \\"When your movie is only 75 minutes but feels longer because so little happens for so long, that will definitely get you on my naughty list.\\" While fellow Dread Central reviewer Ted Hentschke was slightly more lenient towards the film, giving it a grade of 2/5, he still derided it as being \\"uninteresting\\" and \\"bland\\" and concluded, \\"It wasn't good enough to want to love, and wasn't shit enough to make me hate it.\\" Chris Coffel of Film School Rejects wrote, \\"This is the second Krampus movie on this list from director Robert Conway (Krampus: The Reckoning). You would think if one director was going to make two different Krampus movies that Krampus would have the same mythos, but that is not the case. This film does offer up some practical effects with the creature which makes it far better than Conway's previous film. It's still not good at all, but I'll take the slight improvement as a step in the right direction.\\" Nolen Boe of Horror News opined that the film's gore effects were its only positive quality, and dismissively stated, \\"Krampus Unleashed was not entertaining, in any way worth my money as a consumer.\\" A score of 3/10 was awarded to the film by Starburst's Scott Clark, who wrote, \\"Sure it's better than Conway's first Krampus flick, but that's not saying much. The dialogue feels clunky and overdone, the acting is passable yet never involving, and worst perhaps is that its plain old dull\\" before concluding, \\"There's potential here for a good horror comedy (rednecks mistake Krampus prints for Bigfoot) but Conway takes things too seriously and spends too much time acquainting us with Krampus fodder families. Krampus: Unleashed feels most comfortable when its offing terrible people with terrible violence, we just wish it did that more.\\"  See also  * Krampus: The Reckoning, another Krampus film directed by Robert Conway  References   External links  Category:2016 direct-to-video films Category:2016 films Category:2016 horror films Category:2010s Christmas films Category:2010s exploitation films Category:2010s fantasy films Category:2016 independent films Category:2010s monster movies Category:2010s supernatural films Category:Abandoned buildings and structures in fiction Category:American Christmas films Category:American direct-to-video films Category:American exploitation films Category:American fantasy films Category:American films Category:American independent films Category:American monster movies Category:American splatter films Category:American supernatural horror films Category:Christmas horror films Category:Dark fantasy films Category:Demons in film Category:Direct-to-video fantasy films Category:Direct-to-video horror films Category:English-language films Category:Films about dysfunctional families Category:Films about mass murder Category:Films based on European myths and legends Category:Films about hunters Category:Films set in 2016 Category:Films set in Arizona Category:Films set in deserts Category:Films shot in Arizona Category:Krampus in popular culture Category:Mining in film Category:Supernatural fantasy films Category:Treasure hunt films ","title":"Krampus Unleashed"},{"id":"59682039","text":"The 1868 Lyttelton by-election was a by-election held on 2 November 1868 during the 4th New Zealand Parliament in the Canterbury electorate of .

Although the internal openings form two circles, the outside appearance is as a single elongated oval.  Purpose  Sectioned smokebox, showing the double chimney and Kylchap blastpipes of a RENFE (Spanish) class 141 F The classic exhaust design for a steam locomotive began with Hackworth's invention of the blastpipe, placed centrally within a tall chimney. Victorian developments reduced the chimney's height, such that natural draught was no longer significant. The standard design was then a circular drumhead smokebox, with a single blastpipe nozzle leading into a chimney with a flared petticoat pipe beneath it. From the work of theorists such as W.F.M. Goss of Purdue University, and later S.O. Ell of Swindon, guidelines were developed at each locomotive works, describing how these were to be proportioned. It was recognised both that a particular diameter of chimney and blastpipe would be needed for the steam-raising capacity of each boiler, and also that the conical taper from blastpipe to chimney could not be made too steep. As boilers became more powerful, not only did the chimney diameter need to become greater, but also the minimum height for the chimney was becoming longer ‚Äì just as the increasing size of boilers restricted the clearance height available within the loading gauge. A chimney height of at least 24 inches was considered the minimum workable. By the 1930s, it was increasingly difficult to provide such a height and other solutions were sought. A solution to this limit was to adopt a double chimney. This allowed adequate cross-section area for airflow, whilst reducing the diameter of each and thus the minimum height needed for an acceptably gentle taper. = Kylchap blastpipes = A simultaneous development was the Kylchap blastpipe, combining the Kyl√§l√§ spreader by Finnish engineer Ky√∂sti Kyl√§l√§, and a further flue choke tube added by the French engineer Andr√© Chapelon. This split the blastpipe area into four smaller nozzles, and the vertical draught induction across three stacked venturis. Although the total blastpipe area remained constant, their perimeter, and thus the area for mixing with the exhaust gases, was doubled. The additional petticoats also improved the effectiveness of the blast in inducing a draught. Although there is no reason why one approach, either the double chimney or the Kylchap blastpipe, depends on the other, interest in both was generally simultaneous and so both were often installed together. = Disadvantages = 4472 Flying Scotsman in 2003, with Witte-type smoke deflectors refitted The first 50 of the Ivatt class 4MT 2-6-0 were built with double chimneys. These performed poorly however, and were noted as poor steamers. Work on the static test plant at Rugby discovered that there was both no advantage to the double chimney and also that it had been poorly designed initially. When revised with a single chimney and improved gasflow in the smokebox, their steaming rate was raised from 9,000 lb/hour with a double chimney to 17,000 lb/hour with a single chimney, even though this was still below the theoretical limit, restricted by firegrate size, of 19,000 lb/hour. A minor disadvantage could be a 'softer' exhaust blast for the purpose of lifting the external smoke clear of the driver's vision. When the LNER A3 class were fitted with double chimneys in the late 1950s, they suffered problems with smoke obscuring the view from the cab. The solution to this was to fit small Witte-type smoke deflectors of the German pattern.  Notable installations  Many double chimney installations, at least in the UK, were performed as experimental conversions in the 1930s, rather than as new builds. = LNER A4 = A4 60019 Bittern Nigel Gresley, the CME of the LNER, was a keen follower of French locomotive practice, particularly the work of Andr√© Chapelon and the Nord 'Superpacifics' of . When Gresley designed his P2 class as successor to his A3s, he took this French work into account and also used a double chimney with Kylchap blastpipes. Two P2s were built initially, 2001 Cock O' The North and then 2002 Earl Marischal, both in 1934. Also following French practice, 2001 was built with poppet valves, and for comparison 2002 kept the conventional piston valves. To avoid problems with smoke obscuring the driver's vision, both were built with wedged tops to their smokebox and wing plates to the upper sides of it, as had been used for 10000. With the sharper exhaust of the poppet valve-equipped 2001, this was successful and smoke was projected upwards, clear of the cab windows. 2002 had a softer exhaust though and gave trouble, until it was rebuilt with additional smoke deflectors, spaced about 18 inches parallel to the existing wing plates. Both locomotives were considered successful, but 2002 had the edge for efficiency, put down to the smaller volumes within the valve chest. When the further members of the P2 class were built, they followed 2002 with piston valves and the extra smoke deflectors. The first of the A4 class reverted to a single chimney and a conventional blastpipe. They had the greatest attention paid to their gas flow generally, both the inlet and exhaust sides. With the P2s, there had been a tendency for an excess of draught, when working hard at a long cut-off, enough to lift the fire. To avoid this, the A4s used a 'jumper top' on their blastpipe, a loose ring which rose under the influence of a strong blast jet, increasing the effective nozzle diameter and so reducing the drawing effect of the blast. This device could not be applied to either a double chimney, nor to a Kylala blastpipe, but it is not clear if that was the only reason for the simplified single blastpipe. 4468 Mallard the 28th of the A4s was built with a double chimney and Kylchap blastpipes in 1938. This was considered successful and so the final three of the class, built a few months later, were also built with them. The entire class was refitted similarly in the 1950s, together with some of the A3s. Peppercorn's A2 pacifics were built, post-war, with similar double Kylchap blastpipes. = LMS Jubilee = Five members of the LMS Jubilee class were experimentally fitted with double chimneys at different times. The first was 5684 Jutland, a double chimney with Kylchap petticoats in 1937. This improved both the steaming capacity and also reduced coal consumption, although it was removed after a year owing to problems with the excessive draught causing spark-throwing from the chimney and a build-up of excess smokebox ash. 5742 Connaught and 5553 Canada were then fitted with plain double chimneys in 1940, which was removed from Canada after a short time, but which Connaught carried until 1955. As part of experiments at Rugby test plant, 45722 Defence was fitted with a double chimney from 1956 to 1957. In 1961 a double exhaust was fitted to 45596 Bahamas which carried it through withdrawal and into preservation. Two further engines, 5735 Comet and 5736 Phoenix were rebuilt with a 2A taper boiler and double chimney in 1942. They were to have been a prototype for the rebuilding of the entire class but, in the end, the only Jubilees so to be treated. All the Royal Scot class were rebuilt along similar lines as were many of the Fowler Patriot locos. = LMS Black 5 = LMS 'Black 5' 4767 was completed on the last day of the LMS, 31 December 1947. It was unique amongst the 842-strong class in that it featured outside Stephenson link motion in addition to other experimental features; a double chimney, Timken roller bearings throughout and electric lighting. These modifications were part of a series of experiments by George Ivatt to improve the already excellent Stanier-designed Black 5. The double chimney was removed in 1953, owing to the already-good performance of the standard chimney and problems with the softer blast of the double chimney not clearing smoke away from the cab so well. 4765 and 4766 had also trialled a similar double chimney, but with the standard Walschaerts valvegear. Some of the first BR- built Black 5s were built with Caprotti valvegear. A batch of twenty, 44738-44757, were built, of which the last three also had double chimneys. The boilers of the Caprotti engines were raised by 2 inches, further reducing the clearance for the chimney height. The Caprotti valveboxes were arranged with the inlet valves on the outside, fed by large and prominent steam pipes, and the exhaust valves on the inside. The large clearance volume which was unavoidable within the valve chest of the Caprotti's poppet valves had a similar effect to a long lead on the valve setting. In contrast to the Stephenson engine,, this led to these engines performing well at speed but poorly for climbing. Although the intention for trialling the Caprotti valve gear had been to reduce maintenance, coal consumption was still important. These engines were considered as hungrier for coal than usual as the audibly sharp exhaust bark had an effect on the firebox draught. The double chimney examples though had a softer bark and so consumed less. A second batch of two more Caprotti-fitted engines was tried in 1951, 44686 and 44687. These were of a different design, with an improved mechanical drive to the camboxes, and both with double chimneys. To reduce the 'dead-space' volume within the valve chest, the exhaust valves were reduced in size to now be the same as the inlets. The mechanical drive design was considered successful and was copied for the few later Caprotti engines built for the BR Standard classes. The behaviour of good high-speed performance but a lack of power with low cutoffs was the same as the other engines though. All the Caprotti engines kept their double chimneys and it was noticeable that their still-staccato exhaust had no trouble in lifting smoke clear of the cab. = Great Western King class = King Edward I In September 1955, GWR King class 6015 King Richard III was fitted with a double chimney for trials. These were successful and so the whole class was refitted with them. Some of the Castle class were similarly refitted. Tests with a dynamometer car in hauling the Cornish Riviera in 1956 did not show an evident increase in performance, but did show an 8% improvement in the efficiency of coal consumption. Water consumption remained constant, indicating that this was an improvement in combustion and heat transfer, rather than the reduction in engine exhaust back pressure, indicated by some other tests. = British Railways Standard classes = 92240 The BR Standards had been designed from the outset with their draughting based on the earlier work of S.O. Ell. Despite this, some of the classes steamed poorly, notably the Class 4 4-6-0. In 1957, 75029 was successfully fitted with a double chimney, leading to its adoption across many of the class. At the same time, there was also a proposal to test a Giesl ejector on the 9F Possibly as a comparison for this, 92178 was built with a double chimney. The double chimney was so successful that it was adopted as standard for all 9F built from 92183 onwards, including the three fitted with a mechanical stoker.  Duke of Gloucester  The BR Standard class 8 Duke of Gloucester was the last of the BR Standard classes to be designed, as the need to build any more of such large express passenger locomotives had initially been rejected. This led to it ignoring one of the design principles of the Standard classes and rather than two cylinders with outside Walschaerts valvegear it instead used three cylinders and Caprotti valvegear, with cam-actuated poppet valves. The Caprotti's valves opened fully more rapidly than piston valves, giving a sharp exhaust bite. The Caprotti company had recommended the use of a Kylchap blastpipe, to counter the adverse effects of this, but this had been ignored in favour of a Swindon-designed conventional double chimney, based on their experience with the King class. Given the sharpness of the blast, these Swindon principles had produced a relatively small blastpipe, with a double chimney of similarly small proportions. In service, Duke of Gloucester performed infamously poorly, with a reputation for poor steaming. It had a short service life, as a combination of both the rapid withdrawal of steam traction on British Rail and also its poor performance and a reluctance to expend effort in solving this. Duke of Gloucester was rescued from Barry scrapyard and an extensive restoration was required. During this restoration, the boiler draughting and ashpan air supply were both examined and found to be unexpectedly restrictive. These were assumed to be the root causes of the poor performance, which was borne out by the improved performance after both were remedied. Although the choke size of the chimneys was in proportion to the blastpipe, their overall size was a fraction of comparably sized boilers on the Merchant Navy pacifics and the A2 pacifics. Restoration involved constructing a pair of Kylchap blastpipes and chimney flue chokes. As well as improving draughting, these blastpipes also reduced back pressure on the cylinders, further improving efficiency.  US  = Union Pacific Railroad= Union Pacific No. 4014, Union Depot Several late steam era designs on the Union Pacific Railroad, particularly those designed during Otto Jabelmann's time as the railroad's chief mechanical officer; used double chimneys. The FEF-3, the third and final iteration of the Union Pacific FEF Series were all built new with double chimneys. Like their British contemporaries, the double chimney caused issues in creating massive amounts of smoke which could block the engineer's view, as such the FEF-3's were soon equipped with elephant ear style smoke deflectors. Smoke deflectors would later be placed on all the other FEF locomotives, including those without double chimneys. Other Union Pacific designs to get double chimneys were the late-era articulated locomotives built for the railroad, including the final group of 1942 built Union Pacific Challenger locomotives and the entire run of Union Pacific Big Boy locomotives. While some Challenger and Big Boy locomotives were equipped with smoke deflectors, smoke was not as problematic on them as it was on the FEF class due to their much longer boilers. A handful of the double chimney equipped Challengers were diverted to the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad, from which they would later serve on the Clinchfield Railroad. The operational locomotives of the modern Union Pacific Steam Program, UP 844, UP 4014 and the now retired UP 3985 all retained their double chimney's in preservation. South America = L.D.Porta's Argentina = Steam locomotive Argentina, designed by Porta - 1969 Livio Dante Porta's experimental meter gauge locomotive Argentina was a 1948 rebuild of a former 4-6-2 into a 4-8-0. The locomotive incorporated a double chimney in addition to other improvements intended to improve steam flow and fuel consumption. Porta's exhaust designs ultimately evolved into the Lempor ejector. The experimental locomotive was a success, and other locomotives would be modified to include Porta's upgrades although not many received double chimneys like Argentina had. In the 1970's Porta designed a large locomotive to fit the North American Plate C loading gauge that was based on Argentina's design, including double chimneys. That locomotive was never built. Argentina was preserved in the Mate de Luna station in San Miguel de Tucuman, its current status is unknown with some reports suggesting it has since been scrapped.

A. Chakraborty. Publication The City of Brass was published by HarperCollins subsidiary HarperVoyager, on 14 November 2017. It is five- hundred and thirty-two pages long, features illustrations and maps, and is printed in hardcover and paperback, and available in digital download. The press release describes the story as \\"an imaginative alchemy of The Golem and the Jinni, The Grace of Kings, and Uprooted, in which the future of a magical Middle Eastern kingdom rests in the hands of a clever and defiant young con artist with miraculous healing gifts.\\" When asked about writing the novel in an interview for the Huffington Post, Chakraborty explains that it \\"began as a world-building experiment[;] the world that became The City of Brass‚Äìone I imagined djinn might have created by combining their nature and the influences of the particular human societies they lived amongst. It became a game with history and folklore providing the rules: I had to abide by what existed, but could imagine beyond that. For example, we have a few mentions of the Prophet Suleiman punishing djinn but not much beyond that. So, I tried to imagine what happened next: how that might have shaped their religion and politics... as well as dividing them.\\" =Contents= The book is set in an alternative 18th century Middle-East, and follows Nahri, a talented con woman who uses palm reading and sleight of hand to swindle Ottoman nobles. During an exorcism in Cairo, she summons a djinn warrior named Darayavahoush e-Afshin, \\"Dara\\" for short. Nahri is taken on a journey where she meets spirits and monsters, and grows close with Dara. Reception The novel was listed in Best Books of the Year by multiple media outlets, such as Library Journal, Vulture.com, The Verge and SyfyWire. In a review in the New York Times, columnist Suzanne Joinson says \\"it's clear that Chakraborty has great fun alluding to these tales,\\" and continues \\"most enjoyable is the gusto with which everything is thrown into her story, from massacres to zombies to djinns.\\" A review by Paul Di Filippo in Locus compares the novel with One Thousand and One Nights in terms of its imagery and storylines, and summarizes by writing \\"with its blend of royal politesse, djinnish magic, human loves and fears, and Middle Eastern Machiavellianism, The City of Brass offers pleasures worthy of Scheherazade.\\" Mahvesh Murad writes at Tor.com, \\"to most (western?) readers whose only experience of the djinn is Disney, The City of Brass is going to be a lush, entertaining fable inspired by Middle Eastern and Islamic folklore that has just enough familiar elements to not be considering worrying alien, and yet is exotic enough to thrill and entice and tick off diversity boxes in the right way.\\" The City of Brass was a finalist for several science fiction and fantasy awards, including the Crawford Award, Locus Award, British Fantasy Award, World Fantasy Award, and won the Booknest.eu award for best Debut Novel. Chakraborty narrowly missed the final ballot for the John W. Campbell award by a single vote.

It has between five and seven leaves in a fan-like arrangement on each shoot and a large number of pinkish flowers arranged in whorls of between eight and ten around the flowering stem. It is endemic to Queensland. Description Oberonia rimachila is an epiphytic or lithophytic, clump forming herb with between five and seven fleshy, sword-shaped, green to reddish leaves long and wide with their bases overlapping. A large number of pinkish or translucent, non-resupinate flowers about long and wide are arranged in whorls of between eight and ten on an arching or hanging flowering stem long. The sepals and petals are elliptic to egg-shaped, about long and wide. The labellum is about long and wide with three lobes. Flowering occurs between February and June. Taxonomy and naming Oberonia rimachila was first formally described in 2006 by David Jones and Mark Clements who published the description in Australian Orchid Research. The type specimen was collected from Mount Tozer in the Iron Range National Park. The specific epithet (rimachila) is derived from the Latin word rima meaning \\"cleft\\" or \\"fissure\\" and the Ancient Greek word cheilos meaning \\"lip\\" or \\"rim\\", referring to the shape of the pit on the labellum. Distribution and habitat The channelled fairy orchid usually grows on trees and rocks in rainforest, sometimes in other humid, sheltered places such as mangroves and coastal scrub.

Since 1989, Dave Miller has resided in Memphis, Tennessee. History Dave Miller has been playing music, performing, and writing songs for 5 decades (1964‚Äì present). He has played in taverns, dance halls, concert venues, festivals, showcases, and coffee houses from coast to coast across the United States and in British Columbia. Notably, Dave and some of his friends formed a bluegrass trio that played around his hometown of Little Rock, Arkansas, and subsequently moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, in 1976. The influences of the swing and two-stepping dance crowds and the great bands of the area that packed the dance floors, left a lasting impression on him. By 1977, keeping their homespun bluegrass and hillbilly roots, but adding swing, country rock, and western flavored ballads to their sound, they had named the band Gumbo because of the spicy mixture of so many types of music and instrumental combinations that the band had come to offer. Throughout their tenure (1977‚Äì1982), Gumbo was a popular circuit band in Arkansas, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas, but played venues from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, to Fort Nelson, British Columbia, and all points in between, drawing big, enthusiastic crowds wherever they performed‚Äîeven as the opening act for such performers as Brenda Lee, Jerry Jeff Walker, and Michael Martin Murphey. In late 1978, the members of Gumbo moved to Alamosa, Colorado, and became a foundational piece of the vibrant and unique music scene that is still playing, creating, and recording a unique brand of Americana music in Colorado and Northern New Mexico. It was there that Dave Miller met Don Richmond, a fellow picker, writer, and performer who is now the Owner and Producer for Howlin‚Äô Dog Studios, where Dave has recorded much of his original music. In 2013, after taking a long break from the road, enjoying family life, and having a successful career designing and developing medical products, Dave returned to his roots in performing, songwriting, and entered the world of recording. In late 2016, Dave and his cousin Frank Cox decided to form Rocktown Revival as a way to deliver Dave's original music as well as songs from some of the greatest American artists to folks who, like themselves, love the revival of roots-based music. In addition to Dave Miller, Rocktown Revival includes veterans Frank Cox on guitar, Leslie McBryde on vocals, Bill Thurman on fiddle, Bill McCumber on bass, and B.J. Davis on drums. Their 40+ year careers, much of it playing together, have included forays into the roots of country and folk rock, foundational Americana, driving banjo-fueled bluegrass, as well as blues and rockabilly‚Äîwith some jazz even thrown in for good measure. Influences Dave Miller began playing music at age 13 when his mother bought him a five-string banjo for Christmas the year his father passed away. He would tune it up and play along with the country and bluegrass stars who performed on the Saturday afternoon music shows. He sometimes jokes that it was the great Earl Scruggs himself who taught Dave to play the banjo‚ÄîDave sitting on his sofa in Little Rock, Earl in the television studio in Nashville. Dave joined his first band, The 49ers, shortly thereafter in 1964 at the age of 14. Over time, Levon Helm, Merle Haggard, Delbert McClinton, Guy Clark, and John Prine all came to influence him. Current activity In November 2016, in collaboration with, and as a tribute to, his Gumbo bandmate Pat Hooper, Dave Miller released his first album, titled Just Flow: The Tribute Sessions. The recording of this album was started in Memphis, Tennessee, at Easley McCain Recording in 2013 and finished at Howlin' Dog Studios in Alamosa, Colorado, in 2016. Subsequently, in December 2017, Dave released an album of 12 of his original songs, titled Southern Dreams, which was also recorded at Howlin' Dog Studios. As Dave Miller recounts in the liner notes for the album: \\"We all have dreams. When we close our eyes to think about the future, sing a heartfelt song, kiss someone we love, drift into sleep, or pray for grace, we come face to face with our dreams. They give us a reason to hope, to work, to persevere, and to celebrate. We can travel through a dream world full of faces from the past, experiences we have imagined, magical landscapes, and flights through time. Sometimes we work and hope and nothing happens, and it hurts. Sometimes we get to live our dreams or something beyond even our wildest dreams. The songs you will find here are flavored with the spices, woven with the textures, and animated with the images that remind me of growing up, working, traveling, living, singing, and dreaming in the South and Southwest regions of our beautiful country. I hope these tunes take you down a path through some of your own dreams and experiences, make you tap your toes, grin a little bit, and sing along.\\" In October 2019, Dave Miller released another album featuring 12 of his original songs, titled Beauty Path. His first release to appear on the Howlin‚Äô Dog Records label, Beauty Path was recorded and engineered by Don Richmond at Howlin‚Äô Dog Studios in Alamosa, Colorado. The album was produced by both Don Richmond and Dave Miller. Nowadays, you can catch Dave playing around Memphis as part of the duo Mulberry Branch, along with fiddler Bill Thurman, or playing all over the Mid-South fronting Rocktown Revival, the six- piece band that Dave formed along with his cousin Frank Cox in late 2016 as a way to deliver Dave's original music as well as to perform songs from some of the greatest American artists for folks who, like themselves, love the revival of roots-based music. Collaborations In November 2016, in collaboration with, and as a tribute to, his Gumbo bandmate Pat Hooper, Dave Miller released his first album, titled Just Flow: The Tribute Sessions. Recording for this album was started in Memphis, Tennessee, at Easley McCain Recording and finished at Howlin' Dog Studios in Alamosa, Colorado. From late 2013 to early 2014, Dave and his long-time picking pal, Pat Hooper, decided to take some of their original tunes into the studio and create a record that reflected the joy they always found in playing and singing together. They began working with Davis McCain at Easley- McCain Studios, where they succeeded at capturing the rhythm, bass, and lead vocal tracks for the songs. Then tragically, on April 2, 2014, Pat passed away. As Dave Miller recounts in the liner notes for the album: \\"Pat and I played together for about 30 years, off and on, touring together in the hillbilly rock fusion band, Gumbo, in the late '70s and early '80s. Pat performed his entire adult life in countless combos, touring back-up bands, and traveling family shows, and played in venues across the U.S. and Canada. His sudden death broke the heart of the community that loved him so much. It also meant the tracks lay untouched for 2 years and the future of the project looked uncertain at best. Musician friends that I spoke to encouraged me to finish the project and offered their help‚ÄîGumbo bandmates, players who had traveled the same circuits, Pat‚Äôs friends. Without exception, these are premier players and singers that have decades of experience on stage and in the studio and who wanted to be a part of finishing what Pat and I had started.\\" Recording for the album was completed at Howlin' Dog Studios in late 2016.

Pole sports athletes include youths and para pole athletes. The first IPSF U.S. National Championships were held in 2015. At that time, the United States Pole Sports Federation (USPSF) was the federation representing American athletes. After the IPSF terminated the USPSF‚Äôs membership for failing to comply with rules and an ethical violation, American athletes were left without a national organization. The American Pole League formed to fill this void. The APL filed an application in 2016 and was officially recognized by the IPSF in 2017. The APL hosted their first national and open championships in 2018, the American Pole League Championship. That year, Jesse Weber (age 12) became the first male youth to compete for the United States. At the international level, APL athletes received important awards in 2018.

The disorder is called \\"dystrophy\\" instead of \\"degradation\\" to distinguish its genetic origin from other causes, such as age. OMD was first reported by Y. Miyake et al. in 1989.  Symptoms  An Amsler grid, as seen by a person with normal vision. Symptoms entail a loss of visual acuity in both eyes, including darkened vision, ring scotoma (ring of blindness close to the center of vision), color blindness, and difficulty with bright lights. The scotoma may cause text slightly away from the center of vision to disappear; the appearance would not be black (in early stages) but of the same color as the nearby background. Many lines of an Amsler grid would be faded or invisible to the patient. The area of invisibility on the Amsler grid spreads with time. Symptoms do not include headaches or eye pain. The loss of acuity tends to be symmetric between the eyes.  Etiology  OMD that is caused by mutations of the retinitis pigmentosa 1-like 1 (RP1L1) gene (OMIM 608581) is called Miyake's disease. While the mutation is dominant, OMD may manifest more strongly and earlier in children than in the parent (anticipation). However, cases have presented with no mutation to RP1L1. One study suggests that OMD arises because of two mutations arising simultaneously, one in RP1L1 and another in ABCA4. OMD is generally believed to be autosomal dominant, meaning that if you get the abnormal gene from only one parent, you can get the disease. However, this does not always seem to be the case. OMD differentiates from Stargardt macular dystrophy in which gene is mutated (RP1L1 instead of ABCA4), the process of OMD isn't a buildup of toxic lipofuscin, and Stargardt is regressive. = Physiology = The connection between these mutations and OMD is unclear, but cone density is significantly lower in patients with OMD compared to the general population. Use of adaptive optics to obtain high- resolution retinal images reveal abnormal changes in patients with OMD, including thinning of the foveal thickness and the outer nuclear layer and disruption of the IS/OS line and COST line.  Diagnosis  OMD returns negative results for a funduscopic inspection, fluorescein angiogram, and full-field electroretinogram (ERG), for both rod and cone components. The key to diagnosing this disorder is the multifocal ERG (mfERG), providing a single procedure for diagnosis. Onset is known to range from age 6 to 81, with about half of onsets occurring after age 65. = Differential diagnosis = A visual field test can differentiate between whether the reduced visual acuity is centered on the optic nerve or the fundus. Once a neurological problem has, therefore, been ruled out, the disorder's reduced visual acuity without visible fundus abnormalities may be misdiagnosed as optic neuritis, dominant optic atrophy, amblyopia, or nonorganic visual disorder. The combination of weak amplitudes in the mfERG with no visible fundus abnormalities then rules out other explanations. For example, OMD presents negative for a full-field ERG while retinitis pigmentosa presents abnormal.  Prognosis  Since the abnormality is not in the eye lens, the disease is not correctable with eyeglasses. Vision becomes dimmer over the course of years as the macula loses function. Eventually the patient may become legally blind. The peripheral vision field is preserved. In other words, OMD does not cause total blindness, due to the concentration of the degradation at the cone-rich (color-sensitive) region of the retina. No treatment is known to slow the progression. The speed of progression varies by case ‚Äî even between donor and recipient of the mutation ‚Äî and can last for 10 to 30 years.  Future research  Because of the rarity of OMD, no clinical trials are in the pipeline as of January 2019. However, mutations in RP1L1 might play a role in retinitis pigmentosa (RP), raising hope for a spillover effect for OMD patients should an RP1L1-related treatment be developed for RP. Given the possible relation between ABCA4 and OMD, progress with Stargardt disease via gene therapy might have a spillover effect for OMD patients as well. Adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors have been particularly successful in gene therapy of eyes and muscles. Unfortunately, their size is limited--too limited to hold the RP1L1 gene. Therefore, a non-viral approach would need to be developed for gene therapy to treat OMD. Since RP1 has the same size problem, a gene therapy for RP could have a spillover effect for OMD. A stem-cell approach might entail taking stem cells from the patient, editing the mutation with CRISR, and inserting the stem cells in the eye. However, as of 2014, researchers did not yet know if retinal stem cell surgery would work.  Prevalence  Prevalence is unknown, but seems to be elevated in Asian populations, given that most OMD studies are of Japanese and Korean subjects. Given that Stargardt's, the most common macular dystrophy, has a prevalence of 1 in 10,000 in the US, the prevalence of OMD is likely well below 1 in 100,000.

The work sought to analyze anarchism using Marxist methods.  Background  The composition of this work was developed in the years following the failed 1905 Russian Revolution; Stalin at this period of time adopted a strong Marxist ideology. The philosophy of anarchism played a significant role in Russian history, with numerous notable Russian anarchists, such as Mikhail Bakunin, Emma Goldman, Peter Kropotkin, and Leo Tolstoy. At the time anarchists in Georgia were engaged in an ideological campaign against Marxists in the Caucasus, and Stalin was made responsible for Bolshevik operations in the Caucasus region. History of publication The articles that became Anarchism or Socialism began as a series of newspaper articles written in Georgian. The first four articles were published in their original form in the daily Bolshevik newspaper ' (\\"New Life\\") published in Tbilisi, under the direction of Stalin, in June‚ÄìJuly 1906. The series continued to be published in ' (\\"Our Life\\") from February 1907 to its closure on 6 March 1907, and then in ' (\\"Time\\") in April 1907.

Products Black soldier fly larvae Currently, AgriProtein breeds black soldier fly larvae on food waste from a variety of sources including restaurants and supermarkets. After they pupate, the larvae are processed into MagMeal‚Ñ¢ - a sustainable, high quality protein that can be fed to all monogastric animals such as chickens, pigs, fish and pets. The company also produces an oil (MagOil‚Ñ¢) that can be used in aquaculture and pet food. MagOil‚Ñ¢ also presents a unique alternative to less sustainable oils such as palm oil. Lastly, the company produces an organic soil conditioning product called MagSoil‚Ñ¢. History AgriProtein was founded in 2008 to provide an ecologically sound replacement for fishmeal, which is increasingly expensive because of the depletion of fish stocks. The AgriProtein process is noteworthy in that it diverts organic waste from landfills. After consultation with a researcher at Stellenbosch University, a presentation at Tedx in 2011, and approximately five years of development, the company opened its first commercial factory in 2015 in Philippi, near Cape Town International Airport. They received $11 million in initial investment funding, including two grants from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Under a partnership instituted in February 2017 with , an Austrian engineering company, AgriProtein plans to establish standardised industrial-scale factories globally. In 2018, they raised $105 million in funding, the 18th largest recorded agricultural technology deal and the largest in the insect farming sector at the time, and agreed to buy Millibeter, a Belgian company in Turnhout.

Howardula aoronymphium is a species of nematode that infects specialist mushroom-feeding fruit flies such as Drosophila falleni and Drosophila neotestacea. Mated female nematodes pierce the fly larva cuticle and take up residence in the hemolymph (insect blood) where they mature alongside fly development. When the adult fly ecloses, the nematode motherworm has reached full size and sheds juvenile nematodes into the hemolymph which are eventually excreted by either the fly anus or ovipositor. Howardula nematodes can severely impact fly egg development, as infection can effectively sterilize some species. Howardula aoronymphium are attracted to mushroom sites by cuing in on specific odourants that are common in rotting mushrooms. However the odourants that attract H. aoronymphium to mushrooms are different from the odours that attract its fly host D. falleni. Yet when D. falleni are infected by H. aoronymphium, their olfactory preferences differ. Infected flies become more averse to acetate-containing compounds such as ethyl acetate or propyl acetate. Conversely, infected flies become more attracted to 1-nonanol. Howardula aoronymphium can be compared to other insect-infecting nematodes such as Steinernema and Heterorhabiditis. These nematodes are used as biological control agents, as they efficiently kill their insect prey within days after infection. However unlike these nematodes, Howardula aoronymphium requires its host fly to survive into adulthood.

He is known particularly as a researcher for Edward Baines's history of Lancashire. Life Butterworth was the tenth and youngest child of the topographer James Butterworth, and was born at Pitses, near Oldham, in 1812. He followed in the footsteps of his father, whom he assisted in his later works, but was more given to statistical research. When Edward Baines undertook the preparation of a history of Lancashire, he found a useful colleague in Edwin Butterworth, who visited many parts of the county in order to collect the requisite particulars. During the six years in which he was engaged by Edward Baines he travelled on foot through nearly every town and village in the county. His own notes and those of his father formed a large mass of manuscript material. Later researchers have noted that Butterworth not only provided material for Baines's history of Lancashire, but also, without acknowledgement, wrote most of the text. He wrote local history books, which produced little remuneration; his main income was as a journalist, acting as correspondent for several Manchester newspapers. He was for a considerable time registrar of births and deaths for the township of Chadderton. In 1847 Butterworth conceived the idea of publishing a history of Lancashire in fifty volumes, based on his extensive notes; each volume, while part of the general series, would also be complete in itself. This project was encouraged by the Earl of Ellesmere. Overtures were made to Samuel Bamford, as it was thought that his pleasant style and Butterworth's facts would make a popular combination. The suggestion was roughly treated by the Earl, and Butterworth's death occurred before such a plan could have been completed. He is described by those who knew him as genial and modest. Butterworth died, unmarried, of typhoid fever on 19 April 1848. He was buried at Greenacres cemetery in Oldham, and in 1859 a monument to his memory was erected there by public subscription. Such of his books and manuscripts (including material inherited from his father) as had not been accidentally dispersed were purchased by the Platt Brothers, and by them presented to the town. They are now in Oldham Local Studies and Archives. Publications Butterworth published: * Biography of Eminent Natives, Residents, and Benefactors of the Town of Manchester (Manchester, 1829) * A History of Oldham in Lancashire (London, 1832) * A Chronological History of Manchester brought down to 1834 (second edition, Manchester, 1834; the first edition was the Tabula Mancuniensis of his father) * An Historical Description of the Town of Heywood and Vicinity (Heywood, 1840) * A Statistical Sketch of the County Palatine of Lancaster (London, 1841) * An Historical Account of the Towns of Ashton-under-Lyne, Stalybridge, and Dukinfield (Ashton, 1842) * Views of the Manchester and Leeds Railway, drawn from nature and on stone by A.

Their first book together, Tax Revolt: Something for Nothing in California, published in 1982, was an analysis of the 1978 California Proposition 13. In a review for Political Science Quarterly, Alvin Rabushka suggested, \\"the book says virtually nothing about the effects of Proposition 13 on the state's economy, its public services, or its political and judicial processes.\\" He added that \\"their obsession with symbolic racism is wholly unwarranted, both analytically and from a public policy perspective,\\" and he concluded by dismissing the book as \\"hard to read, because it is written in the language of social psychology and social science jargon.\\" In American Identity and the Politics of Multiculturalism, published in 2014, Citrin and Sears studied multiculturalism in relation to civic nationalism versus nativism and patriotism versus chauvinism, and found that most American citizens were patriotic civic nationalists.

The Bagaha Copperplate inscription is a documented record of donation of a village inscribed on a copper plate in 1020 CE. This was commissioned during the rule of King Suryaditya. It is one of the earliest known documented found written in Sanskrit. Moreover, this early Medieval Indian inscription is one of the oldest copperplate obtained in northern region of India. This was obtained from Bagaha, West Champaran, Bihar by S. V. Sohni in 1962.  Description  This inscription is written in 33 rows. Copperplate size is 39.8 cm (Width) x 38.5 (length). The inscription is written in Sanskrit language with the ancient style of Devanagari script. Two lines are inscribed at the backside of the copperplate. This copperplate inscription describes about a land donation that was commissioned by King Suryaditya, who was descended of King MƒÅlyaketu. From the details of inscription it is known that the name of King Suryaditya's father was King HansarƒÅja and grandfather was King HelarƒÅjƒÅ VƒÅrƒÅha. It is mentioned that the king had donated the village named Vanapalli to a Brahmin named Ya≈õƒÅditya. According to inscription, the village of Vanapallƒ´ is located in the region named VyƒÅlisi-vi·π£ya, which is located in the zone named Darda- Gandaki Ma·πá·∏çala. A Brahmin named Ya≈õƒÅditya, the recipient of this donation, is said to be born in SƒÅvar·πáya gotra (clan) and is son of Va·π≠·π≠ho and grandson ƒÄ·∏çavi. They were native residents of a village named Usiya and originally belonged to a village named Cela. The day of donation is mentioned as Friday, the 14th day of the bright fortnight of first lunar month of Chaitra in Vikram Samvat 1077. As per the gregorian calendar this date corresponds to 11 March 1020 CE.  Geographical place-names identified in inscription  From this copper it is evident that in the 10th century this region was named as Darda- Gandaki. The Sanskrit word darda means 'mountain'. At present, the area of Bagaha is located on the banks of Gandaki in the lowland region of the Himalayas, so it is natural for the area to be called Darda- Gan·∏çki Ma·πá·∏çala in the 10th century. The inscription mentions about a Brahmin named Yashaditya as the recipient of donated village named Vanapalli. The Sanskrit word palli means ‚Äòvillage‚Äô. At present, the area of Bagaha has the only forest sanctuary called Valmiki Tiger Reserve located in Valmiki Nagar area. There are many small villages still existing within the forest area of Valmiki Nagar. It is possible that one of such villages was given in donation. The term vyƒÅlisi- vi·π£aya mentioned in this inscription appears to be an administrative term. It might be an under which forty two administrative units were governed. In the textual sources of medieval India, the Dard-Gandaki Ma·πá·∏çala was mentioned in various scriptures and pilgrim-related texts under the name of Tƒ´r-bhukta (current name Tirhut). As the rivers used to play an important role in the identification and naming of a place in ancient times, Tƒ´r-bhukta was the region of western shore of Gandaki river, which was expanded till its confluence with the Ganges, at present day Sonpur in Vaishali district of Bihar. As this area was located (Snk. bhukta) on the banks (Snk. tƒ´r) of the Gandaki, its name was given Tƒ´ra-bhukta. The present name of this region, Tirhut, is Apabhra·πÉ≈õa of its Sanskrit name Tƒ´ra-bhukta.  Linguistic description of the place-names and peoples-name mentioned in the inscription  In this copperplate inscription: * The name of recipient Brahmin (Ya≈õƒÅditya), the donor king (Suryaditya) and the name of king's ancestors (MƒÅlyaketu, HelarƒÅjƒÅ VƒÅrƒÅha, HansarƒÅj) are mentioned in Sanskrit. * The names of ancestors of the recipient Brahmin (ƒÄ·∏çvaƒ´, Va·π≠·π≠ho) are in Prakrit. * Details of the places-names related to the donated village (Vanapallƒ´ , VyƒÅlisi-vi·π£ya, Darda-Gan·∏çki Ma·πá·∏çala) are in Sanskrit. * The names of the places related to the residence (Usiya, Cela) of the recipient Brahmin are in Prakrit.  Other local references  According to the genealogical records of the villagers of Pathkauli village, located in Bagaha, West Champaran, Bihar, in the 12th century, this area was governed by low local Brahmin brothers, Damodar Pathak and Bhupal Pathak. Their mortuary shrines are still under worship at Braham Stan of Pathkauli and at Rajgadhi shrine in the village of Naurangia, near Valmiki Nagar. People of Tharu community worship the shrine of Bhupal Pathak as chaurƒÅ, a small mound built of mud.

Suffragette activity  From at least 1911, Macfarlane, a trained nurse, had started working for the cause of women's suffrage. In 1911, when Emmeline Pankhurst embarked on a speaking tour of Scotland, Macfarlane helped to co- organise a \\"crowded\\" public meeting in St Andrews, which was chaired by the secretary of the St Andrews branch of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. Her increasingly militant advocacy for women's suffrage led to her arrest in London in November 1911, at the age of 23. She was charged with breaking one of the largest windows in London at the office of the Hamburg America Line at Cockspur Street, valued at ¬£104, and sentenced in March 1912 to four months in HM Prison Holloway. She was one of 68 women who added their signatures or initials to The Suffragette Handkerchief embroidered by prisoners in Holloway in March 1912, and kept until 1950 by Mary Ann Hilliard, and still available to view at the Priest House West Hoathly. Macfarlane refused to eat in prison and was regularly force fed until her release at the end of June 1912. Her weight, she said, dropped from 7st 5lb on her entry to prison to 6st 6lb on her release. She later described her experience of force feeding: Macfarlane continued her political work on her release, appearing in court again in January 1913 on charges of breaking a window of the Home Office and doing damage worth ¬£2. She was ordered to pay the damage and a fine of 40 shillings.

Life and education  After graduating from public school, he began training as a pharmacist at Chiba medical school, now Chiba University, in 1918. After graduating in 1921, he joined the pharmaceutical company Momotani Juntenkan. The company hired him as an assistant to the chemist Nishizawa Y≈´shichi of the Imperial University of Tokyo, where he was taught by Ikeda Kikunae. In the summer of the same year, he followed Nishizawa for a short stay at the Tohoku Imperial University to learn organic chemistry from Majima Rik≈ç. Here he then began research in this field of thanks to a scholarship from the company Ajinomoto, which he completed in 1925. From 1930 he held lectures under Majima and obtained the doctoral degree in 1931. From 1932 to 1935 he began further studies abroad. After his return, Akabori became assistant professor at Osaka University, in 1939 full professor, in 1947 dean of the faculty of natural sciences, in 1949 dean of the new faculty for Liberal Arts. In 1953 he gained the additional title of Professor of the newly-founded Institute for applied Microbiology at the University of Tokyo. From 1958 he was the Director of the \\"Protein-Institute\\" (, \\"Tanpakushitsu Kenky≈´jo\\") at Osaka University. Beginning in 1960, Akabori served two terms as rector of the University.

He died in Shizuoka Prefecture on November 3, 1992.  Work  Akabori's main research focus was on the chemistry of amino acids and proteins, as well as the biochemistry of their oxidation processes. As a result he developed in a method for the reduction of Œ±-amino acids to Œ±-aminoaldehydes (Akabori reduction) in 1931, and in 1943 a synthesis of amino-alcohols (Akabori synthesis). In 1952 he reported a method for determination of C-terminal amino acids in proteins by their reaction with hydrazine. In this case, all amino acids (except the C-terminal one) are transformed into Hydrazides. In 1955 he received the prize of Japanese Academy of Sciences and ten years later the Japanese Order of Culture. The same year, Akabori was recognized as a Person of Cultural Merit and a year later he became an honorary citizen of his hometown. In 1975 Akabori received the Order of the Sacred Treasure.

In her childhood she was adopted following the deaths of her parents, and was noted for aiding in household chores and attending Mass on a regular basis. But she was better known for having been murdered after rejecting the sexual advances of Raimundo Alves Riberio, who was around her age, in order to protect herself as being chaste as she desired. She defended herself even to the point of Riberio killing her, using a machete that he carried on his person. Her beatification cause launched in 2013 and she became titled as a Servant of God. The cause had been initiated in order to determine whether she had died \\"in defensum castitatis\\", to defend her chaste nature as a virgin. Her beatification was scheduled to be celebrated on 21 October 2020 but in June 2020 was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Life Benigna Cardoso da Silva was born in Oiti on 15 October 1928 as the last of four children to Jos√© Cardoso da Silva and Teresa Maria da Silva. Her siblings were: * Carm√©lia * Alderi * Cirineu Her father died sometime before her birth and her mother died around the time she turned one. It was following this that the sisters Rosa and Honorina Sisnando adopted Benigna and her siblings. In her childhood she liked to take walks with her siblings or have picnics whenever she could, in between her taking care of the household chores; she was likewise a regular attendee at Mass and was known for her great devotion to her faith. There are no photographs of her, but contemporaries have said that Benigna was of medium height and was slender in addition to having a rounded face and a thin chin. It is also described that she had brown eyes and brown hair, and a slight strabismus in one eye. In 1941 when she was twelve Raimundo Alves Riberio - known as Raul, who was around her age - approached her sexually, though she rejected each of his advances. In concern she sought the guidance of her parish priest, Cristiano Coelho Rodrigues, on the matter, to which her priest advised her to resist Riberio. Riberio insisted on his advances following this; but Benigna continued to reject him, causing Riberio to grow frustrated with her repeated refusals. Just one week after she turned thirteen she went to go and get water in an isolated area which Riberio knew. That afternoon, on 24 October 1941, he hid in the bushes waiting for her to arrive and then jumped out and attempted to grab her. Benigna continued resisting him, which further infuriated Riberio to the point that he took out his machete to attack her in a rage. He struck her four times using the machete. The first blow removed three fingers from her right hand and the second struck her in the forehead. The third strike was in the stomach and the fourth was the fatal strike to her neck that killed her at once; Benigna died there at 4:00pm. Riberio fled after realizing what he had just done, and moments later her brother Cirineu - who had gone out looking for her - discovered her bloodied remains. Her funeral and burial took place on 25 October concurrent to the authorities investigating the murder. The police apprehended those considered to be suspects, including Cirineu; these individuals were released after Riberio was arrested. Riberio served his sentence in prison and then in 1991 returned to the scene of the crime, where he expressed his regret at having murdered Benigna. Her remains were later relocated on 26 May 2012 to the Santana do Cariri parish church. Beatification process In 2011 initial steps were started in order to launch a possible beatification process in the Crato diocese. The formal introduction to the cause came on 31 January 2013 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the \\"nihil obstat\\" (no objections) decree, titling Benigna as a Servant of God. This news was received in Crato just a couple of weeks later, therefore allowing the diocese to initiate a diocesan process to investigate her life, in addition to the circumstances surrounding her death, in order to ascertain if she died \\"in defensum castitatis\\" (if she died to protect herself as a chaste virgin during the attack). The diocesan process was opened on 16 March 2013 and concluded just a few months later on 21 September; the evidence was sent to the C.C.S. in Rome, leading to them validating the process as having complied with their guidelines for conducting causes. The official Positio dossier was presented to the C.C.S. in June 2018 for assessment. Theologians issued their approval to the cause on 24 October 2018. Pope Francis approved her beatification in a decree issued on 2 October 2019; her beatification was scheduled for 21 October 2020 but in June 2020 was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. The current postulator for this cause is Dr. Vittorio Capuzza.

From the beginning of the 20th century, she became increasingly involved in the women's movement, especially the cause for women's voting rights. Biography Born on 25 March 1858 in Hj√∏rring, Charlotte Juliane Sofie Hansen was the daughter of the cattle dealer Lars M√∏ller Jensen (1829‚Äì1905) and Anna Katrine Mettelmann (1831‚Äì1920). As a child, she was already a keen poet, filling her drawers with her own works. After attending a girls' school in Hj√∏rring and learning languages at home, when she was 20 she married the editor Jacob Peter Martinus Julius Eilersgaard (1855‚Äì1905). As an author, she wrote mainly epic novels and plays, many of which were performed in Copenhagen or in Denmark's larger cities. One of the most successful was J√¶germesterinden which was first published as a novel in 1907 but was then dramatised for Folketeatret. It tells the story of a young woman who persuades her parents, a hunter and a housekeeper, to resolve their family problems by getting married. Her work as an editor began in 1898 when the couple moved to Middelfart where she edited the Aarup Avis. She joined the Red Cross, heading the local women's branch. In 1903, she became president of the Middelfart branch of the newly established Danish Women's Society (Dansk Kvindesamfund) where she promoted voting rights as the organization's main concern. She was therefore somewhat concerned when the National Association for Women's Suffrage (Landsforbundet for Kvinders Valgret) established a local chapter there. In 1904, she attended the International Council of Women's conference in Berlin where she presented a paper on Die Frauenbewegung in Skandinavien. When Denmark granted women the vote in 1915, unlike Gyrithe Lemche, she supported the integration of women into the existing political parties rather than creating new ones specially for women. For the rest of her life, Charlotte Eilersgaard continued to publish a play or a novel each year, some of which were translated into other languages. She died on 9 May 1922 in Helsing√∏r's old people's home Montebello. She is buried in Middelfart.

In the Zinnfigurenklause, historical events are depicted by small tin figures and further explained with pictures. Eugen Keidel, mayor of Freiburg, made the first floor of the Schwabentor available to Lehmann in 1969. At that time, the Schwabentor was unutilized and in need of rehabilitation. The second floor of the Schwabentor would be later used by Lehmann as well. The city of Freiburg bought twelve of the dioramas that Lehmann had created in the years leading up to 1985. Lehmann administered the Zinnfigurenklause between 1985 and 1989. After he died in 1989 in the age of 80, Andreas M√ºller, who had previously filled in for Lehmann while he was absent, took charge of the museum in the meantime. On November 2, 1989, M√ºller founded a society for the promotion of the Zinnfigurenklause of which he acted as chairman. In December 1989, the city of Freiburg made M√ºller responsible for the care of the collection. The city of Freiburg does not charge rent for the museum's rooms, and pays for lighting, heating and cleaning. The Zinnfigurenklause is a private museum and independent of other urban museums. However, these museums have representation in the society for promotion founded by M√ºller. After Andreas M√ºller retired in 2008, Volkmar Vogt, head of the Freiburg Archive of Social Movements (Archiv Soziale Bewegungen) took charge of the management of the Zinnfigurenklause. Martin Wiebel is the chairman of the society for the promotion of the Zinnfigurenklause in the Schwabentor. Volkmar Vogt is a member of the extended board of the society.

Collection Castles in the second floor The collection of the museum consists of 9000 tin figures in 21 dioramas which, among other scenes, depict the Battle of Sempach in 1386 (which makes up for 1150 of the figures), a battle from the Swabian-Swiss War of 1499, the German Peasant's War of 1525 that took place in the Black Forest region of Germany, the siege of the K√ºssaburg/Oberlauchringen, the events of the Badische Revolution and a siege from War of the Spanish Succession. Furthermore, there are diorama with castles of the Hochrhein und Oberrhein, the hunting of witches, and the examination of Martin Luther in Worms. Many of the tin figures are threatened by Tin pest and must be occasionally recast and repainted.

He plays 6-string bass guitars.  Life and work Liebig grew up in Los Angeles and was influenced as a child by rock and blues music of the 1960s. He first started playing jazz in highschool. He started experimenting with different sounds in college and between 1974 and 1976 he belonged to John Beasley's band. At the age of 19, he played rhythm guitar for the soul jazz pianist and singer Les McCann, with whom he worked on 4 albums. In 1979 he left McCann's band to attend California State University, where he studied classic double bass, music history, and composition until 1983. After he graduated, he created the fusion band, BLOC, with Nels Cline. He also played with Julius Hemphill's JAH- Band along with Alex Cline and Bill Frisell. He spent a lot of time playing with musicians in Los Angeles that were interested in freely improvised music. Afterwards, he busied himself with his own classical compositions. After the breakup of the BLOC in 1991, he played one tour with Michael Penn, but then decided to focus on improvised music and composition. He formed the group, Quartetto Stig, with violin, trumpet, drum s and contrabass guitar (6-string electric bass). With this group, his compositions began to come to life. Additionally, they recorded three albums, 1993 Hommages Obliques, 1995 Lingua Oscura, and 1997 Pienso Oculto, through Vinny Golia's Nine Wind Records. Afterwards he disbanded Quartetto Stig and worked on the creation of Stigtette (flute, clarinet, trombone, and contrabass guitar) and The Mentones (alto saxophone, harmonica, drums, and contrabass guitar), the worked on music from American folk blues, but in the language of free jazz. Additionally, he created a trio including himself, Vinny Golia, and drummer Billy Mintz. With this trio he worked on two albums for Candence Jazz Records, No Train 1999 and Antipodes 2001. In 1999, he worked with percussionist Gregg Bendian and Nels Cline on Myriad. In 2001, he worked on a longer composition titled Pomegranate for his third stream band, Kammerstig, that was influenced by Igor Stravinksy. On the same album, he played with other musicians such as Nels Cline, Mark Dresser, Jeff Gauthier, Vinny Golia, Ellen Burr, and Tom Varner. After 2000, the following albums emerged: The Mentones' Locustland and Nowhere Calling, Minim's Quicksilver, Stigtette's Delta, as well as the kelpland Serenades with Anna Homler, and the album On the Cusp of Fire and Water with Vinny Golia and Michael Vatcher. In 2000, he collaborated with Gregg Bendian, Jeff Gauthier, and G.E. Stinson on the album, Bone Structure, released in 2003. Recorded live in the studio, it was a collection of twelve 'songs' showcasing collective improvisation that DownBeat magazine gave four stars.https://cryptogramophone.com/reviews/nojs/2001/teaser Aside from his ensemble work, he also wrote music for improvised chamber ensembles, including for: The Meninas Quartet (2005‚Äì2006), Second Practicca Quintet (2000‚Äì2005), for the electric jazz band Lane Ends Merge Left (1997‚Äì2005), a few pieces for solo contrabass guitar, some longer pieces for his ensemble Kammerstig, as well as for Panharmonicon (2005‚Äì2006). In 2006, Liebig worked with guitarist G. E Stinson and the Tee-Tot Quartet by Joseph Berardi (percussion), Dan Clucas (cornet), and Scot Ray (dobro). In 2008, he published the Tee-Tot Quartet's album, Always Outnumbered, which was a mix of blues, rock and roll, bop, swing, and free jazz music. The album was influenced by Charles Mingus, Robert Johnson, Louis Armstrong, Muddy Waters, and Skip James. In 2018 he released \\"Last Call\\"https://orendarecords.com/orenda0056 with Men-Tot Six (a combination of the Mentones and Tee-Tot Quartet), and Nomads http://pfmentum.com/product/emily-hay-steuart-liebig-duo-nomads-pfmcd118/ with flutist/vocalis Emily Hay. In 2005, he was named a bassist deserving wider recognition in the DownBeat poll, and in 2008 he was nominated for the Alpert Awards in the Arts.

I. Qadir, is a Pakistani pharmaceutical scientist.  Life and education  Qadir received his early education from Shujabad, Multan. He received his B.Pharm degree from Bahauddin Zakariya University, Multan, Pakistan. Later he attended Quaid-i- Azam University, Islamabad and received his Ph.D degree in subject of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. He worked in the College of Pharmacy, Government College University (Faisalabad). He then became a researcher and professor at Bahauddin Zakariya University, Multan, Pakistan. There, he is heading \\"Phage Therapy & Drug Design Laboratory\\" of Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology.  Research contributions  # Qadir test: Qadir invented a medical test, known as the Qadir test, for diagnosis of cancer. The approach takes a few hours using standard laboratory equipment for the analysis of plasma lipids (triglycerides, cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol) and a change in the lipid profile is used as marker for diagnosis of cancer. A number of prospective studies were carried out by the researcher by taking fasting blood samples of study subjects from all the major four types of cancers: carcinomas, sarcomas, lymphomas, and leukemias. # Qadirvirtide and Qadir-C30: His work also includes invention of anti-HIV drugs, Qadirvirtide and Qadir-C30. These are fusion inhibitors that may be used as prophylaxis or for the treatment of AIDS. These are synthetic peptides composed of 36 and 30 amino acids respectively. These block the entry of HIV genome into human CD4 cells by binding to HR1 region of spike protein of HIV, so that the virus can not come close to the human cell membrane and ultimately fusion of the viral envelope with human cell membrane is prevented. # Qadir theory of cancer etiology: He has posed that viruses are the cause of cancer, the idea was presented as a theory of cancer etiology. He postulated that \\"Viruses are the causative agents of cancer: 100% of cancer patients contain virus/es in their body which are responsible for the cancer.\\" He also argued that some studies have opposed the idea, but he rejected them because laboratory methods were not used to detect viruses in those studies. The theory was concluded with the point that, in near future, viruses will be isolated from all cancer patients as causative agent of a specific cancer. # Qadirphages: He discovered local bacteriophages to be used as anti-bacterial products which were named as Qadirphages. The evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria has increased research in the field of therapies to search alternative methods to control the infections. Qadir isolated local phages, characterized them and found their antibacterial activities. The phages showed maximum propagation at 37¬∞C indicating that these work best at human body temperature. SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed the presence of protein cover and showed the various bands ranging from 10 to 200 kDa. Nucleic acid analysis confirmed the presence of RNA with a size of approximately 20 kb. Transmission electron microscopy indicated that the isolated phages belonged to Siphoviridae, Leviviridae, and Podoviridae families. # Fungal Research: He also discovered new genes in local fungi which are involved in curing skin diseases caused by these local fungi. # QadirVID-19: He designed a fusion inhibitor for specific treatment of COVID-19, which was named as QadirVID-19. This drug is a synthetic peptide composed of 30 amino acids of Heptad Repeat 2 (HR2) region of spike protein of 2019-nCoV. # Medicinal Plant Research: He has established the use of many local plants in the treatment of cancer, jaundice, hepatitis, hypertension, asthma, diabetes, and infectious diseases of bacterial and fungal origin. # Anticancer techniques: Qadir has contributed to different anticancer techniques including the use of androgen deprivation therapy to cure prostate cancer, synthetic peptides in liver cancer management, the CRISPR/Cas9 gene targeting for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), IGF-1R blockers in prostate and colon carcinomas, and nanoparticles for cancer management. # Publications: He has published more than 600 research articles,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/M_Qadir near 200 of them published in highly indexed journals. He has also written 15 medical books. # Mentorship: He is an HEC approved supervisor for PhD research in Pakistan. He is editor of many scientific journals. He has contributed in health-related community awareness programs. He has worked on phonetics and gave an idea that an alphabet should be pronounced exactly as it is pronounced in a word.  Awards and recognition  Qadir was named best young research scholar by Higher Education Commission of Pakistan, and Productive Scientist of Pakistan, by Pakistan Council for Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology (Pakistan). He received the Research Productivity Award, by Pakistan Council for Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology (Pakistan). He has also received a gold medal in the field of biotechnology from Pakistan Academy of Sciences (PAS).  Fellowships and membership  Qadir is a Fellow of The Linnean Society of London, UK. He is a member of the American Society for Microbiology the International Dermoscopy Society (IDSS), Italy, and the French Society for Cell Biology. He is also member of other healthcare-related global societies.

It is developed by Delhi Development Authority (DDA) with the technical help of Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystems (CEMDE), University of Delhi. It serves as an ideal alternative habitat for migratory and resident bird species. It also is designed to conserve the wild genetic resources of agricultural crops and enhance groundwater recharge and augment freshwater availability. History Delhi has 7,884 hectares of fragmented forests which are deprived of wild animals due to the unplanned urbanisation and of the 400 wetlands fewer than 3 or 4 were left. In 2015, Delhi already had Aravalli Biodiversity Park and Yamuna biodiversity park. Delhi Development Authority (DDA) engaged the scientist of Delhi University to develop four more biodiversity parks in Delhi, including the Northern ridge biodiversity park (Kamla Nehru Ridge), Tilpath valley biodiversity park, Neelahauz biodiversity park and phase-2 of the Yamuna Biodiversity Park. Phase-I of Yamuna biodiversity park focused on barren floodplains commenced in 2005 and phase-2 focused on the active floodplains commenced in 2015. Restoration In 2005 restoration of floodplains of Yamuna commenced, which had been lying barren due to sodic soil making it difficult for plants to grow. In Phase-I, 157 acres ecosystem was restored by developing two wetlands, a grassland and forest communities. Native plant species were reintroduced to reduce the salt content in the soil.Government takes steps to restore biodiversity of Kamala Nehru ridge, Millennium Post, 14 oct 2014. The pH level (scale of acidity) of the soil was not neutral and detrimental to the success of the native Indian plants. Researchers form Delhi University had to plant one specific species of grass that brought the pH level from 10 to seven (neutral) level.From barren land to rich ecosystem: Story behind Yamuna Biodiversity Park, The Indian Express, 23 May 2019. =Flora= According to prof. C R Babu of Delhi University, initially only mongooses, lizards and 31 species of birds were there in the park up until 2004. By 2014 the biodiversity park already had 900 species of native plants.

The plot concerns a fairy princess, Cherestani, whose marriage to a mortal Farruscad was opposed and given a curse-like condition by her father the fairy king Demogorgon. Farruscad is made to swear never to curse his wife Cherestani, no matter what she does. If he does, she will be transformed into a snake for 200 years.Gallagher Metamorphosis p.285 The play was adapted as a children's TV film, broadcast Rete 1, 26 March 1976, directed by :it:Alessandro Brissoni, starring Ave Ninchi, Carlo Bagno, Enrico Osterman and Gianni Bortolotto.Aldo Grasso Enciclopedia della televisione Garzanti 1996 p.223 Opera settings The fable was the basis for Wagner's Die Feen (1833) and Casella's La donna serpente (1932), but not - as sometimes incorrectly reported - Friedrich Heinrich Himmel's 1806 opera Die Sylphen which is based on another Gozzi fable, La Zobeide.Katherine Rae Syer Wagner's Visions: Poetry, Politics, and the Psyche in the Operas2014 1580464823 \\"Koch reiterates, for instance, the error found in Glasenapp's Wagner biography that Friedrich Heinrich Himmel's 1806 opera Die Sylphen is another operatic treatment of Gozzi's La donna serpente.

Taxonomy  A population once described as subspecies Nyctophilus timoriensis major, placed with Nyctophilus timoriensis, a taxon which was revised and separated when it was found to contain cryptic species. The first description was published by John Edward Gray in 1844. A revision of the genus in 2009 elevated the taxon to species. A treatment describing subspecies separates a population as Nyctophilus major tor, which had been referred to as the \\"central long-eared bat Nyctophilus sp. 1\\". The revision by Parnaby (2009) considered the status as a species for populations that are sometimes sympatric, but could not disregard the size variation as environmentally influenced. The distinction of the subspecies, more evident in the females, requires clarification by DNA sequencing. The nominate subspecies Nyctophilus major major is recognised for a population restricted to the southwest corner of Australia, N. major tor is found in wider distribution to the north and east of this. Common names for the species include western, central or greater 'long-eared bat'. The field worker John Gilbert carefully recorded local names in his notes, derived from the Nyungar language, and this was later reported in Gould's Mammals of Australia (1863). The common name bam-be, in the vicinity of the Swan River Colony (Perth, Toodjay), and bar-ba-lon at King George Sound (vicinity of Albany) were given to Nyctophilus sp. in the Southwest of Australia. However, this name was likely applied to any of the several insectivorous bat species of the region. Gould noted the variant spelling as \\"native name: bam-ba\\", contradicting Gilberts note, and applied the common name western nyctophilus to the species. Gould compared his specimen, obtained in Perth, with the type for N. timoriensis in Paris and concluded they were the same species; the type was assumed to have been mislabelled as originating in Timor and produced the erroneous epithet.  Description  A small bat, although one of several larger species of the genus Nyctophilus, which is allied with the family Vespertilionidae. The ears are close to 30 mm in length, proportionally large for the size of the animal, and distinctly ribbed at the interior. The nose has a small leaf-shaped protuberance, simple in its details and lacking a Y-shape feature found in similar bats. The interfemoral membrane completely covers the tail. The fur at the back has an orange tinge to darker brown-grey colour, the ventral side is lighter. The length of the forearm is 38 to 48 millimetres, the weight range for both sexes of the species M. Major, is 9 to 20 grams. The measurements range or average weight and lengths, in grams (g) and millimetres (mm), for the two subspecies are, * M. major major (nominate subspecies): the forearm is 42.5‚Äì48.4 mm and weight range 12‚Äì16.5 g, the females smaller than males. The combined head-body length is 65, tibia 50, and the ear length, the distance from the ear notch to its point, is 24.4‚Äì28.6. *M. major tor (widespread subspecies): forearm 37.6‚Äì45.2, head-body 58, tibia 47, ear length 21.3‚Äì27.5 and weight range is 8.0‚Äì12.3 g, males are again larger than females.  Ecology  The species is similar in size and superficial features to the other larger Nyctophilus species, the tasmanian N. sherrini and southeastern N. corbeni. They most closely resemble the northern N. daedalus, although the fur is sandy coloured and lighter; close examination of will diagnose this species by the slightly greater width of the outer canines. They forage for insect prey in the air and, as suggested by their capture in pit traps, also at ground level. The species flight is similar to some birds, using a fluttering action. The large ears, apart from the usual function in echolocation, also provide directional assistance as rudders while flying. Nyctophilus major possess the ability to enter a lengthy period of semi-hibernation in the austral winter, a state of torpor lasting up to sixty days.  Habitat and distribution  Nyctophilus major occurs in Western Australia, in the high rainfall southwest region of the Australian continent dominated by giant eucalypts and as an isolated population close to the Eyre Bird Observatory. The trees of the upperstory of its habitat are the large to very tall eucalypt species, karri Eucalyptus diversicolor, jarrah E. marginata, tuart E. gomphocephala, and marri Corymbia calophylla. Other woodland types inhabited by the bat include stands of melaleuca, banksia and sheoak tees of genus Allocasuarina, and include a dense understory. Roost sites favoured by the N. major are tree hollows and amongst foliage, and beneath the loose thick bark of swamp paperbark (Melaleuca sp.) and flooded gum (Eucalyptus sp.) in riparian habitat.

It lies in the Northern Aravalli leopard wildlife corridor. History In 2014, of the 611 water bodies in Delhi, 274 were dead and remaining were in bad shape. Neela Hauz is a freshwater lake which was slowly dying due to the dumping of waste. During ancient times it use to be the main source of water supply for the Rajput city of Qila Rai Pithora. During ancient times, its basin was recharged by the wider dense forests of Sanjay Van and its overflow drained in to Yamuna.M Jaggi, June 2017, NOPR: Neela Hauz Biodiversity Park ‚Äì From Barren to Beautiful, SR Vol.54(06). In 2014, the wetland was covered with water hyacinth and ridge was infested with the invasive species of prosopis juliflora (Vilayati Babul or Kikar of Mexican origin), which were planted in the 1920s by the Britisher colonisers to rehabilitate the wasteland. The silted up lake was encroached upon and raw sewage drained into it, causing concerned citizens to take an order from Delhi High Court to have it restored by the government. After the restoration started in 2015, this biodiversity park was officially inaugurated in November 2016. Delhi has 7,884 hectares of fragmented forests which are deprived of wild animals due to the unplanned urbanisation. In 2015, Delhi already had Aravalli Biodiversity Park and Yamuna Biodiversity Park. The Delhi Development Authority engaged the scientist of Delhi University to develop four more biodiversity parks in Delhi, including the Northern ridge biodiversity park (Kamla Nehru Ridge), Tilpath valley biodiversity park, Neelahauz biodiversity park and phase-2 of the Yamuna Biodiversity Park. Restoration In 2015, the Delhi Development Authority commenced the work to restore this as a biodiversity area.DDA biodiversity parks.Government takes steps to restore biodiversity of Kamala Nehru ridge, Millennium Post, 14 October 2014. Lake was desilted, its banks landscaped, water supply was restored with the treated water from the Wastewater Treatment Plant, and native species of plants were reintroduced in 10 acres of the land surrounding the lake. To improve the water quality before water enters the lake, the Constructed Wetland System (CWS) consists of zero energy input physical and biological processes, including 2 oxidation points and four filtration ponds/channels. In first step of oxidation the organic sewage material is broken down by the atmospheric oxygen by microbes and in the second stage the aquatic plants treat the water. Four channels have filters, such as pebbles and sand of varying size, to filter the water before it enters the lake. After the CWS was operationalised, it is claimed that the Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) fell from 40 to 4, phosphate 104 to 14, total dissolved solids from 600 to 298 and dissolved oxygen improved from 0 to 3.4. Independent water testing was carried out by the Delhi Jal Board in June 2019 as part of the investigation carried out by the Ground Water Monitoring Committee appointed by the NGT. It was found that the treated effluent did not meet permissible standards. Prof. C.R. Babu was to improve the parameters of the effluent but up to November 2019 no published action has been taken. Several ridges of Delhi are being restored to revive the native species including leopard, Indian rock python, jackals, neelgai, mongooses, porcupines, small Indian civet, gecko, Sirkeer malkoha cuckoo, nightjar, Indian paradise flycatcher.Two years on, Tilpath Valley Biodiversity Park breathes again, Times of India, 23 February 2018.Delhi gets its third biodiversity park in Tilpat Valley, Hindustan Times, 3 February 2018. Flora 15,000 native plants and shrubs of 75 species from 6 bio communities were planted in 2015‚Äì16. Slopes were stabilised by planting the grasses, such as chrysopogon, heteropogon and cenchrus ciliaris. Wetland has restocked with the phytoplankton, zooplankton, free floating and rooted aquatic plants. Fauna By 2016, the lake was home to over 70 bird species, including migratory birds.  Impropriety  This project was carried out by the Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystems with the design being credited to Professor C.R. Babu, The centre and the professor have no experience in water engineering or water body revival and the project was funded by public money. It is unclear if any tendering process was followed and for what reason an inexperienced agency working with students was appointed. Despite claims being made that the project is low cost and performing well, no budget details have been released by the DDA and independent testing has shown the system is not meeting standards. Professor CR Babu who is part of the implementing agency has previously been selected personally by the DDA to work on several biodiversity parks. In 2011 it was revealed by a public query that the DDA had spent 40 crores over five years for the management of just two biodiversity parks. It was further revealed that the funds were being passed directly from Delhi University to Professor Babu's account, in violation of the Delhi University Act, and he was allowed \\" to operate, pursue and state all transactions and administrative nature with regard to the above mentioned projects\\"  See also * Delhi Ridge * National Parks & Wildlife Sanctuaries of Haryana  References  Category:Wildlife sanctuaries in Delhi Category:Forests of India Category:South Delhi district ","title":"Neela Hauz biodiversity park"},{"id":"59684273","text":"Haifa City Museum, Beit Haam The Haifa City Museum opened in 2000 in a Templers' building that was once the community center of the historic German Colony, Haifa.

The 18th century neo-classical building is set in a walled park in the Beane valley. It has been the home of Heath Mount School since the 1930s. History Thomas Rumbold, who was later made a baronet, acquired the Woodhall estate using the fortune he had made in India. One of his partners at Chittagong, Harry Verelst helped with the financing. The estate and its manor house were originally home to the Butler or Boteler family. The architect Thomas Leverton was commissioned by Rumbold to design a new house to replace the manor house on a nearby site. Rumbold became Governor of Madras in 1778 and made arrangements for work to continue on the house in his absence, payments being made from his account at Goslings Bank. Suffering from poor health, he returned to England in 1780. The East India Company, unhappy about the Second Anglo-Mysore War, dismissed him the following year. He continued to serve as a Member of Parliament until 1790. When Rumbold died in 1791, he was according to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, insolvent. (subscription or UK public library membership required) Under the terms of his will, the property was sold to benefit the children of his second marriage. It was acquired by Paul Benfield, who extended the house. His architect is not known. Benfield, who has been described as \\"perhaps the most notorious of the nabobs\\", went bankrupt. The estate was bought by Samuel Smith in 1801. Architecture Leverton's designs were exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1777. =Interior= Describing Leverton's work at Woodhall Park, Nikolaus Pevsner said that his interiors \\"have a style, decidedly their own, different from Adam's or Chambers's or Holland's\\" their character coming out most clearly in the central staircase hallway, \\"profusely but very delicately decorated with plaster √† la antique\\".Pevsner. Hertfordshire (Buildings of England). 1953, p.278 Park Philip Boteler obtained a licence to create a park in the 16th century. The present appearance of the park reflects landscaping done in the late 18th century for Rumbold. A weir was constructed to hold back the River Beane to create a \\"broadwater\\" within sight of the house. In the 21st-century a new channel was dug bypassing the weir to allow fish migration. As a young man, Joseph Paxton was employed at Woodhall Park by Samuel Smith. He was an apprentice to Smith's gardener, William Griffin.Kenworthy-Browne, J. (2004, September 23).

At that time, the garden appears to have had good facilities for fruit growing, one of the activities for which Paxton later achieved fame when working for the Duke of Devonshire. The walled kitchen garden is listed grade II. The park was listed in 1987 in the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England. =Boundary wall= Boundary wall with ladder stile In the 19th century the Smith family diverted the route of the turnpike between Watton and Ware, moving it further from the house.

He was at the heart of an artists' network, known to some contemporaries as much for their fun-loving lifestyle as for serious artistic endeavour. He emerged as a writer on the arts and a \\"culture politician\\". He was born and lived in Central Switzerland.  Life  Hans Caspar von Matt was born in Stans, the administrative capital of the Nidwalden, a small rural German- speaking canton on the south side of Lake Lucerne. His father, also called Hans von Matt (1869-1932), was a book dealer and local magistrate who took up politics and became a CVP member of the Swiss parliament. After successful completion of his schooling, in 1918 Hans von Matt enrolled in the class of Joseph von Moos at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts on the far side of the lake. The next year he moved further afield, entering the √âcole des Beaux-Arts (as it was known at that time) in Geneva. Here he studied painting and sculpture under David Estoppey and James Vibert respectively. Von Matt was becoming an assiduous networker, and during his time in Geneva he made contact with Kurt Seligmann and Alberto Giacometti. During 1920 he undertook a lengthy study trip to Florence where he was much impressed by what he saw of the work of Sandro Botticelli. He was a student at the Munich Fine Arts Academy between 1921 and 1923. Later in the 1920s he attended several of the winter courses given in Paris by Andr√© Lhote. In 1924 he began establishing himself as an artist, and later also as a sculptor, in Stans, his hometown, where in 1927 he built his own studio. On 25 September 1935 Hans von Matt married the artist-model Annemarie Gunz in Stans. She was a prominent participant in the central Switzerland arts scene of the time, and sat as the model for several of Hans von Matt's better known paintings of women. Around 1939 Hans von Matt set out on a parallel career as a writer on themes such as folklore and local history. He also published a number of monographs on well known personalities from Central Switzerland. These included the artists Melchior Wyrsch and Heinrich Danioth, along with the sculptor Josef Maria Christen. Another was the Lucerne-based conservator and arts patron Paul Hilber. In 1927 he became a member of the Swiss Werkbund (artists' association). In 1937 he became a member of the Luzern Arts Society (\\"Kunstgesellschaft Luzern\\"), serving as its vice-president from 1958. He was a member of the National Arts Commission (\\"Eidgen√∂ssische Kunstkommission\\") between 1941 and 1953, and its vice-president between 1949 and 1953. He was a founder, and between 1944 and 1953 a member of the executive board with the Swiss Luke Society for Promoting Church Art (\\"Schweizerische Lukasgesellschaft zur F√∂rderung der kirchlichen Kunst\\"). And between 1947 and 1974 he was a member of the Nidwalden canton Historical Society.  Works  Hans von Matt's career as an artists began during his student years in Munich and Geneva. Initially he was drawn towards expressionism. Later in the 1920s, influenced by the cubist precepts of Andr√© Lhote in Paris and by Karl Geiser, von Matt's styles acquired a more individualistic form, clear and compact. His figures of maidens and of saints display a gentleness of expression and softened body shapes. Human bodily forms up till 1961 also tend towards a slightly lengthened distorted shape. Commissions for contemporary religious sculpture provided many opportunities for church statuary and grave memorials across the northern part of Switzerland. As he grew older he increasingly favoured smaller bronze and terracotta figures. From 1961 he began to engage with the more abstract forms associated with Jean Arp, Henri Laurens and Henry Moore. His figures now no longer appeared in such self-contained forms, but were characterised by \\"break-outs\\" and sweeping lines.  Prizes (selection)   Family  Hans von Matt's had four brothers. Two of these were the writer and radio personality Josef von Matt (1901-1988) and the photographer Leonard von Matt.

This term has been used in several different contexts.  In markets with money  Consider a market in which there are several buyers and several goods, and each good may have a price. Given a price-vector, each buyer has a demand set - a set of bundles that maximize the buyer's utility over all bundles (this set might include the empty bundle, in case the buyer considers all bundles as too expensive). An envy-free matching (given a price-vector) is a matching in which each agent receives a bundle from his demand-set. This means that no agent would like to get the bundle of another agent with the same prices. An example of this setting is the rental harmony problem - matching tenants (the agents) to rooms (the items) while setting a price to each room. An envy-free price is a price-vector for which an envy-free matching exists. It is a relaxation of a Walrasian equilibrium: a Walrasian equilibrium consists of an EF price and EF matching, and in addition, every item must either be matched or have zero price. It is known that, in a Walrasian equilibrium, the matching maximizes the sum of values, i.e., it is a maximum-weight matching. However, the seller's revenue might be low. This motivates the relaxation to EF pricing, in which the seller may use reserve prices to increase the revenue.  In markets without money  Consider the problem of matching doctors for residency in hospitals. Each doctor has a preference relation on hospitals (ranking the hospitals from best to worst), and each hospital has a preference relation on doctors (ranking the doctors from best to worst). Each doctor can work in at most one hospital, and each hospital can employ at most a fixed number of doctors (called the capacity of the hospital). We want to match doctors to hospitals. Monetary transfers are not allowed. There are two ways in which such a matching can be \\"bad\\": # A matching has justified envy if there is a doctor d and a hospital h, such that d prefers h over his current employer, and h prefers d over one of its current employees. # A matching has waste if there is a doctor d and a hospital h, such that d prefers h over his current employer, h has some vacant positions, and h prefers d over a vacant position. An envy-free matching is a matching with no justified envy. It is a relaxation of stable matching: a stable matching is a matching that is both envy-free and has no waste. = Lattice structure = In a many-to-one matching problem, stable matchings exist and can be found by the Gale‚ÄìShapley algorithm. Therefore, EF matchings exist too. In general there can be many different EF matchings. The set of all EF matchings is a lattice. The set of stable matchings (which are a subset of the EF matchings) is a fixed point of a Tarsky operator on that lattice. = Both upper and lower quotas = Often, the hospitals have not only upper quotas (capacities), but also lower quotas ‚Äì each hospital must be assigned at least some minimum number of doctors. In such problems, stable matchings may not exist (though it is easy to check whether a stable matching exists, since by the rural hospitals theorem, in all stable matchings, the number of doctors assigned to each hospital is identical). In such cases it is natural to check whether an EF matching exists. A necessary condition is that the sum of all lower quotas is at most the number of doctors (otherwise, no feasible matching exist at all). In this case, if all doctor-hospital pairs are acceptable (every doctor prefers any hospital to unemployment, and any hospital prefers any doctor to a vacant position), then an EF matching always exists. If not all pairs are acceptable, then an EF matching might not exist. It is possible to decide the existence of an EFM in the following way. Create a new instance of the problem, in which the upper quotas are the lower quotas of the original problem, and the lower quotas are 0. In the new problem, a stable matching always exists and can be found efficiently. The original problem has an EF matching if-and-only-if, in the stable matching of the new problem, every hospital is full. The algorithm can be improved to find a maximal EF matching. = Minimizing envy = As defined above, envy-free matching only eliminates justified envy, where a doctor d envies another doctor who is matched to a hospital h that prefers d. However, even in an EFM, there may be a doctor d and a hospital h such that d prefers h over his current employer, but h does not prefer d over any of its current employees. This may be called an \\"unjustified envy\\". A matching with no envy at all exists only in the rare case in which each doctor can be matched to his first choice. When such a \\"totally envy-free matching\\" does not exist, it is still reasonable to find matchings that minimize the \\"envy amount\\". There are several ways in which the envy amount may be measured, for example: the total amount of envy-instances over all doctors, or the maximum amount of envy-instances per doctor.  In bipartite graphs  In an unweighted bipartite graph G = (X+Y, E), an envy-free matching is a matching in which no unmatched vertex in X is adjacent to a matched vertex in Y. Suppose the vertices of X represent people, the vertices of Y represent houses, and an edge between a person x and a house y represents the fact that x is willing to live in y. Then, an EFM is a partial allocation of houses to people such that each house-less person does not envy any person with a house, since he does not like any allocated house anyway. Every matching that saturates X is envy-free, and every empty matching is envy-free. Moreover, if NG(X) ‚â• X ‚â• 1 (where NG(X) is the set of neighbors of X in Y), then G admits a nonempty EFM. This is a relaxation of Hall's marriage condition, which says that, if NG(X') ‚â• X' for every subset X' of X, then an X-saturating matching exists.  In cake-cutting  The term envy-free matching has also been used in a different context: an algorithm for improving the efficiency of envy-free cake-cutting.

It is a member of the Rams family of games and, although it is a gambling game, often played for small stakes, it is also suitable as a party game or as a family game with children from the age of 12 upwards. It is named after the mouche, a term that variously refers to its winning hand, the basic stake and the penalty for failing to take any tricks. Although also called B√™te, it should not be confused with the older game of that name from which it came and which, in turn, was a derivative of Triomphe.  History  Mouche is first recorded in the Acad√©mie Universelle des Jeux of 1718, although Parlett implies that, from its terminology, it ought to be an ancestor of the English game, Lanterloo, which goes back at least to Cotton's rules of 1674, and that they are probably both descended from an early trump game, known as Triomphe. In the early 18th century, Mouche was considered a \\"most pleasant\\" provincial game that had yet to catch on in Paris. In the mid-19th century, it is described as being \\"very like Triomphe in the way it is played, but much more spicy\\" and as a game for the \\"petty bourgeoisie\\", a family game played before dinner. Mouche also went under the less fashionable name of B√™te (\\"Beast\\") in the region of Perche and its surrounding areas. However, B√™te or Beste is also the name of an earlier, possibly antecedent, game in which there is no equivalent of the flush known as the mouche, but otherwise the rules are much the same. The term b√™te came to be used in both French and German as the name of the stake and penalty payment in a number of old games of this type and may be the origin of the word bet which dates to the same era.Oxford Dictionary of English. Entry for bet. Another name for Mouche was Lanterlu, a term clearly related to the Lanterloo, although in the English game the Jack of Clubs is the top trump, a concept not found in Mouche but mirrored in its descendant, Mistigri, historically also known as Pamphile.La Mouche and Le Pamphile at academiedesjeux.jeuxsoc.fr. Retrieved 27 Apr 2019.  Rules  The following rules are based on van der Aa (1721) with some additional clarifications from the Acad√©mie des Jeux Oubli√©s. = Cards = The game is played by three or four players using a pack of 32 French- suited cards. If three play, the Sevens are removed. The cards follow the √âcart√© scheme, ranking from highest to lowest as follows: K Q J A 10 9 8 7. = Tokens = Coloured wooden tokens of the type used in Mouche: jetons (round), fiches (long) and contrats (short) Tokens or chips are used for scoring. According to the Academie des Jeux Oubli√©s, at the start of the game each player takes 20 jetons (round), 16 fiches (long rectangular) and 9 contrats (short rectangular). A fiche was worth 5 jetons and a contrat was worth 100 jetons. = Dealing and declarations = The first dealer is chosen by lot; the player drawing the agreed card (e.g. a King) dealing first. Deal and play are anti-clockwise. The dealer antes 5 jetons to the pot before dealing each player five cards. These may be dealt either as 2+2+1, 3+2, 2+3 or 2+1+2 as the dealer wishes, but the method should not be changed during a game. The dealer then turns the next card as trumps leaving it face up on the table, and places the remaining cards face down to form the talon. Players then decide whether they will pass, exchange a number of cards from one to five or 'stick' with the cards in their hand. If they pass, they just lay their hand, face down, on the table and take no further part in the deal. If they want to exchange cards, they select their discards and place them face down on the table announcing the number of cards being exchanged e.g. \\"all cards\\", \\"four cards\\", etc. The dealer then places the discards on the table face to his right and gives the player the same number of cards from the top of the talon. If a player believes he has a good hand, he may stick by saying e.g. \\"I'll take it\\" (\\"je m'y tiens\\") and not exchange any cards. Once a player has announced he will stick or has exchanged cards, he must play and cannot drop out. = Mouche = If a player is dealt five cards of the same suit in the initial deal, he 'has the mouche ' and wins immediately without further play, sweeping the pool (the mouche). He does not have to declare it straight away but may 'save the mouche' by announcing he will stick. This may be to his advantage since, once he declares it, any remaining players will pass in order to avoid making the mouche (i.e. paying a penalty equal to the pool). The player who has the mouche must declare it before trick play starts. Players are allowed to question someone who sticks by saying e.g. \\"are you saving the mouche?\\" The player so questioned does not have to respond. If he stays silent, that is taken as a \\"yes\\", but if he speaks he is expected to bluff and be evasive, as long as he doesn't lie. If two or more have the mouche, a trump mouche beats a plain suit mouche and a higher-scoring plain suit mouche beats one worth fewer points. To calculate the value of such a hand, court cards and Aces score 10 and the remaining cards score their face value. If two hands score the same, the player with positional priority wins (i.e. the one nearest the dealer's right). = Playing = If no-one has the mouche, once everyone has had the chance to stick or exchange cards, play begins with the eldest hand (premier en cartes) leading to the first trick. Players must follow suit or trump and overtrump if unable to follow. If they can neither follow nor trump they may discard. In addition, if a player is unable to beat an earlier trump, they may discard. = Winning = Players earn 1/5 of the pool for each trick taken. If a player wins all five tricks they \\"take the mouche\\", i.e. sweep the pool. A player who fails to take a trick must \\"make the mouche\\" i.e. pay a penalty equal to the amount of the current pool into the basket which is played for in the next deal along with the dealer's ante. In order to stop the amount in the pool escalating too far, players may agree to cap the mouche so e.g. if there are 40 jetons in the basket and the cap is 20 jetons if a player makes a mouche, he only pays a 20 jeton penalty. Alternatively they may agree that, if two or more players make a mouche during one deal, their penalties are paid in successive deals rather than both into the next deal.  Terminology  The term mouche is used in various ways as follows: * Mouche: *# the contents of the basket or pool. The mouche may be single or multiple. *# a penalty payment equal to the contents of the current basket *# a flush comprising five cards of the same suit (without exchanging) * Mouche piquante: multiple mouche * Have the mouche (avoir la mouche): to have five cards of the same suit in one's hand (without exchanging) * Make the mouche (faire la mouche): to incur a penalty equal to the contents of the basket * Take the mouche (prendre la mouche): to sweep the pool i.e. to win the contents of the basket  References   Literature  * Depaulis, Thierry (1987). \\"Un peu de lumi√®re sur l'Hombre\\" in the Journal of the International Playing Card Society, xiv (Nov 1987). * Parlett, David (1990).

Gerger started his racing career as a road racer. In the long distance race Wien‚ÄìBerlin in 1893 he came in third after German star riders Josef Fischer and Georg Sorge on a bike provided by Johann Puch. Being the only one of the top-placed riders who didn't change his bike, a Styria-touring bike, he won a special prize.

Her expressionist style developed under the tutelage of Austrian master Oskar Kokoschka in the late 1950s, with whom she worked in Salzburg in the 1960s. Reviewing a 1993 Exhibition as his Critic‚Äôs Choice in The Times, John Russell Taylor, art critic and author, wrote that \\"(Perlman) captures the particular feel of the place while abating none of her expressionist dash\\".

He was also a senior member in Los Zetas, the Gulf Cartel's former paramilitary group. In the 1990s, de la Cruz Reyna was an officer in the Tamaulipas State Police while working as a hitman for the Gulf Cartel. After he left the agency in 1999, he became a bodyguard for former Gulf Cartel kingpin Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n, and was eventually promoted to regional leader of the cartel in Tampico. He reportedly had policemen on his payroll, and managed international drug trafficking shipments from Central and South America. In 1999, de la Cruz Reyna and his associates threatened two U.S. agents at gunpoint in Matamoros after they had traveled there with an informant to gather intelligence on the Gulf Cartel's operations. The agents returned to the U.S. unharmed, but this incident triggered a massive manhunt for him. De la Cruz Reyna was arrested in 2007 and extradited to the U.S., where he was convicted of assaulting the two agents. Expecting to be released in 2012, de la Cruz Reyna attempted to bribe an undercover agent to ensure he was released to members of the Gulf Cartel upon his return to Mexico. He later pleaded guilty to charges of bribery and received a sentence of slightly more than an additional 11 more years in prison. Early life and career Juan Carlos de la Cruz Reyna was born in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico in . In the 1990s, he was an officer in the Tamaulipas State Police. According to information from the Attorney General's Office (PGR), while de la Cruz Reyna served as a police officer, he also worked as a hitman for the Gulf Cartel, a criminal group based in Tamaulipas. Under the leadership of former kingpin Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n, the Gulf Cartel recruited several law enforcement agents to further their drug trafficking operations and conduct killings on their behalf. De la Cruz Reyna reported to Jorge Eduardo Costilla S√°nchez (\\"El Coss\\"), a former high-ranking Gulf Cartel leader. He was released from the agency on 31 May 1999. When he joined the cartel full-time, de la Cruz Reyna was part of two Gulf Cartel subgroups known as the Sierras and the Tangos. Costilla S√°nchez and V√≠ctor Manuel V√°zquez Mireles (\\"El Meme\\") headed these groups. Its members used aliases and codes to ensure their anonymity. De la Cruz Reyna had several aliases, including \\"El JC\\", \\"Tango 36\\", \\"JC Tango\\", \\"La Torta\\", \\"La Chona\\", and \\"Z-36\\". On 9 November 1999, de la Cruz Reyna and several of his associates, including C√°rdenas Guill√©n, threatened two U.S. agents at gunpoint in Matamoros. The agents had traveled there with an informant to gather intelligence on the Gulf Cartel's operations but were intercepted by the criminal group. During the standoff, C√°rdenas Guill√©n threatened to kill the U.S. agents and the informant, but they were allowed to return to the U.S. unharmed after a heated discussion. This incident led to increased law enforcement efforts against the Gulf Cartel's leadership. Following this incident, de la Cruz Reyna became one of the most-wanted criminals in the U.S. and Mexico. On 14 March 2000, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas (S.D. Tex.) in Brownsville filed a sealed indictment against de la Cruz Reyna for assaulting the two agents. The indictment was unsealed on 14 December 2000. On 9 April 2002, de la Cruz Reyna was included in a superseding indictment for the assault charges. For these charges de la Cruz Reyna faced up to 10 years in prison, up to US$250,000 in fines, and three years of supervised release for each count. In 2003, the PGR identified de la Cruz Reyna as a direct collaborator of C√°rdenas Guill√©n, and listed him as a senior member within Los Zetas, the Gulf Cartel's former paramilitary group. That same year, the U.S. government formally issued an extradition request to the Mexican government. It asked that de la Cruz be transferred to the U.S. should he be arrested in Mexico. While in Los Zetas, de la Cruz Reyna worked as one C√°rdenas Guill√©n's bodyguards. He later managed security logistics for him and other Gulf Cartel leaders. Since he worked for the Tamaulipas State Police, he was tasked with informing the Gulf Cartel of law enforcement efforts against them. In addition, he was responsible for coordinating with several police agencies to facilitate C√°rdenas Guill√©n's transportation. According to several PGR protected witnesses who worked with de la Cruz Reyna and other Gulf Cartel leaders, de la Cruz Reyna was responsible for carrying out multiple executions ordered by the cartel's leadership. In 2000, he allegedly assassinated two lawyers who had represented the Gulf Cartel, Miguel Angel Mart√≠nez S√°nchez and Antonio L√≥pez Nakazono. He also reportedly ordered attacks against Rolando L√≥pez Salinas (\\"El Rolis\\"), a member of a smuggling group headed by Edelio L√≥pez Falc√≥n (\\"El Yeyo\\"). The protected witnesses also stated that de la Cruz Reyna participated in the murders of Gulf Cartel leaders Rogelio Garc√≠a Garc√≠a (\\"El Roger\\") and √Ångel Salvador G√≥mez Herrera (\\"Chava G√≥mez\\"), and of police officer Gerardo Gazc√≥n Sotero and Commander Jaime Rajid Guti√©rrez Arreola. Leadership tenure According to intelligence reports, C√°rdenas Guill√©n promoted de la Cruz Reyna to regional leader in Tampico, Tamaulipas in 2001. A PGR-protected witnesses stated his promotion was due to de la Cruz Reyna's background as a police officer, his tenure in the Gulf Cartel, and his perceived level-headedness. As head of Tampico, he coordinated drug trafficking shipments in southern Tamaulipas and northern Veracruz and had at least 300 people under his command. Some of them were suspected to be members of the local police. These suspects helped protect drug shipments from this part of Mexico to the U.S. -Mexico border between the cities of Matamoros and Nuevo Laredo. While heading operations in Tampico, he was charged with multiple killings and kidnappings. He was a suspect in the murder of Silvestre Ba√±uelos Alejos, former deputy chief of the Tamaulipas State Police, and in the death of Adolfo Velasco Ram√≠rez, former police chief in Tampico, both in 2006. In early April 2007, de la Cruz Reyna ordered an attack against law enforcement for a seizure conducted at of one his properties in Tampico. The seizure resulted in multiple weapons, ammunition, tactical gear, and radio communication equipment being confiscated. In addition, several protected witnesses who testified against de la Cruz Reyna in Mexico stated that he had officers of the Federal Preventive Police (PFP) on his payroll. They reportedly assisted de la Cruz Reyna's human smuggling and drug trafficking operations in Tampico. In January 2007, C√°rdenas Guill√©n was extradited to the U.S., affecting the Gulf Cartel's drug operations. After Luis Reyes Enr√≠quez (\\"El Rex\\"), a high-ranking leader of Los Zetas, was arrested in June 2007, the Gulf Cartel's leadership transferred de la Cruz Reyna to Mexico City. He was tasked with coordinating cocaine shipments with suppliers in Central and South America. Before buying a house in Coyoac√°n, a borough of Mexico City, de la Cruz Reyna lived in multiple hotels in the city. He lived a luxurious lifestyle and spent a lot of money on clothes, food, and other expensive activities, which attracted the attention of law enforcement. To disguise himself in Mexico City, he tried to dress casually; in Tamaulipas, his style was rural, and included boots and a cowboy jeans. De la Cruz Reyna traveled many times between Tamaulipas and Mexico City for work, but preferred to conduct negotiations in Mexico City. Arrest and aftermath On 28 August 2007, security forces received an anonymous tip that led them to a restaurant in Polanco, Mexico City. There the Special Forces Airmobile Group, the elite unit of the Mexican Army, arrested de la Cruz Reyna and eight other suspected drug traffickers. Eyewitnesses stated that de la Cruz Reyna had just paid for his meal and was about to leave when the Army entered the restaurant and conducted the arrest. Most of the other diners had left when the arrest occurred. Through an informant, authorities were kept updated on the suspects' activities inside the restaurant, including their food and drink orders. The government described the incident as a carefully calculated operation; around 30 Army personnel reached the scene in multiple vehicles and surrounded the restaurant and the adjacent premises. Two helicopters flew over the area. Local police assisted by blocking the street and redirecting traffic. Several soldiers went into the restaurant and apprehended the suspects. Later that evening, Mexican authorities arrested two other people who they suspected were involved in de la Cruz Reyna's operations. The location of their arrest was not made public, but they were in possession of an AK-47, and MXN$100,000 (approximately US$9,090 in August 2007) and US$300,000 in cash. No shots were fired during these operations; none of the detainees resisted arrest. Investigators stated that three of the eight detainees were Colombian nationals and alleged representatives of Colombia's Norte del Valle Cartel. De la Cruz Reyna was in a meeting with them to negotiate drug trafficking shipment details between Colombia and Mexico. This meeting was the result of Reyes Enr√≠quez's capture months earlier; he was suspected of being the Gulf Cartel's main intermediary for their drug suppliers in Colombia. Restaurant personnel stated that the three Colombian nationals had eaten there twenty days earlier. Mexican authorities stated that the Norte del Valle Cartel had operated in Mexico City since 2003 and was looking to receive several concessions from Mexican criminal groups like the Gulf Cartel in exchange for their drug supply. Among the reported concessions was that the Norte del Valle Cartel was to be allowed to conduct money laundering activities in Mexico, and use the country as a gateway to Europe (primarily Spain) for their drug trafficking shipments. Once in custody, de la Cruz Reyna was sent to Campo Militar 1, a military installation in Mexico City, before he was transferred to the offices of the Subprocuradur√≠a de Investigaci√≥n Especializada en Delincuencia Organizada (SIEDO), Mexico's organized crime investigation agency. While at the SIEDO offices, de la Cruz Reyna and his accomplices were interrogated and made their first legal declarations. The U.S. government congratulated the administration of Felipe Calder√≥n (2006‚Äì2012) and Mexico's law enforcement agencies for the capture. U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Tony Garza said the U.S. government would strengthened its bilateral ties with Mexico to continue combating drug trafficking and organized crime. U.S. authorities also reminded Mexico that de la Cruz Reyna was wanted in the U.S. for the assault of the two agents in 1999. The PGR confirmed that the two U.S. agents recognized de la Cruz Reyna as one of the suspects who threatened them. News of his arrest was published discretely in media outlets in Tamaulipas with the exception of a newspaper in Tampico. This raised suspicions concerning the Gulf Cartel's control over the local press. De la Cruz Reyna's arrest weakened the Gulf Cartel and led to a series of successful crackdowns by Mexican security forces during the rest of 2007. Authorities were able to arrest members of the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas in record numbers, as well as seize drugs, money, and weapons. On 6 October 2007, the Mexican Army seized of cocaine from the Gulf Cartel in Tampico after a shootout. According to the PGR, this was the largest cocaine seizure in the history of Mexico. In the operation, seven suspected Gulf Cartel traffickers were arrested. On 12 October, Mexico's Secretar√≠a de Seguridad P√∫blica (SSP) (Secretariat of Public Security) arrested 25 officers from the PFP for collaborating with de la Cruz Reyna. The police were on the Gulf Cartel's payroll and assisted de la Cruz Reyna by notifying the cartel of the government's operatives. Imprisonment On 2 September 2007, a federal judge granted authorities a 70-day preventative arrest against de la Cruz Reyna and the suspects arrested with him. This meant that the SIEDO was allowed to keep them for this period at their facilities before they were sent to a maximum- security prison. The SIEDO continued to investigate de la Cruz Reyna and his associates for their alleged participation in organized crime and drug trafficking. That same day, federal Judge Martha S√°nchez Alonso granted de la Cruz Reyna's defense constitutional protection preventing his extradition to the U.S. His defense issued two writs of amparo the day of his capture to stop any extradition efforts by the Mexican government. The two writs of amparo were served on the SIEDO and the Secretariat of Foreign Affairs (SRE). One of the amparos also asked the court to prevent de la Cruz Reyna from being kept incommunicado, segregated, or transferred to one of Mexico's maximum-security prisons. However, on 17 September, de la Cruz Reyna was transferred to the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 1 (also known as \\"Altiplano\\"), a maximum-security prison in Almoloya de Ju√°rez, State of Mexico, with the rest of his accomplices. The transfer was allowed because a State of Mexico court considered the evidence against him to be sufficient and issued an arrest warrant while he was in the SIEDO's custody. On 25 September, a State of Mexico federal court officially charged de la Cruz Reyna with drug trafficking and money laundering after analyzing the evidence presented by the PGR. It stated the charges were sufficient. His accomplices, arrested with him at the restaurant, were charged with the same counts. The two other suspects arrested with firearms were charged with illegal possession of military-exclusive weapons. Throughout most of 2008, the Mexican government was unable to convict de la Cruz Reyna of the crimes he was suspected of committing. On 21 April, he was nearly released from prison after a judge considered the evidence presented by the plaintiff was insufficient to prove his culpability. The plaintiff was unable to prove that he was guilty of attempted homicide, drug trafficking, and illegal possession of military-exclusive firearms. A few days before his release was to be approved, however, the SIEDO issued another arrest warrant that was accepted by a federal court, which charged de la Cruz Reyna for organized crime involvement. De la Cruz Reyna remained imprisoned. He was among a long list of other suspected organized crime leaders from the Gulf Cartel and other groups like the Sinaloa Cartel, Tijuana Cartel, and the Ju√°rez Cartel who were awaiting trial. Extradition and sentence On 31 December 2008, Mexico extradited de la Cruz Reyna to the U.S. along with nine other suspected drug traffickers, including Rub√©n Sauceda Rivera (\\"El Cacahuate\\") and Jos√© Manuel Barrientos Rodr√≠guez, two senior members of the Gulf Cartel. The Mexican government stated they extradited de la Cruz Reyna as a sign of commitment to combat transnational organized crime. They confirmed his extradition was approved for the pending indictments he had in the U.S. for assaulting a federal officer. The U.S. government lauded Mexico's efforts and commitment to extradite prisoners to the U.S., and specifically highlighted de la Cruz Reyna's transfer as important. As part of the (INAI), the SRE released the original details of de la Cruz Reyna's extradition for public access in 2013. The INAI also intended to release sensitive details of his case in Mexico, including the law enforcement officials and judges who presided over it, the witnesses who testified against him, the names of his close collaborators, and the victims of his crimes. However, a court decision denied this request. De la Cruz Reyna was transported from the Matamoros International Airport to Texas. Though he was initially indicted in Brownsville, U.S District Judge Hilda G. Tagle moved his trial to Houston for security reasons. On 31 March 2009, De la Cruz Reyna pleaded guilty to two counts of assault. His attorney said that de la Cruz Reyna was unable to come to an agreement with prosecutors because he did not accept the terms of the plea. Sauceda Rivera, however, entered a plea agreement with the prosecution; he pleaded guilty to one count of money laundering, and the eleven counts of drug trafficking against him were dropped. The money laundering charge carried a sentence of up to 20 years in prison. During the trial, the prosecution stated that de la Cruz Reyna physically struggled with one of the U.S. agents during the armed standoff, and even tried to open one of the doors of their vehicle to grab them. However, de la Cruz Reyna said the statement was false and claimed he did not know they were U.S. agents when the incident occurred. The defense stated that de la Cruz Reyna was not a major figure in the Gulf Cartel and that he backed off from the standoff as soon as the U.S. agents identified themselves. His lawyer stated that de la Cruz Reyna was simply a bodyguard for the cartel and did not give orders during the standoff. \\"If they had been three Canadian tourists or Winter Texans, they would have probably been asked, 'Why are you passing by our house so many times?', his attorney told the judge, in reference to the U.S. agents surveillance of C√°rdenas Guill√©n's house the day of the standoff. De la Cruz Reyna was facing up to five years in prison for each assault charge. The sentence also carried a US$250,000 fine and three years of supervised release. On 3 July 2009, de la Cruz Reyna was sentenced to a -year term in prison for the assault charges. His fines were waived because of to his inability to pay them, and he was prohibited from lawfully re-entering the U.S. upon his release. He was imprisoned at the federal penitentiary in Atlanta, Georgia. De la Cruz Reyna was the first person convicted from the Matamoros standoff. Bribery scheme and re-arrest On 14 March 2012, the month de la Cruz Reyna was expected to be released from prison, he was re-arrested on bribery charges. According to S.D. Tex. attorney Kenneth Magidson, de la Cruz Reyna and several of his accomplices tried to bribe a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) undercover agent to ensure safe passage to Mexico upon his release. They also asked the official to ensure that de la Cruz Reyna's release was not revealed to Mexican authorities, and that he be allowed to see his family while in prison. According to U.S. authorities, around May 2011, de la Cruz Reyna's associate, Julio Torres, began negotiating bribery payments with the undercover agent to arrange for de la Cruz Reyna's release in Matamoros to members of the Gulf Cartel. De la Cruz Reyna was worried that upon his release to Mexico, he faced possible re-arrest by Mexican authorities or capture by rival drug gangs if released in another location in Mexico. The undercover agent was paid US$4,000 to arrange for de la Cruz Reyna's transfer to Texas, and spoke with him over the phone to discuss the payment and arrange for additional payments. On 28 June 2011, the undercover agent was introduced to another associate, Adalberto N√∫√±ez Venegas, who de la Cruz Reyna appointed to make the future payments on his behalf. Over the course of six months, Torres and N√∫√±ez Venegas made eight payments totaling US$542,090 to the undercover agent. They also pledged six properties as collateral for an additional US$460,000 they had agreed with the agent. In September 2011, the undercover agent showed de la Cruz Reyna his identification to prove he was an immigration officer after he had asked to see it. In January 2012, the agent met with de la Cruz Reyna to discuss the final payment and his transfer to Texas. In February 2012, Torres introduced the agent to Carlos Melo, another associate, who said he was aware of the bribery scheme and had agreed to be de la Cruz Reyna's driver. On 12 March 2012, Gaspar Mart√≠nez Montes, another associate involved in the conspiracy, crossed the U.S. -Mexico border with US$134,003 and told customs officials the money was to be used to purchase items for his business. That day, he met with Torres and Juan Trejo Venegas, another associate, and delivered a US$250,010 payment to the undercover agent. The following day, the agent met with Torres, Melo, N√∫√±ez Venegas, Mart√≠nez Montes, Trejo Venegas, and another associate Jos√© Cruz Venegas Esquivel, to discuss the logistics of de la Cruz Reyna's release. Torres and Melo told the agent they would transport de la Cruz Reyna in one vehicle, and that N√∫√±ez Venegas and Venegas Esquivel would escort them in another. On 14 March, a group of ICE agents arrested six of the conspirators at gunpoint inside a restaurant in Brownsville. Witnesses stated that the officers arrived at the restaurant in unmarked police cars and raided the patio where the conspirators were dining; De la Cruz Reyna was re-arrested in a Rio Grande Valley penitentiary. He had been transferred there from Bayview, Texas, after arriving from Atlanta on 9 March. Three of the conspirators appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge Ronald G. Morgan for an initial hearing on 16 March. The rest waived their preliminary hearings on 20 March, but Morgan ordered all of them held without bond in federal custody because he believed their close ties to Mexico meant they were flight risks. By the end of the scheme, the bribery payments totalled nearly US$800,000. =Conviction= On 10 April 2012, the conspirators were indicted in Brownsville on bribery charges. They appeared in court again on 18 April, and each of them pleaded not guilty separately. Morgan scheduled a pre-trial hearing on 29 May and jury selection for 31 May. On 23 April, de la Cruz Reyna, N√∫√±ez Venegas, Trejo Venegas, and Venegas Esquivel, pleaded guilty to the bribery charges. On 8 May, Torres and Montes Mart√≠nez pleaded guilty. On 18 May, the last conspirator, Melo, also pleaded guilty. Some of them entered a plea agreement to receive lower sentences. De la Cruz Reyna entered a blind plea, which mean that he did not finalize the sentence he was to receive for pleading guilty. The bribery charge carried up to 15 years in prison, a US$250,000 fine, and three years of supervised release. On 8 October 2012, Judge Hanan sentenced de la Cruz Reyna to 135 months, slightly over 11 years, in prison for bribery. He was also ordered to pay US$100,000 in fines. The other conspirators, Torres, Melo, Montes Mart√≠nez, Trejo Venegas, and Venegas Esquivel, were sentenced to 120, 84, 46, 46, and 24 months, respectively. N√∫√±ez Venegas was sentenced to 66 months in January 2013. During his sentence, de la Cruz Reyna apologized for his crime, and stated that he tried to bribe the agent to protect his life upon his release to Mexico. He said he had no intention of rejoining the Gulf Cartel and wanted to apologize to his family and children in person. The defense team complained that the undercover agent upped the payment amounts for \\"sentencing entrapment\\" to increase the length of de la Cruz Reyna's jail sentence. However, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jody Young stated that each of the payments were made for specific things de la Cruz Reyna requested, and they were made to establish good faith with those involved. Young stated that the money used in the conspiracy derived from the proceeds of the Gulf Cartel's drug dealings. Hanen stated that he believed the defendants knew that the official they were trying to bribe was a high-ranking officer in the agency. Otherwise, he said they would not have paid the large sums of money they did to get de la Cruz Reyna released on his specific terms. On 23 April 2013, de la Cruz Reyna issued a request to the U.S. Department of Justice asking to be sent to Mexico to fulfill the remainder of his sentence through the International Prisoner Transfer Program. He was imprisoned at the Federal Correctional Institution in Big Spring, Texas, and his expected release date is on 14 October 2021.

After travelling to Japan with her husband in 1895, she wrote several books on Japanese women and her own fascination with the country. In the 1890s, she became involved in the women's movement, speaking about culture and religion at the Kvindelig L√¶seforening (Women's Reading Society). She also joined the Danske Kvinders Forsvarsforening (Danish Women's Defence Association) and the women's department of the Red Cross. In 1904, she participated in the founding conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance (IWSA) in Berlin. In 1906, she founded and headed the women's suffrage organization Kvindevalgretsklubben which was a member of the Danske Kvindeforeningers Valgretsforbund (Danish Women's Society Suffrage Union). She was a delegate at the IWSA conferences in Amsterdam (1908) and London (1909). Biography Born on 13 May 1844 in R√∏nne, Bornholm, Johanne Elisabeth Johnson was the daughter of the ship owner Peter Johnson (1786‚Äì1850) and Maren Kirstine Sonne (1801‚Äì1882). In 1865, she married the naval officer Alexander Herman Jacob Balthasa M√ºnter (1837‚Äì1932). From 1873, she spent 10 years in Malm√∂, Sweden, where her husband was director of a shipyard as well as Danish consul. In 1883, she moved to Copenhagen while her husband was working in the Far East as a military adviser in China and Japan. Johanne M√ºnter increasingly experienced marital difficulties with her husband, especially when she visited him in Japan in 1895. The trip had nevertheless inspired her to lecture on her travels and publish books recounting her experiences. In particular, her Minder fra Japan described the status of Japanese women and her own fascination with the exotic land. She became interested in the women's movement after the 1895 Copenhagen Women's Exhibition and the influence of suffrage campaigners in the late 1890s. She also studied and wrote about Buddhism and Shintoism which she did see as incompatible with Christianity. In 1901, she published Buddhismens Historie (The History of Buddhism) and in 1914 Den esoteriske Buddhisme (Esoteric Buddhism). In regard to the women's movement, she became a member of the Danske Kvinders Forsvarsforening (Danish Women's Defence Association) and joined the women's section of the Red Cross. In 1904, she attended the founding conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance (IWSA) in Berlin and was also a delegate at the IWSA conferences in Amsterdam (1908) and London (1909). In 1906, she founded and headed the women's suffrage organization Kvindevalgretsklubben (KVK) which became known as \\"Fru M√ºnters Club\\". Although it had only about a hundred members, many of them were highly influential women in regard to suffrage and rights. It was associated with Danske Kvindeforeningers Valgretsforbund where M√ºnter was international secretary from 1904 until 1909, when Thora Daugaard took the position. She edited the KVK members' journal Kvindestemmerets-Bladet (1907‚Äì1913). She also contributed articles to Berlingske Tidende, Damernes Blad, Kvindernes Blad and Husmoderens Blad.

The school is divided into four sections, comprising the Pre-Preparatory School, Preparatory School, Senior School and Sixth Form. The current head teacher is Benson Ferrari.  History  The school was first established in 1923 and has been situated in the east Llanelli village of Bryn since 1928. The school was originally established by the Rees brothers, with Percy Rees as the founding Headmaster. Upon retirement of the Rees' brothers, former head boy Mr Vaughan-Evans was appointed Headmaster in 1962. The school's main building, St. David's House, dates back to the 19th century and was originally a large house belonging to a local industrialist. The school's Pre-Preparatory School is housed in a converted former public house, The Royal Oak, which was purchased by the school in 2012  Ownership  The school was acquired in 2019 by Chinese company Bright Scholar, as part of a ¬£150m purchase of colleges in the UK. Bright Scholar is also the largest operator of international and bilingual schools in China. The deal for St Michael's, along with Bosworth Independent College, specifically cost the company a sum of ¬£38m.  Results  The school offers GCSE and A-Level qualifications, with 60.9% of all A-Level entries graded A* or A in 2018, winning the Sunday Times 2018 Welsh Independent Secondary School of the Year award.  Incidents  In 2012 the school appeared in national headlines after accusations arose that education officers at Cognita UK, a rival education company, had posed as parents at St Michael's in order to obtain commercial information. Cognita at the time operated nearby Ffynone House School in Swansea but denied all of the allegations. In 2016 the school was twice the victim of hoax calls warning of a bomb on the school estate. The school twice evacuated its premises, and a heavy police presence was required to confirm the communications were both in fact a hoax. The threat was linked to a number of other hoaxes around that time including threats to schools in Kent and Newcastle. Notable former pupils Notable former pupils of St Michaels' include: *Robert Buckland MP, politician, Lord Chancellor *Cerys Matthews, singer *Kirsty Williams AM, politician, Minister for Education and Skills for Wales *Ivor Richard, politician and diplomat, British Ambassador to the United Nations *Si√¢n Gwenllian AM, politician St Michael's alumna and singer Cerys Matthews has acknowledged in interviews that her career benefited from attending St. Michael's, because \\"through the public school system, you've had so many leg ups\\", and avoids playing music by privately educated acts on her 6 Music show.

Paustenbach PhD, CIH, DABT, (Born Oct 29, 1952) is an American scientist, businessman, researcher, and author. Dennis is currently President of Paustenbach and Associates, which is a consulting firm who uses risk assessment techniques to characterize occupational and environmental health hazards. He is the founder and former president of ChemRisk, a consulting firm specializing in the use of toxicology and risk assessment to characterize the hazards of chemicals in soil, air, water, food, sediments and consumer products. He was, for about 4 years, a Group Vice-President of Exponent. Paustenbach has published nearly 300 peer reviewed papers in scientific journals, about 50 book chapters, and has presented nearly 350 papers at various scientific conferences during his career. He was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree from Purdue University in 2006 and a Doctor of Engineering from the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in 2007. He has given expert testimony in many courts regarding the health hazards posed by dioxins, talc, asbestos, benzene, lead, chromium, beryllium, carbon monoxide, cobalt, chlorinated solvents, and other chemicals. Early life and education Paustenbach was born in Tarentum, Pennsylvania in 1952. He left his hometown after first grade and moved to Akron, Ohio, where he attended St. Matthews. His family later moved to Strasburg, Ohio, which was in a rural setting adjacent to many Amish communities, where he attended high school. In 1974, Paustenbach graduated from the Rose Polytechnic Institute with a BS in Chemical Engineering and joined Eli Lilly and Company. After working Eli Lilly for two years as a process engineer, he felt that he wanted to study further. He left his job and enrolled at University of Michigan for an MS in Industrial Hygiene and Toxicology, which he completed in 1977. He later earned a PhD in environmental toxicology from Purdue University in 1982. While studying for his PhD, he founded the undergraduate/graduate programs in industrial hygiene at Purdue. After his PhD, he worked as the head of Risk Assessment at Stauffer Chemical in Westport, Connecticut. Career Paustenbach twice started the environmental consulting firm ChemRisk. The firm applied the principles of health risk assessment to quantitatively characterize the risk to humans of chemicals in foods, water, air, sediment, soil, and consumer products. They had about 125 persons in 8 locations in the U.S. In 1993, Paustenbach was selected to be the President and CEO of McLaren-Hart Environmental Engineering; a national firm with 15 offices and 600 employees. He was the youngest CEO in the U.S. of a major firm in this industry. In the 1980s and 1990s, Paustenbach conducted research into the dioxins and furans. Among his first major undertakings was characterizing the health hazards posed by dioxin contaminated soil including the site in Times Beach, Missouri. In the 1990s, he conducted research evaluating the hazards posed by occupational exposure to pharmaceuticals, benzene, beryllium, and formaldehyde. Also, in the 1990s, he published many studies which evaluated the exposure and health hazards associated with exposure to hexavalent chromium which were pertinent to Hinkley, CA and Hudson County, NJ. He worked on visible sites like Rocky Mountain, Oak Ridge, and Hanford. From about 2000 to 2018, he conducted risk assessments on as many as 1,000 exposure scenarios including asbestos exposure of auto mechanics, benzene exposure in refineries, lead in consumer products, arsenic in wine, perfluorinated chemical in groundwater, MCHM in drinking water, and the hydrocarbons in drinking water. Paustenbach and colleagues developed some of the earliest multi-pathway exposure risk assessment methods. Later, he conducted research involving the release of cobalt and chromium from medical devices over the years . Professor Paustenbach has served as an adjunct professor at six universities. Specifically, University of Texas (Houston), Purdue University, University of Bridgeport, University of Massachusetts (Amherst), University of California, Irvine School of Medicine (clinical professor of Occupational Medicine), University of Michigan (Ann Arbor), and University of Kansas Medical School (Kansas City). Philanthropy In recent years, Paustenbach was involved in fundraising for Bellarmine College Prep, The Sacred Heart Schools, Purdue University, The University of Michigan, The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, Peninsula Bridge of Menlo Park (California), and The Shakers of Sabbathday Lake (Maine) Books Two textbooks he authored/edited, The Risk Assessment of Environmental and Human Health Hazards: A Textbook of Case Studies (1989) and Human and Ecological Risk Assessment: Theory and Practice (2002).

It is best known as being an experimental electronic cult classic and as one of Rabelais' most profound and detailed (while being sparse and minimalist in tone) works. Background Spellewauerynsherde (spell wavering shard) was created with Rabelais' own experimental electroacoustic audio processing software, Arge√Øphontes Lyre, which he had begun his musical career creating material for albums with, with varying musical sources. For example, on Eisoptrophobia (2001), he processed recordings of himself playing impressionist piano pieces, and on ...B√©n√©diction, Draw. (2003), he processed recordings of guitar improvisations and extended them. However, Spellewauerynsherde was created from vocal recordings due to a circumstance that Rabelais appreciated: while looking through his closet, he came across a cassette tape of what appeared to be Icelandic female lament songs recorded in the 1960s and 1970s. Intrigued by the content of the tape, he digitally cleaned up the recordings, and began processing and rearranging them with Arge√Øphontes Lyre, leading to the creation of the album. \\"I didn't want to abstract it so much that it lost its essential quality,\\" said Rabelais of the source material; \\"I didn't want to damage the fabric of the original language, I wanted to set it, cast it in a certain light.\\" The album, despite its primarily avant-garde style, has an ambient tone which has been described as 'a curious and compelling mixture of the medieval and the modern'. Being that the album is entirely composed of and processed from vocal recordings, it has been described as an experimental a cappella record. The track titles on the album are composed of definitions from early editions of the Oxford English Dictionary (including references to the works of English poets John Gower and John Milton) which Rabelais has confessed to being inspired by: the album is accompanied by a poem written by Rabelais which features Old English spellings of words. Composition On the opening track, \\"1382 Wyclif Gen. ii. 7\\", a vocal line, the first that is sampled from the lament song recordings used on Spellewauerynsherde, 'slips gently into a kind of canonic imitation of itself as a cloud of reverberant resonance drifts in from afar'. The centerpiece of the album, \\"1483 Caxton Golden Leg. 208 b/2\\", is a distinctive drone piece that, while incorporating tones from the recordings, is 'gather[ed] into an eerie microtonal cloud' that has been compared to Gy√∂rgy Ligeti's choral works that were used in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Meanwhile, \\"(Gorgeous Curves Lovely Fragments...)\\" is the album's most expressive piece, with multitracked and backmasked arrangements of another individual lament song that occasionally dip out into reverberation. The album closes with \\"1671 Milton Samson 1122\\", a reprise of the opening track which features more reverberation and droning. Critical reception Upon its 2017 vinyl reissue (on both clear and gold vinyl) by Boomkat Editions (which Rabelais specifically created a reedit of the album for), record distributor Boomkat praised Spellewauerynsherde, calling it 'one of the 21st century‚Äôs most enigmatic and haunting albums'. They commented that on the album, he performs a 'hypermodern animism on ostensibly dead musical material ‚Äî dead as in hardly anyone knows or plays them in the modern age', calling the overall album 'one of the most magickal, perplexing and strangely life-giving records that you‚Äôll likely ever hear'.

Prior to World War II, he was a rabbi and rosh yeshiva in P√°pa, Hungary. Greenwald was the son of Rabbi Yaakov Yechezkiah Greenwald of Pupa - author of Vayaged Yaakov (1882-1941), son of Rabbi Moshe Greenwald of Chust - author of Arugas HaBosem. Greenwald was a devoted Belzer Hasid. After the war, he settled in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and established the contemporary Pupa Hasidic movement. He travelled to Belz many times before World War II, and after the war, he made the trip from the United States to Israel to visit Aharon Rokeach, the fourth Rebbe of Belz.  Biography  = Early life = Greenwald was born on Wednesday, the 24th of Elul 5663 (16 September 1903), in Brezovica, Hungary.http://www.mytzadik.com/tzadik.aspx?id=1014 In his youth, he studied Torah in his father's yeshiva in P√°pa, Hungary. In 1925, he married Chana, the daughter of his grandfather's brother Rabbi Ya'akov Yechezkiya Greenwald, who was orphaned by her father and adopted by her father's brother, Rabbi Eliezer David Greenwald (author of Keren Ledovid), who lived in Satmar (Romania) and began to serve as dayan. He published the books of Eliezer David Greenwald, and after his death on the 1st of Sivan, he replaced him as the head of the Keren Ledovid Yeshiva, which numbered about 100 students. = Rabbinical career = After his father's death in 1941, Greenwald moved to Papa (Hungary), and began to serve as rabbi and Rosh Yeshivah. He brought additional students from Satmar to study in the yeshiva, and hid some sixty young men who fled from Slovakia and Poland and escaped from labor camps, despite the danger involved. Day and night, he worked hard to study the revealed and hidden Torah, and sometimes, he came to the yeshiva late in the night to see that the students were not spending their time. He used to learn \\"Shnayim mikra ve-echad targum\\" from the Sefer Torah. On Friday night, he led a Tish for the hundreds of yeshiva students and balebatim from the community who came to his home, and every Shabbos afternoon, he said a sermon in the great Beit Midrash of the community and taught Pirkei Avot. Before Seudah Shlishit, he used to immerse in the mikvah. Since the yeshiva numbered close to 400 young men, it was decided in the year 5713 (c. 1953 CE) to enlarge the yeshiva building. = World War II = On Lag BaOmer 5704 (Thursday, 11 May 1944), Greenwald was sent to an Arbeitslager (Nazi labor camp), and despite the harsh conditions and ill treatment imposed by the Nazis, he continued to study Torah together with forty yeshiva students who stayed with him in the camp. On the 17th of Tammuz 5704, his mother was murdered together with the Jews of P√°pa. Toward the end of World War II, he was miraculously saved from being sent to a concentration camp in Germany, and hid in the Glass House in Budapest (Hungary). When the Holocaust ended, Greenwald learned that his wife and ten children had been murdered. After the war, he returned to P√°pa and began restoring the glory of Pupa. He re-established the Yeshiva, and tried to rehabilitate the community. In the post-Holocaust years, the Rebbe provided lodging and meals for hundreds of young men, and re-established his yeshiva. As both father and mother, the Pupa Rebbe arranged sustenance and marriages for his orphaned students. He married the daughter of Rabbi Yissachar Weber. In the year 5706 (c. 1946 CE), he moved with the yeshiva, which numbered approximately sixty young men, to Szombathely (Hungary), and later to Antwerp (Belgium), where he lived for several years. = United States = In 1950, Greenwald emigrated to the United States, settling in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn with several students, where he started his congregation and yeshiva anew. He became famous as a great genius throughout the Torah, Shas, and Poskim, founded the congregation \\"Kehilath Yaacov - Pupa\\", and continued as Admor of the Pupa Chassidut. He founded orphanages and educational institutions for refugees from Papa, kindergartens, Talmud Torah, Mesivta, and Kollel for yeshiva students. In 1979, Greenwald established the Toldos Yaakov institutions in Jerusalem.

As one of the leading rabbinic authorities in Williamsburg, he had close relationships with the other rabbis who lived there, including his uncle Rabbi Levi Yitzchok Greenwald, Rav of Tzehlim, and Rabbi Yoel Teitelbaum, the Satmar Rebbe. In 5740 (c. 1980 CE), he was appointed president of the Central Rabbinical Congress of the United States and Canada. On the first day of Rosh Hashana, thousands came to receive his blessing, including rabbis and Admorim. During the Purim meal, he allowed all the participants to ask the most difficult questions, and responded immediately to each questioner. He married his daughters to Rabbi Yaakov Shlomo Meislish and Moshe HaLevi Rosner.

The fourth and the last tropical cyclone to be formed in June of the 1990 Pacific typhoon season, Typhoon Percy originated from an area of disturbed weather spawned by the Western Pacific monsoon trough on June 20\\\\. That same day, the disturbance was classified as a tropical depression as it slowly organized and on June 21, the depression obtained tropical storm intensity. After initially tracking westward, Percy turned towards the southwest while slowly deepening. During this time, Percy affected several of the Carolina Islands. Thirty homes were damaged and airline services were halted in and out of Yap. Farther south- southwest, seven homes were destroyed on the Ngulu Atoll. Furthermore, one boy was killed on Koror, where numerous homes lost their roofs and communication lines were downed. Percy then turned back to the west-northwest and became a typhoon on June 23\\\\. It then began to deepen at a faster rate, with Percy attaining its maximum intensity of on June 25\\\\. Two days later, on June 27, increased wind shear began to induce a weakening trend and the typhoon brushed Luzon, where eight people were killed and over 30,000 lost their homes. Despite that however, damages in the country was minor. After tracking through the South China Sea, Percy made landfall southwest of Xiamen on June 29, and on the next day, dissipated inland. In the province of Quanzhou, four people were killed while 100,000 trees were damaged along with 1,000 power lines. One person was killed in Zhangzhou. In Dongshan, one individual died, four others suffered injuries, and a third of the trees were downed. Moreover, in the province of Shantou, 95 structures were destroyed and 201 were damaged. A total of 16 people were killed throughout southeastern China and more than 100 others sustained injuries. Damage was estimated at US$28 million (¬•190 million). Meteorological history Typhoon Percy originated from the eastern end of the Western Pacific monsoon trough that spawned an area of disturbed weather that was first noted by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) on the morning of June 20\\\\. Satellite imagery showed signs of a well-defined low- level circulation and the disturbance was situated in a weakly divergent environment aloft along with persistent convection. On the same day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the system into a tropical depression. The system gradually became more organized as its outflow expanded, and following a marked increase in convection, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system at 03:00 UTC on June 21\\\\. Following a ship report of winds, both the JTWC and JMA upgraded the system into Tropical Storm Percy. After initially tracking westward, Percy turned and tracked southwestward for 36 hours, a move predicted by tropical cyclone forecast models but not foreseen by the JTWC. Meanwhile, the storm slowly intensified, aided by the development of an anticyclone caused aloft. As Percy continued to intensify, Percy began to track west-northwestward around another upper-level anticyclone that was formed in the southeast of Typhoon Ofelia which would later merge with a subtropical ridge to its north. By June 22, Percy was upgraded into a severe tropical storm by the JMA. Following the development of an outflow channel to its south, hints of an eye became visible on satellite imagery. Based on a Dvorak classification of T4.0/, the JTWC upgraded Percy into a typhoon on the evening of June 23, with the JMA subsequently following suit in the morning of June 24. After moving away from the Caroline Islands, the typhoon began to intensify at a faster clip as an outflow channel to its north opened, even though the eye was initially ragged. On the evening of June 24, the JTWC raised the intensity of the system to . Early on the next day, the JTWC estimated that Percy obtained its peak intensity based on the Dvorak estimate of T6.0/ and a clear eye. Meanwhile, the JMA reported that Percy attained its maximum intensity of and a minimum barometric pressure of . Increased vertical wind shear took toll on the storm, and by June 27, the JTWC dropped the intensity of the storm to as the storm passed over northeastern Luzon. Overland, the storm weakened slightly, but remained a typhoon upon entering the South China Sea. Both computer models and the JTWC expected Percy to begin recurvature; however, the subtropical ridge did not weaken as expected and Percy continued west-northwest instead. At 00:00 UTC on June 29, the JMA downgraded Percy to a severe tropical storm, although the JTWC suggested that Percy was still a typhoon at the time. Shortly thereafter, Percy moved onshore around southwest of Xiamen. At 06:00 UTC, the JTWC downgraded Percy into a tropical storm, noting that the storm had become less organized. By June 30, both the JTWC and JMA had ceased tracking the system, which had dissipated inland. Impact During its formative stages, Percy affected several of the Caroline Islands. The storm first passed about south of Sorol. The island of Pegelmol was nearly cut in half by the system. Taro patches, coconut trees, and other crops were almost completely wiped out. Percy came within of Yap to the south-southwest, where gusts of up to were felt. There, widespread flooding was reported due to storm surge, with most roads on the island requiring closure and 30 homes being damaged. Airline services in and out Yap were halted. To the south-southwest of Yap, the island of Ngulu Atoll bore the brunt of the typhoon. Gusts of up to resulted in the destruction of all crops on the island. Furthermore, seven homes were demolished while many others only lost their roofs. However, there were no fatalities. The typhoon passed north of Koror, where a boy perished when he was swept by rain into mangrove trees near his home. Meanwhile, radio towers, power lines and television lines were downed as several houses lost their roofs. Typhoon Percy was the third typhoon of 1990, and second within a week, after Typhoon Ofelia, to threaten the Philippines. In the province of La Union, landslides killed six people. In suburban Quezon City, police reported that a woman fell into a creek and drowned. The Philippine Red Cross indicated that a baby girl drowned and two other individuals were listed as missing in floods in the Ilocos Region. According to the social welfare department, 31,206 people in 6,143 families lost their homes. Overall, damage in the country was light. The typhoon posed enough of a threat to Hong Kong to warrant a No 1. hurricane signal briefly, but it was dropped within 24 hours. Nevertheless, a pressure of was measured at the Hong Kong Royal Observatory early on June 29. Waglan Island recorded a mean hourly wind of , with a gust of . High Island received of rain during the passage of the storm, the highest in the region, fell in a 24-hour period. These rains resulted in flooding, especially in the New Territories, where there was slight damage to crops. In Kwai Chung, floodwaters were deep, sweeping away a ten-year-old boy. Two other villages lost power and eleven people had to be evacuated. In the provinces of Fujian and Guangdong, power lines were downed. Farm production was reduced by 400 million catties in Fujian. In Nan'ao, gales persisted for about 10 hours and more than of rainfall was recorded, the heaviest in 300 years. Floodwaters there were up to deep. In Quanzhou, four people were killed, another was injured, and of crops were damaged. There, 100,000 trees were damaged along with 1,000 power lines. One person was killed and tens of millions USD in damage was reported in Zhangzhou. In Dongshan, one individual died and four others suffered injuries. A total of of asparagus were damaged. One vessel was sunk and seven more were damaged. One third of the trees there were downed. Damage in Dongshan was estimated at ¬•27 million (US$5.7 million). Elsewhere, of farmland was flooded, including of rice in Shantou. Ninety-five structures were destroyed and two hundred and one were damaged. Roughly of a highway was destroyed.

It is the most commonly found isocrinine species in west Atlantic Ocean. Morphology As members of the order Isocrinida, E. parrae possess a heteromorphic stalk that is made of calcareous nodal columns. Their body is mostly made of porous ossicles, with minimal soft tissue connecting the calcareous structure. The stalks can measure 50.5 cm in some subspecies, but average between 10.2 cm and 23.5 cm. The stalks average between 4‚Äì5mm in diameter, and are connected to between 23 and 58 feeding arms that branch off radially around the mouth and anus. While some subspecies of E. parrae possess arms with a smooth dorsal surface, others have been shown to exhibit a serrated dorsal surface, while others have shown morphology that is between the two characteristics, not quiet smooth but not fully serrated. Cirri allow the crinoid to attach itself to the sediment and continue upwards along the stalk. Distribution and habitat Endoxocrinus parrae is found in benthic communities between 200‚Äì1000m deep in the western Atlantic Ocean, and Indo- West Pacific Ocean though it is most common between 500-600m. It has been found as far north as the Florida strait and as far south as Brazil, and is native to tropical benthic communities. E. parrae has been shown to grown at a more rapid rate in shallower depths due to temperature, but also exhibit less growth in areas without a strong flow of water. As E. parrae are filter feeders, a strong current is required for them to obtain necessary nutrients and energy for growth and survival. They are most commonly found in large groups along areas of good water flow, such as along ridges, boulders, and mounds. E. parrae have also been observed crawling along the sea floor from areas of low flow to higher flow. Feeding biology and behavior As filter feeders, Endoxocrinus parrae use their large branching arms to collect food from the water column. About 60% of the gut content of E. parrae has been found to be detritus, suggesting that they mostly feed on marine snow and other particulate matter in the water column. While feeding, E. parrae will selectively feed on small, organic particles, and have been documented waving their arms in response to capturing large, inorganic particles. This waving action flings the particles away from the crinoid's mouth, keeping it clean. Along the ocean floor, E. parrae is often preyed upon by pencil urchins such as Calocidaris micans. The stomachs of C. mican collected around E. parrae contained large amounts of crinoid stems and soft tissue. In response to this, Endoxocrinus parrae have been observed detaching itself and using its cirri to move across the bottom of the ocean away from the predator. In addition, it is believed that the crinoids offer part of their stem up to the pencil urchin, allowing it time to flee while the urchin feeds. E. parrae have reached speeds of up to 140 m per hour while crawling across the sea floor. Subspecies While originally thought to be three separate species- Endoxocrinus parrae, Endoxocrinus prionedes, and Endoxocrinus carolinae, are now recognized as three subspecies of Endoxocrinus parrae. The speciation of E. parrae has been hypothesized to be a result of different environmental conditions. *Endoxocrinus parrae parrae *Endoxocrinus parrae prionedes *Endoxocrinus parrae carolinae References Category:Crinoidea Category:Isocrinida ","title":"Endoxocrinus parrae"},{"id":"59685745","text":"The Malta-Gozo Tunnel is a planned tunnel development between the islands of Malta and Gozo (both part of the Republic of Malta), which are currently linked by the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) through a ferry from ƒäirkewwa in Malta to Mƒ°arr in Gozo.  Background and purpose  The Government of Malta has embarked on a long-term strategy to address the accessibility between Malta and Gozo, addressing the everyday problems being experienced by Gozitans to travel to Malta to their place of work. Transport Malta, addressing the constant yearly increase of the number of vehicles crossing between Malta and Gozo, has stated that the introduction of a fixed link would: * Reduce average journey times between Gozo and Malta by at least 40 minutes, and the tunnel would ensure that commuters have more control on their travelling schedule. * Provide a second means of travel between the two islands. * Reap benefits from increase in influx of tourism. * Increases in general economic activities. Transport Malta stated that the project works are expected to be divided in the following main phases and approximate durations: * Planning and Design: 3 years * Mobilization at the portal areas: 3 months * Excavation works: 3 years * Finishing works: 1 year * Testing and completion: 3 months * Operation and financing: 20 years * Hand-over and commissioning to Transport Malta: 6 months  History  = Discussion (pre-2011) = Discussions for the development of a Malta‚ÄìGozo tunnel, or a general permanent link between Malta and Gozo, were first discussed in the late 1960s at the Gozo Civic Council ‚Äì the first type of regional committee in the Maltese islands. Society for the Union of the Maltese Islands (SUMI) was especially established to advocate the construction of a permanent link between the islands. SUMI's chairman, Cauchi, underlined that ‚Äúthe unification of the national territory is a National Issue, and it is unhighly patriotic of any Maltese to oppose what should be an eminently non-controversial cause‚Ä¶ future generations will cast shame and dishonour on those who will have done so‚Äù. Cauchi believed that ‚Äúunity at all levels is a most indispensable asset in such a small nation as Malta, where the collective effort of all the component parts of the country and of every citizen should be channelled to the attainment of economic viability‚Äù. In March 1972 the Maltese government commissioned the Overseas Technical Cooperation Agency of the Government of Japan to carry out a preliminary survey report on a possible permanent link between the two islands. Since then no notable talks about a tunnel were discussed until 2011. = Discussion (2011‚Äìpresent) = Talks for the development of a Malta‚ÄìGozo tunnel resumed most notably in February 2011, when Chris Said, the former Parliamentary Secretary for Public Dialogue and Information, talked about the ramifications of a tunnel link between Malta and Gozo. The Malta‚ÄìGozo tunnel is set to run between Imbordin in St. Paul's Bay and Ta‚Äô Kenuna in Nadur, according to studies being considered by the government. The Malta‚ÄìGozo tunnel will be 13km-long tunnel and is planned to have a seven-metre radius and one traffic lane heading in either direction, with an additional emergency lane. The tunnel project is estimated to cost ‚Ç¨300 million, with a lifetime of around 100 years.https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/64031/gozo_tunnel_movement_project_2028 The planning and design of the tunnel is expected to take place till 2021 or 2022. Excavation of the tunnel is expected to take place till 2021 or 2022 and finishing works till 2023. This concludes that the tunnel will be ready by 2024. The main proposed tunnel's purpose is to make it easier for Gozitans, mostly workers and students, to arrive to Malta without using the Gozo Channel Line ferry. The tunnel can also cause the Gozo ferries to eventually wear out and will have to be decommissioned by 2030, according to projections by economist Gordon Cordina. Cordina also predicted that the replacement will cost around ‚Ç¨120 million, with maintenance and fuel costs estimated at a further ‚Ç¨21 million per year. On 3 November 2017, Capital Projects Minister Ian Borg said that a phase of studies has been carried out, from 18 October 2017, as part of the Malta‚ÄìGozo tunnel project. Borg said in a statement that contractor Geotec Spa, which won a tender in June 2017, started extracting investigative samples from different spots on land and at sea. Borg also added that, \\"this is being done in collaboration with the Environmental Resources Authority to ensure the least environmental impact possible\\". Michael Grech, an ex-President of the Gozo Business Chamber and a member of the sub-committee on the Malta‚ÄìGozo tunnel said, \\"there is a whole host of benefits for the island which would include the possible return of Gozitans from Malta, more economic prosperity and more manageable flows of tourists and Maltese on holiday.\\" On 2 June 2018, Prime Minister Joseph Muscat had said work on the tunnel linking Malta and Gozo should start before the end of this legislature and could be finalized as soon as 2024. On 11 December 2018, the Ministry for Transport confirmed that the Malta‚ÄìGozo tunnel project plans are expected to be published within May or June 2019. The Ministry stated that ‚ÄúIt is intended that the tunnel will have two lanes, one in each direction, width of 3.25m to 3.50m, a central buffer area in between with a width of approx. 1.00m, and a 1.00m wide shoulder on both sides of the carriageway.‚Äù The Ministry also added that the tunnel structure itself will be constructed with concrete segments and include infrastructural systems for ventilation, illumination, water drainage and pumping. Ian Borg said the tender for the design, building, maintenance, and operation of the tunnel would be published some time in 2019.  Public opinion  = Surveys = In May 2017, Marvin Formosa, a Maltese sociologist, carried out a social impact assessment among 250 Gozitans, which found that 82% of respondents were in favor of the tunnel. The survey found that younger respondents favored the project more than older respondents and a similar trend was observed amongst those with different education and employment levels: those attaining a higher level or education and those in employment favoured the project. Formosa said that 4.4% of the survey's respondents said there were no advantages to the tunnel while 46.6% said they could not think of any disadvantages. Marvin Formosa also carried out another social impact assessment report. His report stated that the main reasons the respondents stated about why they support the tunnel project is that it would create more work for Gozitans, ease the accessibility between Malta and Gozo, decrease the traveling time between Gozo and Malta and increase levels of Gozitans socializing with the Maltese people and vice versa. Between 5 November and 8 November 2018, a survey conducted by Malta Today among 600 people across Malta and Gozo found that 63.1% of people agree with the construction of a Malta‚ÄìGozo tunnel, while 24.4% disagree. It found out that 66% of Gozitans agreed with a construction of a tunnel, 9.5% opposed it, and 24.5% were unsure. From the political parties' side, 74.7% and 48.8% of Labour Party voters and Nationalist Party voters agree with the project respectively, while 37.9% disagreed with the project. = Support = The most notable organisation in favour of the tunnel project is Front Favur Il-Mina (FFM), a group founded by some university students in December 2015. The Gozo University Group is also in favor of the project, stating that ‚Äújust like the 82% of the Gozitan population, the organisation is in favour of the tunnel project and believes that it would be beneficial to all Gozitans who travel to work and study on the mother island and also for the economy of the Gozitan island to flourish.‚Äù  Political opinions  Politicians elected from the Gozitan district are generally in favour of this policy agenda. In 2008, Anton Refalo, the former Minister of Gozo, spoke favorably of a permanent link between the two islands on the basis that this would facilitate communication and transportation links and stop Gozo's dependence on the ferry service as the only means of transport. In 2011, Franco Mercieca, an elected parliamentarian from the Gozitan district, published an article in Gozo News calling for and supporting a permanent link between the islands. In 2016, Franco Mercieca wrote another article calling for easier accessibility between Malta and Gozo, however he also stated that he isn't surprised about people who criticize the project, stating that Gozo might lose its characteristics. Alan Deidun, a former politician, was not in favour of a permanent link between the island of Gozo and Malta. In 2010, Deidun wrote that ‚ÄúGozo should not become a carbon copy of Ibiza but instead should market its untamed, wild aspects. Safeguarding and promoting Gozo's uniqueness must be surely be the wisest tourism marketing strategy‚Äù. In January 2016, the Nationalist Party organized a General Convention on Gozo, with one news testimony reporting that the ‚Äúdebate on having a permanent link between Malta and Gozo was high on the agenda, with all speakers, ranging from University students to entrepreneur Michael Carauna, backing the idea‚Äù on the basis that such ‚Äúa huge investment would reverse Gozo's brain drain and boost its economy‚Äù.  Concerns  = Environmental = In June 2018, a study was conducted about the environmental impact of the tunnel. The study stated that about one million cubic metres of rock will be dragged out during the excavation of the tunnel, adding that it's more than the entire amount of construction waste disposed in a single year in Malta. On 6 July 2018, the Democratic Party has demanded that the government declares what its plans are, with regards to construction and demolition waste, describing it as a ‚Äúconstruction waste crisis.‚Äù The party stated that the projected tunnel project ‚Äúwill generate over one million tons of excavation waste,‚Äù which it said, ‚Äúis almost equivalent to what the construction industry generates in a whole year.‚Äù On 13 December 2018, Arnold Cassola, Democratic Alternative's party candidate for the MEP elections, and the former secretary general of the European Green Party, wrote an article for Times of Malta criticizing the development of the tunnel project, ending the article saying, \\"History, together with present and future Maltese and Gozitan generations, will damn you all for the wanton destruction of our country.\\" On 19 December 2018, Keith Buhagiar, a Maltese archaeologist, stated, \\"The excavation of the tunnel entrance, on the Malta-side portal, in the hamlet of L-Imbordin will destroy troglodyte dwellings dating back to the late medieval period, fertile agricultural land and other archaeological culturally-relevant remains\\". On 22 December 2018, a public activity on climate change was organized by AD≈ª Green Youth ‚Äî the youth wing of the Democratic Alternative party ‚Äî at City Gate in Valletta. Carmel Cacopardo, leader of the Democratic Alternative party and candidate for the European Parliament elections of 2019 and Mina Tolu, also a candidate for the 2019 European Parliament elections, addressed those present at the public activity. Cacopardo stated that the proposed tunnel is ‚Äúessentially a tunnel for the use of cars not for people. In fact it is estimated that the vehicle movement between the two islands is projected to increase from 3000 to 9000 vehicle movements daily over a fifteen year period.‚Äù Cacopardo added that ‚Äúa service provided for the movement of people would be a fast ferry service: from Gozo to the commercial centres of Malta. The encouragement of the use of cars is central to the projected tunnel as tolls are paid and collected from car owners.‚Äù Mina Tolu stated that ‚ÄúWe need investment to ensure efficient use of energy, as well as to ensure the transition to a sustainable economy and hundred per cent clean energy that better everyone's quality of life and combat climate change.‚Äù On 6 January 2019, Carmel Cacopardo, referring to the National Transport Master Plan 2025 approved for Malta in 2015, said that the plan is the solution to most of Malta's sustainable mobility issues. Cacopardo also believes the solution to the problem requires alternatives to the use of private cars and that the development of a tunnel is not one of them. = Alternatives = On 13 September 2016, Simon Busuttil, the former leader of the Nationalist Party, provided an alternative to the tunnel project by proposing the setting up of a modern train system for Malta and Gozo, saying that the way traffic congestion is increasing will soon make it difficult to go around the islands. On 3 September 2018, Alfred Sant, the former Prime Minister of Malta between 1996 and 1998 and current MEP, provided an alternative to the tunnel project by calling for a light railway system to be built to link Malta and Gozo. Sant said, \\"a metro network, similar to the London Underground, Glasgow Subway or Newcastle Metro could be a better option for Malta in the long run\\".

History Jamieson was born in Aberdeen, Scotland, the fourth son of Rev. George Jamieson of the Church of Scotland and his wife Jane Jamieson, n√©e Wallace. He was educated at Chanonry House School and at Aberdeen University, and in November 1874, not yet aged 15, was apprenticed to Matthew Boulton, Aberdeen City Engineer, and in 1879 was appointed his assistant, a post he held for five years. Page 443 is not accessible through this website, but the whole obituary has been copied verbatim on \\"Grace's Guide\\" reference below. In September 1883 he was, on the recommendation of Sir Robert Rawlinson, appointed Assistant Engineer in the Public Works Department of British Guiana, where much land had been reclaimed from the sea by dykes from when the country was a Dutch colony. Three years later he became Chief Assistant Engineer. He was of assistance to engineer William Russell, the \\"Sugar King of Demerara\\". :William Russell (13 March 1827 ‚Äì 28 March 1888) made several improvements to the process of sugarcane crushing, and was also largely responsible for establishing the East Demerara Water Conservancy, a water supply system for Georgetown, British Guiana. Russell Memorial Square, a triangular plot of land in front of the Stabroek Market, Georgetown, was named for him. The site featured a publicly funded bust of Russell. Russell Street in Georgetown was not named for him but for Lord John Russell, the English Prime Minister. Life in the tropics was deleterious to Jamieson's health, and in 1888 he retired from British Guiana's public service and sailed to Melbourne, Australia, where he set up in private practice at 39 Queen Street. His brother William Jamieson was by this time established as a mine manager in Broken Hill, New South Wales, and had co- founded the Broken Hill Water Supply Limited. No doubt influenced by his brother, Jamieson turned his focus to the mining industry, which had a great need for qualified engineers, and he was soon involved in design and oversight of crushing, concentrating and smelting plant. Around this time he became a director of the Lewis Ponds Gold and Silver Mining Company Limited Round Hill Silver Mining Company, Soudan Silver NMining Company, Pioneer Silver and Lead Mining Company, Limited, and others. Water supply to Broken Hill was always a vexed issue. When the local catchment was depleted, water was brought in by rail from Hutton's Lagoon, 12,000 gallons at a time, to be snapped up within days. In 1890 Jamieson and George Gordon founded the Broken Hill Water Supply Company, Limited, with plans to dam Stephens Creek, and pipe it in to \\"The Barrier\\". The scheme was moderately successful, and taken over by Broken Hill Proprietary around 1900.

A crash was avoided in a similar incident on 16 November 2018, when a Taban Airlines MD-88 carrying 155 people twice attempted to land on this runway, mistaking it for a longer 3,659-metre (12,005 ft) runway at Payam International Airport, which is nearly inline but 11 km away. The first approach was aborted at 11:26 hours and the aircraft circled for another attempt. The second approach was aborted at 11:29 and the aircraft continued for a safe landing at Payam Airport at 11:31. AAID Iran reported that the flight reached an altitude of 1 m above ground level during one of the approaches. The MD-88 requires a minimum of approximately 1,500m of runway to land safely, 500m more than the 981m runway at Fath Air Base.
