He became Attorney General for Ireland and formulated many of the legal principles that underpinned the British Empire. Early life Davies was born in Wiltshire, possibly at Chicksgrove Manor at Lower Chicksgrove, to John and Mary Davies. He was educated at Winchester College for four years, a period in which he showed much interest in literature. He studied there until the age of sixteen and went to further his education at the Queen's College, Oxford, where he stayed for a mere eighteen months, with most historians questioning whether he received a degree. Davies spent some time at New Inn after his departure from Oxford, and it was at this point that he decided to pursue a career in law. In 1588 he enrolled in the Middle Temple, where he did well academically, although suffering constant reprimands for his behaviour. Following several suspensions, his behaviour cost him his enrolment. Davies travelled to the Netherlands in 1592 with others of the Middle Temple (William Fleetwood, Richard Martin). There in Leiden he met the jurist Paul Merula, to whom the group had a letter of introduction from William Camden. In 1594 Davies's poetry brought him into contact with Queen Elizabeth. She wished him to continue his study of law at the Middle Temple and had him sworn in as a servant-in-ordinary. In the following year, his poem, Orchestra, was published in July, prior to his call to the bar from the Middle Temple. He was elected Member of Parliament for Shaftesbury in 1597. History of Parliament Online ‚Äì John Davies In February 1598 Davies was disbarred for the offence of entering the dining hall of the Inns in the company of two swordsmen and striking Richard Martin with a cudgel. The victim Martin was a noted wit who had insulted him in public, and Davies immediately took a boat at the Temple steps and retired to Oxford, where he chose to write poetry. Another of his works, Nosce Teipsum (\\"Know Thyself\\"), was published in 1599 and found favour with the queen and with Lord Mountjoy, later Lord Deputy of Ireland. Davies became a favourite of the queen, to whom he addressed his work Hymns of Astraea in 1599. Later that year, however, his Epigrams was included in a list of published works that the state ordered to be confiscated and burned. In 1601 he was readmitted to the bar, having made a public apology to Martin, and in the same year served as the member of Parliament for Corfe Castle. In 1603, he was part of the deputation sent to bring King James VI of Scotland to London as the new monarch. The Scots king was also an admirer of Davies's poetry, and rewarded him with a knighthood and appointments (at Mountjoy's recommendation) as solicitor-general and, later attorney-general, in Ireland. Ireland Davies arrived in Dublin in November 1603, where Mountjoy had accepted the submission of the rebel Hugh O'Neill some six months earlier, at the close of the Nine Years War. Finding pestilence and famine all over Ireland, Davies noted that the courts still commanded respect, but that the sloth of the protestant clergy and the ruin of the churches was detrimental to religion. He condemned the practice of issuing debased coinage and, in pursuit of the establishment of regular quarter-sessions of the courts, went on the Leinster circuit through seven counties in April 1604. In 1605 he travelled to England with the commendation of Sir Arthur Chichester, who succeeded Mountjoy in government, and had returned to Ireland by July. Davies was very much committed to reform not just in the law but in religious affairs too. He was all for banishing Catholic clergy from Ireland and for enforcing church attendances, and strict measures to this end were taken on his return. He delivered a powerful speech on 23 November 1605 in the Court of Castle Chamber, dealing with the summonsing of recusants to answer their contempt of the king's proclamations. In May 1606 he submitted his report of his circuit of the province of Munster to Sir Robert Cecil, the king's secretary, and was made serjeant at law after his appointment as Attorney General. In the summer he travelled through counties Monaghan, Fermanagh and Cavan, and a year later through Meath, Westmeath, Longford, King's county and Queen's County, both of which circuits he reported to Cecil. Davies always looked at Ireland as a stepping-stone towards major political office in England but he knew that his chances were hurt by the death of Cecil, his patron, and his own absence from the court. Ulster Davies became heavily involved in government efforts to establish a plantation in the lately rebellious province of Ulster. In September 1607, he delivered to Cecil his report of the Flight of the Earls, a seminal event in Irish history and, before long, had travelled into the absent earls' territories to lay indictments against them there. In August 1608, he went with Chichester to view the escheated lands, reporting that the people, \\"wondered as much to see the king's deputy as the ghosts in Vurgil wondered to see AEneas alive in hell[sic]\\". In October he was in England, pushing for the plantation of the province. In May 1609, Davies was made serjeant, with a grant of lands valued at ¬£40 p.a. He revisited England in 1610 on plantation business, which had so advanced that he thought his assistance to the commission charged with bringing the project to fruition would no longer be needed. In 1610 he defended proceedings brought by the Irish against the plans for the plantation of Cavan, but in the following year he begged for recall from Ireland. At about this time he wrote the Discoverie of the True Causes why Ireland was never entirely subdued (pub.1612), a well-written ‚Äì albeit polemical ‚Äì account of the constitutional standing of Ireland. Speaker of the Irish House of Commons In England, Davies spent much time in preparing the way for the Irish Parliament of 1613, to which he was returned for Fermanagh. In the first sitting he was proposed as speaker with the Crown's approval, but he met fierce opposition from the Catholic members, who formed a very large minority, and who nominated a former High Court judge, Sir John Everard, the knight of the shire for Tipperary. Everard was an open recusant, and despite his clownish behaviour on this occasion, a man of good reputation. A scene of comical disorder ensued when Everard was placed in the chair and refused to vacate in favour of the government candidate. Davies, always a very heavy man, was seized by his own supporters and lifted bodily into his opponent's lap; Everard, half crushed by Davies's bulk, was then ejected from the chair and withdrew himself from the chamber with 98 supporters, whereupon the vote was taken in their absence. Davies was approved as speaker by Chichester, and delivered a memorable speech on the history and role of parliament in Ireland. Everard, his rival, was summoned to England and briefly imprisoned, but was quickly pardoned and thereafter loyally supported the Crown. In 1615, Davies's reports of Irish cases were published; he had appeared as counsel in many of these, including the case of the Bann fishery and the cases of tanistry and gavelkind, which set precedents in Irish constitutional law, with wider implications for British colonial policy. Later career In 1617 Davies failed to win the position of Solicitor General for England and Wales and consequently resigned as Attorney-General in Ireland. In 1619 he returned to England permanently, in the expectation that his chance of gaining office there would be improved by his presence. He practised as king's serjeant, and eventually went on circuit as a judge. He was a founder member of the Society of Antiquaries. In 1621, he was elected MP for Hindon, and Newcastle-under- Lyme, choosing to sit for the latter constituency. He occasionally spoke in parliament on Irish matters. Davies retired to Englefield House in Berkshire, but was then appointed Lord Chief Justice. He had always been corpulent, and on 7 December 1626 he died in his bed of apoplexy brought on after a supper party, and thus never enjoyed the appointment he had been angling for throughout his career. Poetry Davies wrote poetry in numerous forms, but is best known for his epigrammes and sonnets. In 1599 he published Nosce Teipsum (Know thyself) and Hymnes of Astraea. Queen Elizabeth became an admirer of Davies's work, and these poems contain acrostics that spell out the phrase Elisabetha Regina.A list of his works can be found at: Davies is a great example of \\"new\\" poetry in the 1590s. This was a poetry characterized by a burning delight in intellectual analysis and a pure passion for knowledge. Davies's works are very well represented in Elizabethan anthologies. The last complete edition of his poems appeared in 1876 and is long out of print. His most famous poem, Nosce Teipsum, was reprinted numerous times, and was one of the first English poems to use the decasyllabic quatrain instead of the heroic couplet for a poem of its scope. It gained him the favor of James I, by which he won promotion in Ireland. The poem summarizes the main issues in religious thought in the Elizabethan Era, addressing the relation of body to soul, and of Materialism to Idealism. A. H. Bullen described it as being \\"singularly readable for such a subject: highly accomplished verse, no Elizabethan quaintness, bothe subtle and terse\\". Bullen also described Davies's Orchestra, or a Poem of Dancing as \\"brilliant and graceful\\". This poem, written in rhyme royal, reveals a typical Elizabethan pleasure: contemplating and trying to understand the relationship between the natural order and human activity. Legacy In political terms, Davies was significant in his work on constitutional law and in framing the terms of the Plantation of Ulster, a model that served the English crown as it extended its colonial reach in North America and elsewhere. In literary terms, he was a fine poet who lay quite neglected from the mid-17th century, until his cause was championed by T. S. Eliot. Davies's poem \\"I know my soul hath power to know all things\\" was set to music by the composer Hubert Parry in his choral work, Songs of Farewell (1916‚Äì18). Family Davies married Eleanor Touchet, daughter of the first Earl of Castlehaven, in March of 1609. She was one of the most prolific women writing in early seventeenth-century England, author of almost seventy pamphlets and prophecies, and one of the first women in England to see her works through to print. During the marriage, Eleanor published numerous books of prophecy, particularly anagrammatic prophecies; her prophetic writings were a source of conflict in the marriage and Davies burned a set of the prophecies that Eleanor had been writing. Davies was exasperated by his wife's excesses and once addressed her, \\"I pray you weep not while I am alive, and I will give you leave to laugh when I am dead\\". She is said to have accurately foretold the date of his death and wore mourning clothes for the three years leading up to the predicted time: as the date approached ‚Äì three days before ‚Äì she \\"gave him pass to take his long sleep\\". Davies had three children by his marriage. His only son to survive infancy John (Jack), was deaf and dumb but his daughter married Ferdinando Hastings and became Countess of Huntingdon. It is thought by many that his wife Eleanor may have been one of Davies's biggest problems in getting a job. On 28 July 1625 she was working on a commentary of the Book of Daniel and believed she heard the voice of the prophet; she wrote about the experience and took it to the Archbishop of Canterbury. When Davies found and burned her writing she predicted he would die within three years, and went into mourning. In November 1626 Davies was appointed to high office in England. In early December, following her husband's appointment, Eleanor started weeping during a dinner with friends. When asked why, she explained it was in anticipation of Davies's funeral. Davies was found in his home, dead of apoplexy on the morning of 8 December. In 1633, Eleanor was brought before the high commission in England on charges relating to her religious anagram practices. During a fruitless examination of her under oath, one of the commissioners devised an anagram of his own: Dame Eleanor Davys ‚Äì never so mad a ladye. She was sent to prison, and afterwards remarried, but was deserted by her new husband and buried next to Davies on her death in 1652.An account of the legal proceedings is given in Ballard at p.277ff. https://books.google.com/books?id=GnxBAAAAYAAJ&printsec;=frontcover&dq;=ballard+memoirs+of+several+ladies&source;=bl&ots;=WftsjTqnOl&sig;=pYoQHMOeDUC2Ak51cC2RcHEQghA&hl;=en&ei;=g09xTdf8PIbHsgbUh5WEDg&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&ct;=result&resnum;=3&ved;=0CCcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q;=fitzwilliam&f;=false She continued to make prophesies until her death.

Quiroga was a candidate in the 2014 presidential election for the Christian Democratic Party. Background and early life Quiroga was born in Cochabamba. He graduated from Texas A&M; University in 1981 with a degree in industrial engineering, becoming the first head of state from that university. Retrieved on Feb. 15, 2007 He went on to work for IBM in Austin, Texas while earning a master's degree in business administration from St. Edward's University. He and his American wife Virginia then moved back to Bolivia. He has 4 children: Vanessa Elena, Cristina Andrea, Adriana Patricia and Jorge Cristian. Vice President of Bolivia (1997‚Äì2001) Quiroga was elected as Vice President of Bolivia in 1997 running on the Nationalist Democratic Action ticket with former dictator Hugo Banzer.Vicepresidency of Bolivia At 37, he was the youngest vice president in Bolivia's history. President of Bolivia (2001‚Äì2002) He became President when Banzer resigned because of aggravated health problems (he died a year following his resignation). Quiroga assumed office as acting president on July 1, 2001 and was sworn-in on August 7, to complete Banzer's five-year mandate. Soon after becoming President he told a reporter from the New Yorker \\"We [Bolivia] will be the vital heart of South America..\\" believing that gas exports would lift the economy, that a long- anticipated transcontinental highway connecting Brazil to Chile would be built passing through the Bolivian city of Cochabamba, and that fibre-optic cables would soon be laid. He blamed Bolivia‚Äôs lack of economic progress on hypocrisy on free trade in the United States and Europe, saying \\"Bolivia is the most open economy in Latin America. Meanwhile, American and European farm subsidies, along with tariffs on textiles and agricultural products, make it impossible for Bolivia to sell its exports in the Global North. They tell us to be competitive while tying our arms behind our backs.\\" When asked about the Bolivian Water Wars of 2000, he said ‚ÄúA lot of things certainly could have been different along the way, from a lot of different actors. The net effect is that we have a city today with no resolution to the water problem. In the end it will be necessary to bring in private investment to develop the water.\\" Later life Quiroga ran for President in his own right in the 2005 election, as the candidate for a new right-of-center coalition known as Social and Democratic Power (PODEMOS), which included the bulk of Banzer's former ADN organization. His main opponent was the leftist Evo Morales of the Movement Towards Socialism. Morales won the election and Quiroga finished a distant second place, receiving 28.6% of the vote. He has also worked as a consultant for the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. In 2002, he was honored in a tribute exhibit at his alma mater, Texas A&M; University.https://www.aggienetwork.com/tribute/index/8-25/ He is, as of November 2016, active in the private sector and many international organizations, among them: as Vice-President of Club de Madrid with almost 100 former heads of state and government; on the board of Results for Development-R4D in Washington D.C.; as a member of the Inter-American Dialogue and the International Advisory Council of the China Economic Club; and in different capacities on the Global Adaptation Institute, the Foro Iberoamericano and many others.https://www.oneyoungworld.com/counsellors/president-jorge-quiroga He has presided FUNDEMOS since 2002, a Bolivian public policy foundation. His areas of expertise are: management of international aid and cooperation for developing countries; macroeconomic policy; constitutional, legal and institutional reforms; private and official external debt restructuring and relief; programs to reduce drug trafficking and cocaine production; and broadly in Latin American public policy, trade, economics, finance and banking, integration, politics and development issues. He was appointed as vice president of the Club de Madrid in 2011. In 2020, Qurioga announced his candidacy for the snap elections in Bolivia as a Revolutionary Nationalist Movement member. Throughout the election cycle, he remained around sixth place reaching between 1 to 2% in opinion polling and never surpassing 7%. On 11 October, one week before the scheduled election, Quiroga announced he was dropping out of the presidential race. He indicated in his withdrawal announcement that he wished to prevent an outright victory of Luis Arce of the Movement for Socialism party in the first electoral round by consolidating the right around Carlos Mesa.

Crane co-wrote \\"Fire\\", the 1968 hit single by The Crazy World of Arthur Brown.  Career  Born Vincent Rodney Cheesman in Reading, Berkshire, he taught himself boogie woogie piano as a teenager before attending Trinity College of Music between 1961 and 1964. Influenced by Graham Bond, he took up Hammond organ. In late 1966 he formed the Vincent Crane Combo, which comprised bass player Binky McKenzie, sax player John Claydon and drummer Gordon Hadler. In 1967 he teamed up with Arthur Brown in The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. Their eponymous debut album, The Crazy World of Arthur Brown (1968) contained the song \\"Fire\\", co-written by Crane and a chart-topping hit single in the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada, with Crane's organ and brass arrangement to the fore. During their first tour of the United States in 1968, Crane suffered a nervous breakdown and returned to the United Kingdom where he spent 3 or 4 months in the mental hospital at Banstead. Crane rejoined the band but on a subsequent tour of the United States, the band disintegrated in June 1969 when Arthur Brown temporarily disappeared to a commune and Crane and drummer Carl Palmer left to form Atomic Rooster, playing their first concert at the Lyceum in London on 29 August headlining over Deep Purple. Atomic Rooster enjoyed success in 1971 with two hit singles, \\"Tomorrow Night\\" and \\"Devil's Answer\\". Crane was the one constant member of the band through their almost constantly changing lineups, and wrote a slim majority of their material. Atomic Rooster published their first eponymous album in 1970, and then drummer Carl Palmer left to form Emerson, Lake & Palmer that same year. Crane suffered from bipolar disorder from at least 1968 onwards, periodically necessitating treatment at both out- and inpatient mental health treatment facilities. He collaborated with other musicians on a number of albums, including Rory Gallagher (Rory Gallagher, 1971), Arthur Brown (Faster Than the Speed of Light, 1979), Peter Green, Richard Wahnfried, and Dexys Midnight Runners (Don't Stand Me Down, 1985). In 1983, he was part of the one-off blues outfit, Katmandu, with Ray Dorset, Len Surtees, and Peter Green, who recorded the album A Case for the Blues.

The novel shows themes of ecofeminism and nonviolent revolution, combined with Slonczewski's own mastery of knowledge in the field of biology. Premise The novel is set in the future, on the fictional planet of Shora, a moon covered by water. The inhabitants of this planet, known as Sharers, are all female. Sharers use genetic engineering to control the ecology of their planet. They are peaceful beings who \\"share\\" ‚Äî that is, they have a spiritual and linguistic union with each other and treat everyone equally. The Sharers take egalitarianism for granted because they share and they lack the concept of \\"power-over\\", making their society one in which conflicts are settled without violence. When they are being threatened by an outside power, they resist nonviolently because they refuse to believe in power. Thus, the Sharers can never be subdued by force. The Sharer way of nonviolence is more than spiritual. It is based on historical realities of nonviolent resistance. The author based the events of her novel on much historical research, particularly the writings of peace historian Gene Sharp. The novel includes much biological research into the evolution of innate capacities for nonviolence. For example, the participation of children in nonviolent resistance draws on deep instinctual responses found in humans and related mammals. A unique expression of the Sharer way is their language, in which subject and object are interchangeable. The Sharers know by context what subject and object are‚Äîbut their language does not allow them to make a distinction. As a result, they always know that what one person \\"forces\\" upon another can always go the other way. Their language impedes anyone from \\"giving orders\\" to dominate others. For example, if a stranger says, \\"You must obey me,\\" the Sharer hears, \\"I must obey you,\\" or (the closest translation), \\"We must share agreement.\\" Their language reinforces the Sharers' inability to accept any situation in which one individual dominates another by force. The Sharer worldview extends to their environment, their surrounding ecosystem. They cannot act upon their plants and animals without being acted upon in return. So, for example, because Sharers consume plants and animals as food, they accept the fact that they in turn will become food for other life forms; that predators will ultimately consume them. At the beginning of the novel, the Sharers are all female. But as they encounter a non-Sharer community from another planet, which threatens them, the Sharer Merwen realizes that they must find out whether other kinds of \\"people\\" can share their life or not. Merwen goes to the other planet, Valedon, to recruit a young man, Spinel, to return to Shora and attempt to learn their ways. This venture leads to disagreement within the Sharer community (they have plenty of disagreements, though addressed without violence). With many false starts, Spinel gradually learns the Sharer way, as a man; and ultimately he works with the Sharers to help them defend their planet from a military invasion. Characters  * Merwen * Usha * Spinel * Uriel * Lystra * Berenice * Realgar * Malachite * Siderite * Yinevra Literary significance and reception The 1985 Library Journal review highly recommends this novel, saying \\"Slonczewski creates an all-female nonviolent culture that reaches beyond feminism to a new definition of human nature\\".

Aerodromes include small general aviation airfields, large commercial airports, and military air bases. The term airport may imply a certain stature (having satisfied certain certification criteria or regulatory requirements) that not all aerodromes may have achieved. That means that all airports are aerodromes, but not all aerodromes are airports. Usage of the term \\"aerodrome\\" remains more common in Ireland and Commonwealth nations, and is conversely almost unknown in American English; with the term airport being almost exclusively applied. A water aerodrome is an area of open water used regularly by seaplanes, floatplanes or amphibious aircraft for landing and taking off. In formal terminology, as defined by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), an aerodrome is \\"A defined area on land or water (including any buildings, installations, and equipment) intended to be used either wholly or in part for the arrival, departure, and surface movement of aircraft.\\"International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Documents, Annex 14 to The Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention), Volume I- Aerodrome Design and Operations under Definitions  Etymology  The word aerodrome derives from Ancient Greek ·ºÄŒÆœÅ (a·∏ór), air, and Œ¥œÅœåŒºŒøœÇ (dr√≥mos), road or course, literally meaning air course. An ancient linguistic parallel is hippodrome (a stadium for horse racing and chariot racing), derived from ·ºµœÄœÄŒøœÇ (h√≠ppos), horse, and Œ¥œÅœåŒºŒøœÇ (dr√≥mos), course. A modern linguistic parallel is velodrome, an arena for velocipedes. ŒëŒµœÅŒøŒ¥œÅœåŒºŒπŒø is the word for airport in Modern Greek, which transliterates as aerodromio. In British military usage, the Royal Flying Corps in the First World War, and the Royal Air Force in the First and Second World Wars, used the term--it had the advantage that their French allies, on whose soil they were often based, and with whom they co-operated, used the cognate term a√©rodrome. In CanadaTransport Canada AIM - AGA 2.0 Aerodromes and Airports and Australia,Commonwealth Consolidated Acts aerodrome is a legal term of art for any area of land or water used for aircraft operation, regardless of facilities. International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) documents use the term aerodrome, for example, in the Annex to the ICAO Convention about aerodromes, their physical characteristics, and their operation. However, the terms airfield or airport mostly superseded use of aerodrome after the Second World War, in colloquial language.Compare airport, airfield and aerodrome at Google Books Ngram Viewer  History  In the early days of aviation, when there were no paved runways and all landing fields were grass, a typical airfield might permit takeoffs and landings in only a couple of directions, much like today's airports, whereas an aerodrome was distinguished, by virtue of its much greater size, by its ability to handle landings and takeoffs in any direction. The ability to always takeoff and land directly into the wind, regardless of the wind's direction, was an important advantage in the earliest days of aviation when an airplane's performance in a crosswind takeoff or landing might be poor or even dangerous. The development of differential braking in aircraft, improved aircraft performance, utilization of paved runways, and the fact that a circular aerodrome required much more space than did the \\"L\\" or triangle shaped airfield, eventually made the early aerodromes obsolete. The unimproved airfield remains a phenomenon in military aspects. The DHC-4 Caribou served in the United States military in Vietnam (designated as the CV-2), landing on rough, unimproved airfields where the C-130 Hercules workhorse could not operate. Earlier, the Ju 52 and Fieseler Storch could do the same, one example of the latter taking off from the F√ºhrerbunker whilst completely surrounded by Russian troops.  Types  =Airport= Soest-Bad Sassendorf Airfield near Soest, Germany In colloquial use in certain environments, the terms airport and aerodrome are often interchanged. However, in general, the term airport may imply or confer a certain stature upon the aviation facility that other aerodromes may not have achieved. In some jurisdictions, airport is a legal term of art reserved exclusively for those aerodromes certified or licensed as airports by the relevant national aviation authority after meeting specified certification criteria or regulatory requirements. =Air base= Hahn Air Base, near Kirchberg, Rhein-Hunsr√ºck-Kreis, Germany An air base is an aerodrome with significant facilities to support aircraft and crew. The term is usually reserved for military bases, but also applies to civil seaplane bases. =Airstrip= A private airstrip at what used to be RAF Knettishall An airstrip is a small aerodrome that consists only of a runway with perhaps fueling equipment. They are generally in remote locations. Many airstrips (now mostly abandoned) were built on the hundreds of islands in the Pacific Ocean during Second World War. A few airstrips grew to become full-fledged airbases as strategic or economic importance of a region increased over time. An Advanced Landing Ground (ALG) was a temporary airstrip used by the Allies in the run-up to and during the invasion of Normandy, and these were built both in Britain, and on the continent. =Water aerodrome= Yellowknife Water Aerodrome, Northwest Territories, Canada A water aerodrome or seaplane base is an area of open water used regularly by seaplanes, floatplanes and amphibious aircraft for landing and taking off. It may (for example Yellowknife Water Aerodrome) have a terminal building on land and/or a place where the plane can come to shore and dock like a boat to load and unload. Some are co-located with a land based airport and are certified airports in their own right. These include Vancouver International Water Airport and Vancouver International Airport. Others, such as Vancouver Harbour Flight Centre have their own control tower, Vancouver Harbour Control Tower.  By country  =Canada= The Canadian Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM) says \\"...for the most part, all of Canada can be an aerodrome\\", however there are also \\"registered aerodromes\\" and \\"certified airports\\". To become a registered aerodrome the operator must maintain certain standards and keep the Minister of Transport informed of any changes. To be certified as an airport the aerodrome, which usually supports commercial operations, must meet safety standards. Nav Canada, the private company responsible for air traffic control services in Canada, publishes the Canada Flight Supplement (CFS), a directory of all registered Canadian land aerodromes, as well as the Canada Water Aerodrome Supplement (CWAS).CWAS description =Republic of Ireland= Casement Aerodrome is the main military airport used by the Irish Air Corps.

He was born on 9 February 1742 of Welsh parentage at Machynlleth and educated at Codrington College, Barbados and Jesus College, Oxford. His father was Richard Davies. He was Rector of Barkham in Berkshire, England, from 1781 until his death. Davies studied the condition of the labouring poor, recorded statistics of their wages, cost of food, etc. in various districts of England and Scotland. A controversial rapid rise in Poor Law costs at the time (especially in rural parishes) instigated debates on the issue, and inspired Davies to compile statistics from which he produced data covering the income and expenditure of certain families in the country (including three in the parishes of Llandegla and Llanarmon (Denbighshire), and two in the parishes of Llanfor and Llanycil (Merioneth). He published his findings in 1795 as a book called Cases of Labourers in Husbandry Stated and Considered in Three Parts, an important work in social history. Part 1, Section 2 contains what is considered considered the first usage of household surveys. Davies claims to have collected 2‚Äì3 surveys from every county in the kingdom with the help of his friends. From these surveys, poor households on average spent 75% of their income on food. Through this publication, Davies called for a marked improvement in the standard of living for agricultural labourers. He demonstrated that the 'Poor Rates' were used as a means to keep wages down. He presented calculations in Section 7, which show that the number of days an average laborer had to work to afford a quarter of wheat doubled between the 14th century and the 18th century. For policy recommendations, he advocated the principle of a minimum wage. He died on 6 February 1819 at Barkham.

It is a perennial plant, notable for the profusion of bright scarlet flowers in late summer and autumn. The name reflects that in the past it used to be treated in a distinct genus Zauschneria, but modern studies have shown that it is best placed within the genus Epilobium. Other common names include California-fuchsia (from the resemblance of the flowers to those of fuchsias), hummingbird flower or hummingbird trumpet (the flowers are very attractive to hummingbirds), and firechalice. The original genus name was in honor of Johann Baptista Josef Zauschner (1737‚Äì1799), a professor of medicine and botany in Prague. Description It is a subshrub growing to 60 cm tall. Native populations of these plants exhibit considerable variation in appearance and habit. The small leaves may be opposite or alternate, lance-shaped or ovate, with short to nonexistent stalks, and range in color from green to nearly white. Overall shape may be matting or mounding, the plants commonly spreading via rhizomes. The racemes of tubular or funnel-shaped flowers are terminal, and colors are mostly reddish, ranging from fuchsia to pink to red-orange. The wide degree of variation has led to the description of many subspecies, mostly no longer recognised as distinct due to the extensive intergradation between them; the following are still recognised: *Epilobium canum ssp. canum (including ssp. angustifolia, ssp. microphylla) *Epilobium canum ssp. garrettii *Epilobium canum ssp. latifolium Cultivation As befits their origin, they prefer to be cultivated in well-drained soil exposed to full sun but protected from the wind, and need little watering. Epilobium canum ssp. canum is hardy to USDA zone 8a. Epilobium canum (or its cultivar(s)) is a recipient of the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit under the Zauschneria californica name. A small number of hybrid cultivars have been introduced by various growers, in some cases by working from isolated populations, such as those on Santa Cruz Island off the California coast.

Davies was often known as David Davies Llandinam (from the place of his birth, Llandinam in Montgomeryshire).Ivor Bulmer-Thomas: Top Sawyer: David Davies of Llandinam (Golden Grove, Carmarthen, 1988) He is best remembered today for founding Barry Docks. Early life Davies was the son of David Davies and his wife Elizabeth and the eldest of nine children. He attended the day school at Llandinam but was primarily self-educated. He began work as a sawyer and went into agriculture, working alongside his father, who died when David was aged 20, leaving him to take charge of the family. He was successful from an early age and in 1848 took over a larger farm called Tynymaen, which later became the home farm of the Plasdinam estate. Two years later he took over a further holding, Gwerneirin. Early business career His first enterprise was the building of a bridge over the Severn at Llandinam. He soon built a reputation as a contractor and was responsible for the building of numerous roads and bridges. From 1855 he was involved in the construction of the Llanidloes and Newtown Railway, which eventually opened in 1859. This line was unusual in that at neither terminus did it connect with any other railway, and the engines and carriages had to be carried on specially constructed wagons from Oswestry, 36 miles away. Together with partners such as Thomas Savin, Davies built the Vale of Clwyd Railway (opened in 1858 ), the Oswestry and Newtown Railway (1861), the Newtown and Machynlleth Railway (1862) and the Pembroke and Tenby Railway ( 18630, which was extended to Whitland in 1866. His greatest achievement was the section of the Manchester and Milford Railway from Pencader to Aberystwyth, which opened in 1867. This included the very difficult crossing of Tregaron Bog in the construction of the line between Lampeter and Aberystwyth in 1866. It is reputed that he bought up the entire year's production of sheep fleeces in Ceredigion to lay as a foundation for the railway line on the bog. He later became a director of the Brecon and Merthyr Junction Railway. Early political career: the 1865 Cardiganshire election David Davies first sought election to Parliament at the 1865 General Election when he ran for the Cardiganshire county seat. Prior to the election, the sitting member, Colonel Powell of Nanteos, had indicated his intention to retire and Sir Thomas Davies Lloyd of Bronwydd, a Whig landowner, had announced his intention to stand as a Liberal. However, when Powell reversed his decision, Lloyd issued an address stating that he would not oppose the sitting member. The result was that both Davies and Henry Richard offered themselves as alternative Liberal candidates. A selection meeting was arranged to be held at Aberaeron, but shortly before this took place, Powell again announced his retirement. Lloyd now stated that he would now fight the seat after all and Richard withdrew in his favour. David Davies did not withdraw. Lloyd won the seat with a majority of 361 votes. Davies had a number of advantages, including the fact that his railway building enterprises benefited the county and created additional, if temporary, employment opportunities. However, his defeat was attributed to the strong opposition of landowners, including the overwhelming influence of the Pryse family of Gogerddan at Aberystwyth, and the failure of nonconformists to unite behind his candidature. However, his intervention represented a direct challenge to the traditional hegemony of the county's landed gentry over the political representation of the county. Ieuan Gwynedd Jones describes the election as 'a contest between two kinds of wealth, the affluent railway contractor pitting his ready cash and ruthless commercial methods against the sedate and comfortable but strained resources of the rural gentry.\\" This was symbolised by Davies depositing ¬£10,000 in an Aberystwyth bank as \\"ale money for the battle\\". Davies presented himself as a businessman who brought employment to the county and scarcely referred in his speeches to radical policies, including the secret ballot. As a Calvinistic Methodist deacon, Davies had envisaged strong support from the nonconformist community. However, there were numerous examples of prominent nonconformists who were lukewarm, or even opposed, to Davies's candidature. The reasons included a reluctance to offend landowners who held the leases to land on which some chapels had been built. When the result was announced, Davies had polled 1,149 votes against 1,510 for Lloyd. Davies had a large majority in the Tregaron area, which was attributed to the coming of the railway and his Calvinistic Methodist connections. He was also ahead in the Lampeter district. However, he lost the other four districts, including Cardigan, where Lloyd polled 360 votes against a mere 65 for Davies. Following his 1865 defeat in Cardiganshire, it appears that Davies initially intended to contest the seat again. After the election, he made significant contributions to chapels in the north of the county where Lloyd had won by a small margin. During the months leading up to the 1868 election became clear that Sir Thomas Lloyd did not wish to bear the costs of another contested election. A meeting of prominent Liberals at Aberaeron in late May saw an invitation issued to davies to contest the county seat if Lloyd declined to do so (with Lloyd been offered the Cardigan Boroughs constituency where he was likely to be returned unopposed). However, Davies declined the invitation and appear to have offered Lloyd, his erstwhile opponent, a gift of ¬£500 to contest the seat. Industrialist Statue of David Davies, holding the plans for Barry Docks, at Llandinam Statue of David Davies outside the Barry Dock Offices, Barry As a result of his success in the railway trade, Davies became a colliery owner. He was an important figure in the industrialisation of the Rhondda Valley, having founded the Parc and Maendy collieries in the 1860s. The Ocean Merthyr company was formed under his chairmanship in 1867 and a number of new collieries were sunk including Dare (1868), Western and Eastern (1872), Garw (1884), and Lady Windsor (1885). By the 1880s the output from his collieries had increased to such an extent that Davies established a limited liability company, the Ocean Coal Company Ltd. At the same time a combination of the inability of the Taff Vale railway and the Bute docks at Cardiff to cope with the Ocean traffic, and the fact that Davies had to pay such high costs to use these facilities, led him Davies to construct new docks at Barry with a railway connection from the Rhondda. The project came to fruition after a lengthy parliamentary process, and was completed in 1889. Barry Docks, described by Kenneth Morgan as \\"the crowning triumph\\" of David Davies, was a crucial factor in the expansion of the South Wales coal trade on a global scale. At the time of Davies's death, in 1890, Ocean Coal was the largest and most profitable coal company in South Wales. Religion and education A Calvinistic Methodist by upbringing, Davies was teetotaller and firm about his Sunday observance. He became an influential figure within the Calvinistic Methodist denomination, which had over 13,000 members in Cardiganshire alone, and funded the building of numerous chapels. Davies was a keen patron and one of the first governors of the University College of Wales at Aberystwyth and in 1875 was elected treasurer, a post which he held till 1887. Member of Parliament In 1874, however, Davies was elected as Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Cardigan Boroughs and held the seat until 1885, when the county and borough seats were merged under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885. He was then elected MP for Cardiganshire county seat in 1885. Davies was a poor public speaker, and his speech was described as untutored, but his support in Cardiganshire was nevertheless considerable owing to factors including his patronage of the new university college at Aberystwyth and his connections within the Calvinistic Methodist denomination, which had over 13,000 members in Cardiganshire. His success in 1885 was also underpinned by a particularly effective Liberal Association, organised by H. C. Fryer, an Aberystwyth solicitor, and which set up mechanisms to ensure the registration of voters. Trains were even organised to convey voters who had migrated to the South Wales coalfield back to their native county to cast their votes. Break with the Liberal Party and the 1886 General Election In 1886, however, Davies broke with Gladstone over home rule for Ireland and at the 1886 general election he stood as a Liberal Unionist candidate, having initially indicated that he would retire from politics. A number of his associates such as Robert J. Davies, Cwrtmawr followed him into the Liberal Unionist camp. The election split the Liberal Party in Cardiganshire and the election was hotly contested with almost all the landowners, including those previously regarded as having Liberal sympathies, supporting Davies. He also received the support of several prominent Liberals, especially from his own Methodist denomination. Eventually Davies was defeated by William Bowen Rowlands, the Gladstonian Liberal candidate, by a mere nine votes, a result which was largely attributed to the influence of nonconformist ministers over their congregations. Rowlands served until 1895. Although he withdrew from political life after his defeat in 1886, Davies became a member of Montgomery County Council in 1889 and was a long- standing member and chairman of the Llandinam School Board. He was also a JP for Montgomeryshire. Personal life Iron bridge across the Severn During his lifetime, he was also known by the nicknames, \\"Top Sawyer\\" and \\"Davies the Ocean\\". His father was a sawyer and lived on the south side of the Severn valley in Llandinam so that in winter the house was shaded from the sun because of the enclosing hills. Once he had started to amass his fortune, he built Broneirion, a grand country mansion on the north side of the river that would enjoy sunshine all year round, which is maintained in good order to this day in the ownership of Girlguiding Cymru. Davies married Margaret Jones, daughter of Edward Jones of Llanfair in 1851. They had one child, Edward Davies (1852‚Äì1898). His grandson, another David Davies, continued Llandinam's philanthropic activities and was elevated to the peerage. Llandinam's two granddaughters, Gwendoline Davies and Margaret Davies, donated their substantial art collection to the National Museum of Wales. In 1884 he bought the large country house Plas Dinam where he died on 20 July 1890, aged 71.

During the 1930s he worked for a time as a British secret agent, serving as a double agent to Nazi Germany. He returned to the Navy in World War II. During his flying career he logged over 17,000 flying hours on 73 types of aircraft. Early life Christopher Draper was born at Bebington, on the Wirral in Cheshire, England, into a family of five sons and two daughters. He became interested in flying in July 1909 when Louis Bl√©riot flew across the English Channel. Unable to afford the ¬£75 fee for pilot training, Draper wrote to his local MP, Joseph Hoult, who was an acquaintance of his father. Hoult provided Draper with ¬£210 after making him promise not to tell anyone about the gift. On 9 October 1913, with a total of 3 hours 15 minutes of flying experience, he obtained Royal Aero Club Aviator's Certificate No. 646 after flying a Grahame-White biplane at the Grahame-White Flying School at Hendon Aerodrome. While trying to find a job flying, he learned from a cousin in the service that the Royal Navy was offering short service commissions to pilots with an Aviator's Certificate. After passing the medical Draper joined the Royal Naval Air Service on 27 January 1914 and was commissioned as a probationary sub-lieutenant, RNR. From January to April 1914 he attended the fifth course at the Central Flying School. Also on the course were Hugh Dowding and Wilfrid Freeman while the instructors included John Tremayne Babington and John Salmond ‚Äì all of whom were later Air Marshals. After passing his course, Draper was assigned to the Royal Naval Air Station at Eastchurch under the command of Commander Charles Rumney Samson. He was promoted to flight lieutenant in June, and on 20 July he was one of nine pilots who flew in the Naval Review at Spithead, the first review to include aircraft. Spending the initial war years on Home Defence in Newcastle and Scotland, Draper initiated his liking for dare-devil exploits by flying a seaplane under one of the spans of the Firth of Tay bridge near Dundee. While based at Dundee, Draper was ordered to land an aeroplane on the green at St. Andrew's golf course. He stopped right in front of the clubhouse. On 28 June 1915 he was promoted to flight commander. World War I =Royal Naval Air Service= In mid-1916 he was posted to 3 Naval Wing, who were preparing to go to France. While collecting his new Sopwith 1¬Ω Strutter, Draper flew the aircraft under the foot-bridge which ran around the racing track behind the Sopwith hangars at Brooklands. While flying the Sopwith 1¬Ω Strutter with 3 Naval Wing he scored his first four victories while carrying out some of the first strategic bombing missions against German industrial targets. In 1917 he flew with 6 Naval Squadron on Nieuports, claiming two victories. On 6 June 1917 his aircraft was shot up whilst in action against Jasta 5, before Draper slightly wounded prominent German ace Lt. Werner Voss (with 34 victories at the time), and forced him to land his Albatros D.III. After a heated argument with his commanding officer, Draper was transferred back to England soon after. In the autumn of 1917 he returned to combat with 8 Naval Squadron, with which he scored three more victories. In October 1917 Draper became commanding officer of 8 Naval Squadron. Like most RNAS and RFC Squadrons by now, it was a multi-national unit, manned by British, Australians (including the leading Australian ace Robert A. Little), Canadians, and at least one American. By the time the war ended, this Squadron would boast 25 aces. On 31 December 1917 he was promoted to squadron commander. In March 1918 the Squadron was posted to RAF Walmer and then on 30 March departed for France one day before the RNAS and RFC were amalgamated to form the RAF. Draper later commented 'What a change, I don't think the Squadron was ever the same again' During the Ludendorff Offensive of Spring 1918 the German Army's initial breakthrough and rate of advance was such that Draper was forced to order the burning of 16 of Naval 8's aircraft to prevent them being captured on the ground. =Royal Air Force= On 1 April 1918, 8 Naval Squadron became No. 208 Squadron RAF when the RNAS and the Royal Flying Corps merged to become the Royal Air Force. Draper refused to wear the new blue RAF uniform, and continued to wear the old Naval blacks. On 13 October 1918, he was wounded by anti-aircraft fire. One morning while flying towards the front lines Draper accidentally flew under a bridge while in full view of a large body of troops. The troops cheered so heartily that Draper repeated the stunt wherever possible. This earned him his nickname The Mad Major. (In its early days the RAF used Army ranks.) For his service in the war he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross in April 1918 and the French Croix de Guerre in August 1919. Interwar years =Stunt and film flying= After the war Draper became a secondhand car salesman. When this venture failed he returned to flying, and in April 1919 he was the Chief Test Pilot for the British Aerial Transport Company, piloting the first flight of their F.K.26. This was the first aircraft specifically designed to carry passengers. Draper was lucky to survive a crash on 23 March 1920 test flying the BAT Bantam at Hendon. When the company folded Draper sought an interview with Air Marshal Hugh Trenchard and was granted a short service commission as a squadron leader on 27 September 1920. Posted to the Central Flying School he led the RAF aerobatic team in the 1921 Air Pageant in July, and then resigned on 6 October. After leaving the RAF, he continued to fly as a stunt pilot at air shows and in films. In 1930, out of work and penniless, he decided to raise his public profile and protest over the government's treatment of war veterans by staging an aerial publicity stunt. Borrowing a Puss Moth, he set out to fly under all 14 of London's bridges over the River Thames. Due to bad weather on the day he only managed to fly under two. This was captured on film and brought \\"The Mad Major\\" the desired degree of fame. Draper's work as a stunt pilot in films eventually led him into acting. Standing six feet two inches tall, with a robust frame and a classic profile, he was photogenic. He starred in many theatrical productions and several films as \\"George Mannering\\". He played a pilot in 1935's King of the Damned. =Espionage work= In 1932 Draper was invited to participate in an \\"Aces of the Air Tour\\" of Germany. Aces from many nations participated. In addition to meeting various German aces (he became firm friends with the German ace Major Eduard Ritter von Schleich). He was also introduced to Adolf Hitler. As a result of this meeting and of Draper's longstanding criticism of the British Government's treatment of veterans, he was listed by the Nazi Party as a potential sympathiser. After his return to England he was contacted and asked to spy for the Germans. He agreed and then immediately contacted MI6. They decided to use him as a double agent to feed false information to the Nazis. This situation continued for about four years until the Germans stopped answering Draper's communications. World War II and post-war years In 1939, Draper joined the Royal Naval Reserve and was posted to Ford as assistant armament officer before going to Trinidad. In World War II, although 47 years of age, he became a Lieutenant Commander with postings in Scotland and the Gold Coast in 1943, before commanding No. 777 Squadron at Freetown, flying anti-submarine duties in Supermarine Walrus, Boulton Paul Defiant and Fairey Swordfish aircraft. After the war Draper once more drifted into a variety of activities including acting and store-keeping. By the fifties he was once again upset at the government's treatment of veterans. On 5 May 1953, he again repeated his earlier protest by flying under the Thames bridges. This time he flew a rented, 100 h.p. Auster monoplane under 15 of the 18 bridges. It was a spectacular stunt; the bridge arches were only 40 to 50 feet high; Draper was flying 90 mph and dodged around a ship. According to news accounts, he pulled off his stunt as a means of seeking attention and soliciting job offers. He was arrested, charged with flying too low in an urban area, and assessed a nominal ten guineas court costs. \\"I did it for the publicity,\\" Draper told the press; \\"For 14 months I have been out of a job, and I'm broke. I wanted to prove that I am still fit, useful and worth employing......They tell me I can be jailed, possibly for six months.....It was my last-ever flight- I meant it as a spectacular swansong.\\" However, he retained his pilot's licence for another eleven years; it was revoked in 1964. His memoirs The Mad Major were published by Aero Publishers in 1962. Draper died in Camden, London in 1979.

In electronics, electrical termination is the practice of ending a transmission line with a device that matches the characteristic impedance of the line. Termination prevents signals from reflecting off the end of the transmission line. Reflections at the ends of unterminated transmission lines cause distortion which can produce ambiguous digital signal levels and mis-operation of digital systems. Reflections in analog signal systems cause such effects as video ghosting, or power loss in radio transmitter transmission lines. Transmission lines Signal termination often requires the installation of a terminator at the beginning and end of a wire or cable to prevent an RF signal from being reflected back from each end, causing interference, or power loss. The terminator is usually placed at the end of a transmission line or daisy chain bus (such as in SCSI), and is designed to match the AC impedance of the cable and hence minimize signal reflections, and power losses. Less commonly, a terminator is also placed at the driving end of the wire or cable, if not already part of the signal-generating equipment. Radio frequency currents tend to reflect from discontinuities in the cable such as connectors and joints, and travel back down the cable toward the source causing interference as primary reflections. Secondary reflections can also occur at the cable start, allowing interference to persist as repeated echoes of old data. These reflections also act as bottlenecks, preventing the signal power from reaching the destination. Transmission line cables require impedance matching to carry electromagnetic signals with minimal reflections and power losses. The distinguishing feature of most transmission line cables is that they have uniform cross sectional dimensions along their length, giving them a uniform electrical characteristic impedance. Signal terminators are designed to specifically match the characteristic impedances at both cable ends. For many systems, the terminator is a resistor, with a value chosen to match the characteristic impedance of the transmission line, and chosen to have acceptably low parasitic inductance and capacitance at the frequencies relevant to the system. Examples include 75-ohm resistors often used to terminate 75-ohm video transmission coaxial cables. Types of transmission line cables include balanced line such as ladder line, and twisted pairs (Cat-6 Ethernet, Parallel SCSI, ADSL, Landline Phone, XLR audio, USB, Firewire, Serial); and unbalanced lines such as coaxial cable (Radio antenna, CATV, 10BASE5 Ethernet).  Types of electrical and signal terminators  =Passive= Passive terminators often consist of a single resistor, however significantly reactive loads may require other passive components such as inductors, capacitors, or transformers. =Active= Active terminators consist of a voltage regulator that keeps the voltage used for the terminating resistor(s) at a constant level. Forced perfect termination Forced Perfect Termination. Forced perfect termination (FPT) can be used on single ended buses where diodes remove over and undershoot conditions. The signal is locked between two actively regulated voltage levels, which results in superior performance over a standard active terminator. \\"FPT is a terminator that [dynamically] self-terminates. One that matches itself to the line perfectly thereby removing all reflections at the endpoints  Signal Termination Applications  SCSI terminator. =SCSI= All parallel SCSI units use terminators. SCSI is primarily used for storage and backup. An active terminator is a type of single ended SCSI terminator with a built-in voltage regulator to compensate for variations in terminator power. =Controller Area Network= Controller area network, commonly known as CAN Bus, uses terminators consisting of a 120 ohm resistor. =Dummy load= Dummy loads are commonly used in HF to EHF frequency circuits. =Ethernet coaxial 50 ohm= 10BASE2 networks absolutely must have proper termination with a 50 ohm BNC terminator. If the bus network is not properly terminated, too much power will be reflected, causing all of the computers on the bus to lose network connectivity. =Antenna network 75 ohm= A terminating resistor for a television coaxial cable is often in the form of a cap, threaded to screw onto an F connector. Antenna cables are sometimes used for internet connections; however RG-6 should not be used for 10BASE2 (which should use RG-58) as the impedance mismatch can cause phasing problems with the baseband signal. =Unibus= Unibus terminator/bootstrap card from a PDP-11/34. The Digital Equipment Corporation minicomputer Unibus systems used terminator cards with 178 Œ© pullup resistors on the multi-drop address and data lines, and 383 Œ© on the single-drop signal lines. =MIL-STD-1553= Terminating resistors values of 78.7 ohms 2 watt 1% are used on the MIL- STD-1553 bus. At the two ends of the bus, resistors connect between the positive (high) and negative (low) signal wires either in internally terminated bus couplers or external connectorized terminators. The MIL- STD-1553B bus must be terminated at both ends to minimize the effects of signal reflections that can cause waveform distortion and disruption or intermittent communications failures. Optionally, a high-impedance terminator (1000 to 3000 ohms) may be used in vehicle applications to simulate a future load from an unspecified device. Connectorized terminators are available with or without safety chains.'''

Appointed by Republican President Richard Nixon, Blackmun ultimately became one of the most liberal justices on the Court. He is best known as the author of the Court's opinion in Roe v. Wade, which prohibits many state and federal restrictions on abortion. Raised in Saint Paul, Minnesota, Blackmun graduated from Harvard Law School in 1932. He practiced law in the Twin Cities, representing clients such as the Mayo Clinic. In 1959, he was appointed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. After the defeat of two previous nominees, President Richard Nixon successfully nominated Blackmun to the Supreme Court to replace Associate Justice Abe Fortas. Blackmun and his close friend, conservative Chief Justice Warren Burger, were often referred to as the \\"Minnesota Twins\\", but Blackmun drifted away from Burger during their tenure on the court. Blackmun retired from the Court during the administration of President Bill Clinton, and was succeeded by Stephen Breyer. Aside from Roe v. Wade, notable majority opinions written by Blackmun include Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, Bigelow v. Commonwealth of Virginia, and Stanton v. Stanton. He joined part of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's opinion in Planned Parenthood v. Casey but also filed a separate opinion, warning that Roe was in jeopardy. He wrote dissenting opinions in notable cases such as Furman v. Georgia, Bowers v. Hardwick, and DeShaney v. Winnebago County.  Early years and professional career  Harry Blackmun was born on November 12, 1908 in Nashville, Illinois, to Theo Huegely (Reuter) and Corwin Manning Blackmun. Three years after his birth, his baby brother, Corwin Manning Blackmun, Jr., died soon after birth; his sister Betty was born in 1917. Blackmun grew up in Dayton's Bluff, a working-class neighborhood in Saint Paul, Minnesota, where his father owned a small store. He attended the same grade school as future Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, with whom he eventually served on the Supreme Court for sixteen years. Blackmun attended Mechanic Arts High School in Saint Paul, where he graduated fourth in his class of 450 in 1925. He had expected to attend the University of Minnesota; however, he received a scholarship to attend Harvard University, where he graduated summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa with an Artium Baccalaureus degree in mathematics in 1929. While at Harvard, Blackmun joined Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity and sang with the Harvard Glee Club (with whom he performed for President Herbert Hoover in 1929, Blackmun's first visit to Washington). He attended Harvard Law School (among his professors there was future Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter), graduating with a Bachelor of Laws in 1932. After graduating from law school, Blackmun returned to Minnesota, where he served in a variety of positions including private counsel, law clerk, and adjunct faculty at the University of Minnesota Law School and William Mitchell College of Law (then the St. Paul College of Law). Blackmun's practice as an attorney at the law firm now known as Dorsey & Whitney focused in its early years on taxation, trusts and estates, and civil litigation. He married Dorothy Clark in 1941 and had three daughters with her, Nancy, Sally, and Susan. Between 1950 and 1959, Blackmun served as resident counsel for the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. He would later describe his time at Mayo as \\"his happiest time\\" (while describing his later work on the judiciary as where he \\"performed his duty\\"). Court of Appeals service In the late 1950s, Blackmun's close friend Warren E. Burger, then an appellate judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, repeatedly encouraged Blackmun to seek a judgeship. Judge John B. Sanborn Jr. of the Eighth Circuit, whom Blackmun had clerked for after graduating from Harvard, told Blackmun of his plans to assume senior status. He said that he would suggest Blackmun's name to the Eisenhower administration if Blackmun wished to succeed him. After much urging by Sanborn and Burger, Blackmun agreed to accept the nomination, duly offered by Eisenhower and members of the Justice Department. Blackmun was nominated by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on August 18, 1959, to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit vacated by Judge John B. Sanborn Jr. The American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary gave him a rating of \\"exceptionally well qualified\\", and he was confirmed by the United States Senate on September 14, 1959, and received his commission on September 21, 1959. Over the next decade, Blackmun would author 217 opinions for the Eighth Circuit. His service on the Court of Appeals ended on June 8, 1970 due to his appointment to the Supreme Court.  Tenure on the Supreme Court  Blackmun was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Richard Nixon on April 14, 1970, and was confirmed by the United States Senate on May 12, 1970, by a 94‚Äì0 vote.See Warren Weaver Jr., Blackmun Approved, 94-0; Nixon Hails Vote by Senate in The New York Times, May 13, 1970, page 1. He received his commission on May 14, 1970 and took the oath of office on June 9, 1970. Blackmun was Nixon's third choice to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Abe Fortas on May 14, 1969. His confirmation followed contentious battles over two previous, failed nominations forwarded by Nixon in 1969‚Äì1970, those of Clement Haynsworth and G. Harrold Carswell. Nixon's original choice, Lewis F. Powell Jr., turned him down but later joined the Court in 1972. Blackmun served as Circuit Justice for the Eighth Circuit from June 9, 1970 to August 2, 1994 and for the First Circuit from August 7, 1990 to October 8, 1990. = Early years on the Supreme Court = Blackmun, a lifelong Republican, was expected to adhere to a conservative interpretation of the Constitution. The Court's Chief Justice at the time, Warren Burger, a long-time friend of Blackmun's and best man at his wedding, had recommended Blackmun for the job to Nixon. The two were often referred to as the \\"Minnesota Twins\\" (a reference to the baseball team, the Minnesota Twins, in turn named after the \\"Twin Cities\\" of Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota) because of their common history in Minnesota and because they so often voted together. Indeed, Blackmun voted with Burger in 87.5 percent of the closely divided cases during his first five terms (1970 to 1975), and with William J. Brennan, the Court's leading liberal, in only 13 percent.Greenhouse, Linda. Becoming Justice Blackmun. Times Books. 2005. Page 186. In 1972, Blackmun joined Burger and the other two Nixon appointees to the Court in dissenting from the Furman v. Georgia decision that invalidated all capital punishment laws then in force in the United States, and in 1976, he voted to reinstate the death penalty in Gregg v. Georgia, even the mandatory death penalty statutes, although in both instances he indicated his personal opinion of its shortcomings as a policy. Blackmun, however, insisted his political opinions should have no bearing on the death penalty's constitutionality. That began to change, however, between 1975 and 1980, by which time Blackmun was joining Brennan in 54.5 percent of the divided cases, and Burger in 45.5 percent. Shortly after Blackmun dissented in Rizzo v. Goode (1976), William Kunstler embraced him and \\"welcom[ed] him to the company of the 'liberals and the enlightened.'\\"Woodward & Armstrong, The Brethren 506 (2005). From 1981 to 1986 when Burger retired, the two men voted together in only 32.4 percent of close cases, whereas Blackmun joined Brennan in 70.6 percent of the close cases. = Abortion = In 1973, Blackmun authored the Court's opinion in Roe v. Wade, invalidating a Texas statute making it a felony to administer an abortion in most circumstances. The Court's judgment in the companion case of Doe v. Bolton held a less restrictive Georgia law to be unconstitutional also. Both decisions were based on the right to privacy announced in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965) and remain the primary basis for the constitutional right to abortion in the United States. Roe caused an immediate uproar, and Blackmun's opinion made him a target for criticism by opponents of abortion, receiving voluminous negative mail and death threats over the case. Blackmun became a passionate advocate for abortion rights, often delivering speeches and lectures promoting Roe v. Wade as essential to women's equality and criticizing Roe's critics. Defending abortion, in Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Blackmun wrote: Blackmun filed separate opinions in 1989's Webster v. Reproductive Health Services and 1992's Planned Parenthood v. Casey, warning that Roe was in jeopardy: \\"I am 83 years old. I cannot remain on this Court forever, and when I do step down, the confirmation process for my successor well may focus on the issue before us today. That, I regret, may be exactly where the choice between the two worlds will be made.\\" Ancillary to the primary right to abortion, Blackmun extended First Amendment protection to commercial speech in Bigelow v. Commonwealth of Virginia, a case where the Supreme Court overturned the conviction of an editor who ran an advertisement for an abortion referral service. = Split with Burger = After Roe, Blackmun began to drift away from the influence of Chief Justice Warren Burger to increasingly side with liberal Justice Brennan in finding constitutional protection for unenumerated individual rights. For example, Blackmun wrote a dissent to the Court's opinion in 1986's Bowers v. Hardwick. The Court's ruling in this case denied constitutional protection to homosexual sodomy. Burger's opinion in Bowers read: \\"To hold that the act of homosexual sodomy is somehow protected as a fundamental right would be to cast aside millennia of moral teaching.\\" In his dissent, Blackmun responded by quoting Oliver Wendell Holmes: \\"[i]t is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was laid down in the time of Henry IV. It is still more revolting if the grounds upon which it was laid down have vanished long since, and the rule simply persists from blind imitation of the past.\\" Burger and Blackmun drifted apart, and as the years passed, their lifelong friendship degenerated into a hostile and contentious relationship. From the 1981 term through the 1985 term, Blackmun voted with Brennan 77.6% of the time, and with Thurgood Marshall 76.1%. From 1986 to 1990, his rate of agreement with the two most liberal justices was 97.1% and 95.8%. Blackmun's judicial philosophy increasingly seemed guided by Roe, even in areas where Roe was not apparently directly applicable. His concurring opinion in 1981's Michael M. v. Superior Court of Sonoma County, a case that upheld statutory rape laws that applied only to men, did not directly implicate Roe, but because the laws were justified on the basis that women would be subject to the \\"risk\\" of pregnancy, Blackmun had cause to discuss Roe further in his opinion. = Later years on the bench = Despite his stated personal \\"abhorrence\\" for the death penalty in Furman v. Georgia, he voted to uphold mandatory death penalty statutes at issue in 1976's Roberts v. Louisiana and Woodson v. North Carolina, even though these laws would have automatically imposed the death penalty on anyone found guilty of first-degree murder. But on February 22, 1994, less than two months before announcing his retirement, Blackmun announced that he now saw the death penalty as always and in all circumstances unconstitutional by issuing a dissent from the Court's refusal to hear a routine death penalty case (Callins v. Collins), declaring that \\"[f]rom this day forward, I no longer shall tinker with the machinery of death.\\" Subsequently, adopting the practice begun by Justices Brennan and Marshall, he issued a dissent from denial of certiorari in every death penalty case, citing and reiterating his Callins dissent. As Linda Greenhouse and others have reported, Blackmun's law clerks prepared what would become the Callins dissent well in advance of the case coming before the Court; Blackmun's papers indicate that work began on the dissent in the summer of 1993, and in a memo preserved in Blackmun's papers, the clerk writing the dissent wrote Blackmun that: Blackmun and his clerks then sought an appropriate case to serve as a \\"vehicle for [the] dissent,\\" and settled on Callins. That the case found the dissent, rather than the more traditional relationship of the dissent relating to the case, is underscored by the opinion's almost total omission of reference to the case it ostensibly addressed: Callins is relegated to a supernumerary in his own appeal, being mentioned but five times in a 42-paragraph opinion ‚Äì three times within the first two paragraphs, and twice in footnote 2. In his emotional dissent in 1989's DeShaney v. Winnebago County, rejecting the constitutional liability of the state of Wisconsin for four-year-old Joshua DeShaney, who was beaten until brain-damaged by his abusive father, Blackmun famously opined, \\"Poor Joshua!\\" In his dissent in 1993's Herrera v. Collins, where the Court refused to find a constitutional right for convicted prisoners to introduce new evidence of \\"actual innocence\\" for purposes of obtaining federal relief, Blackmun argued in a section joined by no other justice that \\"The execution of a person who can show that he is innocent comes perilously close to simple murder.\\" = Women's rights = In Stanton v. Stanton (1975), a case striking down a state's definitions of adulthood (males reaching it at 21, women at 18), Blackmun wrote:  Relationship with law clerks  Compared to other Justices on the Supreme Court, Blackmun gave his law clerks great latitude in drafting opinions, such as his opinion in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which was written by Stephanie Dangel, then one of Blackmun's clerk and now a lawyer in Pennsylvania. Blackmun's Casey opinion draft included sharp criticism of Chief Justice William Rehnquist, which included, according to Dangel, a sarcastic reference to Rehnquist as \\"The Chief\\" rather than Chief Justice because \\"I have my doubts as to whether he deserves to be called 'justice' on this one.\\" Dangel, however, changed it to \\"Chief Justice\\" at the urging of Justice Anthony Kennedy. It has also been revealed by Blackmun in a 1995 oral history with Harold Koh that his dissent in Bowers v. Hardwick was written by a clerk, Pam Karlan. Blackmun said of the dissent; \\"[K]arlan did a lot of very effective writing, and I owe a lot to her and her ability in getting that dissent out. She felt very strongly about it, and I think is correct in her approach to it. I think the dissent is correct.\\"Adam Liptak, Exhibit A for a Major Shift: Justices‚Äô Gay Clerks, (June 8, 2013) (discussing Karlan's authorship of Justice Blackmun's dissent in Bowers). = Notable clerks = Blackmun's clerks included Edward B. Foley.  Relationship with other justices  When Blackmun's papers were released at the Library of Congress, his sometimes negative notations regarding fellow Justice Clarence Thomas came to light. However, Thomas spoke positively of Blackmun when he appeared in 2001 at the dedication of the Harry A. Blackmun Rotunda at the St. Louis federal courthouse, mentioning that Blackmun drove a blue Volkswagen Beetle and would tell fast food patrons that he was \\"Harry. I work for the government.\\" Blackmun and Justice Potter Stewart shared an obsessive following of baseball. In one oral argument on October 10, 1973, Stewart passed Blackmun a note that read, \\"V.P. AGNEW JUST RESIGNED!! METS 2 REDS 0.\\" (The game in question was the 5th and deciding game of the 1973 National League Championship Series, and the Mets would eventually win that game 7-2, sending them to the 1973 World Series.)Biskupic, Joan (December 25, 2007). \\"Ginsburg, Scalia Strike a Balance\\" USA Today. Accessed August 24, 2009.  Post-Supreme Court  Blackmun announced his retirement from the Supreme Court in April 1994, four months before he officially left the bench, assuming retired status on August 3, 1994. By then, he had become the court's most liberal justice. In his place, President Bill Clinton nominated Stephen Breyer who was confirmed by the Senate 87‚Äì9. In 1995, Blackmun received the United States Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards. In 1997, Blackmun portrayed Justice Joseph Story in the Steven Spielberg film Amistad, making him the only United States Supreme Court justice to have played a judge in a motion picture. On February 22, 1999, Blackmun fell in his home and broke his hip. The next day, he underwent hip replacement surgery at Arlington Hospital in Arlington, Virginia, but he never fully recovered. Ten days later, on March 4, at the age of 90, he died at 1:00 A.M. from complications from the procedure. He lay in repose in the Great Hall of the United States Supreme Court Building, and was buried five days later at Arlington National Cemetery. His wife died seven years later on July 13, 2006, at the age of 95, and was buried next to him. In 2004 the Library of Congress released his voluminous files. Blackmun had kept all the documents from every case, notes the Justices passed between themselves, 10 percent of the mail he received, and numerous other documents. After Blackmun announced his retirement from the Court, he recorded a 38-hour oral history with one of his former law clerks, former Yale Law School dean Harold Koh, which was also released. In it, he discusses his thoughts on everything from his important Court cases to the Supreme Court piano, though some Supreme Court experts such as David Garrow have cast doubt on the accuracy of some of Blackmun's recollections, especially his thoughts on the Court's deliberations on Roe v. Wade. Based on these papers, Linda Greenhouse of The New York Times wrote Becoming Justice Blackmun. Jan Crawford's Supreme Conflict also draws heavily from the papers.

It was originally introduced by the Catholic Church, particularly by the Jesuits, as a means to combat the Reformation and the Protestant church with a new architecture that inspired surprise and awe.Gauvin Alexander Bailey, Between Renaissance and Baroque: Jesuit Art in Rome, 1565‚Äì1610 (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2003). It reached its peak in the High Baroque (1625‚Äì1675), when it was used in churches and palaces in Italy, Spain, Portugal and France, and Austria. In the Late Baroque period (1675‚Äì1750), it reached as far as Russia and the Spanish and Portuguese colonies in Latin America, Beginning in about 1730, an even more elaborately decorative variant called Rococo appeared and flourished in Central Europe.Oudin, Dictionnaire des Architectes (1994), pp. 43‚Äì44Ducher (1988), Flammarion, pp. 102‚Äì104 Baroque architects took the basic elements of Renaissance architecture, including domes and colonnades, and made them higher, grander, more decorated, and more dramatic. The interior effects were often achieved with the use of quadratura, or trompe-l'oeil painting combined with sculpture; The eye is drawn upward, giving the illusion that one is looking into the heavens. Clusters of sculpted angels and painted figures crowd the ceiling. Light was also used for dramatic effect; it streamed down from cupolas, and was reflected from an abundance of gilding. Twisted columns were also often used, to give an illusion of upwards motion, and cartouches and other decorative elements occupied every available space. In Baroque palaces, grand stairways became a central element.Ducher (1988), Flammarion, p. 102 The Early Baroque (1584‚Äì1625) was largely dominated by the work of Roman architects, notably the Church of the Ges√π by Giacomo della Porta (consecrated 1584) facade and colonnade of St. Peter's Basilica by Carlo Maderno (completed 1612) and the lavish Barberini Palace interiors by Pietro da Cortona (1633‚Äì1639). Church of the Ges√π by Giacomo della Porta (consecrated 1584), interior, and Santa Susanna (1603), by Carlo Maderno. In France, the Luxembourg Palace (1615‚Äì45) built by Salomon de Brosse for Marie de Medici was an early example of the style.Toman (Rolf, L'Art Baroque ‚Äì Architecture ‚Äì Sculpture- Peinture (2015) pp. 12‚Äì70 The High Baroque (1625‚Äì1675) produced major works in Rome by Pietro da Cortona, including the (Church of Santi Luca e Martina) (1635‚Äì50); by Francesco Borromini (San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane (1634‚Äì1646)) ; and by Gian Lorenzo Bernini (The colonnade of St. Peter's Basilica) (1656‚Äì57). In Venice, High Baroque works included Santa Maria della Salute by Baldassare Longhena. Examples in France included the Pavillon de l‚ÄôHorloge of the Louvre Palace by Jacques Lemercier (1624‚Äì1645), the Chapel of the Sorbonne by Jacques Lemercier (1626‚Äì35) and the Ch√¢teau de Maisons by Fran√ßois Mansart (1630‚Äì1651). The Late Baroque (1675‚Äì1750) saw the style spread to all parts of Europe, and to the colonies of Spain and Portugal in the New World. National styles became more varied and distinct. The Late Baroque in France, under Louis XIV, was more ordered and classical; examples included the Hall of Mirrors of the Palace of Versailles and the dome of Les Invalides. An especially ornate variant, appeared in the early 18th century; it was first called Rocaille in France; then Rococo in Spain and Central Europe. The sculpted and painted decoration covering every space on the walls and ceiling. Its most celebrated architect was Balthasar Neumann, noted for the Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers and the Wurzburg Residence (1749‚Äì51).Toman (2015), pp. 190‚Äì194  History  = Early Baroque (1584‚Äì1625) = File:Church of the Ges√π, Rome.jpgFacade of the Church of the Ges√π Rome (consecrated 1584) File:Dome of Church of the Ges√π (Rome).jpgInterior view of Dome of the Church of the Ges√π by Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola, and Giacomo della Porta File:–ù—è—Å–≤—ñ–∂ –ö–∞—Å—Ü—ë–ª –ë–æ–∂–∞–≥–∞ –¶–µ–ª–∞.JPGCorpus Christi Church, Nesvizh in what is now Belarus (1586 and 1593) File:Santa Susanna (Rome) - facade.jpgFacade of Santa Susanna, Rome by Carlo Maderno (1603) File:Krakow 16.jpgSaints Peter and Paul Church, Krak√≥w, Poland by Giovanni Maria Bernardoni (1605‚Äì1619) File:Facade St-Gervais St- Protais.jpgThe Church of St-Gervais-et-St-Protais, the first Paris church with a fa√ßade in the new Baroque style (1616‚Äì20) File:Palais Luxembourg Sunset Edit.JPGThe Luxembourg Palace by Salomon de Brosse (1615‚Äì1624) Baroque architecture first appeared in the late 16th and early 17th century in religious architecture in Rome a means to counter the popular appeal of the Protestant Reformation. It was a reaction against the more severe and academic earlier style of earlier churches, it aimed to inspire the common people with the effects of surprise, emotion and awe. To achieve this, it used a combination of contrast, movement, trompe-l'oeil and other dramatic and theatrical effects, such as quadratura the use of painted ceilings that gave the illusion that one was looking up directly at the sky. The new style was particularly favored by the new religious orders, including the Theatines and the Jesuits, who built new churches designed to attract and inspire a wide popular audience.Ducher, Caracteristique des Styles (1989), p. 102 Rome One of the first Baroque architects, Carlo Maderno, used Baroque effects of space and perspective in the new facade and colonnade of Saint Peter's Basilica, which was designed to contrast with and complement the gigantic dome built earlier by Michelangelo.Ducher, Caracteristique des Styles (1989), p. 104 Other influential early examples in Rome included the Church of the Ges√π by Giacomo della Porta (consecrated 1584), with the first Baroque facade and a highly ornate interior, and Santa Susanna (1603), by Carlo Maderno.Wittkower R., Art & Architecture in Italy 1600‚Äì1750, 1985 edn, p. 111 Paris The Jesuits soon imported the style to Paris. The Church of Saint-Gervais-Saint-Protais in Paris (1615‚Äì1621) had the first Baroque facade in France, the first facade in France, featuring, like the Italian Baroque facades, the three superimposed classical orders.Texier, Simon, Paris ‚Äì Panorama de l'architecture (2012), p. 31 The Italian style of palaces was also imported to Paris by Marie de Medici for her new residence, the Luxembourg Palace (1615‚Äì1624) by architect Salomon de Brosse, and for a new wing of the Chateau of Blois by Francois Mansard (1635‚Äì38). Nicolas Fouquet, the superintendent of finances for the young King Louis XIV, chose the new style for his ch√¢teau at Vaux-le-Vicomte (1612‚Äì1670) by Louis Le Vau. He was later imprisoned by the King because of the extravagant cost of the palace.Toman, L'Art Baroque (2015) p. 125 Central Europe The first example of early Baroque in Central Europe was the Corpus Christi Church, Nesvizh in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, built by the Jesuits on the Roman model between 1586 and 1593 in Nie≈õwie≈º (after 1945 Niasvizh in Belarus). The church also holds a distinction of being the first domed basilica with a Baroque fa√ßade in the Commonwealth and Eastern Europe. Another early example in Poland is the Church of Saints Peter and Paul Church, Krak√≥w, built between 1597 and 1619 by the Italian Jesuit architect Giovanni Maria Bernardoni. =High Baroque (1625‚Äì1675)= Italy File:Bernini Baldachino.jpgBaldaquin by Bernini in the Basilica of Saint Peter, Rome (1623‚Äì34) File:Allegory of Divine Providence and Barberini Power (Cortona) in Palazzo Barberini (Roma).jpgFresco on ceiling of the grand salon of Barberini Palace in Rome, by Pietro da Cortona (1633‚Äì1639) File:San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane.jpgSan Carlo alle Quattro Fontane by Francesco Borromini (1634‚Äì1646) File:San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane (Rome) - Dome.jpgThe interior of the dome of San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane by Francesco Borromini (1638‚Äì1641) File:Santi Luca e Martina (seen from Tabularium) - Roman Forum - Rome 2016 (2).jpgChurch of Santi Luca e Martina, in Rome, by Pietro da Cortona (1635‚Äì50) File:Santa Maria della Salute (Venice).jpgSanta Maria della Salute by Baldassare Longhena in Venice (1630‚Äì31). Pope Urban VIII, who occupied the Papacy from 1623 to 1644, became the most influential patron of the Baroque style. After the death of Carlo Maderno in 1629, Urban named the architect and sculptor Gian Lorenzo Bernini as the chief Papal architect. Bernini created not only Baroque buildings, but also Baroque interiors, squares and fountains, transforming the center of Rome into an enormous theater. Bernini rebuilt the Church of Santa Bibiana and the Church of San Sebastiano al Palatino on the Palatine Hill into Baroque landmarks, planned the Fontana del Tritone in the Piazza Barberini, and created the soaring baldacchino as the centerpiece St Peter's Basilica.Toman, L'Art Baroque (2015), pp. 15‚Äì45 The High Baroque spread gradually across Italy, beyond Rome. The period saw the construction of Santa Maria della Salute by Baldassare Longhena in Venice (1630‚Äì31). Churches were not the only buildings to use the Baroque style. One of the finest monuments of the early Baroque is the Barberini Palace (1626‚Äì1629), the residence of the family of Urban VIII, begun by Carlo Maderno, and completed and decorated by Bernini and Francesco Borromini. The outside of the Pope's family residence, was relatively restrained, but the interiors, and especially the immense fresco on the ceiling of the salon, the Allegory of Divine Providence and Barberini Power painted by Pietro da Cortona, are considered masterpieces of Baroque art and decoration.Toman, L'Art baroque (2015), pp. 21‚Äì23 Curving facades and the illusion of movement were a speciality of Francesco Borromini, most notably in San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane (1634‚Äì1646), one of the landmarks of the high Baroque.Ducher (1989) p. 104 Another important monument of the period was the Church of Santi Luca e Martina in Rome by Pietro da Cortona (1635‚Äì50), in the form of a Greek cross with an elegant dome. After the death or Urban VIII and the brief reign of his successor, the Papacy of Pope Alexander VII from 1666 until 1667 saw more construction of Baroque churches, squares and fountains in Rome by Carlo Rainaldi, Bernini and Carlo Fontana.Toman, L'Art baroque (2015), pp. 24‚Äì45 France File:Paris - Palais du Louvre - Pavillon de l'horloge - PA00085992 - 001.jpgPavillon de l‚ÄôHorloge of the Louvre Palace by Jacques Lemercier (1624‚Äì1645) File:Sorbonne DSC09369.jpgChapel of the Sorbonne by Jacques Lemercier (1626‚Äì35) File:Ch√¢teau de Maisons-Laffitte 001.jpgCh√¢teau de Maisons by Fran√ßois Mansart (1630‚Äì1651) King Louis XIII had sent the architect Jacques Lemercier to Rome between 1607 and 1614 to study the new style. On his return to France, he designed the Pavillon de l‚ÄôHorloge of the Louvre Palace (beginning 1626), and, more importantly, the Church of the Sorbonne, the first church dome in Paris. It was designed in 1626, and construction began in 1635.Toman (2015) p. 128 The next important French Baroque project was a much larger dome for the church of Val-de-Grace begun in 1645 by Lemercier and Fran√ßois Mansart, and finished in 1715. A third Baroque dome was soon added for the College of the Four Nations (now the Institut de France). In 1661, following the death of Cardinal Mazarin, the young Louis XIV took direct charge of the government. The arts were put under the direction of his controller of finance, Jean- Baptiste Colbert. Charles Le Brun, director of the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture, was named Superintendent of Buildings of the King, in charge of all royal architectural projects. The Royal Academy of Architecture was founded in 1671, with the mission of making Paris, not Rome, the artistic and architectural model for the world.Toman (2015) pp. 129‚Äì131 The first architectural project of Louis XIV was a proposed reconstruction of the facade of the east wing of the Louvre Palace. Bernini, then Europe's most famous architect, was summoned to Paris to submit a project. Beginning in 1664, Bernini proposed several Baroque variants, but in the end the King selected a design by a French architect, Charles Perrault, in a more classical variant of Baroque. This gradually became the Louis XIV style. Louis was soon engaged in an even larger project, the construction of the new Palace of Versailles. The architects chosen were Louis Le Vau and Jules Hardouin-Mansart, and the facades of the new palace were constructed around the earlier Marble Court between 1668 and 1678. The Baroque grandeur of Versailles, particularly the facade facing the garden and the Hall of Mirrors by Jules Hardouin-Mansart, became models for other palaces across Europe.Toman (2015) pp. 133‚Äì35 = Late Baroque (1675‚Äì1750) = During the period of the Late Baroque (1675‚Äì1750), the style appeared across Europe, from England and France to Central Europe and Russia, from Spain and Portugal to Scandinavia, and in the colonies of Spain and Portugal in the New World. It often took different names, and the regional variations became more distinct. A particularly ornate variant appeared in the early 18th century, called Rocaille in France and Rococo in Spain and Central Europe. The sculpted and painted decoration covering every space on the walls and ceiling. The most prominent architects of this style included Balthasar Neumann, noted for the Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers and the Wurzburg Residence (1749‚Äì51). These works were among the final expressions of the Rococo or the Late Baroque.

Notable examples included the Basilica of Superga, overlooking Turin, by Filippo Juvarra (1717‚Äì1731), which was later used as model for the Panth√©on in Paris. The Stupinigi Palace (1729‚Äì31) was a hunting lodge and one of the Residences of the Royal House of Savoy near Turin. It was also built Filippo Juvarra.

Later in the period, during the reign of Louis XV, a new, more ornate variant, the Rocaille style, or French Rococo, appeared in Paris and flourished between about 1723 and 1759.Lovreglio, Aur√©lia and Anne, Dictionnaire des Mobiliers et des Objets d'art, Le Robert, Paris, 2006, p. 369 The most prominent example was the salon of the Princess in H√¥tel de Soubise in Paris, designed by Germain Boffrand and Charles-Joseph Natoire (1735‚Äì40). The Rocaille style lasted until the mid-18th century. It never achieved the extravagant exuberance of the Rococo in Bavaria, Austria and Italy. The discoveries of Roman antiquities beginning in 1738 at Herculanum and especially at Pompeii in 1748 turned French architecture in the direction of the more symmetrical and less flamboyant neo-classicism. England Christopher Wren was the leading figure of the late Baroque in England, with his reconstruction of St. Paul's Cathedral (1675‚Äì1711) inspired by the model of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, his plan for Greenwich Hospital (begun 1695), and Hampton Court Palace (1690‚Äì96). Other British figures of the late Baroque included Inigo Jones for Wilton House (1632‚Äì1647 and two pupils of Wren, John Vanbrugh and Nicholas Hawksmoor, for Castle Howard (1699‚Äì1712) and Blenheim Palace (1705‚Äì1724).Toman (2015) pp. 162‚Äì169 File:St Paul's Cathedral, London, UK.jpgWest facade of Saint Paul's Cathedral by Christopher Wren (1675‚Äì1702) File:Greenwich Hospital from Thames.jpgGreenwich Hospital by Sir Christopher Wren (1694) File:Castle Howard and garden.jpgCastle Howard, North Yorkshire by John Vanbrugh and Nicholas Hawksmoor (1699‚Äì1712) File:Blenheim Palace cropped.jpgBlenheim Palace by John Vanbrugh and Nicholas Hawksmoor Central Europe Many of the most extraordinary buildings of the Late Baroque were constructed in Austria, Germany, and Czechia. In Austria, the leading figure was Fischer von Erlach, who built the Karlskirche, the largest church of Vienna, to glorify the Austrian Emperors. These works sometimes borrowed elements from Versailles combined with elements of the Italian Baroque to create grandiose new effects, as in the Schwarzenberg Palace (1715). Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt used grand stairways and ellipses to achieve his effects at the upper and lower Belvedere Palace in Vienna (1714‚Äì1722). In The Abbey of Melk, Jakob Prandtauer used an abundance of polychrome marble and stucco, statuary and ceiling paintings to achieve harmonious and highly theatrical effects.Cabanne (1988), pp. 89‚Äì91 Another important figure of German Baroque was Balthasar Neumann (1687‚Äì1753), whose works included the W√ºrzburg Residence for the Prince-Bishops at W√ºrzburg, with its famous staircase.Cabanne (1988), pp. 901 In Bohemia, the leading Baroque architect was Christoph Dientzenhofer, whose building featured complex curves and counter-curves and elliptical forms, making Prague, like Vienna, a capital of the late Baroque.Cabanne (1988), pp. 90‚Äì92 File:Stift Melk church dsc01494.jpgInterior of the church of the Abbey of Melk by Jakob Prandtauer (1702‚Äì1736) File:Clementinum library2.jpgLibrary of the Clementinum, the Jesuit university in Prague (1722) File:Karlskirche Abendsonne 3.JPGKarlskirche, Vienna by Fischer von Erlach (consecrated 1737) File:Kaisersaal W√ºrzburg.jpgKaisersaal of Wurzburg Residence by Balthasar Neumann (1749‚Äì51) File:Vierzehnheiligen-Basilika3-Asio.JPGBasilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers by Balthasar Neumann (1743‚Äì1772) File:Grassalkovich- kast√©ly (7051. sz√°m√∫ m≈±eml√©k) 6.jpgRoyal Palace of G√∂d√∂ll≈ë (Hungary) by Andr√°s Mayerhoffer (1730s‚Äì1785) Spain Political and economic crises in the 17th century largely delayed the arrival of the Baroque in Span until the late period, though it was strongly promoted by the Jesuits. Its early characteristics were a lavish exterior contrasting with a relatively simple interior, and the use of the multiple spaces and carefully planned lighting in the interior to give an impression of mystery. early 18th century,Cabanne (1988) pp. 49‚Äì51 Notable Spanish examples included the new west facade of Santiago de Compostela Cathedral, (1738‚Äì50), with its spectacular towers, by Fernando de Casas Novoa. In Seville, Leonardo de Figueroa was the creator of the College of San Telmo, with a facade inspired by Italian Baroque. The most ornate works of the Spanish Baroque were made by Jose Benito de Churriguera in Madrid and Salamanca. In his work, the buildings are nearly overwhelmed by ornament of gilded wood, gigantic twisting columns, and sculpted vegetation. His two brothers, Joaquin and Alberto, also made important, if less ornamented, contributions to what became known simply as the Churrigueresque style.

The style was sometimes called Churrigueresque, after the family of Baroque architects in Salamanca. A particularly fine example is Zacatecas Cathedral in Zacatecas City, in north-central Mexico, with its lavishly sculpted facade and twin bell towers. Another important example is San Cristobal de las Casas in Mexico.Toman (2015) p. 120 A notable example in Brazil is the Monastery of Sao Bento in Rio de Janeiro. begun in 1617, with additional decoration after 1668.

Sometimes painted or sculpted figures of Atlantes appear to be holding up the ceiling. In some Baroque churches, illusionistic ceiling painting gave the illusion of three dimensions. * grand stairways. Stairways often occupied a central place and were used for dramatic effect. winding upwards in stages, giving changing views from different levels, serving as a setting for ceremonies.Ducher (1988), p. 102 * cartouche in elaborate forms and sculpted frames break up the surfaces and add three-dimensional effects to the walls. * mirrors to give the impression of depth and greater space, particularly when combined with windows, as in the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles. * incomplete architectural elements, such as frontons with sections missing, causing sections to merge and disorienting the eye. * chiaroscuro. Use of strong contrasts of darkness and light for dramatic effect. * overhead sculpture. Potty or figures on or just below the ceiling, made of wood (often gilded), plaster or stucco, marble or faux finishing, giving the impression of floating in the air. * Solomonic columns, which gave an illusion of motion. * elliptical or oval spaces, eliminating right angles.

An oft-quoted poem, it is a popular example of the dramatic monologue. Facing old age, mythical hero Ulysses describes his discontent and restlessness upon returning to his kingdom, Ithaca, after his far-ranging travels. Despite his reunion with his wife Penelope and his son Telemachus, Ulysses yearns to explore again. The character of Ulysses (in Greek, Odysseus) has been explored widely in literature. The adventures of Odysseus were first recorded in Homer's Iliad and Odyssey (c. 800‚Äì700 BC), and Tennyson draws on Homer's narrative in the poem. Most critics, however, find that Tennyson's Ulysses recalls Dante's Ulisse in his Inferno (c. 1320). In Dante's re- telling, Ulisse is condemned to hell among the false counsellors, both for his pursuit of knowledge beyond human bounds and for creating the deception of the Trojan horse. For much of this poem's history, readers viewed Ulysses as resolute and heroic, admiring him for his determination \\"To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield\\". The view that Tennyson intended a heroic character is supported by his statements about the poem, and by the events in his life‚Äîthe death of his closest friend‚Äîthat prompted him to write it. In the twentieth century, some new interpretations of \\"Ulysses\\" highlighted potential ironies in the poem. They argued, for example, that Ulysses wishes to selfishly abandon his kingdom and family, and they questioned more positive assessments of Ulysses' character by demonstrating how he resembles flawed protagonists in earlier literature. Synopsis and structure As the poem begins, Ulysses has returned to his kingdom, Ithaca, having made a long journey home after fighting in the Trojan War. Confronted again by domestic life, Ulysses expresses his lack of contentment, including his indifference toward the \\"savage race\\" (line 4) whom he governs. Ulysses contrasts his present restlessness with his heroic past, and contemplates his old age and eventual death‚Äî\\"Life piled on life / Were all too little, and of one to me / Little remains\\" (24‚Äì26)‚Äîand longs for further experience and knowledge. His son Telemachus will inherit the throne that Ulysses finds burdensome. While Ulysses thinks that Telemachus will be a good king‚Äî\\"Most blameless is he, centred in the sphere / Of common duties\\" (39)‚Äîhe seems to have lost any connection to his son‚Äî\\"He works his work, I mine\\" (43)‚Äîand the conventional methods of governing‚Äî\\"by slow prudence\\" and \\"through soft degrees\\" (36, 37). In the final section, Ulysses turns to his fellow mariners and calls on them to join him on another quest, making no guarantees as to their fate but attempting to conjure their heroic past: ‚Ä¶ Come, my friends, 'Tis not too late to seek a newer world. Push off, and sitting well in order smite The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths Of all the western stars, until I die. It may be that the gulfs will wash us down; It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles, And see the great Achilles, whom we knew. (56‚Äì64) = Prosody = The speaker's language is unelaborated but forceful, and it expresses Ulysses' conflicting moods as he searches for continuity between his past and future. There is often a marked contrast between the sentiment of Ulysses' words and the sounds that express them. For example, the poem's insistent iambic pentameter is often interrupted by spondees (metrical feet that consist of two long syllables); such laboured language slows the poem (and in other places may cast doubt upon the reliability of Ulysses' utterances): Yet all experience is an arch wherethro' Gleams that untravell'd world, whose margin fades For ever and for ever when I move. (19‚Äì21) Observing their burdensome prosodic effect, the poet Matthew Arnold remarked, \\"these three lines by themselves take up nearly as much time as a whole book of the Iliad.\\"Quoted in . Many of the poem's clauses carry over into the following line; these enjambments emphasize Ulysses' restlessness and dissatisfaction. = Form = The poem's seventy lines of blank verse are presented as a dramatic monologue. Scholars disagree on how Ulysses' speech functions in this format; it is not necessarily clear to whom Ulysses is speaking, if anyone, and from what location. Some see the verse turning from a soliloquy to a public address, as Ulysses seems to speak to himself in the first movement, then to turn to an audience as he introduces his son, and then to relocate to the seashore where he addresses his mariners. In this interpretation, the comparatively direct and honest language of the first movement is set against the more politically minded tone of the last two movements. For example, the second paragraph (33‚Äì43) about Telemachus, in which Ulysses muses again about domestic life, is a \\"revised version [of lines 1‚Äì5] for public consumption\\": a \\"savage race\\" is revised to a \\"rugged people\\". The ironic interpretations of \\"Ulysses\\" may be the result of the modern tendency to consider the narrator of a dramatic monologue as necessarily \\"unreliable\\". According to critic Dwight Culler, the poem has been a victim of revisionist readings in which the reader expects to reconstruct the truth from a misleading narrator's accidental revelations. (Compare the more obvious use of this approach in Robert Browning's \\"My Last Duchess\\".) Culler himself views \\"Ulysses\\" as a dialectic in which the speaker weighs the virtues of a contemplative and an active approach to life; Ulysses moves through four emotional stages that are self-revelatory, not ironic: beginning with his rejection of the barren life to which he has returned in Ithaca, he then fondly recalls his heroic past, recognizes the validity of Telemachus' method of governing, and with these thoughts plans another journey. = Publication history = Tennyson completed the poem on 20 October 1833, but it was not published until 1842, in his second collection of Poems. Unlike many of Tennyson's other important poems, \\"Ulysses\\" was not revised after its publication. Tennyson originally blocked out the poem in four paragraphs, broken before lines 6, 33 and 44. In this structure, the first and third paragraphs are thematically parallel, but may be read as interior and exterior monologues, respectively. However, the poem is often printed with the first paragraph break omitted. Interpretations =Autobiographical elements= The death of Arthur Henry Hallam, a young poet and close friend of Tennyson, was devastating for him. Tennyson penned \\"Ulysses\\" after the death of his close Cambridge friend, the poet Arthur Henry Hallam (1811‚Äì1833), with whom Tennyson had a strong emotional bond. The two friends had spent much time discussing poetry and philosophy, writing verse, and travelling in southern France, the Pyrenees, and Germany. Tennyson considered Hallam destined for greatness, perhaps as a statesman. When Tennyson heard on 1 October 1833 of his friend's death, he was living in Somersby, Lincolnshire, in cramped quarters with his mother and nine of his ten siblings. His father had died in 1831, requiring Tennyson to return home and take responsibility for the family. Tennyson's friends were becoming increasingly concerned about his mental and physical health during this time. The family had little income, and three of Tennyson's brothers were mentally ill. Just as Tennyson's outlook was improving‚Äîhe was adjusting to his new domestic duties, regaining contact with friends, and had published his 1832 book of poems‚Äîthe news of Hallam's death arrived. Tennyson shared his grief with his sister, Emily, who had been engaged to Hallam. According to Victorian scholar Linda Hughes, the emotional gulf between the state of his domestic affairs and the loss of his special friendship informs the reading of \\"Ulysses\\"‚Äîparticularly its treatment of domesticity. At one moment, Ulysses' discontent seems to mirror that of Tennyson, who would have been frustrated with managing the house in such a state of grief. At the next, Ulysses is determined to transcend his age and his environment by travelling again. It may be that Ulysses' determination to defy circumstance attracted Tennyson to the myth; he said that the poem \\"gave my feeling about the need of going forward and braving the struggle of life\\".Widely quoted; see for example . On another occasion, the poet stated, \\"There is more about myself in Ulysses, which was written under the sense of loss and that all had gone by, but that still life must be fought out to the end. It was more written with the feeling of his loss upon me than many poems in In Memoriam.\\"Quoted in . Hallam's death influenced much of Tennyson's poetry, including perhaps his most highly regarded work, In Memoriam A.H.H., begun in 1833 and completed seventeen years later. Other critics find stylistic incongruities between the poem and its author that make \\"Ulysses\\" exceptional. W. W. Robson writes, \\"Tennyson, the responsible social being, the admirably serious and 'committed' individual, is uttering strenuous sentiments in the accent of Tennyson the most un-strenuous, lonely and poignant of poets.\\" He finds that Tennyson's two widely noted personae, the \\"responsible social being\\" and the melancholic poet, meet uniquely in \\"Ulysses\\", yet seem not to recognize each other within the text. =Literary context= A Roman mosaic depicting a maritime scene with Odysseus (Ulysses), from Carthage, 2nd century AD Tennyson adopts aspects of the Ulysses character and narrative from many sources; his treatment of Ulysses is the first modern account. The ancient Greek poet Homer introduced Ulysses (Odysseus in GreekThe word \\"Ulysses\\" (more correctly \\"Ulixes\\") is the Latin form of the Greek \\"Odysseus\\", source of the word \\"odyssey\\".), and many later poets took up the character, including Euripides,Tennyson wrote in the margin of Euripides' Hecabe, \\"Ulysses is, as usual, crafty [and] unfeeling\\" (). Horace, Dante, William Shakespeare, and Alexander Pope. Homer's Odyssey provides the poem's narrative background: in its eleventh book the prophet Tiresias foretells that Ulysses will return to Ithaca after a difficult voyage, then begin a new, mysterious voyage, and later die a peaceful, \\"unwarlike\\" death that comes vaguely \\"from the sea\\". At the conclusion of Tennyson's poem, his Ulysses is contemplating undertaking this new voyage. Tennyson's character, however, is not the lover of public affairs seen in Homer's poems. Rather, \\"Ulisse\\" from Dante's Inferno is Tennyson's main source for the character, which has an important effect on the poem's interpretation. Ulisse recalls his voyage in the Inferno's 26th canto, in which he is condemned to the Eighth Circle of false counsellors for misusing his gift of reason. Dante treats Ulisse, with his \\"zeal ‚Ä¶/ T'explore the world\\", as an evil counsellor who lusts for adventure at the expense of his family and his duties in Ithaca. Tennyson projects this zeal into Ulysses' unquenched desire for knowledge: And this gray spirit yearning in desire To follow knowledge like a sinking star, Beyond the utmost bound of human thought. (30‚Äì32) The poet's intention to recall the Homeric character remains evident in certain passages. \\"I am become a name\\" (11) recalls an episode in the Odyssey in which Demodocus sings about Odysseus' adventures in the king's presence, acknowledging his fame. With phrases such as \\"There gloom the dark broad seas\\" (45) and \\"The deep / Moans round with many voices\\" (55‚Äì56), Tennyson seems to be consciously invoking Homer. Critics have also noted the influence of Shakespeare in two passages. In the early movement, the savage race \\"That hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me\\" (5) echoes Hamlet's soliloquy: \\"What is a man, / If his chief good and market of his time / Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.\\"IV, iv. 32 ff., quoted in Tennyson's \\"How dull it is to pause, to make an end, / To rust unburnish‚Äôd, not to shine in use!\\" (22‚Äì23) recalls Shakespeare's Ulysses in Troilus and Cressida (c. 1602):Troilus and Cressida, Act III, Scene III, quoted in . perseverance, my dear lord, Keeps honour bright: to have done is to hang Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail, In monumental mockery. In one of William Blake's watercolors (1824‚Äì1827) illustrating Dante's Inferno, Ulysses and Diomedes are condemned to the Eighth Circle. The last movement of \\"Ulysses\\", which is among the most familiar passages in English poetry of the period, presents decisive evidence of the influence of Dante. Ulysses turns his attention from himself and his kingdom and speaks of ports, seas, and his mariners. The strains of discontent and weakness in old age remain throughout the poem, but Tennyson finally leaves Ulysses \\"To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield\\" (70), recalling the Dantesque damnable desire for knowledge beyond all bounds. The words of Dante's character as he exhorts his men to the journey find parallel in those of Tennyson's Ulysses, who calls his men to join him on one last voyage. Quoting Dante's Ulisse: 'O brothers', said I, 'who are come despite Ten thousand perils to the West, let none, While still our senses hold the vigil slight Remaining to us ere our course is run, Be willing to forgo experience Of the unpeopled world beyond the sun. Regard your origin,‚Äîfrom whom and whence! Not to exist like brutes, but made were ye To follow virtue and intelligence'.Dante, Inferno XXVI; quoted in . Critics note, however, that in the Homeric narrative, Ulysses' original mariners are dead. A tension may therefore be found in Ulysses' speech to his sailors (\\"Come, my friends,/ 'Tis not too late to seek a newer world/ ...\\" [56‚Äì57]). Since Dante's Ulisse has already undertaken this voyage and recounts it in the Inferno, Ulysses' entire monologue can be envisioned as his recollection while situated in Hell. =From affirmation to irony= \\"Satan rises from the burning lake\\" (1866) by Gustave Dor√©; a critical interpretation of the poem compares Ulysses' final sentiments with Satan's \\"courage never to submit or yield\\" in John Milton's Paradise Lost. The degree to which Tennyson identifies with Ulysses has provided one of the great debates among scholars of the poem. Critics who find that Tennyson identifies with the speaker read Ulysses' speech \\"affirmatively\\", or without irony. Many other interpretations of the poem have developed from the argument that Tennyson does not identify with Ulysses, and further criticism has suggested that the purported inconsistencies in Ulysses' character are the fault of the poet himself. Key to the affirmative reading of \\"Ulysses\\" is the biographical context of the poem. Such a reading takes into account Tennyson's statements about writing the poem‚Äî\\"the need of going forward\\"‚Äîand considers that he would not undermine Ulysses' determination with irony when he needed a similar stalwartness to face life after Hallam's death. The passion and conviction of Tennyson's language‚Äîand even his own comments on the poem‚Äîsignify that the poet, as was typical in the Victorian age, admired courage and persistence. Read straightforwardly, \\"Ulysses\\" promotes the questing spirit of youth, even in old age, and a refusal to resign and face life passively. Ulysses is thus seen as a heroic character whose determination to seek \\"some work of noble note\\" (52) is courageous in the face of a \\"still hearth\\" (2) and old age.Tennyson, however, discouraged an autobiographical interpretation of his monologues (). Until the early twentieth century, readers reacted to \\"Ulysses\\" sympathetically. The meaning of the poem was increasingly debated as Tennyson's stature rose. After Paull F. Baum criticized Ulysses' inconsistencies and Tennyson's conception of the poem in 1948, the ironic interpretation became dominant. Baum finds in Ulysses echoes of Lord Byron's flawed heroes, who similarly display conflicting emotions, self-critical introspection, and a rejection of social responsibility. Even Ulysses' resolute final utterance‚Äî\\"To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield\\"‚Äîis undercut by irony, when Baum and later critics compare this line to Satan's \\"courage never to submit or yield\\" in John Milton's Paradise Lost (1667)., cited in . Ulysses' apparent disdain for those around him is another facet of the ironic perspective. He declares that he is \\"matched with an aged wife\\" (3), indicates his weariness in governing a \\"savage race\\" (4), and suggests his philosophical distance from his son Telemachus. A skeptical reading of the second paragraph finds it a condescending tribute to Telemachus and a rejection of his \\"slow prudence\\" (36). However, the adjectives used to describe Telemachus‚Äî\\"blameless\\", \\"discerning\\", and \\"decent\\"‚Äîare words with positive connotations in other of Tennyson's poetry and within the classical tradition. Other ironic readings have found Ulysses longing for withdrawal, even death, in the form of his proposed quest. In noting the sense of passivity in the poem, critics highlight Tennyson's tendency toward the melancholic. \\"Ulysses\\" is found lacking in narrative action; the hero's goal is vague, and by the poem's famous last line, it is not clear for what he is \\"striving\\", or to what he refuses to yield. Goldwin Smith wrote in 1855 that Ulysses \\"intends to roam, but stands for ever a listless and melancholy figure on the shore\\".Quoted in T. S. Eliot, who praised the poem, still opined that \\"Tennyson could not tell a story at all\\"; he found Dante's treatment of Ulysses exciting compared to Tennyson's \\"elegiac mood\\". Victorian scholar Herbert Tucker suggests that the goal of Tennyson's characters is to be moved inwardly by moving through time and space. Ulysses says he finds experience \\"somewhere out there\\", ‚Ä¶ an arch wherethro' Gleams that untravell'd world whose margin fades For ever and for ever when I move. (19‚Äì21) Legacy Tennyson, as Poet Laureate, used verse to promote Empire. \\"Ulysses\\" has been interpreted as anticipating the concept of imperialism. =Contemporary appraisal and canonization= Contemporary reviews of \\"Ulysses\\" were positive and found no irony in the poem. Author John Sterling‚Äîlike Tennyson a member of the Cambridge Apostles‚Äîwrote in the Quarterly Review in 1842, \\"How superior is 'Ulysses'! There is in this work a delightful epic tone, and a clear impassioned wisdom quietly carving its sage words and graceful figures on pale but lasting marble.\\"Quoted in . Tennyson's 1842 volume of poetry impressed Scottish writer Thomas Carlyle. Quoting three lines of \\"Ulysses\\" in an 1842 letter to Tennyson‚Äî It may be that the gulfs will wash us down, It may be we shall touch the happy Isles And see the great Achilles whom we knew! [sic] (62‚Äì64) ‚ÄîCarlyle remarked, \\"These lines do not make me weep, but there is in me what would fill whole Lachrymatories as I read.\\" English theologian Richard Holt Hutton summarized the poem as Tennyson's \\"friendly picture of the insatiable craving for new experience, enterprise, and adventure, when under the control of a luminous reason and a self-controlled will.\\"Quoted in . The contemporary poet Matthew Arnold was early in observing the narrative irony of the poem: he found Ulysses' speech \\"the least plain, the most un-Homeric, which can possibly be conceived. Homer presents his thought to you just as it wells from the source of his mind: Mr. Tennyson carefully distils his thought before he will part with it. Hence comes ... a heightened and elaborate air.\\" Despite the early critical acclaim of \\"Ulysses\\", its rise within the Tennyson canon took decades. Tennyson did not usually select it for publication in poetry anthologies; in teaching anthologies, however, the poem was usually included‚Äîand it remains a popular teaching poem today. Its current prominence in Tennyson's oeuvre is the result of two trends, according to Tennyson scholar Matthew Rowlinson: the rise of formal English poetry studies in the late nineteenth century, and the Victorian effort to articulate a British culture that could be exported. He argues that \\"Ulysses\\" forms part of the prehistory of imperialism‚Äîa term that only appeared in the language in 1851. The protagonist sounds like a \\"colonial administrator\\", and his reference to seeking a newer world (57) echoes the phrase \\"New World\\", which became common during the Renaissance. While \\"Ulysses\\" cannot be read as overtly imperialistic, Tennyson's later work as Poet Laureate sometimes argues for the value of Britain's colonies, or was accused of jingoism. =Literary and cultural legacy= In a 1929 essay, T. S. Eliot called \\"Ulysses\\" a \\"perfect poem\\". An analogue of Ulysses is found in Eliot's \\"Gerontion\\" (1920). Both poems are narrated by an aged man contemplating life's end. An excerpt from \\"Gerontion\\" reads as an ironic comment on the introductory lines of \\"Ulysses\\": Rocks, moss, stonecrop, iron, merds. The woman keeps the kitchen, makes tea, Sneezes at evening, poking the peevish gutter. I am an old man, A dull head among windy places. (13‚Äì17) The Italian poet Giovanni Pascoli (1855‚Äì1912) stated that his long lyric poem L'ultimo viaggio was an attempt to reconcile the portrayals of Ulysses in Dante and Tennyson with Tiresias's prophecy that Ulysses would die \\"a mild death off the sea\\". Pascoli's Ulysses leaves Ithaca to retrace his epic voyage rather than begin another. \\"Ulysses\\" remains much admired, even as the twentieth century brought new interpretations of the poem. Professor of literature Basil Willey commented in 1956, \\"In 'Ulysses' the sense that he must press on and not moulder in idleness is expressed objectively, through the classical story, and not subjectively as his own experience. [Tennyson] comes here as near perfection in the grand manner as he ever did; the poem is flawless in tone from beginning to end; spare, grave, free from excessive decoration, and full of firmly controlled feeling.\\" In the fifteenth edition of Bartlett's Familiar Quotations (1980), nine sections of \\"Ulysses\\", comprising 36 of the poem's 70 lines, are quoted, compared to only six in the ninth edition of 1891. Many readers have found the acclaimed last lines of the poem inspirational. The final line has been used as a motto by schools and other organisations, and is inscribed on a cross at Observation Hill, Antarctica, to commemorate explorer Robert Falcon Scott and his party, who died on their return trek from the South Pole in 1912. \\"Ulysses\\"concludes: ... and tho' We are not now that strength which in old days Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are; One equal temper of heroic hearts, Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield. (68‚Äì70) The same line was quoted in the 2012 film Skyfall. It was also spoken by Frasier Crane as he signed off from his radio program, in the final episode of Frasier, \\"Goodnight, Seattle\\".

Mint-made errors are errors in a coin made by the mint during the minting process. Groups of coins with distinctive characteristics are known as varieties. The term variety applies to coins with both intended and unintended differences while the term error refers only to coins with unintended differences. Nevertheless, not all errors are varieties. Although there may be many identical examples of a some errors, others are unique. For example, there may be many indistinguishable examples of coins with a specific die crack, while off-center strikes tend to be unique. Being unique does not mean that an error is valuable. Although no other coin may be similar to a coin with an off-center strike, off-center strikes happen often enough that buyers can choose from many examples each of which varies slightly from the other. Mint error coins can be the result of deterioration of the minting equipment, accidents or malfunctions during the minting process, or intentional interventions by mint personnel.Herbert, Alan. Official Price Guide to Mint Errors. New York: House of Collectibles, 2007. 7th ed. p. 2. Print. Accidental error coins are perhaps the most numerous and in modern minting are usually very rare, making them valuable to numismatists. Intentional intervention by mint personnel does not necessarily include a deliberate attempt to create an error, but usually involves an action intended to improve quality that miscarries and creates error coins instead. Errors can be the result of defective planchets, defective dies or the result of mistakes made during striking. The planchet, die, and striking (or PDS) classification system happens to correspond with the mintmarks of the three largest U.S. mints, Philadelphia, Denver, and San Francisco. Not all errors fall neatly within the categories. Sometimes design elements are missing from coins because die crevices are filled with grease. Labels used to identify specific categories of errors sometimes describe the cause of the error (die crack, rotated die, clipped planchet). Other errors names describe what the viewer sees when looking at the coin (wavy steps, trails, missing element) while others have names that were adapted for use (mule, cud, brockage). The result is that some errors are known by multiple names. Filled die errors are also known as missing design element errors and as strike throughs. As is noted below under the discussion of missing design element coins, some errors have multiple causes. A rare error that sold for $5462.50 on Heritage Auctions in August 2010 is an undated U.S nickel struck on top of a 1960 5 centavos. Foreign coins struck on a U.S coin planchet or vice versa are very uncommon and hold a high value. Authentic error coins should not be confused with coins that are damaged after being minted, which is known as post-mint damage. Planchet preparation errors Mints purchase long strips of metal which are fed through blanking machines that punch out disks known as blank planchets (or simply as planchets or blanks) on which coins are struck. This determines the size and shape of eventual coins. Dime type-one blank and one cent type- two blank =Blank planchet= The punched disks are first known as \\"type-1 blanks (or planchets)\\". The disks are called \\"type-2 blanks (or planchets)\\" after an upending mill adds uniform, rounded rims. Type-2 blanks may also be considered striking errors as they are prepared correctly, but are released without having been struck. Clipped planchet =Clipped planchet= A misfeed can occur when the metal strip is fed through the blanking machine. The punches sometimes overlap the leading edge of the metal producing a straight clip. Sometimes, the punches strike an area of the strip which overlaps the hole left by the previous strike producing a curved clip. Sometimes punches strike the irregular trailing edge of the metal strip producing irregular clips. =Improper planchet thickness= Coins are sometimes struck on planchets that are either too thin or too thick producing underweight or overweight coins. This can be because the equipment settings cause the metal strip to be rolled to an incorrect thickness or because the metal strip was intended for another coin denomination such as a quarter planchet cut from a metal roll intended for dimes. Lamination crack =Lamination flaw= A lamination flaw is a planchet defect that results from metal impurities or internal stresses. Lamination flaws cause discoloration, uneven surfaces, peeling, and splitting. Peeled cladding =Cladding flaw= Many modern coins are made of layers of different metals known as clads. These cladding layers sometimes peel, fold, or completely separate. Hub and die errors Mints use hubs bearing raised images similar to the images that appear on a coin to imprint indented images onto the ends of steel rods. Those rods become the dies which strike planchets making them into coins. Hub and die errors can occur at the time dies are made, when the dies are installed into presses, and from die deterioration during use. Modern coins are still released with hub and die errors, mainly because the defects are usually too small to be seen with the naked eye. A few exceptions exist, where the dies are used despite producing obvious flaws. The 1955 Lincoln cent is an example. =Fundamental die-setting error= A fundamental die-setting error occurs when the die is not set as the producers intended. For example, in April 2013 the Central Bank of Ireland issued a silver ‚Ç¨10 commemorative coin in honor of James Joyce that misquoted a famous line from his masterwork Ulysses despite being warned on at least two occasions by the Department of Finance over difficulties with copyright and design. Partial date likely caused by filled die =Missing design elements= Missing mintmarks, dates, and other design elements are not distinct errors, but rather are what the observer sees when viewing other error types. A design element that is missing from the die when it is made is a fundamental error. Missing design elements that occur because dies are tilted and do not strike the planchet face-on are known as misaligned dies. A design element may be missing because foreign matter such as grease plugs the cavity into which the planchet's metal would normally flow under the striking pressure. This error is also known as a filled die and as a strike through. Although this does involve a die, it is typically thought of as a striking error, but is included here so as to provide a more complete list. =Doubled die= Doubling on LIBERTY from the 1995 doubled die Lincoln cent A doubled die occurs when a die receives an additional, misaligned impression from the hub. Overdate coins such as the 1942/1 Mercury dime and 1918/7 buffalo nickel are also doubled dies. They are both listed in the CONECA files as class III doubled dies. Class III means the die was hubbed with different \\"designs\\" (or hubs that had different dates). They are not repunched dates, since the dates were punched onto the hub. A die crack is seen to the left of Lincoln's head Broken die resulting in a \\"cud\\" atop Jefferson's head =Die cracks, die breaks, and die chips= Dies can crack during use producing jaggeds, raised lines on the surface of subsequently struck coins. In U.S. coinage, many Morgan dollar coins show slight die cracks. Dies with cracks, especially those with cracks near the edge, sometimes break. The broken piece may be retained in position or fall away. Die cracks and retained die breaks can be difficult to distinguish. Retained die breaks cross the coin's face from rim to rim with the area to one side of the break being slightly higher than the other. Coins struck after the break falls away have a raised, rounded, unstruck area along the edge. These coins are known to collectors as cuds. Sometimes, an area of a die will chip out of the center. These so-called die chips appear on subsequently struck coins as raised, rounded, unstruck areas called die chips. The marks seen above the word LIBERTY were caused by the obverse die clashing with elements on the reverse die intended to impress the space between the memorial columns =Die clash= A die clash occurs when the obverse and reverse dies are damaged upon striking each other without a planchet between them. Due to the tremendous pressure used, parts of the image of one die may be impressed on the other. Planchets subsequently struck by the clashed dies receive the distorted image. A well-known example is the \\"Bugs Bunny\\" Franklin half dollar of 1955, where part of the eagle's wing from the reverse gives Franklin the image of protruding teeth. =MAD clash= 1993 MAD clash mark on a U.S. cent A MAD clash occurs when an obverse and reverse die strike each other while misaligned in relation to each other. Additional misalignment errors are discussed below. Double punched mintmark =Punching errors= Historically, some design elements near the outer perimeter of a die were added by punching because technology made it difficult to press both the central and perimeter design elements at the same time. Also, some dies were made without mintmarks or dates to permit their use at different mints and in later years. A die technician added missing elements by positioning a punch, a small steel rod with the mirror image of a letter or number on it, and striking the punch with a hammer pressing the image into the die. If the image is not strong enough, the technician will punch it a second time. Punches placed in a different position between strikes will produce a doubled image which is called a repunch. Dual punches occur when punching is repeated in a second location. Sometimes technicians use a punch with the wrong or incorrectly sized letter or number. A well known example of a small mint mark is 1945-S \\"Micro S\\" Mercury dime, when the mint used an old puncheon intended for Philippines coins. A much rarer example is the 1892-O \\"Micro O\\" Barber half dollar, which may have come about from the brief use of a mintmark puncheon intended for the quarter. Exactly the same error occurred with the 1905-O Barber dime, although numerous examples are known of this mistake. Modern equipment virtually eliminates the need to design elements by punching. =Overdates and overmintmarks= In the past, mints used dies until they broke. At the beginning of the year, mints punched a new date over the old on dies that were in use. For 19th-century coins, it is difficult to call an overdate an \\"error\\", as it resulted from intentional recycling of the die. An overmintmark occurs when a second mintmark is punched over an earlier mintmark following the transfer of a die from one mint to another. A well-known example is the 1900 Morgan silver dollar, when reverse dies with \\"CC\\" below the eagle were sent from the Carson City Mint to the New Orleans Mint, where they were given an \\"O\\". A similar case occurred in 1938, when a reverse die for the buffalo nickel was made for the San Francisco Mint, because that year only, the Denver Mint made these coins with a \\"D\\" punched over the \\"S\\". =Trails= Lines, called trails, transfer to coins from dies made using the modern high pressure \\"single pressing\\" process. When images are impressed into dies using the process, the displaced metal moves out into fields leaving visible lines on the dies. The dies themselves are called trail dies. Coins on which the lines appear are simply called trails. Trails were first noted on Lincoln Memorial steps found on the reverse of one cent coins minted from 1959 to 2008. The trails gave the steps the appearance of being wavy. The term wavy steps is still used to refer to trails found on the memorial steps, but the term trails is more commonly used to refer to lines found elsewhere. =Mule= Great Britain dateless double obverse \\"mule\\" halfpenny Edward VII 1902 to 1910, well circulated obverse. What looks like a mint error is actually a cleverly made up double headed coin, just slightly under weight. The reverse of that same coin was also minted with an obverse die, but on a different flan. The two obverse parts were cleverly put together from two different coins. This manipulated coin was found in Australia where it was legal tender. It could have been used in the very popular Australian Two-up game in a fraudulent way. A coin struck using dies never intended for use together is called a \\"mule\\". An example is a coin struck with dies designed for different coin denominations, or a coin struck with two dies that both lack a minting year on them, resulting in a 'dateless' coin. Because of misalignment, the obverse of this coin is off-center but the reverse is centered thumbnail =Misaligned dies= Dies must be properly aligned in presses for coins to be struck correctly. Errors occur when dies are offset, tilted, or rotated. Offset errors occur when the hammer die is not centered over the anvil die typically resulting in an off-centered obverse, but centered reverse. Tilting errors occur when die surfaces are not parallel producing coins that are thinner along one edge, and sometimes causing missing design elements along the opposite edge because of insufficient pressure being exerted on that edge. Rotation errors occur when the images on the obverse and reverse dies are turned from the normal positions such as when the reverse image is at a right angle to the obverse. Strike errors Strike errors occur when the planchet is struck. It is a fault in the manufacturing process rather than in either the die or the planchet. Numismatists often prize strike-error coins over perfectly struck examples, which tend to be more common, but less highly than die-error coins, which are usually rarer, making them valuable. This broad struck Lincoln cent is the size of a nickel =Broadstrike= Broadstrike errors are produced when the collar die (the circular die surrounding the lower die) malfunctions. The collar prevents the metal of the blank from flowing outside the confines of the die. All denominations of U.S. coins with a broadstrike have plain edges. =Strike through= A \\"strike-through\\" coin is made when another object comes between a blank and a die at the time of striking. That object's outline is pressed into the blank's surface. Common examples include hard objects such as staples, metal shavings, and other coins as well as soft objects such as cloth and grease. Hard objects leave sharp outlines and, on occasion, adhere to the blank producing a coin called a \\"retained strike-through\\". A planchet \\"struck- through\\" a coin is left with an impression of the coin called brockage (discussed below). When the \\"strike-through object is a blank planchet the result is a uni-face coin with one struck side and one blank side (see below). When the \\"struck-through\\" object is another coin, and that coin adheres to a die(as opposed to the other coin), the adhered coin is called a \\"die cap\\" (discussed below). Two coins which adhere to one another are called \\"bonded pairs\\". Softer objects, such as grease, can fill crevices in a die, producing a weak strike with a smudged appearance. These errors are often called \\"missing element coins\\" (discussed above and as \\"filled dies.\\"(A great example of such an error occurred in 1922, when only the Denver mint struck Lincoln cents. The dies were so covered in grease, because the mint had to speed up production, that the mintmark was obscured and therefore either nonexistent or weakened on the 1922 cents. These are very popular with collectors.) Uni-face coin (blank reverse) =Uni-face coin= A uni-face coin results when two planchets are stacked one atop the other at the time of striking. This produces two coins: one with only an obverse image, and a second with only the reverse image. The planchets may be centered over the die producing one complete image on each coin or off-centered producing partial images on each side. In the accompanying image of the blank reverse, the shadow or outline of Lincoln's profile from the obverse side of the coin is visible. The brockage image of the Lincoln memorial can be seen near the bottom of the coin =Brockage= Brockage occurs when a mirror image of a coin is struck on a blank. After a struck coin fails to eject, a new blank is fed between the struck coin and the hammer die. The hammer die strikes the second blank leaving its image on one side while pressing the blank against the previously stuck coin which sinks its image into opposite side. Most brockages are off- center, but fully overlapping brockages are the most desirable. Die cap =Die cap= A struck coin remains on a die and leaves its slowly fading impression (called brockage) on subsequently struck coins and, over time, changing shape to resemble a bottle cap. =Edge strike= There are two types of edge strikes. A standing edge strike occurs when a blank \\"bounces\\" so that it is standing on edge as it is struck. Striking pressure produces edge indentations where the dies strike, and sometimes bends the blank. Repeated strikes can produce a coin that is folded flat. . Chain edge strikes occur when two blanks are fed into the space between dies at the same time. The blanks expand when struck and press together leaving each with single indented edge. Two chain edge struck coins together are known as a matched pair. Lincoln cent with second off-center strike Flip-over multi-struck coin =Multiple strike= A multiple strike, also referred to as a double exposure, occurs when the coin has additional images from being struck again, off center. The result is sometimes mistaken for being a \\"doubled die\\". On occasion, a coin will flip over between strikes so that the second image is that of the opposite side of the coin. Lincoln cent struck off-center =Off-center strike= An off-center coin is produced when the coin is struck once, albeit off center. Unlike a broadstrike, the punch is not in the center of the coin, but rather the edge. This results in a coin which is not circular. The coin gives a freakish appearance as a result, and various amounts of blank planchet space are visible. The coins can vary in value because of how far off center they are struck, although coins with full dates are more desirable than coins without a date or missing digits. =Double denomination= A double denomination coin is one that has been struck twice between different denomination dies such as once between nickel dies and again between quarter dies. The term is sometimes used to refer to a coin struck on the wrong planchet (see below). Nickel struck on one cent planchet =Struck on wrong planchet= Sometimes planchets for one coin denomination are fed into a coin-stamping press equipped with dies of another denomination. This results in a coin that has been stamped with a design intended for a differently sized coin. The resulting errors are prized by collectors, though they are usually caught during the manufacturing process and destroyed. Such errors are sometimes called \\"double denomination\\" coins, but that term is also used to refer to coins struck a second time with dies of a different denomination. Some examples include cents struck on dime planchets, nickels on cent planchets, or quarters on dime planchets. This type of error should not be confused with the much rarer mule which is a coin struck between dies that were never intended to be used together such as a coin with nickel obverse and a dime reverse. Wrong-planchet errors may also occur when the composition of the coin changes. Such situations generally arise when the mint has decided to change the alloy or plating of the coin in the new coinage year, but a few planchets from the previous year‚Äîand thus of the previous composition‚Äîhave yet to be struck. Should the dies be changed for the new year while the old planchets are awaiting striking and not removed, coins using the old composition will be struck with the new year's date. Such coins are rare and often highly valued by collectors, as with the 1943 copper cents and 1944 steel cents. A much rarer error is a denomination struck on a foreign planchet. This did occur occasionally with United States (and before that American colonial) coinage in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. In the 20th century, less errors on foreign planchets are discovered but they still occur when the US Mint is contracted by foreign governments to produce coinage for them. Recent encapsulations and sales at auctions reveal 1995 and 1996 examples of mintages on foreign planchet. A few 1996 Lincoln cents were struck on stock designated for Singapore. There are 1997-D, 1998 and 2000 dated Lincoln cents struck on foreign planchets, but not identified by PCGS or NGC as to the country the mintage was intended. Wire rim =Edge and rim errors= Blanks are surrounded by collars when struck to prevent the blank from flattening and spreading. Edge and rim errors occur when collars are either out of position or are deteriorated. A wire rim occurs when excessive pressure squeezes out metal between the collar and the edge of the die producing an extremely high thin rim. A partial collar occurs when an out-of-position collar leaves a line around the coin which is visible when looking at its edge. A partial collar is sometimes called a railroad rim when a reeded edge coin is involved as the line resembles a rail and the reeds resemble railroad ties. =Mated pair or set= A collection of two or more coins struck at the same time or during successive strikes on one or more dies, these coins with the resulting errors are related to one another, fitting together as a set. All brockages, indents, chain edge strikes, and capped die strikes have a corresponding coin, but are rarely found together. A single coin of the set may be discovered by mint staff during quality control and removed, or the coins may be separated into different lots to be distributed separately into circulation. Numismatic value of error coins Like other coins, the value of errors is based, in part at least, on rarity and condition. In general, lower denomination errors are less expensive than higher denomination errors simply more such coins are minted resulting in available errors. Modern errors are generally less expensive than older errors simply because, with billions being struck, errors are made. Because of modern technology, some types of errors are less likely to occur now, but that has not seemed to have a dramatic impact on values. Some types of errors, such as clipped planchets, edge strikes, and foreign object strike-throughs can be faked perhaps keeping down the value of some types of mint errors. Many errors are sold ungraded because of their relatively low value. Grading services often charge more to grade a coin than it is worth. Errors are often not noted by grading services. Overdates, mules, brockage, double denomination, and struck on the wrong planchet errors are often valuable. Errors on ancient, medieval, and higher- value coins are usually detrimental to the coin's numismatic value.

H. Auden in 1939, shortly after he moved from England to the United States. The poem was first published on January 6, 1940 in The New Yorker, and first appeared in book form in Auden's collection Another Time (Random House, 1940). The poem is the epitaph of a man identified only by a combination of letters and numbers somewhat like an American Social Security number (\\"JS/07/M/378\\"), who is described entirely in external terms: from the point of view of government organizations such as the fictional \\"Bureau of Statistics.\\" The speaker of the poem concludes that the man had lived an entirely average, therefore exemplary, life. The poem is a satire of standardization at the expense of individualism.Haffenden, John. \\"W.H. Auden.\\" Routledge, 1983. The poem is implicitly the work of a government agency at some point in the future, when modern bureaucratizing trends have reached the point where citizens are known by arbitrary numbers and letters, not personal names. Interpretation ‚ÄúThe Unknown Citizen‚Äù by W.H. Auden describes, through the form of a dystopian report, the life of an unknown man. Analysis of The Unknown Man by W.H. Auden By describing the \\"average citizen\\" through the eyes of various government organizations, the poem criticizes standardization and the modern state's relationship with its citizens. The last lines of the poem dismiss the questions of whether he was \\"free\\" or \\"happy\\", implicitly because the 'statistical method' strategy used by the state to judge his life cannot understand such questions. According to Shmoop: > The manipulative \\"State\\" in Auden's poem celebrates \\"The Unknown Citizen\\" as > the ideal citizen. The epigraph to \\"The Unknown Citizen\\" is a parody of the symbolic Tomb of the Unknown Soldier commemorating unidentified soldiers; tombs of unknown soldiers were first created following the first World War.Hewett, Ronald. \\"A Choice of Poets.\\" London: Harrap, 1968. It is not just government organizations that Auden criticizes. His employer is \\"satisfied\\", his union \\"reports he paid his dues\\", his mates are found to like him, and the press are pleased with his buying papers daily and responding to the ads. The industry poll takers are happy with his buying habits, and teachers are glad he stayed out of their way. In Auden's poem, the entire system and society are responsible for the loss of individualism, whether or not government was the initial cause of the decline.

She worked as an aeronautical engineer during the Second World War and did much to make Canada a powerhouse of aircraft construction during her years at Canadian Car and Foundry (CC&F;) in Fort William, Ontario. After her work at CC&F; she ran a successful consulting business. Between 1967‚Äì1970 she was a commissioner on the Royal Commission on the Status of Women in Canada, published in 1970. Early life and education MacGill was born in Vancouver on March 27, 1905, youngest daughter of James Henry MacGill, a prominent Vancouver lawyer, part- time journalist, and Anglican deacon, and Helen Gregory MacGill, a journalist and British Columbia's first woman judge.Wakewich 2006, p. 396. She had two older step-brothers from her mother's first marriage, and an older sister Dr. Helen \\"Young Helen\\" MacGill Hughes (1903) with whom she was very close. In the early years, the MacGill children were home schooled in a formal setting to mimic that of Lord Roberts, the public school that the older boys attended. This included drawing lessons with Emily Carr,Bourgeois-Doyle 2008, p. 29. and swimming lessons with Joe Fortes. Later, they attended King George Secondary School, which was affiliated with McGill University. This rigorous education facilitated Elsie entering University of British Columbia when she was 16.Bourgeois-Doyle 2008, p. 43. She was admitted to the applied sciences program, but the Dean of the faculty asked her to leave after only one term. When MacGill was 12 years old, her mother was appointed Judge of the Juvenile Court of Vancouver. After 1911, the racial strife in British Columbia continued to escalate, and Jim MacGill's immigration-related legal work was directly impacted. This caused severe financial strain for the family during the war years. Her early aptitude for \\"fixing things\\" held the family in good stead, and informed discussions of possible careers. Her mother was an advocate of women's suffrage and influenced MacGill's decision to study engineering. She graduated from the University of Toronto in 1927, and was the first Canadian woman to earn a degree in electrical engineering. MacGill was admitted to the University of Toronto's Bachelor of Applied Sciences program in 1923. During the summers she worked in machine shops repairing electrical motors to supplement the theory and practical teachings during the school year. It is also here that Elsie became exposed to the nascent field of aeronautical engineering. Contracting polio just before her graduation, MacGill was told that she would probably spend the rest of her life in a wheelchair. She refused to accept that possibility, however, and learned to walk supported by two strong metal canes. When she convocated she was Canada's first woman graduate in electrical engineering. Following graduation, MacGill took a junior job with a firm in Pontiac, Michigan. During the time there, the company began producing aircraft, which furthered Elsie's interest in aeronautics. She began part-time graduate studies in aeronautical engineering at the University of Michigan, enrolling in the fall of 1927 in the full-time Master of Science in Engineering program to begin aircraft design work and conduct research and development in the University's new aeronautics facilities. In 1929, she became the first woman in North America, and likely the world, to be awarded a master's degree in aeronautical engineering.Bourgeois-Doyle 2008, p. 64. In order to help finance her doctoral studies at MIT in Cambridge MacGill wrote magazine articles about aircraft and flying.\\"Queen of the Hurricanes: Elsie MacGill leads Canada's fighter plane production during the Second World War.\\" CBC. Retrieved: January 8, 2016. Her contemporary at MIT was aeronautical engineer and technical writer, M. Elsa Gardner. Engineering career In 1934, MacGill started work at Fairchild Aircraft's operations in Longueuil as an Assistant Aeronautical Engineer.Sissons 2014, p. 40. In 1938, she was the first woman elected to corporate membership in the Engineering Institute of Canada (EIC). She presented a paper, \\"Simplified Performance Calculations for Aeroplanes\\", to the Royal Aeronautical Society in Ottawa, on March 22, 1938 to high praise.Sissons 2014, p. 91. It was later published in The Engineering Journal. She also participated in the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's six-part series, The Engineer in War Time; her segment was called \\"Aircraft Engineering in Wartime Canada\\". In 1942, she was elected to the position of Chairman of the EIC, Lakehead Branch, after having also served as their Vice- Chairman.Sissons 2014, p. 94. Later that year MacGill was hired as Chief Aeronautical Engineer at Canadian Car and Foundry (CanCar), becoming the first woman in the world to hold such a position.\\"Elizabeth 'Elsie' Gregory MacGill.\\" Library and Archives Canada. Retrieved: January 9, 2016. At CanCar she designed and tested a new training aircraft, the Maple Leaf Trainer II.Wakewich 2006, p. 397. The Maple Leaf Trainer was designed and first built in CanCar's Fort William (now Thunder Bay) factories, where MacGill had moved. Although the Maple Leaf II did not enter service with any Commonwealth forces, ten (two were completed, but eight had to be assembled in Mexico) were sold to Mexico where its high-altitude performance was important given the many airfields from which it had to operate. Her role in the company changed when the factory was selected to build the Hawker Hurricane fighter aircraft for the Royal Air Force (RAF). The factory quickly expanded from about 500 workers to 4,500 by war's end, half of them women. For much of the war MacGill's primary task was to streamline operations in the production line as the factories rapidly expanded. MacGill was also responsible for designing solutions to allow the aircraft to operate during the winter, introducing de- icing controls and a system for fitting skis for landing on snow. Elsie MacGill portrayed as \\"The Queen of the Hurricanes.\\" By the time the production line shut down in 1943, CanCar had produced over 1,400 Hurricanes.Hatch 2006, p. 148. In 1940 she wrote and presented a paper on the experience, \\"Factors Affecting Mass Production of Aeroplanes\\", later published in The Engineering Journal . Her role in this successful production run made her famous, even to the point of having a comic book biography appear in an issue of True Comics in 1942, using her nickname, \\"Queen of the Hurricanes‚Äù. Numerous popular stories were published about her in the media as well, reflecting the public's fascination with this female engineer. After Hurricane production ended, CanCar looked for new work and secured with a contract from the U.S. Navy to build Curtiss SB2C Helldivers. This production did not go nearly as smoothly, and a continual stream of minor changes from Curtiss-Wright (in turn demanded by the U.S. Navy) meant that full-scale production took a long time to get started. In the midst of this project MacGill and the works manager, E. J. (Bill) Soulsby, were dismissed. It was initially rumoured that Soulsby had been curt with a group of senior naval officers who had visited a week earlier, but it was later revealed the reason for the dismissals was that the two were having an affair.Saxberg, Kelly, Director. \\"Rosies of the North.\\" Documentary National Film Board of Canada, 1999 via IMDb. Retrieved: January 9, 2016. MacGill and Soulsby were married in 1943 and moved to Toronto, where they set up an aeronautical consulting business. In 1946, she became the first woman to serve as Technical Advisor for International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), where she helped to draft International Air Worthiness regulations for the design and production of commercial aircraft. In 1947 she became the chairman of the United Nations Stress Analysis Committee, the first woman ever to chair a UN committee.Bourgeois-Doyle 2008, p. 219. In 1952, MacGill presented a paper to the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) conference, \\"The Initiative in Airliner Design\\", that was subsequently published in The Engineering Journal. A year later they awarded her their annual Engineering Award. Women's rights After breaking her leg in 1953, MacGill used the opportunity of her months of convalescence to sort through her mother's papers and begin writing a biography of her mother's life. MacGill published the book, My Mother, the Judge: A Biography of Judge Helen Gregory MacGill, in 1955. Her mother and grandmother's active public service and work in the suffrage movement inspired her to spend an increasing amount of time dealing with women's rights during the 1960s. MacGill served as the president of the Canadian Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs from 1962 to 1964.Fraser, David. \\"Elizabeth Muriel Gregory MacGill.\\" The Canadian Encyclopedia.

The exact date of when the name was first used as the university's mascot is not known, but photographs in the school's yearbook document its use as early as the 1940s. Mascot history The university's school newspaper is the first known organization on campus to adopt the beaver as its namesake and did so as early as 1908. The school yearbook's long use of the name, known as \\"The Beaver\\" starting in 1916, eventually helped solidify the beaver as the university's official mascot. The popularity of the beaver was also shared by students at University of Oregon. For several early publishings, students at this school also used \\"The Beaver\\" as their yearbook's title. Oregon State University's first documented use of \\"Benny Beaver\\" was found in a photograph showing students posing next to a statue of a beaver inscribed with the name \\"Benny Beaver.\\" The photograph appears in the 1942 edition of the yearbook. BASKETBALL ATTIRE: Benny Beaver at a home game in 180px Prior to the beaver, Oregon State's mascot was an individual known as John Richard Newton Bell (1893‚Äì1928). A longtime member of the university's board of regents, Bell became hugely popular among the students for his ritual of marching to the Marys River after each of Oregon State's Civil War victories. He was said to have tossed his top hat into the water as a token of celebration. Earlier mascots include \\"Jimmie\\" the Coyote (1892‚Äì1893) and \\"Bulldog\\" (1906‚Äì1910, unofficial and for specific teams only, such as the Wrestling squad). The beaver mascot's name, \\"Benny,\\" was officially adopted in 1945. Two failed attempts to maintain a live beaver mascot include Bevo Beaver (rescued from Mary's River in 1921 and later stolen ) and Billy Beaver (made mascot in 1935, and later fell ill and died). 100px The early Benny Beaver \\"cartoon\\" icon/logo was created by famous graphic illustrator, and former Disney employee, Arthur C. Evans. As the art director for Angelus Pacific Company, Evans submitted his design to OSU and it was approved for use in 1951. His logos were used at hundreds of other universities and high schools throughout the nation. Evans' beaver logo also appeared in the 1985 movie Teen Wolf. A beaver statue was carted around the stadium and in parades in the 1940s, patterned after an earlier bronze statue, went by the name \\"Benny.\\" The 1941 yearbook shows the statue with the caption \\"Bill Beaver\\" while a 1942 yearbook photo of the same beaver statue gives it the name \\"Benny Beaver\\". After the statue's demise, the name stuck with \\"The Gnawed Log,\\" a sports column in the student newspaper the Daily Barometer. The first live appearance during an athletic event by a mascot named \\"Benny\\", was September 18, 1952 and performed by Ken Austin. Austin later founded Newberg, Oregon-based A-dec, the largest privately held dental equipment manufacturer in North America. Austin is now a major Oregon State donor. Between the early 1980s and mid-1990s, Benny was often joined at sporting events by a co-mascot, known as \\"Bernice Beaver.\\" In 1998 No Dinx, a graphic design shop in Albany, Oregon, redesigned the logo for the first time in nearly 50 years (shown below). 100px1998 Season - Pregame outside Reser Stadium (Vince Ewert as Benny Beaver)In March 2013, working together with Nike, Oregon State University unveiled the latest, newly redesigned version, of the Benny Beaver logo.

Note the extended and irregular forms around the lettering. Die deterioration doubling (DDD) is an extremely common form of mint-made error on many United States and Canadian coins that results from degradation of the die used to strike the coin. Due to a combination of improper preparation and treatment of the dies, excessive wear, and overuse, die deterioration doubling has occurred on nearly every series issued by the US mint in recent times. Certain coins are more susceptible to it than others, due to various factors, but it does occur on most series of coins. Causes =Annealing Errors= During the annealing process of die making, two main errors can occur, resulting in less than perfect dies. It is impossible to tell without expensive and lengthy tests whether these errors occurred, but they will lead to significantly weaker dies and a higher tendency to deteriorate quickly. The first thing which can happen to a die in this process what metallurgists call decarburization. Decarburization is the result of an improper mix of metals and chemicals in the annealing furnace where the dies are sent to soften. If there is not enough ambient carbon in the furnace, the steel will give up some of its carbon and will become soft. The result is a thin surface of inadequate metal whose chemical composition has been altered and is below standard. Another less obvious error can also occur when heating the dies. After being taken out of the annealing furnace, the dies must cool for 24 to 36 hours. They are usually given an oil bath to cool them more quickly, but the dies must still cool for a period of several hours. When the dies are cooling, if they are not stored properly or not allowed to fully cool before being used, the result is a much softer die. When the die is subjected to the hubbing press again and work hardened again, it will be softer and more susceptible to wear. If the die is softer because it was not fully cooled, it will not harden to the same standard as a die which has received proper treatment. However, there will not be a noticeable difference between a good die and a bad die; the change in the structure of the die is not apparent until it is used for a period of time. =Overuse of Dies= In modern presses, a die strikes approximately 120 coins a minute. This is a large number of coins produced in a short time, and obviously the die cannot last forever. However, the process of wearing the die is only hastened by the metals used in coins. Nickel, one of the main metals used in today‚Äôs coins, is quite hard and causes wear quickly. Copper has been used for centuries because of its malleability and the ease with which it makes coins. However, it too wears the dies when they are used for too long. An infamous example is the 1955 \\"poorman‚Äôs double die.\\" This coin is sold as a replacement for the 1955 doubled die cent, but it is no more than Die Deterioration Doubling, caused by wear on the dies. When a coin is struck, the planchet is not heated. Although the planchet would be softer and more malleable, the extra time and expense would prove too great for the Mint. The planchet is therefore struck at room temperature, and the only thing which makes the coin form is the tremendous pressure used to strike it. With a metal such as nickel, which is harder than a normal coin metal like silver, gold or copper, the pressure must be greater. When a nickel coin, or any coin, is struck, the metal must \\"flow\\" into the contours of the front and back dies. It is through the atoms of the metal flowing into the dies that flow lines are created. However, when metal flows over a sharp corner in the die, like the edges of a mintmark or words, it tends to roll the detail out. It wears on the die, and a little detail is lost with every strike. Die Deterioration Doubling is most prevalent on the date and mintmark because these fine details are alone in the middle of the field, and the metal must flow into these without the help of other valleys nearby. When the metal rolls into the mintmark or date, it wears away the corner of the die, and after long enough will appear on the coin as Die Deterioration Doubling. In addition, the mint has a practice of polishing the dies and using them longer. When a die begins to show evidence of wear, a mint technician will polish the die and reuse it. However, the die is still rapidly deteriorating, and polishing it cannot avoid the problem of wear. So, after many thousand coins in rapid succession, the wear on the die has gotten so bad that it appears as Die Deterioration Doubling. Identification Die deterioration doubling is a result of a few simple causes, but it can be difficult to positively identify. There are a number of different features which appear similar, but the characteristic traits of each are easy to identify with practice. Die deterioration doubling is often mistaken for hub doubling. The causes of the two types of doubling are different, but their appearance on the finished coin is often similar. Die deterioration doubling appears most often around the mintmark and date because they are alone in the field. When it occurs in other features, like an image of a bust, it looks more like a weak strike than doubling. Close examination of affected features show that the doubling is extremely irregular. This is because the coin metal does not flow from just one direction, but flows and produces wear on the die from all sides. There is no definite shape, and it can take on several different but similar appearances. It often looks like a thin metal shelf or spreading spot. It can also make lettering appear thick and twisted. There are no crisp lines affected, but things generally look bloated, enlarged, blurry, twisted, and damaged. This is different from hub doubling, because hub doubling appears as a crisp secondary image, rotated minutely from the original. When casually glancing at a coin, the difference is not easy to tell, but when magnified, the difference is obvious on most coins. Another easy way to tell hub doubling from die deterioration doubling is the presence of notched serifs; the small flairs on the ends of letters will appear distinctly separated with the former, whereas they appear just blurry and washed out with the latter. Types of die deterioration doubling There really are two different kinds of DDD: Inside and Outside Abraded Die Doubling. This is because Die Deterioration Doubling manifests itself in two different ways. The two classes look different, and are caused by wear in two different places. Inside Abraded Die Doubling is caused by wear around the edges and inside the actual detail affected. It appears as an enlarged, irregular outline of the element overlapping the original design element. Outside Abraded Die Doubling is caused by actual wear in the field of the die. The field of a die is the highest point, so when a mint technician polishes the die or the metal flow of a coin wears it away, the field is the first thing to be worn down. The difference here is that Outside doubling does not overlap any of the original design, but rather appears like an irregular shelf around the object. Numismatic Interest Many beginning numismatists buy coins thinking they are very valuable, but really are not worth more than a little over face value due to a die deterioration doubling. This common error fools a number of people into believing that it is a much rarer, and more valuable, form of doubling. It goes by a number of names, such as the \\"poorman's double die\\". Jefferson nickels and Lincoln cents especially exhibit a large number of affected coins, throughout the entire history of the coin. The 1955 \\"poorman‚Äôs double die\\" is actually outside abraded die doubling, and a high percentage of 1999 coins exhibit this error. Because of the large numbers of these coins in circulation, they are not worth more than a few cents over normal value. Nevertheless, die deterioration doubling can deceive the beginning numismatist with the high hopes of discovering a new variety and making a fortune.

The Cambridge Union's Bridge Street premises () were designed by Alfred Waterhouse (who went on to design the Oxford Union Society's building) and formally opened on 30 October 1866. An additional wing was added several decades later. The future radical Liberal politician, Sir Charles Dilke, was the President chiefly responsible for construction. Included among the building's many rooms are the debating chamber, a dining room, bar, snooker room, the Keynes Library and various offices. Although Cambridge escaped virtually undamaged from the widespread bombing destruction of World War II, the Union's building was hit by a bomb dropped during one attack. The explosion caused extensive damage to the Union's library. = Modern developments = The Union is legally a self- funded charity that owns and has full control over its private property and buildings in the Cambridge city centre. It enjoys strong relations with the university, and allows other student societies to hire rooms for a nominal cost. Guests are sometimes admitted to Union events for a charge. After more than 200 years, the Cambridge Union is best known for its debates, which receive national and international media attention. The top members of its debating team compete internationally against other top debating societies. The Union also organises talks by visiting speakers and a wide array of events throughout the academic year. The Cambridge Union is sometimes confused with the Cambridge University Students' Union, the student representative body set up in 1971; consequently, the term 'President of the Union' may cause confusion. Although the Cambridge Union has never functioned as a students' union in the modern sense, it did briefly affiliate to the UK's National Union of Students in 1924. In 2015 the Union celebrated its bicentenary; a committee composed of former and current Officers was put together to organise a range of events to mark the occasion. This included special debates, dinners and parties in Cambridge and, for the first time in its history, in London. = 2016 redevelopment project = In January 2015 the Union announced a ¬£9.5m refurbishment project to begin in late 2016 to address major structural problems and to expand existing facilities, subject to approval by planners, to include a new Wine Bar on the ground floor and a Jazz & Comedy Club in the basement (in the old home of the Cambridge Footlights). It also announced a plan to use the revenue generated from the new building to reduce membership fees to make the Union more accessible to students from lower income backgrounds, and to increase the size of its competitive debating activities for disadvantaged children and students. The development was to be partially financed through the leasing of disused parts of its site to Trinity College in a deal worth ¬£4.5 million. Planning permission was received in 2016, and a fundraising campaign to cover the remaining cost was to be launched on 11 March 2017 with a special debate between Jon Snow and Nick Robinson. Construction on the major redevelopment project was scheduled to begin in Michaelmas 2018. = Gallery = File:The Cambridge Union Building.jpgThe Cambridge Union File:Stephen Fry at the Cambridge Union.jpgThe Main Chamber File:cmglee Cambridge Union Society bar.jpgThe 1815 Bar and Cafe  Membership of the Union  The Cambridge Union receives no formal funding from the University and raises funds for event expenses and building maintenance through membership fees and sponsorship. For most of its history the Cambridge Union was an all-male club. By the early 1960s this was perceived as an embarrassment and an anachronism. Votes were held to amend the constitution to allow women as members, but although a majority voted in favour, they failed to meet the two-thirds majority required by the constitution to make constitutional change. On one occasion a female student gate-crashed a debate and was removed, the whole incident seen and reported in the national press. In about 1965 the amendment was passed and in Michaelmas 1967 Ann Mallalieu became the first female president. Membership is now open to all students at the University of Cambridge and Anglia Ruskin University. Members are able to bring guests to certain functions provided that the guests would not be allowed to purchase membership. Social events and events organised by external bodies are occasionally open to the public, with discounts for Union members. The Union launched online membership in late 2015, which allowed any student around the world access to live streams of events for an annual subscription. = Honorary members = The union awards honorary memberships to particularly distinguished individuals. Honorary members include: * Raif Badawi * Ensaf Haidar * Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh * Anne, Princess Royal * John Major * Alfred Waterhouse * Desmond Tutu * Stephen Hawking * Harold Macmillan * F. W. de Klerk * Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa * Jesse Jackson * Ronald Reagan * Bernie Sanders  Past speakers and debates  The Union puts on a wide variety of events for its members, but is best known for its Thursday night debates and individual speaker events. In both of these, leading figures from public life are invited to discuss something of interest to the membership. One of the Union's most famous debates in recent years was between Richard Dawkins and Rowan Williams in February 2013, on the motion, 'This House Believes Religion has no place in the 21st Century', which was rejected by the assembled members. The Union's debates regarding religion have also created several controversial incidents, including in October 2014, when Peter Hitchens, speaking in favour of the motion 'This House Regrets the Rise of New Atheism', appeared to break the rules of the House by physically intimidating Baron Desai after a heated exchange. Speakers hosted by the Union have included: * Spiritual leader of Tibet the Dalai Lama * Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates * Theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking * British prime ministers Winston Churchill, Clement Attlee, Margaret Thatcher and John Major * US Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan * First Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru * German Chancellor Helmut Kohl * Australian Prime Minister John Howard * First democratically elected President of Iraq Jalal Talabani, * Libyan dictator Muammar al-Gaddafi * Last President of apartheid-era South Africa, F. W. de Klerk * British politician Jeremy Corbyn * British politician Nigel Farage * Academic Germaine Greer * Economist Ha Joon Chang * African- American author and activist James Baldwin * Wikileaks founder Julian Assange * Actors Brian Blessed, Bradley Whitford, Judi Dench, Clint Eastwood, Roger Moore and Bill Nighy, * Former head of the IMF Dominique Strauss-Kahn * Chat show host Jerry Springer * Actress and model Pamela Anderson * Magician David Blaine * Comedian and political activist Russell Brand * American civil rights activist Jesse Jackson * American civil rights activist Al Sharpton * American Presidential candidate, and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders * Second person to walk on the moon Buzz Aldrin. * Economist Jeffrey Sachs * Actress and activist Rose McGowan * Professor and author Jordan Peterson * American EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler  Governance  The Cambridge Union is an organisation that was founded and is headed by students. Each term is planned and carried out by a mixture of elected officers and appointed student staff, with support from the organisation's non-student staff and trustees. The governance of the Cambridge Union is mandated by its Constitution. = The Standing Committee = The Standing Committee (or 'Voting Members') is the Union's primary managerial body of 13 members, which consists of the current President, Vice-President and Officers, the President-Elect and Officers- Elect, and the Debating Officers. All Officers of the Union are elected by its membership on a termly basis, with the exception of the Vice-President and two Debating Officers, who are appointed on an annual basis. Officers of the Union are elected a term in advance, allowing them to serve one term as an officer- elect to prepare for their following term in office. Termly elected officers serve a term (and its preceding vacation) as \\"officer-elect\\", during which time they are members of Standing Committee. The Michaelmas 2020 Standing Committee: * President - Emaan Ullah, Homerton * Vice President - Jungmin Seo, Jesus * President-Elect - Freddie Fisk, Robinson * Executive Officer - Jess Molyneux, Jesus * Speakers Officer - Joel Rosen, Trinity Hall * Treasurer - Patrick Connolly, Robinson * Social Events Officer - Tara Bhagat, Sidney Sussex * Diversity Officer - Georgia Gray, Peterhouse * Debating Officers - Cary Godsal, Peterhouse & Tamkeen Nawab, St John's * Executive Officer-Elect - James Vitali, Christ's * Speakers Officer-Elect - Keir Bradwell, Queens' = Full Committee = During every term, the Standing Committee appoints a variety of positions within the Union. These specialized positions range from the Secretary, Head of Event Management, Head of Publicity, Head of Audio- Visual and Head of Press amongst others. Collectively, they are referred to as 'Full Committee' or just 'appointees'. = The Trustees = The Board of Trustees, currently chaired by Lord Chris Smith, is responsible for overseeing the long-term development of the Union's finances and property. Whilst the Trustees are not intimately involved with the day-to-day running of the Union, they maintain ultimate legal responsibility for the organization, its assets and status as a registered charity. To maintain the link between the Student management and the Trustees, the President, the Vice President, and a Debating Officer of the Union are traditionally appointed as Trustees for the duration of their term in office. = Review Committee = The Review Committee of the Cambridge Union is a committee of former Officers appointed by Standing Committee under the guidance of the Vice President. It is responsible for handling all disciplinary matters of the Union and may also be called upon to adjudicate on electoral malpractice. No member of Review Committee may serve as an elected officer for the duration of their term. = Staff = In addition to these posts the Union also maintains an employed staff consisting of a Bursar, responsible for overseeing the long-term health of the charity, Office Managers and a Bar Manager. The Union also holds contracts for catering, cleaning, building maintenance, property management, IT services and legal advice. Members of staff are employed by the Union's subsidiary events company. The President, Vice-President, Bursar and other Trustees appointed on an ad-hoc basis serve as Directors of the company. = Past officers = Many of the Union's former Officers have gone on to considerable personal success after their time involved in the society. Notable past Presidents and officers include: * John Maynard Keynes * Edward John Gambier * Philip Noel-Baker * Gerald Strickland * Spencer Horatio Walpole * Michael Ramsey * James Peiris * Rab Butler * Peter Bazalgette * Douglas Hurd * Leon Brittan * Kenneth Clarke * Arianna Huffington * Michael Howard * Norman Lamont * Andrew Mitchell * Robert Harris * Adair Turner * Clare Balding * Vince Cable * Gavin Barwell * Karan Bilimoria * Helene Hayman * Jack Ashley * Charles Lysaght * Christopher Steele In addition to the long list of real life distinguished individuals that served as officers of the Cambridge Union during their time in Cambridge, Will Bailey, a fictional character on The West Wing, a US television drama series, claimed to have been a \\"former president of the Cambridge Union on a Marshall Scholarship\\", as well as MacKenzie McHale, a fictional character in the hit US series, The Newsroom. = Constitution = The Cambridge Union was famous within the University for having a very long and complicated constitution; it is a common rumour that the constitution is longer than the entire Constitution of Canada. This was in fact untrue, but only just: a quick count puts the old Union constitution in question at 31,309 words while the complete Constitution of Canada is 31,575 words long. If the University's rules on Single Transferable Voting are included, then this Constitution was indeed longer than that of Canada. These rules are referenced within this old constitution, but are not contained. By comparison, the rules of the Oxford Union Society total over 45,000 words, not including the Standing Orders and Schedules.  Recordings and streaming  = YouTube = On 9 May 2011, the Union launched its online public video service CUS-Connect, whereby recordings of past events and interviews were uploaded for free viewing. These have since been transferred the Union's YouTube channel titled 'The Cambridge Union'. Before 2014, the Union only occasionally live-streamed popular events, with the first ever live stream held on 12 May 2011, in which Stephen Fry debated Radio 1 DJ Kissy Sell Out on the motion: \\"This House believes that classical music is irrelevant to today's youth\\". = Members' streaming service = As part of its bicentennial celebrations in 2015, the Union launched a permanent live streaming service, to be integrated with a new automatic multi-camera rig in the Main Chamber. The new service includes the ability for \\"virtual\\" attendees to contribute to debates via questions and comments to be read out on the floor of the Union. The streaming service is hosted on the Union's website and is available only to members.  Controversy  = Hosting of speakers = The Cambridge Union, like its Oxford counterpart, has faced controversy over its choice of speakers. Protests have been arranged by students against the appearance of Universities Minister David Willetts, Government Minister Eric Pickles, during which the building was broken into, former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn, French politician Marine Le Pen and Wikileaks Founder Julian Assange. In January 2015, the hosting of Germaine Greer caused a public row between the Union and the Cambridge Students' Union's LGBT+ group, due to Greer's alleged transmisogyny towards Rachael Padman. In June 2019, the hosting of Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad attracted criticism from the Union of Jewish Students, the Board of Deputies of British Jews, and several former Cambridge Union members including former President Andrew Cannon due to the former's anti-Semitic remarks. Responding to these criticisms, the Union is often quoted as upholding the universal right to free speech, against the principles of No Platform passed by the National Union of Students and upheld by a few groups within Cambridge. = 2015 Counter-Terrorism Bill = Lobbying by former Union Presidents Lord Deben and Lord Lamont resulted in the specific exclusion of the Cambridge and Oxford Unions from the Government's counter-terrorism bill, amid fears it could restrict free debate. Deben argued that the provisions within the bill would have prevented the hosting of British Union of Fascists' leader Oswald Mosley in the 1950s, concluding that the bill threatened \\"an essential British value\\". The National Union of Students used the exclusion to argue that the passage of the Bill was too rapid and ill-thought out, whilst both the Oxford and Cambridge Union reaffirmed that they were not legally part of their respective Universities and thus were never subject to the bill in the first place. Strong opposition to the bill from Liberal Democrats and senior Conservative peers eventually resulted in the shelving of provisions regarding Universities' until after the 2015 General Election. The Counter Terrorism and Security Act 2015 eventually clarified that Higher Education institutions must retain particular regard to the duty to ensure freedom of speech and the importance of academic freedom within University societies, although it is unclear whether this applies to the Union. = Referendum on Julian Assange = The union called a referendum on the hosting of Julian Assange on 22 October 2015, arguing that his residency in the Ecuadorian Embassy meant he was outside the jurisdiction of UK law, and thus required the consultation of its members considering a lack of past precedent. The referendum was more widely viewed as an opinion poll on the union's refusal to \\"no platform\\" speakers. It passed with 76.9% of the vote. Turnout was 1463.

Looking at rotational energy separately around an object's axis of rotation, the following dependence on the object's moment of inertia is observed: :E_\\\\mathrm{rotational} = \\\\frac{1}{2} I \\\\omega^2 where : \\\\omega \\\\ is the angular velocity : I \\\\ is the moment of inertia around the axis of rotation : E \\\\ is the kinetic energy The mechanical work required for or applied during rotation is the torque times the rotation angle. The instantaneous power of an angularly accelerating body is the torque times the angular velocity. For free-floating (unattached) objects, the axis of rotation is commonly around its center of mass. Note the close relationship between the result for rotational energy and the energy held by linear (or translational) motion: :E_\\\\mathrm{translational} = \\\\frac{1}{2} m v^2 In the rotating system, the moment of inertia, I, takes the role of the mass, m, and the angular velocity, \\\\omega , takes the role of the linear velocity, v. The rotational energy of a rolling cylinder varies from one half of the translational energy (if it is massive) to the same as the translational energy (if it is hollow). An example is the calculation of the rotational kinetic energy of the Earth. As the Earth has a period of about 23.93 hours, it has an angular velocity of 7.29√ó10‚àí5 rad/s. The Earth has a moment of inertia, I = 8.04√ó1037 kg¬∑m2.Moment of inertia--Earth, Wolfram Therefore, it has a rotational kinetic energy of 2.138√ó1029 J. A good example of actually using earth's rotational energy is the location of the European spaceport in French Guiana. This is within about 5 degrees of the equator, so space rocket launches (for primarily geo- stationary satellites) from here to the east obtain nearly all of the full rotational speed of the earth at the equator (about 1,000 mph, sort of a \\"sling-shot\\" benefit). This saves significant rocket fuel per launch compared with rocket launches easterly from Kennedy Space Center (USA), which obtain only about 900 mph added benefit due to the lower relative rotational speed of the earth at that northerly latitude of 28 degrees. Part of the earth's rotational energy can also be tapped using tidal power. Additional friction of the two global tidal waves creates energy in a physical manner, infinitesimally slowing down Earth's angular velocity œâ. Due to the conservation of angular momentum, this process transfers angular momentum to the Moon's orbital motion, increasing its distance from Earth and its orbital period (see tidal locking for a more detailed explanation of this process).

It can be found in the Western Ghats in India. Names in English that have been used for this species are purple frog, Indian purple frog, or pignose frog. Although the adult frog was formally described in October 2003, the taxon was recognized much earlier by its tadpole, which had been described in 1918. History of the discovery The species was described from specimens collected in the Idukki district of Kerala by S.D. Biju from the Tropical Botanic Garden and Research Institute in Palode, India, and Franky Bossuyt from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (Free University of Brussels), in 2003. However, it was already well known to the local people and several earlier documented specimens and publications had been ignored by the authors in the 2003 paper that describes the genus and species. Name The scientific name Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis is a Latinized form, composed of respectively derived from Sanskrit () for \\"nose\\", Greek () for \\"frog\\", and Sahyadri, the native name of Western Ghats where it inhabits. Description Video recording of a vocalizing male. The body of Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis appears robust and bloated and is relatively rounded compared to other more dorsoventrally flattened frogs. Their flattened body assists them to cling to submerged rocks and boulders which essentially helps them fight strong currents, allowing them to remain near stream banks where they typically reside.Senevirathne G, Thomas A, Kerney R, Hanken J, Biju SD, Meegaskumbura M. From clinging to digging: The postembryonic skeletal ontogeny of the indian purple frog, Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis (anura: Nasikabatrachidae). PLOS ONE. 2016;11(3):e0151114. Its arms and legs splay out in the standard anuran body form. Compared to other frogs, N. sahyadrensis has a small head and an unusual pointed snout. Adults are typically dark purplish-grey in color. Males are about a third of the length of females. The specimen with which the species was originally described was 7.0 cm long from the tip of the snout to the vent. Tadpoles of the species had been described in 1917 by Nelson Annandale and C. R. Narayan Rao as having oral suckers that allowed them to live in torrential streams. Suckers are also present in rheophilic fishes of genera such as Glyptothorax, Travancoria, Homaloptera, and Bhavania, adaptations that are the result of convergent evolution. Some of these fishes co-occur with Nasikabatrachus tadpoles in the hill streams. Its vocalization is a drawn-out harsh call that sounds similar to a chicken clucking. The frogs may switch to headfirst borrowing due to their wedge shaped skull and other shaped limbs.PLOS ONE, 2016, Volume 11, Issue 3 Purple frog tadpoles Distribution Earlier thought to be restricted to the south of the Palghat Gap in the Western Ghats, additional records have extended its known range farther north of the gap.Das, K. S. Anoop 2006 Record of Nasikabatrachus from the Northern Western Ghats. Zoos' Print Journal 21(9):2410 PDF The species is now known to be quite widely distributed in the Western Ghats, ranging from the Camel's Hump Hill Range in the north, all the way to the northernmost portions of the Agasthyamalai Hill Range in the south. Ecology The frog spends most of its life underground and surfaces only during the monsoon, for a period of two weeks, for mating. With few field scientists out in the field during the rainy season the species was discovered and studied only in recent times. Males emerge to call beside temporary rainwater streams. They mount females and grip them (amplexus) along the vertebral column. Around 3000 eggs are laid in a rock pool and the tadpoles metamorphose after around 100 days. Purple frog juveniles Unlike many other burrowing species of frogs that emerge and feed above the ground, this species has been found to forage underground, feeding mainly on termites using its tongue and a special buccal groove. In 2015, tadpoles of the species were discovered to be traditionally consumed by tribal communities. The major threat to these amphibians in the Western Ghats of India is caused by the alteration of natural habitats by an ever-increasing human population, resulting in large areas being converted for settlement and agricultural use. Recent studies have shown frog utilization to be one of the major threats, which include utilization of frogs for food, traditional medicine, research purposes and pet trade has also been considered a major contributor to their decline. Tadpole-harvesting was prevalent in the monsoon season during July‚ÄìSeptember every year. The Nadukani-Moolamattom-Kulamaav tribal people have developed an indigenous method for collecting these uniquely adapted suctorial tadpoles. Usually, about 2‚Äì5 individuals would participate in each harvesting event.S D, Biju & Ashish,. (2015).

He was the first Grand Duke of Luxembourg of French agnatic descent. Jean was the eldest son of Grand Duchess Charlotte and Prince Felix. Jean's primary education was initially in Luxembourg, before attending Ampleforth College in England. In 1938, he was officially named Hereditary Grand Duke as heir to the throne of Luxembourg. While Luxembourg was occupied by Germans during the Second World War, the grand ducal family was abroad in exile. Jean studied at the Universit√© Laval in Quebec City. Jean later volunteered to join the British army's Irish Guards in 1942, and after graduating from the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, received his commission in 1943. He participated in the Normandy landings and the Battle for Caen, and joined the Allied forces in the liberation of Luxembourg. From 1984 until 2000, he was colonel of the Irish Guards. On 9 April 1953, Jean married Princess Jos√©phine Charlotte of Belgium with whom he had five children. On 12 November 1964, Grand Duchess Charlotte abdicated and Jean succeeded her as Grand Duke of Luxembourg. He then reigned for 36 years before he himself abdicated on 7 October 2000 and was succeeded by his son, Grand Duke Henri. Early life Jean was born on 5 January 1921, at Berg Castle, in central Luxembourg, the son of Grand Duchess Charlotte and of Prince F√©lix. Among his godparents was Pope Benedict XV, who gave him his second name. He attended primary school in Luxembourg, where he continued the initial stage of secondary education. He completed secondary school at Ampleforth College, a Roman Catholic boarding school in the United Kingdom. Upon reaching maturity, on 5 January 1939 he was styled 'Hereditary Grand Duke', recognising his status as heir apparent. Second World War On 10 May 1940, Germany invaded Luxembourg, beginning a four-year occupation. Having been warned of an imminent invasion, the Grand Ducal Family escaped the previous night. At first, they sought refuge in Paris, before fleeing France only weeks later, after receiving transit visas to Portugal from the Portuguese consul Aristides de Sousa Mendes, in June 1940. They arrived at Vilar Formoso on 23 June 1940. After travelling through Coimbra and Lisbon, the family first stayed in Cascais, in Casa de Santa Maria, owned by Manuel Esp√≠rito Santo, who was then the honorary consul for Luxembourg in Portugal. By July they had moved to Monte Estoril, staying at the Chalet Posser de Andrade. On 10 July 1940, Prince Jean, together with his father Prince F√©lix, his siblings, Princess Elisabeth, Princess Marie Adelaide, Princess Marie Gabriele, Prince Charles and Princess Alix, the nanny Justine Reinard and the chauffeur Eug√®ne Niclou, along with his wife Jos√©phine, boarded the S.S. Trenton headed for New York City,‚ÄúA fuga da fam√≠lia gr√£-ducal‚Äù, by Margarida de Magalh√£es Ramalho (2019).Exiles Memorial Center. where they sought refuge during the war in a rented estate in Brookville, New York. The Grand Ducal Family sought refuge in the United States, renting an estate in Brookville, New York. Jean studied Law and Political Science at Universit√© Laval, Quebec City. He joined the British Army as a volunteer in the Irish Guards in November 1942. After receiving officer training at the Royal Military College at Sandhurst, Jean was commissioned as a lieutenant on 30 July 1943, before being promoted to captain in 1944. He landed in Normandy on 11 June 1944, and took part in the Battle for Caen and the liberation of Brussels. On 10 September 1944, he took part in the liberation of Luxembourg before moving on to Arnhem and the invasion of Germany. He relinquished his commission in the British Army on 26 June 1947. From 1984 until his abdication, he served as Colonel of the Regiment of the Irish Guards, often riding in uniform behind Queen Elizabeth II during the Trooping the Colour. Reign Grand Duke Jean taking the oath on 12 November 1964 Jean was named Lieutenant-Representative of the Grand Duchess on 28 April 1961. He became Grand Duke when his mother, Grand Duchess Charlotte, abdicated on 12 November 1964. The same day, he was made a General of the Armed Forces of Luxembourg. From the beginning of his reign, Grand Duke Jean's priorities included the well-being of his people and the completion of European unity. In the words of President Georges Pompidou of France, \\"If Europe had to choose a hereditary president, it would certainly be the Grand Duke of Luxembourg.\\". Indeed, during his reign Grand Duke Jean saw Luxembourg transformed from a minor industrial contributor into an international financial centre. In 1986, he was honoured with the Charlemagne Prize in Aachen for his efforts towards European integration. The Grand Duke's reign was one of the most prosperous periods in the history of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. The degree of stability in the country's politics, economy and social life was without precedent, thanks in part to the influence of the Grand Duke and his wife. He abdicated on 7 October 2000, and was succeeded on the throne by his son Henri. Luxembourg's museum of modern art Mudam was officially named \\"Mus√©e d'Art Moderne Grand-Duc Jean\\" to commemorate his reign which lasted 36 years. It was inaugurated in his presence in July 2006. Retirement and death Prince Louis in 2006 In the summer of 2002, Grand Duke Jean and Grand Duchess Jos√©phine Charlotte took up residence at Fischbach Castle. After his wife died in January 2005, the Grand Duke continued to live there alone. On 27 December 2016, Grand Duke Jean was hospitalized due to bronchitis and was discharged from hospital on 4 January 2017, a day before he celebrated his 96th birthday. =Death= Surrounded by his family, Grand Duke Jean died at 00.25 CEST on 23 April 2019 at the age of 98 after he had been hospitalized for a pulmonary infection. He had become the world's oldest living monarch by the time of his death. His funeral was held on Saturday, 4 May at the Notre-Dame Cathedral, Luxembourg after a period of mourning of 12 days. =Tributes= Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission and former prime-minister of Luxembourg, described Jean's death as \\"a great loss for the Grand Duchy and for Europe\\". He added, \\"Like all the people of Luxembourg, I had great esteem for this man of commitment, kindness and courage.\\" Luxembourg's prime- minister, Xavier Bettel, alluded to his service in the Second World War: \\"Grand Duke Jean fought for our freedom, for our independence and for the unity of our country and we will always be grateful. A family man left us today. A great statesman, a hero, an example ‚Äì and a very beloved and gracious man.\\" Tributes followed from the Belgian royal family, commenting \\"His courage, his dignity and his high sense of duty will remain as an example... The whole of Belgium shares the grief of the Luxembourg people\\" In their tribute, the Dutch royal family mentioned \\"the friendship and warmth he radiated\\", adding \\"With his thoughtfulness and humanity, he added to calm and confidence in his country and Europe.\\" In the tribute from the Romanian Royal Family via a post on their websites, they mentioned that \\"The entire Royal Family of Romania is alongside the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg in these sad and painful moments\\"; also written was their very close relations (via Queen Anne who was a paternal first cousin of his) as well as \\"a lifetime of friendship\\"; the head of the family, Crown Princess Margareta, sent a letter of condolences to her cousin, Grand Duke Henri The president of the International Olympic Committee Thomas Bach paid tribute to Grand Duke Jean who had joined the IOC in 1946 and had been an honorary member since 1998. \\"He was always a very calm and well-balanced person who was highly respected by the entire Olympic Movement because of his integrity... The IOC will always hold him in the highest honour and with the greatest respect.\\" Marriage and family Grand Duke Jean and his wife Jos√©phine-Charlotte (1964) The Grand Ducal couple with their children (July 1971) In October 1952, Jean was officially engaged to Princess Jos√©phine Charlotte of Belgium, the only daughter of King Leopold III of the Belgians and his first wife, Princess Astrid of Sweden. There had been speculation that the marriage was arranged to improve relations between Luxembourg and Belgium but it soon became apparent that a love match was blooming between two longtime friends. They were married in Luxembourg on 9 April 1953, first in the Hall of Ceremonies at the Grand Ducal Palace, later in Luxembourg's Notre-Dame Cathedral. The marriage put an end to the tensions between Luxembourg and Belgium which arose from 1918 to 1920 when there had been a threat of annexation. The couple had five children, 22 grandchildren and 15 great-grandchildren: *Archduchess Marie Astrid, Archduchess Carl Christian of Austria (17 February 1954) she married Archduke Carl Christian of Austria on 6 February 1982. They have five children and nine grandchildren. *Grand Duke Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg (16 April 1955), he married Mar√≠a Teresa Mestre y Batista on 14 February 1981. They have five children and five grandchildren. *Prince Jean (15 May 1957) he married H√©l√®ne Vestur on 27 May 1987 and they were divorced in 2004. They have four children and two grandsons. He remarried Diane de Guerre on 18 March 2009. *Princess Margaretha (15 May 1957) she married Prince Nikolaus of Liechtenstein on 20 March 1982. They have four children. *Prince Guillaume (born 1 May 1963) he married Sibilla Weiller on 8 September 1994. They have four children.

The Arr√™t√© Grand-Ducal (Grand Ducal decree) of 21 September 1995 established that the title of Prince/Princesse de Luxembourg is reserved for the children of the sovereign and the heir to the throne. It also stated that the descendants in male lineage of the sovereign should be styled as Royal Highnesses and titled Prince/Princess of Nassau and that the descendants of unapproved marriages should be styled as Count/Countess of Nassau. =Honours= National honours *106px Knight of the Order of the Gold Lion of the House of Nassau (Grand Master 1964‚Äì2000) *106px Grand Cross of the Order of Adolphe of Nassau (Grand Master 1964‚Äì2000) *106px Grand Cross of the Order of the Oak Crown (Grand Master 1964‚Äì2000) *106px Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (Grand Master 1964‚Äì2000) *106px Recipient of the Military Medal (17 December 2002) *106px54px Recipient of the Luxembourg War Cross with bronze palm *106px Recipient of the Cross of the Order of Resistance Foreign honours * Austria ** Austrian Imperial and Royal Family: 1,293rd Knight of the Imperial and Royal Order of the Golden Fleece ** : Grand Cross of the Order of Honour for Services to the Republic of Austria (1975) * : Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Leopold I * : Recipient of the World War II Cross of War Medal with bronze palm * : Knight of the Order of the Elephant (22 November 1976)Borger.dk * : Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of the White Rose of Finland (1993) * : Grand Cross of the Order of the Legion of Honourhttps://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d;=20190423&t;=2&i;=1379746172&w;=640&fh;=&fw;=‚â™=&pl;=&sq;=&r;=LYNXNPEF3M0E0 * : Recipient of the World War II Cross of War Medal * : Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany, Special Class * Greek Royal Family: Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Order of the Redeemer * : Knight of the Order of the Golden Spur * : Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of the FalconIcelandese Presidency Website , Jean ; st√≥rhertogi ; L√∫xemborg ; 1986-06-09 ; St√≥rkross me√∞ ke√∞ju (=Jean, Grand Duke, Luxembourg, 9 June 1986, Grand Cross with Collar) * Empire of Iran: Recipient of the Commemorative Medal of the 2, 500th Year Celebration of the founding of the Persian Empire (14 October 1971)Badraie Badraie * : Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (26 October 1973) *: Knight of the Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation ** Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus ** Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown of Italy * : Knight Grand Cordon with Collar of the Order of the Chrysanthemum * : Bailiff Knight Grand Cross of Justice of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, Special Classhttps://c7.alamy.com/comp/E1224D/jan-01-1983-princess- josephine-receives-insignia-among-the-insingies-E1224D.jpg * : Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Lion of the NetherlandsStaatsbezoek van Groothertog en Groothertogin van Luxemburg aan Nederland * : Recipient of the Queen Juliana Inauguration Medal * : Recipient of the Silver Wedding Anniversary Medal of Queen Juliana and Prince Bernhard * : Recipient of the Wedding Medal of Princess Beatrix and Claus van AmsbergHuwelijk prinses Beatrix en prins Claus (1966) * : Recipient of the War Commemorative Cross * : Knight Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of Saint Olav (1964) * : Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland * : Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of the Tower and Sword * : Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of Infante Dom Henrique (29 January 1985) * : 1,184th Knight of the Royal Order of the Golden Fleece (8 July 1980) * : Knight Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of Charles III (16 June 1983) * : Knight with Collar of the Royal Order of the Seraphim (18 July 1951)https://www.royalty-postcards.com/wp- content/uploads/2019/03/photo-swed-87.jpg * : Recipient of the 50th Birthday Commemorative Medal of King Carl XVI Gustaf (30 April 1996) * : Knight of the Order of the Royal House of Chakri (17 October 1960) * : 948th Stranger Knight of the Order of the Garter (1972) * : Recipient of the 1939-1945 Star Medal * : Recipient of the France and Germany Star Medal * : Recipient of the Defence Medal * : Recipient of the World War II War Medal * : Recipient of the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal * : Recipient of the Silver Star Medal =Awards= *He also received the Gold Olympic Order in 1998 and the 60px Bronze Wolf Award for his contributions to worldwide scouting. * ** : Honorary Degree of the University of Laval * : ** : Honorary Degree of the University of Strasbourg * ** : Honorary Degree of the University of Miami Ancestry =Patrilineal descent= Henri's patriline is the line from which he is descended father to son. Patrilineal descent is the principle behind membership in royal houses, as it can be traced back through the generations - which means that if Grand Duke Jean were to choose an historically accurate house name it would be Robertian, as all his male-line ancestors have been of that house. Jean is a member of the House of Bourbon-Parma, a sub-branch of the House of Bourbon-Spain, itself originally a branch of the House of Bourbon, and thus of the Capetian dynasty and of the Robertians. Jean's patriline is the line from which he is descended father to son. It follows the Dukes of Parma as well as the Kings of Spain, France, and Navarre. The line can be traced back more than 1,200 years from Robert of Hesbaye to the present day, through Kings of France & Navarre, Spain and Two-Sicilies, Dukes of Parma and Grand-Dukes of Luxembourg, Princes of Orl√©ans and Emperors of Brazil.

A living fossil is an extant taxon that closely resembles organisms otherwise known only from the fossil record. To be considered a living fossil, the fossil species must be old relative to the time of origin of the extant clade. Living fossils commonly are of species-poor lineages, but they need not be. Living fossils exhibit stasis (also called \\"bradytely\\") over geologically long time scales. Popular literature may wrongly claim that a \\"living fossil\\" has undergone no significant evolution since fossil times, with practically no molecular evolution or morphological changes. Scientific investigations have repeatedly discredited such claims. The minimal superficial changes to living fossils are mistakenly declared the absence of evolution, but they are examples of stabilizing selection, which is an evolutionary process‚Äîand perhaps the dominant process of morphological evolution. Characteristics Living fossils have two main characteristics, although some have a third: # Living organisms that are members of a taxon that has remained recognisable in the fossil record over an unusually long time span. # They show little morphological divergence, whether from early members of the lineage, or among extant species. # They tend to have little taxonomic diversity. The first two are required for recognition as a living fossil status; some authors also require the third, others merely note it as a frequent trait. Such criteria are neither well-defined nor clearly quantifiable, but modern methods for analyzing evolutionary dynamics can document the distinctive tempo of stasis. Lineages that exhibit stasis over very short time scales are not considered living fossils; what is poorly-defined is the time scale over which the morphology must persist for that lineage to be recognized as a living fossil. The term \\"living fossil\\" is much misunderstood in popular media in particular, in which it often is used meaninglessly. In professional literature the expression seldom appears and must be used with far more caution, although it has been used inconsistently. One example of a concept that could be confused with \\"living fossil\\" is that of a \\"Lazarus taxon\\", but the two are not equivalent; a Lazarus taxon (whether a single species or a group of related species) is one that suddenly reappears, either in the fossil record or in nature, as if the fossil had \\"come to life again\\". In contrast to \\"Lazarus taxa\\", a living fossil in most senses is a species or lineage that has undergone exceptionally little change throughout a long fossil record, giving the impression that the extant taxon had remained identical through the entire fossil and modern period. The average species turnover time, meaning the time between when a species first is established and when it finally disappears, varies widely among phyla, but averages about 2‚Äì3 million years. A living taxon that had long been thought to be extinct could be called a Lazarus taxon once it was discovered to be still extant. A dramatic example was the order Coelacanthiformes, of which the genus Latimeria was found to be extant in 1938. About that there is little debate ‚Äî however, whether Latimeria resembles early members of its lineage sufficiently closely to be considered a living fossil as well as a Lazarus taxon has been denied by some authors in recent years. Coelacanths disappeared from the fossil record some 80 million years ago (upper Cretaceous) and, to the extent that they exhibit low rates of morphological evolution, extant species qualify as living fossils. It must be emphasised that this criterion reflects fossil evidence, and is totally independent of whether the taxa had been subject to selection at all, which all living populations continuously are, whether they remain genetically unchanged or not. This in turn gives rise to a great deal of confusion; for one thing, the fossil record seldom preserves much more than the general morphology of a specimen ‚Äî to determine much about its physiology is seldom possible. To determine much about its noncoding DNA is hardly ever possible, but even if a species were hypothetically unchanged in its physiology, it is to be expected from the very nature of the reproductive processes that its non-functional genomic changes would continue at more or less standard rates. It follows that a fossil lineage with apparently constant morphology need not imply equally constant physiology, for example, and certainly neither implies any cessation of the basic evolutionary processes such as natural selection, nor reduction in the usual rate of change of the noncoding DNA. In short, not even the most dramatic examples of living fossils can be expected to be without changes, no matter how persistently constant their fossils and their extant specimens might seem. Some living fossils are taxa that were known from palaeontological fossils before living representatives were discovered. The most famous examples of this are: * Coelacanthiform fishes (2 species) * Metasequoia, the dawn redwood discovered in a remote Chinese valley (1 species) * glypheoid lobsters (2 species) * mymarommatid wasps (10 species) * eomeropid scorpionflies (1 species) * jurodid beetles (1 species) * soft sea urchins (59 species) All the above include taxa that originally were described as fossils but now are known to include still-extant species. Other examples of living fossils are single living species that have no close living relatives, but are survivors of large and widespread groups in the fossil record. For example: * Ginkgo biloba * Syntexis libocedrii, the cedar wood wasp * Dinoflagellates (typified on coccoid dinocysts: occasionally calcareous cell remnants) All of these were described from fossils before later found alive. The fact that a living fossil is a surviving representative of an archaic lineage does not imply that it must retain all the \\"primitive\\" features (plesiomorphies) of its ancestral lineage. Although it is common to say that living fossils exhibit \\"morphological stasis\\", stasis, in the scientific literature, does not mean that any species is strictly identical to its ancestor, much less remote ancestors. Some living fossils are relicts of formerly diverse and morphologically varied lineages, but not all survivors of ancient lineages necessarily are regarded as living fossils. See for example the uniquely and highly autapomorphic oxpeckers, which appear to be the only survivors of an ancient lineage related to starlings and mockingbirds.  Evolution and living fossils  The term living fossil is usually reserved for species or larger clades that are exceptional for their lack of morphological diversity and their exceptional conservatism, and several hypotheses could explain morphological stasis on a geologically long time-scale. Early analyses of evolutionary rates emphasized the persistence of a taxon rather than rates of evolutionary change. Contemporary studies instead analyze rates and modes of phenotypic evolution, but most have focused on clades that are thought to be adaptive radiations rather than on those thought to be living fossils. Thus, very little is presently known about the evolutionary mechanisms that produce living fossils or how common they might be. Some recent studies have documented exceptionally low rates of ecological and phenotypic evolution despite rapid speciation. This has been termed a \\"non-adaptive radiation\\" referring to diversification not accompanied by adaptation into various significantly different niches. Such radiations are explanation for groups that are morphologically conservative. Persistent adaptation within an adaptive zone is a common explanation for morphological stasis. The subject of very low evolutionary rates, however, has received much less attention in the recent literature than that of high rates Living fossils are not expected to exhibit exceptionally low rates of molecular evolution, and some studies have shown that they do not. For example, on tadpole shrimp (Triops), one article notes, \\"Our work shows that organisms with conservative body plans are constantly radiating, and presumably, adapting to novel conditions.... I would favor retiring the term ‚Äòliving fossil‚Äô altogether, as it is generally misleading.\\"\\"Diversification in Ancient Tadpole Shrimps Challenges the Term 'Living Fossil'\\" Science Daily accessed 2 April 2013; \\"The Falsity of 'Living Fossils'\\", The Scientist accessed 2 April 2013. The question posed by several recent studies pointed out that the morphological conservatism of coelacanths is not supported by paleontological data. In addition, it was shown recently that studies concluding that a slow rate of molecular evolution is linked to morphological conservatism in coelacanths are biased by the a priori hypothesis that these species are ‚Äòliving fossils‚Äô. Accordingly, the genome stasis hypothesis is challenged by the recent finding that the genome of the two extant coelacanth species L. chalumnae and L. menadoensis contain multiple species-specific insertions, indicating transposable element recent activity and contribution to post-speciation genome divergence. Such studies, however, challenge only a genome stasis hypothesis, not the hypothesis of exceptionally low rates of phenotypic evolution. History The term was coined by Charles Darwin in his On the Origin of Species from 1859, when discussing Ornithorhynchus (the platypus) and Lepidosiren (the South American lungfish): =Other definitions=  Long-enduring  Elephant shrews resemble the extinct Leptictidium of Eocene Europe. A living taxon that lived through a large portion of geologic time. Queensland lungfish (Neoceratodus fosteri) is an example of an organism that meets this criterion. Fossils identical to modern Queensland lungfish have been dated at over 100 million years making this species one of the oldest if not actually the oldest extant vertebrate species.  Resembles ancient species  A living taxon morphologically and/or physiologically resembling a fossil taxon through a large portion of geologic time (morphological stasis).  Retains many ancient traits  More primitive trapdoor spiders, such as this female Liphistius sp., have segmented plates on the dorsal surface of the abdomen and cephalothorax, a character shared with scorpions, making it probable that after the spiders diverged from the scorpions, the earliest unique ancestor of trapdoor species was the first to split off from the lineage that contains all other extant spiders. A living taxon with many characteristics believed to be primitive. This is a more neutral definition. However, it does not make it clear whether the taxon is truly old, or it simply has many plesiomorphies. Note that, as mentioned above, the converse may hold for true living fossil taxa; that is, they may possess a great many derived features (autapomorphies), and not be particularly \\"primitive\\" in appearance.  Relict population  Any one of the above three definitions, but also with a relict distribution in refuges. Some paleontologists believe that living fossils with large distributions (such as Triops cancriformis) are not real living fossils. In the case of Triops cancriformis (living from the Triassic until now), the Triassic specimens lost most of their appendages (mostly only carapaces remain), and they have not been thoroughly examined since 1938.  Low diversity  Any of the first three definitions, but the clade also has a low taxonomic diversity (low diversity lineages). Oxpeckers are morphologically somewhat similar to starlings due to shared plesiomorphies, but are uniquely adapted to feed on parasites and blood of large land mammals, which has always obscured their relationships. This lineage forms part of a radiation that includes Sturnidae and Mimidae, but appears to be the most ancient of these groups. Biogeography strongly suggests that oxpeckers originated in eastern Asia and only later arrived in Africa, where they now have a relict distribution. The two living species thus seem to represent an entirely extinct and (as Passerida go) rather ancient lineage, as certainly as this can be said in the absence of actual fossils. The latter is probably due to the fact that the oxpecker lineage never occurred in areas where conditions were good for fossilization of small bird bones, but of course, fossils of ancestral oxpeckers may one day turn up enabling this theory to be tested. = Operational definition = An operational definition was proposed in 2017, where a 'living fossil' lineage has a slow rate of evolution and occurs close to the middle of morphological variation (the centroid of morphospace) among related taxa (i.e. a species is morphologically conservative among relatives). The scientific accuracy of the morphometric analyses used to classify tuatara as a living fossil under this definition have been criticised however, which prompted a rebuttal from the original authors. Examples Some of these are informally known as \\"living fossils\\". Ginkgos have not only existed for a long time, but also have a long life span, with some having an age of over 2,500 years. Six specimens survived the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, 1 to 2 kilometers from ground zero. They still live there today. dominant plant group in the Jurassic period, with some species, such as Osmunda claytoniana, maintaining evolutionary stasis for at least 180 million years. =Bacteria= * Cyanobacteria - the oldest living fossils, emerging 3.5 billion years ago.

The game was developed by Raven Software and published by Activision. Raven Software collaborated with id Software, the creators and developers of preceding Quake games. id Software supervised the development of the game as well as providing the id Tech 4 engine upon which it was built. Quake 4 went gold in early October 2005 and was released on October 18, 2005 for Microsoft Windows and later for Linux and OS X, as well as being a launch title for the Xbox 360. A special DVD Collectors Edition was released, including promotional material and the game Quake II with its expansions, The Reckoning and Ground Zero. The Xbox 360 version of Quake 4 is based on the Special Collectors Edition, and includes Quake II. On August 4, 2011, the game was made available through Steam. Plotwise, the game is a sequel to Quake II and takes place during the same war as Enemy Territory: Quake Wars. Compared to other titles in the Quake series, Quake 4 has an increased emphasis on the single-player portion of the game. A multiplayer mode is available, but it does not involve playable bots like Quake III Arena. Gameplay =Single player= Quake 4 has a stronger emphasis on single- player than its predecessor and features a campaign that continues the story of Quake II. However, it lacks the bot matchmaking offered in Quake III. The campaign's gameplay is mostly the same as in the multiplayer but also adds friendly NPC squad members that can aid you in combat. The game also features outdoor vehicle sections during certain missions, where you can control walkers and tanks. =Multiplayer= Multiplayer modes are Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Tourney, Capture the Flag, Arena CTF and DeadZone. Players at QuakeCon reported the multiplayer gameplay to include elements similar to those in previous Quake games such as strafe-jumping or rocket jumping. Notable additions to play are the ability to send shots through the teleporters and the advancement of the game physics provided by the new technology including the ability to bounce grenades and napalm fire off of jump-pads. Like the previous Quake games, the multiplayer has a client-server architecture. The network code has been altered from Doom 3, allowing for larger numbers of players on each server; Doom 3 has a four-player restriction, whereas Quake 4 has a standard 16 player limit. =Movement= The player movement in Quake 4 is similar to that in Quake III Arena and Quake Live, but with the additions of ramp jumping and crouch slides. Crouch slides give players the ability to maintain speed by sliding around corners. Ramp jumps allow players to gain extra height from jumping as they reach the top of an inclined object, which while present in the original Quake and Quake II was not included in Quake III Arena. Plot Corporal Matthew Kane prepares to take out the Strogg Nexus with his Rail Gun The Quake 4 single player mode continues the story of Quake II by pitting the player against cyborg alien race known as the Strogg. The game follows the story of a Marine Corporal named Matthew Kane who is joining the elite Rhino Squad.Quake 4 Designer Diary No. 1 ‚Äì The Characters of Quake 4 GameSpot, July 29, 2005 Following the success of the protagonist of Quake II in destroying the Strogg's leader, the Makron, Rhino Squad is tasked with spearheading the mission to secure the aliens' home planet Stroggos. In the course of the invasion, the squad ship is shot down and crashes in the middle of a battle zone, separating Kane from his companions. Kane rejoins his scattered team members and partakes in the assault against the Strogg. After performing a number of tasks, such as destroying and capturing Strogg aircraft hangars and defense systems, Kane and his remaining squad members make it to the USS Hannibal. There they are given their next mission: infiltrating one of the Strogg's central communication hubs, the Tetranode, with an electromagnetic pulse bomb in the hope that it will put the main Strogg Nexus in disarray. Kane is tasked with defending the mission convoy, which takes heavy casualties. After many setbacks, including the destruction of the EMP device by a Strogg ambush, Kane is left to complete the mission, assisted only by Private Johann Strauss (Peter Stormare) and Lance Corporal Nikolai \\"Sledge\\" Slidjonovitch (Dimitri Diatchenko). Strauss figures out a way to destroy the core by shutting down its coolant systems. As Kane reaches the entrance to the Tetranode, however, he is greeted by two rocket-equipped network guardians, as well as the newly constructed Makron, which easily defeats Kane and knocks him unconscious. When Kane awakens, he finds himself strapped to a conveyor belt in the Strogg \\"Medical Facilities\\", a structure used for turning those captured and killed by the aliens either into protein food or additional Strogg units. In a long and gruesome first- person cutscene, Kane is taken through this \\"stroggification\\" process which violently replaces much of his anatomy with bio-mechanical parts. Before the final controlling neurochip implanted in his brain can be activated, though, Rhino Squad bursts into the facility and rescues Kane. After escaping through the Strogg medical facility and Waste Disposal plant, fighting off zombie-like half-stroggified humans along the way, Kane is forced to combat his former commander, Lieutenant Voss (Michael Gannon), who has been fully stroggified into a powerful mechanized monster but retains his own consciousness long enough to warn Kane. After defeating this threat, Kane and the remaining marines finally make it back to the Hannibal. The commanders realize that Kane's Strogg physiology has opened up new possibilities for defeating the Strogg, as he can be used to infiltrate locations and teleportation areas previously impenetrable and/or fatally harmful to human forces. The new plan is to directly target the Strogg Nexus Core, a huge centralized brain-like structure which controls the alien forces. The Marines are tasked with infiltrating the three data towers adjacent to the Nexus: Data Storage, Processing, and Networking. There, they will deactivate the Nexus' shield and power up the teleporter used to access the Nexus and send Kane in. Once inside, Kane will travel to the center of the Nexus to destroy the Core Brain and its guardian. After infiltrating the facility and realigning the data nodes powering the teleporter, and destroying its fearsome \\"Guardian\\" creature, Kane reaches the Nexus core. There he meets the Makron in a final showdown and kills it. This accomplished, he destroys the Core and returns to the Hannibal. Celebrating with Rhino Squad afterward, Kane receives word that he has new orders. Development The Xbox 360 version of Quake 4 was released at the launch of the Xbox 360 and is Xbox Live compatible. There have been major issues with frame rates for the console adaptation, earning it the award for Most Aggravating Frame Rate/Best Slideshow in the GameSpot.com Best and Worst of 2005 list. In addition, the Xbox 360 port of Quake 4 has very long load times and Xbox Live glitches that result in problematic multiplayer experiences, as documented by game review sites as well as on Activision's support pages for the Xbox 360 version. This version was initially priced the same as the PC Special Edition DVD and features the same content. Aspyr Media published and released Quake 4 for OS X on April 5, 2006, initially only for PowerPC based Macs, but later as a universal binary compatible with both PowerPC- and x86-based Macs. id Software continued its tradition of supporting Linux, with Timothee Besset of id releasing a Linux version of the Quake 4 binary executable. The binary can be downloaded for free from id's servers and it requires a licensed copy of Quake 4 for Windows or OS X in order to run. The Linux installer was made available two days after the release of the game itself. Having worked on the theme music for Doom 3, Clint Walsh and Chris Vrenna, were brought in to compose and produce the main theme respectively for Quake 4. The rest of the music were composed by Raven's audio leads, Zachary Quarles and Kevin Schilder. Quake 4 was re-released for the Xbox 360 and PC on June 19, with publication handled by Bethesda. In Europe, the game was launched in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and Benelux territories. It was released in the United Kingdom on June 22. Unlike the original Xbox 360 version, the Bethesda re-release does not include the port of Quake II. Like its predecessors, Quake 4 can be modified. This led to Quake 4 versions of popular mods from previous versions of Quake, such as Rocket Arena, and Quake 4 Fortress (the Quake 4 version of Team Fortress Classic). Quake 4 Fortress was abandoned before its creators considered it complete; instead they released an alpha version complete with source code. In the competitive gaming scene, there were two principal mods, Q4Max and X-Battle. The online Quake 4 competitive community was split between the two mods. A number of the online leagues switched between X-Battle and Q4Max, such as ClanBase EuroCup and GGL. Despite this split in the online community, the offline professional LAN tournaments run by CPL, ESWC, WCG, QuakeCon,Major League Gaming and WSVG all used Q4Max. Members of both the Q4Max and X-Battle teams joined forces with Adam 'SyncError' Pyle of id Software and developed another mod, Delta CTF, which brought Quake II style Capture the Flag to Quake 4. Another notable mod is SABot, which successfully implemented multiplayer bots in Quake 4 less than a month after the SDK was released, despite this being a feature that some reviewers criticised Quake 4 for not including. Reception Quake 4s computer version received a \\"Silver\\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom. Quake 4 received generally favorable reviews regarding the PC version of the game, with game database Metacritic giving the game an aggregate review score of 81/100. Websites and magazines such as IGN and UGO praised its single-player campaign, graphics and Hollywood voice-acting, but complained that its multiplayer was too much like Quake III. GameSpot gave Quake 4 an 8.0 and it also said: \\"The single-player is great fun, but the uninspired multiplayer leaves a lot to be desired\\". PC Magazine gave Quake 4 a good review for both singleplayer and multiplayer gameplay. The original 2005 Xbox 360 version of the game fared slightly worse with critics when it was released but still received generally positive reviews, scoring 75/100 on Metacritic. The only exception for that is 1UP.com, where they gave the PC version a score of \\"B-\\" but the Xbox 360 version a score of \\"B+\\". Electronic Gaming Monthly gave a mixed rating to the Xbox 360 port. It panned the single-player campaign for not being creative enough to compete with other games such as Half-Life 2 and noted that the game ran poorly on the 360. IGN scored Quake 4 8.1/10, saying \\"Quake 4 is one of those games that will appeal to console gamers who haven't owned a PC for years. The single-player campaign is varied and pretty interesting, getting better after you're Stroggified. The enemies go from dumb and running right at you to diverse and more interesting in the second half of the game, and there are a few cool boss fights worth your while. The gory graphics and excellent lighting are well done and they'll appeal to many gamers looking for a fast, shiny game to just let loose on\\". GameSpot gave it a worse rating than the PC version: 6.6. They also wrote: \\"There's a good game in Quake 4, but it's buried under several layers of highly disappointing graphical performance issues\\". X-Play gave the Xbox 360 version a 3/5 and the PC version a 4/5. Quake 4 was a finalist for PC Gamer USs \\"Best Multiplayer Game 2005\\" award, which ultimately went to Battlefield 2. In 2016, former id Software employee and original Quake director John Romero expressed his disappointment over the direction of Quake 4. =Competitive play= In part due to the similarities to the Quake III Arena multiplayer, Quake 4 was used in a number of professional electronic sports tournaments.

The offices of the CBAC are located in Moncton, New Brunswick. The union is one of four components of Canadian Baptist Ministries. History The Baptist Convention of the Maritime Provinces was founded in 1846. The Canadian Baptists of Atlantic Canada was formed in 1905-1906 as the United Baptist Convention of the Maritimes by a union of Free, or Free Will Baptists and Calvinistic or Regular Baptists. The Regular Baptist and Free Will Baptist congregations wrote a statement of faith and polity called the \\"Basis of Union\\" with which both groups could agree. With the addition of Newfoundland to Canada in 1949, the name was changed to the United Baptist Convention of the Atlantic Provinces. Many of these churches still carry \\"United Baptist\\" in their official name. In 2001, the name was changed to the Convention of Atlantic Baptist Churches. In 2016, the name was changed to the Canadian Baptists of Atlantic Canada. Since 1944 CBAC has been one of the partners in the Canadian Baptist Federation (now known as Canadian Baptist Ministries). Organization The largest regional union in Canada, in 2003 the CBAC consists of over 62,000 members in 538 churches and 21 associations across the Atlantic provinces (New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia & Prince Edward Island). The CBAC is subdivided into nine regions for local cooperation.

Born in a family of modest means, he became an acclaimed historian both in Italy and abroad, in particular in the United States, after he was forced into exile by Mussolini's Fascist regime. Initially engaging with the Italian Socialist Party, he later adhered to an independent humanitarian socialism, while maintaining a commitment to radical political and social reform throughout his life. Salvemini offered significant leadership to political refugees in the United States. His prolific writings shaped the attitudes of U.S. policymakers during and after the Second World War. His transatlantic exile experience endowed him with new insights and a fresh perspective to explain the rise of fascism, while shaping the memory of the war and political life in Italy after 1945. He advocated a third way between Communists and Christian Democracy for post-war Italy.  Early life and career  Salvemini was born in the town of Molfetta, in Apulia in the poor south of Italy, in an extended family of farmers and fishermen of modest means. His father, Ilarione Salvemini, was a carabiniere and part-time teacher. He had been a radical republican who had fought as a Red Shirt following Giuseppe Garibaldi in his fight for Italian unification.Sarti, Italy: a reference guide from the Renaissance to the present, p. 539Carnes, American National Biography, pp. 490-91 His mother Emanuela (n√©e Turtur) was a socialist. His parents' political leanings as well as the poverty of the region, shaped his own political and social ideals throughout his life.Gaetano Salvemini (1873‚Äì1957): Historian, humanitarian socialist, and activist intellectual, by Mark Clark, in Transatlantic Perspectives (retrieved May 14, 2016) He was admitted at the University of Florence, where he met mostly students of northern Italy and engaged with young socialists who introduced him to Marxism (which he would revise critically later), the ideas of Carlo Cattaneo and the Italian socialist Filippo Turati's journal Critica Sociale, as well as his first wife Maria Minervini. Biografia di Gaetano Salvemini, Istituto di studi storici Gaetano Salvemini (retrieved May 14, 2016) After completing his studies in Florence in 1894, his historical studies on medieval Florence, the French Revolution and Giuseppe Mazzini established him as an acclaimed historian. In 1901, after years of teaching in secondary schools, he was appointed as a professor in medieval and modern history at the University of Messina. While in Messina, he lost his wife, five children and his sister in the devastating 1908 Messina earthquake before his eyes, while hiding under an architrave of a window; an experience that shaped his life. \\"I am a miserable wretch, without home or hearth, who has seen the happiness of eleven years destroyed in two minutes,\\" he wrote.Pugliese, Carlo Rosselli, pp. 30-31 He went on to teach history at the University of Pisa and in 1916 was appointed Professor of Modern History at the University of Florence. Over the years, he aligned with Luigi Einaudi and gradually developed a pragmatic inquiry and inductive analysis, which he called concretismo ‚Äì a combination of secular values from the enlightenment, liberalism and socialism ‚Äì in contrast to more philosophical thinkers like Benedetto Croce and Antonio Gramsci.  Engaging with socialism  A portrait of Gaetano Salvemini Salvemini became increasingly concerned with Italian politics and adhered to the Italian Socialist Party (, PSI). In 1910, he published an article in the socialist newspaper Avanti! entitled 'The minister of the underworld' (Il ministro della malavita), in which he attacked the power system and political machine of the liberal Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti who dominated Italian political life from the start of the 20th century.Puzzo, Gaetano Salvemini, pp. 222-23Sarti, Italy: a reference guide from the Renaissance to the present, p. 314 Salvemini reproached Giolitti to exploit the backwardness of Southern Italy for short- term political goals, appeasing the landlords while engaging with corrupt political go-betweens with ties to the underworld.De Grand, The hunchback's tailor, p. 4 According to Salvemini, Giolitti exploited \\"the miserable conditions of the Mezzogiorno in order to link the mass of southern deputies to himself\\".Paoli, Broken bonds: Mafia and politics in Sicily He opposed the costly military campaign in Libya during Italo-Turkish War (1911‚Äì1912). The war did not meet the real needs of the country in need of far-reaching economic and social reforms, according to Salvemini, but was a dangerous collusion between unrealistic nationalism and corporate interests. In 1911, Salvemini left the PSI because of the \\"silence and indifference\\" on the war by the partyKillinger, Gaetano Salvemini, p. 69 and founded the weekly political review L'Unit√† that would serve as the voice of militant democrats in Italy for the next decade. He criticised the government's imperial designs in Africa as chauvinist foolishness. However, he did favour Italy's entry in the First World War on the side of the Entente, in order to achieve a greater political, economic and social stake in the nation by the masses, as well as national self-determination.Duggan, The Force of Destiny, p. 399 He became one of the leaders of the democratic interventionists with Leonida Bissolati. Through the fight for democracy abroad, he believed, Italy would rediscover its own democratic roots. Consistent with his interventionist position he joined as a volunteer in the first two years of the war. As a member of the PSI he fought for universal suffrage, for the moral and economic rebirth of Italy's Mezzogiorno (Southern Italy) and against corruption in politics. As a meriodanalist he criticised the PSI for its indifference for the problems of the South of Italy. While he abandoned the Socialist Party to adhere to an independent humanitarian socialism, he would maintain a commitment to radical reform throughout his life. Elected on a list of ex-combatants, he served in the Italian Chamber of Deputies as an independent radical from 1919 to 1921 during the revolutionary period of the Biennio Rosso. He supported the internationalist programme of self-determination of the U.S. president Woodrow Wilson, which envisioned a re-adjustment of the frontiers of Italy along clearly recognizable lines of nationality, in contrast to the irrendentist policy of Foreign Minister Sidney Sonnino.  Resisting fascism  March on Rome In the immediate post-war period, Salvemini was initially silent about Italian Fascism, but as a deputy he soon dissented from the political line of its parliamentary group and started a lively polemic against Benito Mussolini, who he had admired in the past as socialist leader, to the point that Mussolini even challenged him to a duel, which never took place. Nevertheless, as late as 1922, he considered the fascist movement too small to be a serious political challenge. Salvemini was more opposed to old-style politicians like Giolitti. \\"A return to Giolitti would be a moral disaster for the whole country,\\" he wrote. \\"Mussolini was able to carry out his coup ... because everybody was disgusted by the Chamber.\\"Clark, Modern Italy, pp. 266-67 While in Paris he was surprised by Mussolini's March on Rome in October 1922, which initiated the Fascist take over of Italy. In 1923, he held a series of lectures on Italian foreign policy in London, to the ire of the Fascist government and Florentine fascists. The walls of Florence were plastered with posters saying: \\"The monkey from Molfetta should not return to Italy\\". Instead, Salvemini not only returned home, but resumed his lectures at the University, regardless of the threat of fascist students. He joined the opposition after the murder of the socialist politician Giacomo Matteotti on 10 June 1924, when it became clear that Mussolini wanted to establish a one- party dictatorship. He worked to maintain a strong network of contacts among anti-fascist intellectuals throughout Italy, while much of the Italian academic world bowed to the regime. With his former students and followers Ernesto Rossi and Carlo Rosselli he founded the first clandestine anti-fascist newspaper Non mollare (Don't Give Up) in January 1925.Pugliese, Carlo Rosselli, p. 64 A half year later he was arrested and put on trial,Trial of Professors Is Exciting Italy, The New York Times, July 12, 1925 but was released on a technicality, although he was kept under surveillance.Court In Florence Frees Professor, The New York Times, July 14, 1925 Threats against his life were published in the Fascist press and his lawyer was beaten to death by Fascist blackshirts.Fascisti in Frenzy in Florence Riots, The New York Times, October 8, 1925 His name was on top of the list of the Fascist death squads during raids on 4 October 1925 in Florence.Rose, The Dispossessed, pp. 135-37 However, Salvemini had fled to France in August 1925. He was dismissed from the University of Florence and his Italian citizenship was revoked in 1926. In exile Salvemini continued to actively organize resistance against Mussolini in France, England and finally in the United States. In 1927, he published The Fascist Dictatorship in Italy, a lucid and groundbreaking study of the rise of Fascism and Mussolini.Puzzo, Gaetano Salvemini, p. 224 In Paris he was involved with the founding of Concentrazione antifascista in 1927 and Giustizia e Libert√† with Carlo and Nello Rosselli in 1929. Through these organizations, Italian exiles were helping the anti- fascists in Italy, spreading clandestine newspapers. The movement intended to be a third alternative between fascism and communism, pursuing a free, democratic republic based on social justice.Killinger, Gaetano Salvemini, p. 226  In the United States  Salvemini first toured the United States in January 1927, lecturing with a clear anti-fascist agenda.Salvemini Arrives, Criticizes Fascism, The New York Times, January 6, 1927 His lectures were disturbed by fascist foes.Police Drive Fascisti From Lecture By Foe, The New York Times, January 25, 1927'Liar, Liar,' Halts Attack On Fascism, The New York Times, January 23, 1927 His forced exile nevertheless gave him a \\"sense of freedom, of spiritual independence.\\" Rather than \\"exile\\" or \\"refugee,\\" he preferred the term fuoruscito ‚Äì an originally contemptuous label employed by Fascists, which was adopted as a symbol of honour by political exiles from Italy ‚Äì, \\"a man who has chosen to leave his country to continue a resistance which had become impossible at home\\".Killinger, Gaetano Salvemini, p. 232 He published The Fascist Dictatorship in Italy (1927), contradicting the widely held belief that Mussolini had saved Italy from Bolshevism.Discrediting the Moral Pretensions of the Fascisti; Prof. Salvemini and Signor Prezzolini Maintain the Black Shirts Did Not Save Italy, The New York Times, June 12, 1927 In 1934, Salvemini accepted to teach Italian civilization ‚Äì a position created especially for him ‚Äì at Harvard University, where he would remain until 1948. Together with Roberto Bolaffio he founded a North American chapter of Giustizia e Libert√†. He wrote articles in important journals like Foreign Affairs and travelled around the country to warn American public opinion against the dangers of fascism.Puzzo, Gaetano Salvemini, pp. 226 Alarmed by the outbreak of the Second World War after Hitler‚Äôs invasion of Poland in September 1939, he and other Italian exiles founded the antifascist Mazzini Society in Northampton, Massachusetts.Rose, The Dispossessed, p. 140 Salvemini joined the Italian Emergency Rescue Committee (IERC), which raised money for Italian political refugees and worked to convince American authorities to admit them.Rose, The Dispossessed, pp. 142-43 He obtained US citizenship in 1940, believing that as an American citizen, he would have greater opportunity to influence U.S. policies toward Italy. In fact, government agencies like the State Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), solicited his advice on Fascism and Italian matters in general. Notable writings of the American years include Under the Axe of Fascism (1936).The Case Against Mussolini and His Fascist Rule, The New York Times, May 17, 1936, Section Book Review, Page BR9 As an intellectual Salvemini left an undeniable mark on the study of Italian history at Harvard and other universities, changing their original focus on language, art and literature, to a critical and systematic study into modern Italy.Rose, The Dispossessed, p. 149 The increasing prominence of Max Ascoli, Carlo Sforza and Alberto Tarchiani in the Mazzini Society consequently led to the progressive distancing of Gaetano Salvemini from active decision making. Salvemini's fear was that Roosevelt would give Churchill and his conservative agenda a free hand in post-war Italy that would benefit the monarchy and those that had collaborated with Mussolini.Rose, The Dispossessed, p. 144 After Mussolini's fall in July 1943, Salvemini became increasingly concerned that the Allies and Italian moderates favoured a conservative restoration in Italy. In order to provide an alternative, together with Harvard professor Giorgio La Piana, Salvemini authored What to do with Italy?, in which they sketched a plan for the reconstruction of Italy after the war along a republican and social-democratic programme.Puzzo, Gaetano Salvemini, pp. 228-29Is Fascism Endemic?, The New York Times, September 12, 1943, Section Book Review, Page BR5  Back in Italy  Although a U.S. citizen, he returned to Italy in 1948 and was reinstated to his old post as Professor of Modern History at the University of Florence.Italian Professor Restored, The New York Times, November 8, 1948 After 20 years of exile, he started his first speech at his old university with: \\"As we were saying in the last lecture\\".Killinger, Gaetano Salvemini, p. 313 As a left- leaning republican he was disappointed with the victory of the Christian Democratic party in the 1948 general election in Italy and the influence of the Catholic church in the country. Salvemini hoped that the Action Party, a post-war political party that emerged from Giustizia e Libert√†, could provide a third force, a socialist-republican coalition uniting reformist socialists and genuine democrats as an alternative for the Communists and the Christian Democrats. However, his hopes for a new Italy declined with the restoration of old attitudes and institutions with the start of the Cold War. In 1953, his last major historic study, Prelude to World War II, was published, about the Second Italo-Ethiopian War.Puzzo, Gaetano Salvemini, pp. 230-32The War of Many Medals, The New York Times, January 10, 1954, Section Book Review, Page BR12 As a historian, he wrote mainly about recent and contemporary history, but was also noted for his studies of the medieval Italian commune. His The French Revolution: 1788‚Äì1792 is an outstanding explanation of the social, political and philosophical currents (and monarchical incompetence) that led to that cataclysm.Turbulent Years That Led to a Republic, The New York Times, July 24, 1955, Section Book Review, Page BR4  Death and legacy  Salvemini spent the last period of his life in Sorrento, never ceasing to denounce the ancient Italian evils: inefficiency, the scandals, the lengthy justicial procedures that continued to favour the powerful. He lamented the failure of public schools that, according to him, were unable to form real critical conscience. After a long illness, he died on September 6, 1957, at the age of 83.Prof. Salvemini, Fought Fascism; Historian and Educator, 83, Dies, The New York Times, September 7, 1957, Page 14 Salvemini was among the first and most effective opponents of Fascism. The political culture he embodied, made that, according to his biographer, Charles L. Killinger, \\"the Fascists were anti- Salvemini before he became anti-Fascist, and their efforts to silence him made his name synonymous with early Italian resistance to the new regime.\\"Killinger, Gaetano Salvemini, p. 173 Although a prolific historian, he was not the kind of person to separate scholarship from political activity. Throughout his exile he actively organized resistance to Mussolini, assisting others in escaping Italy, while he played an important role in spurring both elite and public opinion in America against the Fascist regime.Killinger, Gaetano Salvemini, p. 3 Giolitti's biographer, Alexander De Grand, describes his subject's foe as a \\"major historian, driven by an austere moralism\\" and as a \\"difficult man who attracted deep attachments and bitter enmity\\", who \\"constantly sought to turn his ideas into practical policy, yet he was a mediocre ‚Äì no, terrible ‚Äì politician,\\" quoting Salvemini's fellow exile Max Ascoli who described him \\"as the greatest enemy of politics of all the men I have known\\".Killinger, Gaetano Salvemini, p. 274Grand on Killinger, 'Gaetano Salvemini: A Biography', H-Italy, March, 2003 (Retrieved 2 June 2016) Nevertheless, Salvemini was an imperative force who left a permanent mark on Italian politics and historiography. As a party activist, political commentator, and public officeholder, he championed social and political reform, and his name is tantamount to early Italian resistance to the new Fascist regime. Salvemini said several times that he always tried to live by the principle: \\"Do what you have to do, come what may\\" (F√† quello che devi, avvenga quello che pu√≤).

The town originally developed next to a medieval priory in the form of market stalls. These were replaced over the years by permanent structures, which eventually defined the boundaries of today's Market Square. There is some evidence of pre-Roman and Roman activity in the area, but the main story of the town begins with the founding of St Neots Priory in medieval times. This history article covers the modern suburban area of St Neots which includes Eaton Ford, Eaton Socon and Eynesbury.  Pre-Roman  There is evidence for Iron Age and earlier settlement in the vicinity of St Neots, mainly in the valley of the River Great Ouse where soils are easily cultivated. The first settlements in the valley were in Neolithic times. A hearth from this period was uncovered in Eaton Socon, and there have been isolated finds of flint tools and hand axes. There is rather more evidence from the Bronze Age (pottery, polished stone axes, burial mounds), and from the Iron Age a timber structure (possibly a temple) and several small, Iron Age settlements. This pre-Roman activity would have altered the natural landscape quite markedly, mostly through the felling of timber to clear fields and construct buildings.  Roman  During the Roman period, from the mid-1st century to the mid-5th century, the nearest large settlement was at Godmanchester, with another at Sandy. A Roman road joined the two and passed close to present-day St Neots, and there are traces of other roads as well. Apart from two villas and some earthworks, until recently, only scattered Roman remains had been found, mostly coins and pottery in Eynesbury. However, excavations east of the railway line on what was known as Love's Farm in 2005‚Äì6 have revealed a farming settlement the extent and character of which will be known only when the finds have been assessed, which may take some time. There is little evidence of large-scale settlement in Roman times, but the area around St Neots was certainly used for farming and was crossed by roads and tracks. Romans and Britons lived and worked here, but probably not in a town.  Anglo-Saxon and Viking period  There is some documentary evidence from this period, and also ample archaeological remains, mostly in and around Eynesbury (Ernulf's Burgh), Eaton Socon (Eatun) and the western part of Eaton Ford (Sudbury). The Anglo-Saxon names are in brackets. Everyday objects have been found such as the clay weights used in weaving, broken pieces of pottery, a quern-stone, a plough share, and an iron axe. Burials from the period contained other objects such as a sword, spears, pagan brooches, and a knife. A number of buildings have been discovered, some of them substantial; one or two had wooden floors, a sign of some wealth at a time when most people made do with beaten earth. There were a number of settlements in the area that is now St Neots. One of these would have been the early Priory which may not have been on the riverside site of the later, Norman, Priory. The Angles and Saxons divided the country into administrative areas called hundreds. St Neots and Eynesbury were in the Toseland Hundred while Eaton was in the Barford Hundred. Following St Augustine's mission to Britain in 597, a mother church was built in Eaton to serve as a focus for a large area on the west bank of the Great Ouse, while at Great Paxton on the east bank, another church served an area including St Neots and Eynesbury. Later in Saxon times Eynesbury built its own church. A little later, the first St Neots Priory was dedicated in 974, and the bones of St Neot brought from Cornwall as holy relics for the new foundation. The Vikings first brought their longships up the River Great Ouse as far as St Neots in the late 10th century and St Neot's bones were sent to Lincolnshire for safe-keeping, being restored again by 1020. The Danes seem not to have settled in large numbers in or near St Neots, certainly not displacing the Anglo-Saxons completely.  Norman and mediaeval history  Initial control of the area by the Normans was from Bedford and Huntingdon with the river forming the boundary between the two. There were two manors in Eynesbury in the Barony of Huntingdon, and another in Eaton in the Barony of Bedford. Around the year 1080, major changes were initiated in the affairs of the Priory. At the instance of Richard fitz Gilbert and his wife Rohese Giffard to whom the manor of Eynesbury had been given by William the Conqueror, it was refounded as a dependency of the abbey of Bec in Normandy, thus separating it from the Abbey at Ely. Anselm, Abbot of Bec and soon to be Archbishop of Canterbury, visited the town shortly afterwards and took away a small relic of St Neot At the hands of the de Clares, the Priory, which may have been much further west near the Foxbrook, was completely rebuilt near the river by 1110. On her husband's death, Rohais gave her entire manor to the Priory and its monks at the re- dedication ceremony in 1113. It consisted of a church with the bell tower, a refectory, a dormitory, a chapter house, a central cloister area, as well as kitchens, a cellarium for food storage and outbuildings including stables, storage barns, workshops and pigsties. The priory remains are very incomplete, but attempts have been made to draw a plan based on what has been found. Apart from foundations and column bases, other finds include glazed floor tiles, painted wall plaster, fragments of stained glass, and pieces of carved masonry. The gatehouse survived until 1814. Some idea of what it may have looked like can be seen by visiting Binham Priory in Norfolk. Remains of the Norman castle at Eaton Socon A castle was built on the riverbank at Eaton (modern Eaton Socon) around 1140, apparently without permission of the monarch. It was probably of timber construction and may never have been completed, but the earth mound still exists and can be seen from the path along the opposite bank. The castle was demolished about 15 years later by order of Henry II. St Neots Priory was now holding a weekly market, a right given by charter around 1130. The market stalls were set out next to the Priory, in the area where today's Market Square still stands. A wooden bridge was built to replace the old ford, and a system of tolls was set up. By the end of the 12th century, the infant town of St Neots was a busy, prosperous place; almost a twin of the older settlement at Eynesbury. Around 1200, a new parish church was built in St Neots, possibly on the site of the original Priory, while had moved to a stone structure by the river to the north of the Market. Meanwhile, Eynesbury and Eaton Socon parish churches were rebuilt around the same time. The Priory became highly respected and extremely wealthy during this period, and the settlements of Eynesbury, St Neots, and Eaton Socon were prosperous too. This was partly due to the presence of the Priory and partly due to river and road traffic, especially along the Great North Road between London and central England. There was a small settlement called Sudbury based around the manor owned by the de Sudbury family (now Crosshall, part of Eaton Ford). The manor fell into disrepair in the early 14th century, but traces of the old fields still remain. These are typical of the open field system of that time, the town was surrounded by field strips and areas of common land, with water meadows and reed beds close to the river. These would have provided most of the food and materials necessary for the local population, timber would have been taken from the abundant woodland on the higher ground. Because the Priory was an 'alien house', that is, it belonged to a French order, it suffered from intermittent confiscations during the Hundred Years' War from 1338, as well as the payment of an annual fee which amounted to over half their annual income. In addition, it was ostracised by pilgrims and travellers cutting off another source of income. The Black Death struck St Neots in 1348, spreading very quickly and resulting in the deaths of about 35% of the population. In 1378, only seven monks remained in the Priory, and three of these returned to France. An English Prior was appointed in 1409 and the French connection finally broken. By the 1340s, the Priory was reported to be semi-derelict with lax discipline, but by 1507, it seems that it had been repaired and was once again thriving. St Neots Parish Church St Neots parish church was rebuilt in the 15th century, as was the church at Eaton Socon. This last revival of gothic architecture, which left almost nothing of the previous church, was made possible by Edward IV's policy of reducing taxation on his returns from exile in Flanders in 1471. It resulted in the town having a uniformly Perpendicular building with a prominent 130 ft tower, built in the Somerset style, which is still visible from miles around. Like many churches of the period it was supported by a local gild, which had a chapel within the building and because of its size and grandeur, it became known as \\"the cathedral of Huntingdonshire\\". Eynesbury church had already been rebuilt in the 13th century. All three suffered from the depredations of government legislation when their interiors were shorn of their stone altars, rood screens and statuary as part of the Reformation agenda. Eaton Socon church suffered a severe fire in the 1930s and was rebuilt in the same style. 15th century building in St Neots A few non-ecclesiastical buildings remain from the late mediaeval period, though the timber frames were often covered by more recent \\"improvements\\". One of the best of these buildings was discovered and restored quite recently and is now a jewellery shop. It is pictured on the right.  Tudor period  Henry VIII became King in 1509, and when he severed the connection with the Roman Catholic Church, he dissolved and physically destroyed most of the country's monasteries. St Neots Priory was no exception and was forced to close in 1539, the remaining 12 monks being pensioned off. Eight years later, the buildings and land were sold while the manor was given to the King's daughter Elizabeth, later to become Queen Elizabeth I. In 1591, there were 879 people living in Eaton Socon; as Eynesbury and St Neots may both have been a similar size, this suggests a total population of at least 2,000. St Neots Grammar School was in existence by 1556 when the schoolmaster was a Mr Faucet. The Priory buildings fell into a state of disrepair, but were still at least partly standing in 1584. In 1588, a new bridge was built, mainly wooden but with masonry piers in the river. Possibly some of this stone was salvaged from the ruins of the Priory.  Stuart and Civil War period  The bridge mentioned above was replaced again, probably in 1617, but, this time, entirely in masonry. The bridge was clearly of great importance as it allowed river traffic to pass without hindrance, and also carried road traffic between the town and the Bedfordshire villages across the river. Other improvements in the same period included sluices downstream towards St Ives and works to make the river navigable upstream to Bedford. St Neots Manor passed from royal ownership under James I to Sir Sidney Montague. In the First Civil War, he supported the Royalist or Cavalier cause although his nephew, Edward, supported Parliament. As in most parts of the country, loyalties were mixed, but St Neots was firmly in Parliamentary hands and a detachment of Roundhead troops guarded the town. However, King Charles I passed through the town in 1645 and gathered willing recruits from local people. On 10 July 1648 during the Second Civil War, a small battle took place when a group of 300 Royalists camped in the Market Square overnight. They were surprised and defeated by a smaller group of Roundheads advancing across the bridge, most of them being taken prisoner. A detailed account of the battle can be found in the entry for Henry Rich, 1st Earl of Holland, the leader of the captured Royalist force. Many of the older buildings in St Neots and Eynesbury were constructed in the years following the Restoration of Charles II in 1660. There were 543 houses in the town in 1674 when records were taken for the Hearth Tax (though some of these may have been in nearby villages). Eynesbury Church was allowed to fall into disrepair during this period, until in 1684 the spire collapsed, causing serious and extensive damage. The building was repaired and the current tower built in 1687.  Restoration and the Victorian age  = Lords of the Manor = After the dissolution, Queen Elizabeth I became Lord of the manor of St Neots. James I, who succeeded her, passed the title to Sir Richard Lucy in 1620 who, in turn, sold it to Sidney Montagu in 1631, whose family subsequently became Earl of Sandwich and of Manchester. The Earls of Sandwich lived in Huntingdon and allowed the St Neots affairs to be handled by a bailiff, Robert Payne, whose son, Edward, succeeded him. The Lordship of the Manor passed in 1902 to the Rowley family who still hold it. The Rowleys first appear on the scene, however, in the 18th century at Upper Wintringham when they acquired the house formerly owned by the Payne family. Then in 1793, Owsley Rowley bought Priory Farm at the north end of Huntingdon Street from his father-in-law William King. He set about laying out the farm as parkland and, in 1798, he built a large house on it. Rowley's purchases of land, much of it to the east of the railway line, including Monks Hardwick Farm, the Mill at Little Paxton made him arguably the most powerful man in the town, long before the family became Lords of the manor. He was a JP and chairman of Quarter Sessions for 25 years. On his death in 1824, his son George William Rowley succeeded and acquired the advowson of St Neots in 1864. Owsley Rowley's third grandson, Charles Perceval Rowley, who lived at Wintringham, was responsible for ten of the stained glass windows in St Neots Parish church. The second son, George Dawson Rowley became famous as an explorer and ornithologist. Some of his collection of stuffed birds is now in the British Museum. He and his father died within hours of each other in 1878, to be succeeded by his only son George Fydell Rowley. = Turnpikes and Railways = By the 18th century, the desire to improve the roads resulted in the creation of turnpike trusts, authorised by Act of Parliament. In 1725, a trust was established to manage the Great North Road between Biggleswade and Alconbury. Another was established in 1772 to manage the road between St Neots and Cambridge. These and other road improvements meant more traveling and coaching inns, where horses could be changed, so that coaches could travel further and faster were built in Eaton Socon and in St Neots. By this means the journey from London to Edinburgh, a distance of more than 400 miles, could be achieved in eight days. At the height of stagecoach activity, some 20 coaches passed through Eaton Socon each day. In 1850, the railway came, in the form of the Great Northern Railway Company. The route taken lay to the east of the town, farthest away from the river and from Eaton Socon. George Williams Rowley had wanted it to run to the west of the town but, after a court action in which he failed, it ran just east of the east of the great house, for which the family was given ¬£8,000! The railway rapidly ousted the stagecoaches. Apart from long-distance trains that reduced the time of travel to Scotland to less than a day, there were soon excursions to holiday resorts such as Skegness, Cromer, and Great Yarmouth. By the 1890s, trippers were even going as far as Scarborough and Brighton. = From Church to Churches = The Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 had meant the restoration of the church. The so-called Clarendon Code granted to the Church of England many privileges including the removal of Dissenting ministers to a distance of five miles from any Anglican church. However, the first dissenting chapel was built at Hail Weston, and a Meeting House was established on the north side of the High Street in 1718. They were, by his time, known as Congregationalists. The chapel was enlarged for bigger congregations in 1889. Meanwhile, Baptists who broke away from the Congregationalists (for whom baptism had become optional) in 1800, establishing a chapel in New Street. Methodism started in St Neots as a result of a visit by John Wesley in 1772. The first chapel was built at the corner of Huntingdon Street in 1794. Other chapels built in the period include the Salvation Army citadel in 1891, and a chapel in New Street and one in East Street now converted for use by the Roman Catholic Church. By the time of the 1851 Census, there were as many Non-Conformists worshipping on Sundays as there were members of the Church of England. It was a time of religious revival which showed itself not only in the growth of new denominations but also in the revival of the parish church. In 1847, at a cost of over ¬£2,000, the church was refloored and repewed, with much stonework substantially repaired. New stained glass windows were put in between 1859 and 1902, largely paid for by C.P. Rowley. A new organ by George Holdich of London was installed in 1855. = Industry = The oldest forms of industry grew out of the needs of agriculture. Corn milling was practised at Duloe using a windmill and at Eaton Socon using water. Industrialisation proper began in St Neots as elsewhere in the 18th century. The most notable contribution of St Neots was in the field of paper making. In 1808 the Fourdrinier brothers invented a process by which paper could be made in a continuous roll and it was at St Neots Mill (in Little Paxton) that the process was first put into action. The machines were at first powered by water but subsequently by steam turbines. Brewing took on a more industrial character in the 18th century. James Paine acquired Foster's brewery in the Market Square in 1831. The Priory Brewery, on the site of the old Priory, which was owned by the Fowler family, was sold to John Day of Bedford in 1814. Day it was who demolished the Priory Gatehouse in order to improve access for his brewery drays. He also provided St Neots with its first street lamps. St. Neots also became famous for gas appliances. George Bower built a foundry for making gas fires, light fittings and even gas cookers. Unfortunately though he sold his appliances as far afield as South America; he was a poor businessman and went bankrupt. (The town was, essentially, a market town for all that. Its industries continued to supply farming and its cattle market was in use until the late 1980s. Meanwhile, from the 1960s, newer industries arrived to accompany the overspill developments from London.) By the late 20th century, the de-industrialisation which characterised much of Britain affected St Neots with the loss of Courtaulds (formerly Kayser Bondor), Samuel Jones, Gates' Hydraulics and several others. Paine's Brewery was sold and closed. Meanwhile, the Market Place was refurbished (and the largest Millennium celebrations in the county outside Cambridge occurred in December 1999. The by-pass which had been opened in 1985 provided an envelope for new housing growth between it and the railway; the Eynesbury floodplain was also filled with housing towards the river. It is estimated that the population of the town will be 40,000 by 2020.  Notes   References  * G.C.

Train 48 was based on the format of an Australian television program called Going Home. History The show was broadcast daily, and recorded the same day. It took place in a railway car of a GO Train on Lakeshore West line returning from Toronto to the suburb of Burlington, Ontario, and followed the lives of 12 daily commuters through their interactions. Although major plot lines were written in advance, much of the dialogue was improvised by the actors. The entire series was shot on a 64-foot replica of a GO Train Bombardier BiLevel Coach, which kept production costs to a minimum. The train setting allowed a basic construct where characters would share and act upon their opinions and views. The same-day recording allowed for comments on topical news stories to be introduced. The filming production was completed by 1:30 p.m. and edited by 5:00 p.m., later broadcast into regular time slots in different regions of Canada throughout the day (7:00 p.m. weeknights on Global in Toronto). It is estimated that each 30 minute episode cost $40,000 (Canadian) and had a typical audience of 200,000 to 300,000 viewers a night. The method of improvisation, developed by show runners Duncan McKenzie and Eric Lunsky was a hybrid of techniques used by Mike Leigh and Keith Johnstone. Actors worked from outline scripts of just a few lines per scene, and an extensive character bio which provided each actor with a background of events and attitudes which might affect the scene.http://www.blogto.com/film/2014/11/that_time_when_train_48_left_union_station/ The improvised format and quick turnaround enabled the inclusion of references to extremely current events, giving a heightened sense of realism and currency. For example, the 2003 North America blackout was mentioned the next day. The show typically dealt with fictional relationships, humour and the non-fictional topics mentioned were the cases of Scott Peterson, Karla Homolka, the SARS outbreak and different views about US President George W. Bush. Dilemmas and criticism When Train 48 debuted, product placement was an important aspect of the show for the Global Television Network. Characters were seen using Fido cell phones, and if someone was seen reading the newspaper, it was the National Post, a newspaper owned by CanWest, the parent company of Global Television. The show's producers argued that product placement was there to make the show seem more real. Later in the series, the use of product placement diminished, and the range of reading materials and products on the show became more diverse. During the production of the series between 2003 and 2004, four episodes were aired on Global Television Network during the week. However, in 2005, this was reduced to three. The series dealt with such controversial issues as the adoption of babies by gay couples, in vitro fertilization, single parent families, and euthanasia. A number of events occurred which would be unusual on a real commuter train, including the death of a passenger, a beating, a shooting, an escaped snake, a party, and sex in the train washroom. The producers received word of the show's cancellation several months ahead of time, allowing them to bring the stories to a conclusion. Throughout the series, viewers had frequently commented that the train seemed to be on a journey to nowhere. In response to this criticism, the final episode showed the train stopped, and showed, through the windows, the characters emerging from the train onto the platform at Burlington. This was the only time in the series that characters were ever seen outside the train. Cancellation The cancellation of the show was announced publicly on June 2, 2005 by series producer Cindy Wrong. She stated that the final episode would be shown on July 1. After the finale, re-runs of the last few episodes aired until the finale was shown again on September 2. The show was cancelled in order to make way for the launch of Entertainment Tonight Canada. Theme song The series theme song was entitled \\"Train goes\\" by Adam Crossley and 9 Point Landing.

Poslovni sistem Mercator d.d. is one of the largest business entities in Slovenia and the parent company of the Mercator Group. As the Mercator Group's controlling company, it has a double role: it manages its retail operations, and carries out corporate tasks for other Mercator Group companies. In addition to its domestic market of Slovenia, Mercator Group is also present in Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and North Macedonia. Mercator Group's core activity is fast-moving consumer goods retail in an extensive retail network spanning Slovenia, Serbia, Montenegro, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Mercator's story dates back to 1949 when the wholesale company ≈Ωivila Ljubljana, the predecessor of the present-day Poslovni sistem Mercator d.d., was founded. In the early days, Mercator sold the goods straight from the warehouse; today, it is among the most modernized retailers in the region. History =1949‚Äì2000= Mercator was founded in 1949 under the name \\"Ljubljana Groceries\\" (), and four years later it was given its current name, Mercator. The first director of the firm was Adolf \\"Adi\\" Osterc (1918‚Äì2014),Mekina, Borut. 2008. Miran Goslar, oƒçe Mercatorja.

Ferdreng ‚Äì nepoznano ≈æensko delovno tabori≈°ƒçe na Koƒçevskem. Siol.net (13 September). The company operated only in Slovenia until the 1990s, and later started opening retail stores in other countries in the Balkans, with future plans to spread on markets outside the territories of the former Yugoslavia. =2000‚Äì2014: Regional expansion= Mercator entered retail markets of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2000, Serbia in 2002, North Macedonia in 2005, and Montenegro in 2007. At the end of 2009, Mercator opened stores in Tirana, Albania, and Stara Zagora, Bulgaria. While also planning on opening seven other shopping centers in Bulgaria, Mercator considered exiting the Bulgarian market by 2013. In 2012, Mercator also planned to withdraw from the Albanian market; after which it closed the two stores located in the largest Albanian cities of Tirana and Durr√´s, in January 2013. =2014‚Äì2017: Agrokor's takeover= To pay off its debt, Slovenian shareholders agreed to Croatian Agrokor acquiring a 53.1% stake in Mercator in late June 2014, and additional 27.6% of the company shares in early September, 2014; leading to vast closure of Mercator stores in Croatia and Bosnia, and acquirement of nearly an equal amount of additional stores in Serbia. Due to the absence of a final decision from the Bosnian Competition Council, Konzum only in BiH was not obliged to sell or rent any of the retail stores inherited by merging with Mercator BiH (Mercator shopping centers and DP markets). Konzum is, in some parts of the country, gained almost a monopoly position. =2017‚Äìpresent = After the outbreak of the Agrokor debt crisis in 2017 and the subsequent corporate restructuring, 83 Konzum stores in Bosnia were rebranded as Mercator stores, while the other 173 stores the company owned continued to operate under the name Konzum. However, because of Konzum's debts, Mercator returned to Bosnia and Herzegovina in September 2017. It took over 83 out of Konzum's 258 stores. After that, Konzum lost its title of the biggest supermarket chain in Bosnia and Herzegovina. As of 31 December 2018, Mercator has 1,051 retail units, with most of the revenues coming from Slovenia (56.1%) and Serbia (32.6%). Operating divisions While Mercator's primary market remains in Slovenia, it is also operating its retail chain in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, and Montenegro. Poslovni sistem Mercator d.d. is the largest trading company in Slovenia. Including its franchise stores, it operates a total of 715 units (as at September 30, 2018). The company's core activity is retail of fast-moving consumer goods, while technical consumer goods (M Tehnika) and wholesale (Cash & Carry) are a separate business area. In addition, Mercator also operates two independent manufacturing companies in Slovenia ‚Äì Mercator‚ÄìEmba d.d., and Mercator IP d.o.o. ‚Äì and it owns a self- service gas station company Maxen. In Slovenia, Mercator is recognized as a national player, owing to the extent of its retail network and convenient location of its stores. Customers also appreciate the breadth of Mercator's offer and the largest offer of local products. Popularity and the widespread use of the Pika customer loyalty card that is used by virtually every Slovenian household demonstrate that Mercator has a special place with Slovenian consumers. In addition to having the longest-standing tradition, Mercator is in many ways also a leader in terms of new developments. It was the first fast-moving goods retailer in Slovenia to operate an online store, the first one to offer self-checkout, the first one to offer shopping with mobile applications M Scan and M Scan Mobile, and it was the first retailer to develop a mobile platform called \\"Moj M\\" that also includes a mobile wallet \\"M Pay\\". Mercator is constantly introducing innovative solutions to its services and its offer, gradually changing and upgrading them, and adjusting them to the actual needs of the customers, while replacing others with new ones. Thus, it is improving both the shopping experience and its efficiency, so that it can offer the customers what they need and desire, and what represents added value for them. As a result, it is developing a store tailored to the customers. = In addition to Slovenia, Mercator operates as a local retailer in three other markets in the region. = = Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina = =Serbia= The first Mercator store was opened in Belgrade, in 2002. Today, the company has stores in many Serbian cities, including Belgrade and Novi Sad. An upscale supermarket in the basement of the Beograƒëanka skyscraper was originally branded Mercator Premium, but it was rebranded to Idea after Agrokor's acquisition of Mercator. Some of the chain's other stores in Serbia are named Roda. As of 31 December 2018, Mercator has 321 retail stores in Serbia. = Montenegro = Mercator entered Montenegro's market in 2007. As of 2018, the retail chain is running stores under the Idea banner. As of 31 December 2018, Mercator has 117 retail stores in Montenegro. =Bosnia and Herzegovina= Mercator opened the first store in Sarajevo, in 2000, and later several additional hypermarkets, supermarkets, and convenience stores in Bosnia and Herzegovina. All Mercator BH stores were transferred to Konzum in late 2014. However all 83 Mercator BH stores were retransferred from Konzum to Mercator during September 2017. As of 31 December 2018, Mercator has 77 retail stores in Bosnia and Herzegovina, of which 50 are markets, 16 supermarkets and 11 hypermarkets. =Croatia= Mercator opened the first store in Pula, in 2000; following with establishment of over 40 hypermarkets and supermarkets, and many more convenience stores in Croatia. Following Agrokor's acquisition of Mercator, most stores were leased out to Konzum or closed down in late 2014, while the company Mercator H d.o.o., Croatia, has retained its real estate management operations.

She was inducted into the Arkansas Aviation Historical Society's Hall of Fame in 1980. Birth and education Louise McPhetridge was born in Bentonville, Arkansas and attended Bentonville public schools. McPhetridge attended the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, Arkansas from 1921 to 1926 and studied as a journalism, physical education, and pre-medical major. Aviation In 1926, McPhetridge was working for the J.H.J. Turner Coal Co. where one of her main customers was the Travel Air Corporation in Wichita, Kansas, owned by Walter Beech. Beech liked McPhetridge and offered her a job as a sales representative in San Francisco, California, which she accepted. Her salary included free pilot's lessons, and she earned her pilot's certificate in 1928. She was the first female pilot to be licensed by the state of Ohio. Marriage McPhetridge met Herbert von Thaden, who was a United States Army Signal Corps pilot and engineer who worked on developing the first American all-metal aircraft, the Thaden T-2. McPhetridge and von Thaden were married in San Francisco on June 19, 1928. By 1929, Louise Thaden had become only the fourth woman to hold a transport pilot rating. Records Thaden rapidly became a major figure in the aviation world and set many world performance records and won many major flying events. In 1929, she became the first pilot to hold the women's altitude, endurance and speed records in light planes simultaneously. Thaden set the women's altitude record in December 1928 with a mark of 20,260 feet. In March 1929, she set the women's endurance record with a flight of 22 hours, 3 minutes, 12 seconds. Women were barred from air racing from 1930 to 1935, due to sexism. Women's Air Derby Thaden was a friend and rival of pioneer aviators Amelia Earhart, Pancho Barnes, Opal Kunz, and Blanche Noyes. Thaden defeated her colleagues in the first Women's Air Derby, also known as the Powder Puff Derby, in 1929. The Air Derby was a transcontinental race from Santa Monica, California to Cleveland, Ohio, which was the site of the National Air Races that year. It took place from August 13‚Äì20, 1929. Twenty women were entered in the race. Marvel Crosson was killed. Earhart damaged her aircraft at Yuma, Arizona, Barnes became lost and flew into Mexico and damaged her plane attempting to get back on course, and Noyes suffered an in-flight fire over Texas.http://aerofiles.com/powderpuff.html Middle career In 1930, Thaden went to work as the public relations director of Pittsburgh Aviation Industries (which had recently purchased her husband's Thaden Metal Aircraft Company) and became the director of the Women's Division of the Penn School of Aeronautics. That same year, Thaden and Earhart participated in the founding of an international organization for women pilots called the Ninety-Nines. Thaden turned down the presidency of the organization but served as the treasurer and vice-president. The Ninety-Nine organization still exists. In 1991, astronaut Eileen Collins carried Thaden's flying helmet into space on the space shuttle to honor her achievements and the early women pioneers of flight. In 1935, Phoebe Omlie, another pioneer female aviator, asked Thaden to become a field representative for the National Air Marking Program. 1936 Bendix Trophy Race In 1936, Thaden won the Bendix Trophy Race in the first year women were allowed access to compete against men. She set a new world record of 14 hours, 55 minutes from New York City to Los Angeles, California. In her astonishing victory, she flew a Beech C17R Staggerwing biplane and defeated twin-engine planes specifically designed for racing. Laura Ingalls, another aviator, came in second by 45 minutes flying a Lockheed Orion. First prize was $4,500, and she also won the $2,500 prize for a woman finishing. Time magazine wrote on September 14, 1936: > To Pilots Thaden & Noyes the $7,000 prize money was far less gratifying than > the pleasure of beating the men.

Smilingly observed > Pilots Thaden and Noyes last week when they found they had won one of the > two most important events of the Races: \\"Well, that's a surprise! We > expected to be the cow's tail.\\" For her achievements Thaden won aviation's highest honor given to women, the Harmon Trophy. Aviation career Thaden teamed up with Frances Marsalis and set another endurance record by flying a Curtiss Thrush high-wing monoplane over Long Island, New York for 196 hours. The pair made seventy-eight air-to- air refueling maneuvers. Food and water were lowered to the two by means of a rope from another aircraft. The event gained national attention and the pair made a series of live radio broadcasts from the aircraft. In 1937, she became the National Secretary of the National Aeronautics Association. Just prior to her retirement, she returned to Beech Aircraft Corporation as a factory representative and demonstration pilot. Retirement Thaden retired from competition in 1938. She worked for a time with the Bureau of Air Commerce to promote the creation of airfields. She also wrote her memoirs, High, Wide and Frightened soon after her retirement. In addition to her memoirs, she wrote numerous newspaper and magazine articles dealing with aviation issues. Thaden said women were \\"innately better pilots than men.\\" The final chapter of her autobiography, \\"Noble Experiment,\\" omitted from the 1973 and 2004 reissues of the book, is a short story giving a dystopian vision of the use of women in combat. It gains particular pertinence in its implicit criticism of the strategic bombing theories of Giulio Douhet and William (\\"Billy\\") Mitchell. The Arkansas Aviation Historical Society selected Thaden in 1980 as one of five initial inductees in the Arkansas Aviation Hall of Fame. Death Thaden died of a heart attack at High Point, North Carolina on November 9, 1979.

He studied Philosophy at the Autonomous University of Barcelona and was also a member of the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia. He spent 18 months in prison after attending a 1962 miner's strike. He began writing poetry in 1967. He is one of the Nov√≠simos from Jose Mar√≠a Castellet. His poetic works until 1986 are collected in Memoria y deseo (\\"Memory and desire\\"). The same characteristic features of his poetry appear in his novels. Los mares del Sur, part of the Pepe Carvalho series, won the Planeta Award in 1979, bringing fame for both the writer and the fictional detective, who would later be portrayed in films, TV series and comic strips. In 1988, he wrote and published a children's book called, Escenas de la Literatura Universal y Retratos de Grandes Autores (English version as \\"Scenes from World Literature and Portraits of Greatest Authors\\"), which is illustrated by Willi Glasauer, and published by C√≠rculo de Lectores.

They raised their four children in Montreal. In 1925, Sam and his brother, Allan, built the family's first liquor distillery near Montreal. They later bought a distillery owned by the Seagram family and incorporated the name. The U.S. subsidiary of the Seagram Company Ltd. opened in 1933; Edgar Bronfman would later take charge of the subsidiary.Kandell, Jonathan (December 22, 2013). \\"Edgar M. Bronfman, Who Brought Elegance and Expansion to Seagram, Dies at 84\\". The New York Times. Bronfman had two older sisters: architect Phyllis Lambert, and Minda de Gunzburg, who married Baron Alain de Gunzburg (1925‚Äì2004), a great grandson of Joseph G√ºnzburg. Bronfman also had a younger brother, Charles Bronfman. The Bronfmans \\"kept a kosher home, and the children received religious schooling on weekends. But during the week Edgar and his younger brother, Charles, were among a handful of Jews sent to private Anglophone schools, where they attended chapel and ate pork.\\" Bronfman attended Selwyn House SchoolThe invisible thread that unites all Jews in Montreal, and Trinity College School in Port Hope, Ontario, Canada. He next attended Williams College, then transferred to McGill University, where he graduated from in 1951 with a bachelor's degree in commerce. Career =Seagram= Edgar M. Bronfman with his father, Sam Bronfman After graduating from McGill University with a B.A. degree, in 1951, he joined the family business, where he worked as an accounting clerk and apprentice taster. In 1953, he took over as head of the Seagram U.S. subsidiary, Joseph E. Seagram & Sons. He increased the range of products sold by the company, improved distribution, and expanded the number of countries in which Seagram's products were sold. In 1966, Cemp Investments, which managed the family's investments, bought 820,000 shares of MGM and, in 1969, Bronfman took over the chairmanship of MGM, albeit briefly. Following his father's death, in 1971, Bronfman took over as president, treasurer and director of Distillers Corporation-Seagram Ltd. His son, Edgar Jr., succeeded him as chief executive officer of the company in 1994. = World Jewish Congress = When former World Jewish Congress President Philip Klutznick stepped down in 1979, Bronfman was asked to take over as acting head of the organization, then was formally elected President by the Seventh Plenary Assembly, in January 1981. Together with his deputy, Israel Singer, Bronfman led the World Jewish Congress in becoming the preeminent international Jewish organization that it is today. Initiatives such as those seeking to help free Soviet Jewry; to expose Austrian President Kurt Waldheim's Nazi past; and to help victims of the Holocaust and their heirs to acquire compensation (including by Swiss banks); raised Bronfman's international profile during the 1980s and 1990s.  Initiatives  = Soviet Jewry = In 1983, Bronfman suggested that \\"American Jews should abandon their strongest weapon, the Jackson‚ÄìVanik amendment, as a sign of goodwill that challenges the Soviets to respond in kind.\\" After Mikhail Gorbachev's ascension in 1985, Bronfman's New York Times message began to resonate with the public. In early 1985, Bronfman secured an invitation to the Kremlin and on September 8‚Äì11, visited Moscow, becoming the first World Jewish Congress President to be formally received in Moscow by Soviet Officials. Carrying a note from Shimon Peres, Bronfman met with Gorbachev, and initiated talks of a Soviet Jewish airlift. It is said that Peres' note called on the Soviet Union to resume diplomatic relations with Israel. In a Washington Post profile a few months after the September trip, Bronfman laid out what he thought had been accomplished during his September meetings. He said, \\"There's going to be a buildup of pressure through the business community. The Russians know the Soviet Jewry issue is tied to trade ... My guess is that over a period of time, five to ten years, some of our goals will be achieved.\\" Author Gal Beckerman says in his When They Come For Us We'll Be Gone, \\"Bronfman had a business man's understanding of the Soviet Jewish issue. It was all a matter of negotiation, of calculating what the Russians really wanted and leveraging that against emigration.\\" In March 1987, Bronfman along with fellow delegates of the World Jewish Congress, flew to Moscow once again. Bronfman held three days of discussions with senior Soviet officials. Together, Bronfman and the World Jewish Congress delegates advocated for the freeing of the Jews living under Soviet rule. On June 25, 1982, Bronfman became the first representative of a Jewish organization to speak before the United Nations. Speaking before the Special Session on Disarmament, Bronfman said, \\"world peace cannot tolerate the denial of the legitimacy of Israel or any other nation-state ... [and the] charge that Zionism is racism is an abomination.\\" Bronfman's goals for the visit were threefold. In his book, The Making of a Jew, he explained: First, he called for the release of all so-called Prisoners of Zion, the Jews imprisoned for expressing a desire to emigrate to Israel. Bronfman also wanted freedom for Jews in the Soviet Union to practice their religion. Finally, he called for the freedom for Soviet Jews to learn Hebrew, which was forbidden at the time. A year later, in 1988, Bronfman returned to Moscow to meet with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze. This trip resulted in the Soviets promising to legalize the teaching of Hebrew in the Soviet Union and to establish a Jewish cultural center in Moscow. Bronfman said of this visit, \\"By their actions, they are indicating that they are eager to get the question of Jewish rights and emigration off the bargaining table. And it is actions, rather than simply words, that count.\\" Edgar M Bronfman and President George H. W. Bush = Kurt Waldheim = In 1986, during Bronfman's presidency, the World Jewish Congress accused Austrian President Kurt Waldheim of covering up his past connections to the Nazi Party. It was when Waldheim became a candidate for president that the World Jewish Congress first published material showing Waldheim's active duty in the German army during wartime. This evidence was later used to prove that Waldheim must have known about the deportation of Jews to concentration camps, though Waldheim's service as an Austrian in the German army cannot be considered a war crime. Waldheim had served as an intelligence officer in a unit of the army that participated in the transfer of Greek Jews to death camps. The allegations against Waldheim resulted in public embarrassment for the Austrian president. On May 5, 1987, Bronfman spoke to the World Jewish Congress saying Waldheim was \\"part and parcel of the Nazi killing machine\\". Waldheim subsequently filed a lawsuit against Bronfman, but dropped the suit shortly after due to a lack of evidence in his favor. According to Joel Bainerman, in 1991 he was appointed to the International Jewish Committee for Inter-religious Consultations to conduct official contacts between the Vatican and the State of Israel. Edgar M Bronfman and President Barack Obama = Swiss bank restitution = In the late 1990s, Bronfman championed the cause of restitution from Switzerland for Holocaust survivors. Bronfman began an initiative that led to the $1.25 billion settlement from Swiss banks. This settlement aimed to resolve claims \\"that they hoarded bank accounts opened by Jews who were murdered by the Nazis\\". The Swiss banks, the United States Government, and Jewish groups investigated unclaimed assets deposited by European Jews into Swiss banks before the Holocaust. Negotiations began in 1995 between the U.S. and Switzerland. The parties reached a settlement in August 1998, and signed the $1.25 billion settlement in January 1999. In exchange for the settlement money, both parties agreed to release the Swiss banks and government from any claims regarding the Holocaust. The settlement was officially approved on November 22, 2000, by Judge Edward R. Korman. = Israel = Bronfman was accused by another WJC official of \\"perfidy\\" when he wrote a letter to President Bush in mid-2003 urging Bush to pressure Israel to curb construction of its controversial West Bank separation barrier, co-signed by former Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger. Former Israeli prime minister Shimon Peres said in support of Bronfman, \\"Clearly, issues that are open for debate in Israel should be open for debate in the Jewish world.\\"  Resignation  Bronfman stepped down from his post as President on May 7, 2007, amid scandals and turmoil about Israel Singer. Bronfman's leadership is known for transforming the World Jewish Congress into the powerful organization it is today. As president, Bronfman is remembered most for his diplomacy with the Soviet Union in freeing Soviet Jews. At his memorial held in January 2014, Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said of Bronfman, \\"Edgar was never shy of pressing an issue in the face of injustice,\\" as she spoke about the many causes he championed in his lifetime. Personal life =Marriages and children= Bronfman was married five times (twice to his third wife). * Ann Margaret Loeb (1932‚Äì2011). In 1953, he married Loeb, a Jewish-American banking heiress. Loeb was the daughter of John Langeloth Loeb Sr. (a Wall Street investment banker whose company‚Äì which he had co-founded with his father ‚Äìwas a predecessor of Shearson Lehman/American Express), and Frances Lehman (a scion of the Lehman Brothers banking firm). They divorced in 1973. They had five children: ** Samuel Bronfman II ‚Äì On August 9, 1975, Samuel was abducted in New York. He was held for more than a week when his father personally paid a $2.3 million ransom. He was later rescued by the FBI and New York City police from a Brooklyn apartment where he was found with his hands bound and his eyes and mouth covered with adhesive tape. The captors, both natives of Ireland, former limousine operator, Dominic Byrne, and his neighbor, former fireman Mel Patrick Lynch‚Äì \\"who claimed that he and whisky heir Samuel Bronfman were homosexual lovers,\\" and \\"claimed that Bronfman's nine-day disappearance in August 1975 was a hoax abduction engineered by the 23-year- old whisky heir himself\\" ‚Äìwere acquitted of kidnapping, but convicted of extortion charges and spent several years in prison.Newman, Peter C.

In 1975, he married Webb, then 25, who converted to Judaism and is the daughter of Barry and Eileen Webb, proprietors of an Essex country pub, Ye Old Nosebag. Webb and Bronfman divorced in 1983 and were later remarried, but again divorced. (\\"After the second divorce, she began a brief but tempestuous affair with Lorenzo Ricciardi [spouse of Mirella Ricciardi], an Italian filmmaker in his 60s. He was arrested in 1990 for trying to kill her.\\" In 2007, Webb married English actor Nigel Havers.)

Bronfman was quoted stating, \\"I think it's a cult.\\" In 2018, Raniere, then daughter Clare and her long-time mentor NXIVM president Nancy Salzman, among others, were arrested on federal charges in connection with NXIVM. In September 2018, daughter Sara was named the defendant in a 2018 class-action suit regarding her NXIVM activities. Death Bronfman died on December 21, 2013 at his home in Manhattan. He was 84. Bronfman was survived by his widow, Aronson, seven children, 24 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren at the time of his death.Survivors Philanthropy Bronfman at the founding of Hillel of Uruguay Bronfman was a philanthropist who gave large amounts of money to Jewish causes, including Hillel: The Foundation for Jewish Campus Life, which he was credited with helping revive together with Hillel President Richard Joel in the 1990s. The Hillel at New York University is called The Edgar M. Bronfman Center for Jewish Student Life, known by students just as \\"Bronfman\\". Bronfman established the Bronfman Youth Fellowships in Israel, a leadership program for Jewish youth, and provided the funding for MyJewishLearning.com, a digital media entity that includes Kveller, a popular Jewish parenting site. His mother has a concert hall named after her in Montreal, the Saidye Bronfman Centre, and a building at McGill University is named after his father. Bronfman was also the Founder and President of The Samuel Bronfman Foundation, whose work is informed by these four principles: \\"Jewish renaissance is grounded in Jewish learning, Jewish youth shape the future of the Jewish people, vibrant Jewish communities are open and inclusive, and that all Jews are a single family.\\" Major points of focus for The Samuel Bronfman Foundation are pluralism, intermarriage, community engagement ‚Äì especially youth ‚Äì and making Jewish knowledge accessible to Jews of all backgrounds. It is known for its work with the following grantees: Edgar M. Bronfman meets with Hillel Students * In 1987, Bronfman founded The Bronfman Youth Fellowships in Israel, a network of 1,000 young Jews from Israel and North America that includes some of today's most inspiring Jewish writers, thinkers and leaders. The Bronfman Youth Fellowships tap future influencers at a formative point in their lives, their final year of high school, and immerses them in an intensive exploration of Jewish text study, pluralism and social responsibility. The Fellowship has been called \\"a new kind of yeshiva and a modern house of study.\\" * Hillel: The Foundation for Jewish Campus Life, which is the largest Jewish campus organization in the world, engaging Jewish students globally in religious, cultural, artistic, and community-service activities. Hillel's mission is \\"to enrich the lives of Jewish undergraduate and graduate students so that they may enrich the Jewish people and the world\\". * MyJewishLearning.com, which is the leading transdenominational website of Jewish information and education, offering articles and resources on all aspects of Judaism and Jewish life, along with Kveller, a Jewish parenting website that is a project of MyJewishLearning.com. In April 2012, Bronfman joined the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Giving Pledge, a long-term charitable initiative that aims to inspire conversations about philanthropy and increase charitable giving in the United States. Bronfman and 12 others joined the 68 billionaires who had already signed the giving pledge. Following his death in 2013, Jewish news outlets called Bronfman a \\"prince of his people,\\" for his unique combination of lineage, intrigue, and devotion to the Jewish people through learning and philanthropy. Through his Jewish philanthropy, Bronfman became known for his unique approach to Jewish life. A proud Jew who publicly stated his disbelief in God, Bronfman developed his own understanding of Judaism, as he learned Jewish texts and traditions both in his personal life and in his work at The Samuel Bronfman Foundation. In an article, journalist Ami Eden writes about Bronfman, who chose to incorporate meaningful Jewish traditions into his life, all the while continuing to educate himself about the religion until his final days. Bronfman also promoted the idea that Jewish organizations needed to stop using fear as a selling point, but rather encourage ordinary Jews to take a deeper interest in the substantive heritage they have been born to. Specifically, while much of the American Jewish community saw intermarriage as an epidemic to be curbed, Bronfman considered the trend an opportunity for Jews to learn further with their non-Jewish partners. Awards Edgar M. Bronfman received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Bill Clinton in 1999 In 1986 Bronfman was honored with the Chevalier de la L√©gion d'honneur (Legion of Honour), from the Government of France.

Plot summary  Set in present-day Toronto, Ontario, the novel is about three women and their history with old friend and nemesis, Zenia. Roz, Charis, and Tony meet once a month in a restaurant to share a meal decades after Zenia betrayed them and interferes with their romantic relationships. During one outing they spot Zenia, who they thought to be long- dead since their university days. The plot then travels back in time to explain how Zenia stole, one by one, their respective partners. The novel alternates between the present and the past through flashbacks, in the third person perspective of Tony, Charis and Roz. Zenia gives each woman a different version of her biography, tailor-made to insinuate herself into their lives. No one version of Zenia is the truth, and the reader knows no more than the characters. Their betrayals by Zenia are what initially bring the three together as friends and bind their lives together irrevocably - their monthly luncheons begin after her funeral. In the present-day, Roz, Charis and Tony each individually confront Zenia in a Toronto hotel room, where she tells each of them that the men they'd been with got what they deserved. She explains various versions of her earlier staged death, each as implausible as the accounts of her life. Themes The novel, like many other works by Atwood, deals with power struggles between men and women, while also being a meditation on the nature of female friendship, power and trust. Zenia's character can be read as either the ultimate self-empowered woman - a traitor who abuses sisterhood - or a self-interested mercenary who cunningly uses the \\"war between the sexes\\" to further her own interests. One interpretation posits Zenia as a kind of guardian angel to the women, saving them from unworthy men. This proposition comes as the conclusion of Atwood's later short story, \\"I Dream of Zenia with the Bright Red Teeth\\", which features the same characters. Canadian literary critic Brian Busby wrote in his book Character Parts: Who's Really Who in Canlit that the character of Zenia was based on journalist Barbara Amiel.Brian Busby, Character Parts: Who's Really Who in Canlit, Toronto: Knopf, 2003, p. 280\\\\. .  Film adaptation  A film adaptation of The Robber Bride, starring Mary-Louise Parker as Zenia, Wendy Crewson as Roz, Greg Bryk as Henry, Shawn Doyle as John, Susan Lynch as Charis, Amanda Root as Tony, Tatiana Maslany as Augusta and Brandon Firla as West, aired on CBC Television in January 2007 and the Oxygen Network in March 2007. The adaptation altered the plotline, choosing not to show Roz, Tony and Charis' childhood flashbacks and adding several new characters. In addition, Augusta is taken by Zenia and the Toxique has been changed to Absinthe. Sequel In 2014, Atwood published the short story \\"I Dream of Zenia with the Bright Red Teeth\\", which revisits Roz, Tony and Charis in the present day, when Charis believes that her new pet dog Ouida is possessed by the spirit of Zenia. Originally published by the Canadian magazine The Walrus, the story also appears in her 2014 short story collection Stone Mattress.\\"Stone Mattress review ‚Äì Margaret Atwood's new collection of short stories\\".

Erogenous zones are located all over the human body, but the sensitivity of each varies, and depends on concentrations of nerve endings that can provide pleasurable sensations when stimulated. The touching of another person's erogenous zone is regarded as an act of physical intimacy. Whether a person finds stimulation in these areas to be pleasurable or objectionable depends on a range of factors, including their level of arousal, the circumstances in which it takes place, the cultural context, the nature of the relationship between the partners, and the partners' personal histories. Erogenous zones may be classified by the type of sexual response that they generate. Many people are gently aroused when their eyelids, eyebrows, temples, shoulders, hands, arms and hair are subtly touched. Gently touching or stroking of these zones stimulates a partner during foreplay and increases the arousal level. Also, the gentle massage or stroke of the abdominal area along with kissing or simply touching the navel can be a type of stimulation.  Classification  = Specific zones = Specific zones are associated with sexual response, and include the lips and nipples in addition to areas of the genitals, notably the foreskin and corona of the glans penis, clitoris and rest of the vulva, and perianal skin. The rete ridges of the epithelium are well-formed and more of the nerves are close to the external surface of the skin than in normal-haired skin. These zones have a high density of innervation, and may have an efficiency of wound healing and a capacity to stimulate generalized cerebral arousal. = Nonspecific zones = In these zones, the skin is similar to normal-haired skin and has the normal high density of nerves and hair follicles. These areas include the sides and back of the neck, the inner arms, the axillae (armpits) and sides of the thorax (chest). An exaggerated tickle and anticipatory response are responsible for the heightened sensual response.  Genitals  = Male = Males can be aroused by stimulation to the sides of the glans and penis, upper side of the glans, the foreskin, the front side of the scrotum, the skin between the scrotum and anus perineum, and around the anus. The prostate gland may be stimulated from inside the rectum, such as by anal sex, or by applying pressure on the base of the perineum near the anus. (Last updated/reviewed on 2008-03-28) Men who report the sensation of prostate stimulation often give descriptions similar to females' accounts of G-spot stimulation. The foreskin, which carries the highly innervated ridged band and lower frenular delta, has mucocutaneous end-organs extending from the distal margin to the point where hairy skin starts.cirp.org The thin dermis and minimal subcutaneous tissue results in closely set nerve networks. Vater-Pacini corpuscles are present. The mucocutaneous end-organs are formed after birth, with few in newborn infants and many well-organized endings in adults. Cold and Taylor state in 1999 that the foreskin is primary erogenous tissue. Alanis and Lucidi in 2004 describe this as speculative and unproven. = Female = Parts of the vulva, especially the clitoris, are erogenous zones. While the vagina is not especially sensitive as a whole, its lower third (the area close to the entrance) has concentrations of the nerve endings that can provide pleasurable sensations during sexual activity when stimulated; this is also called the anterior wall of the vagina or the outer one-third of the vagina, and it contains the majority of the vaginal nerve endings, making it more sensitive to touch than the inner two-thirds of the vaginal barrel. Within the anterior wall of the vagina, there is a patch of ribbed rough tissue which has a texture that is sometimes described as similar to the palate (the roof of a mouth) or a raspberry, and may feel spongy when a woman is sexually aroused. This is the urethral sponge, which may also be the location of an area that some women report is an erogenous zone; this is sometimes called the G-spot. When stimulated, it may lead to sexual arousal, an orgasm, or female ejaculation. The existence of the G-spot and whether or not it is a distinct structure is debated among researchers, as reports of its location vary from woman to woman, it appears to be nonexistent in some women, and scientists commonly believe that it is an extension of the clitoris.See page 98 for the 2009 King's College London's findings on the G-spot and page 145 for ultrasound/physiological material with regard to the G-spot. Head =Mouth= The lips and tongue are sensitive and can be stimulated by kissing and licking. Biting at the lip can also provide stimulus. =Neck= The neck, clavicle area and the back of the neck are very sensitive in both males and females, which can be stimulated by licking, kissing or light caressing. Some people also like being bitten gently in these areas, often to the point that a \\"hickey\\", or \\"love-bite\\" is formed. =Ears= Some people find whispering or breathing softly in the ear to be pleasurable and relaxing, as well as licking, biting, caressing and/or kissing it especially the area of and behind the earlobe.  Torso  = Chest = The areola and nipple contain Golgi- Mazzoni, Vater-Pacini and genital corpuscles. No Meissner's corpuscles and few organized nerve endings are present. There are concentrations of nerve tissue in the area of ducts and masses of smooth muscle. The hair surrounding the areola adds additional sensory tissue. The mass of smooth muscle and glandular-duct tissue in the nipple and areola block the development of normal dermal nerve networks which are present in other erogenous regions and the development of special end organs. The entire breast has a network of nerve endings, and it has the same number of nerve endings no matter how large the breast is, so that larger breasts may need more stimulation than smaller ones. Intense nipple stimulation may result in a surge in the production of oxytocin and prolactin which could have a significant effect on the individual's genitals, even to the point that some people of both sexes can achieve orgasm through nipple stimulation alone. Having the chest, breasts and nipples stimulated manually (hands), digitally (fingers, toes) and/or orally (mouth, lips, teeth, tongue) is a pleasurable experience for many people of both sexes. =Abdomen and navel= Many people find stimulation (kissing, biting, scratching, tickling, caressing) of the abdomen to be pleasurable, especially close to the pubic region. It can cause strong arousal in men and women, in some even stronger than stimulation of the genitals. The navel is one of the many erogenous zones that has heightened sensitivity.A celebration of sex - Douglas E. Rosenau - Chapter 3 - Your Erogenous Zones . In a 1982 study of eroticism in dress entitled \\"Skin to Skin\\", Prudence Glynn claimed that the waist symbolized virginity and that it was the first place that a man would touch a woman \\"when indicating more than a formal courtesy\\". The navel and the region below when touched by the finger or the tip of the tongue result in the production of erotic sensations.Touch Me There!: A Hands-On Guide to Your Orgasmic Hot Spots - Yvonne K. Fulbright. Madonna has told in an interview to the SPIN magazine (May 1985 issue), \\"When I stick my finger in my belly button, I feel a nerve in the center of my body shoot up my spine.\\"Confessions of a Madonna - May 1985 =Sacrum= The sacrum, the triangular bone located near the base of the spine, is also an erogenous zone.  Arms  The skin of the arms, and specifically the softer skin of the inner arms and across the creased mid-arm bend covering the ventral side of the elbow, are highly sensitive to manual or oral stimulation. Caressing with fingers or tongue, more vigorous kneading, and butterfly kissing can initiate arousal and, in some cases, induce clitoral/vaginal orgasm or penile ejaculation without direct contact with the latter areas. The mid-arm bend is especially sensitive due to the thinner skin found there, which makes nerve endings more accessible. Arm sensitivity may be reduced or concentrated to a more narrow range by excessive muscularity or obesity on the one hand, or transformed to uncomfortable tenderness by excessive thinness on the other. Armpits Some consider the armpits to be an erogenous zone, despite the similarity of the axillae (armpits) to normal-haired skin in both the density of nerves and hair follicles. Exaggerated or anticipated digital (fingers, toes) or oral (mouth, lips, tongue) stimulation is believed to be responsible for the heightened sensual response. If pheromones exist for humans, they would likely be secreted by a mixture of liquid from the apocrine glands with other organic compounds in the body. George Preti, an organic chemist at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia and Winnefred Cutler of the University of Pennsylvania's psychology department, discovered that women with irregular menstrual cycles became regular when exposed to male underarm extracts.Looking for love potion number nine, Cathryn M. Delude, The Boston Globe, September 2, 2003. They hypothesized that the only explanation was that underarms contain pheromones, as there was no other explanation for the effects, which mirrored how pheromones affect other mammals. Fingers The fingertips have many nerves and are responsive to very light touches, like the brushing of a tongue, light fingernail scratching or teeth stroking. The sides of the fingers are somewhat less sensitive and more ticklish. Both light and firmer touches work well at the junction of the fingers. Human fingertips are the second-most sensitive parts of the body, after the tongue.  Legs  The thighs can be sensitive to touch. An exaggerated tickle on the back of the legs and knees can also be sensitive for some. Feet and toes Because of the concentration of nerve endings in the sole and digits of the human foot‚Äîand possibly due to the close proximity between the area of the brain dealing with tactile sensations from the feet and the area dealing with sensations from the genitals‚Äîthe sensations produced by both the licking of the feet and sucking of toes can be pleasurable to some people. Similarly, massaging the sole of the foot can also produce stimulation. Many people are extremely ticklish in the foot area, especially on the soles.

He was assistant director of the Helsinki City Theatre from 1975 to 1982, and a professor at the Helsinki Theatre Academy from 1981 to 1988, being its rector from 1982 to 1985. Turkka influenced a whole generation of Finnish actors, and created a recognisable style of acting. Turkka died after a long illness on 22 July 2016, aged 74.Provocative director Turkka dies at 74  Technique  The method was to progressively search for a mental borderline state by psychic and physical exertion, and the result was frequently an acting performance characterised by actors shaking uncontrollably and spewing spit and snot and other bodily fluids around them. Some likened the method to brainwashing, or to those of religious cults. In 1987 the government had cause to remove him from his post as rector of the Helsinki School of Drama, when a group of his students held a performance at a theater symposium held in the city of Oulu. The organizers had specifically requested that the group should present something \\"shocking\\" so that there would be a bit of fuel for late night discussions at the bar. However the young students overshot expectations by staging a performance art piece in which they cut themselves to bleed, smeared each other with excrement, and crucified and whipped one of their number. The group, called \\"Jumalan Teatteri\\" (The Theatre of God) in a direct reference to Antonin Artaud, also hurled excrement at the audience, resulting in well-publicised laundry bills and court cases for the recompense for same. When the Finnish Minister of Culture appointed Maija-Liisa Marton to follow him as headmaster, the whole student body occupied and barricaded the school building with desks and chairs, refusing to \\"give it up\\". Several actors have written books which describe their experiences with him, either as students or actors. Literary works *Aiheita (1982; J. H.

It is located in Le Bec Hellouin, Normandy, France, and was the most influential abbey of the 12th-century Anglo-Norman kingdom.C. Warren Hollister, Henry I (Yale English Monarchs) 2001:16. Like all abbeys, Bec maintained annals of the house but uniquely its first abbots also received individual biographies, brought together by the monk of Bec, Milo Crispin. Because of the abbey's cross-Channel influence, these hagiographic lives sometimes disclose historical information of more than local importance.Seal Abbaye du Bec. Name \\"Bec\\" is the name of the stream running through the abbey, Old Norse bekkr, in English place or river names Beck. First foundation \\"Herlwin Building His First Church\\", from E.M. Wilmot-Buxton's 1915 Anselm. West side of the Tour Saint-Nicolas, between the ancient pottery to its left and the monks' residential building to its right The abbey was founded in 1034 by Saint Herluin, whose life was written by Gilbert Crispin, Abbot of Westminster, formerly of Bec, and collated with three other lives by Milo Crispin. Abbey construction began in 1034 and continued through 1035. Further lands were added through 1040.Vaughn. Anselm of Bec and Robert Meulan: the Innocence of Doves and the Wisdom of the Serpent, p. 21. Saint Herluin was a Norman knight who in about 1031 left the court of Gilbert, Count of Brionne, to devote himself to a life of religion: the commune of Le Bec Hellouin preserves his name. One hundred and thirty-six monks made their profession while Herluin was in charge.Adolphe-Andr√© Por√©e, Histoire de l'abbaye du Bec, Vol. 1, p. 131, note 1 & Appendix no 1. With the arrival of Lanfranc of Pavia, Bec became a focus of 11th century intellectual life. Lanfranc, who was already famous for his lectures at Avranches, came to teach as prior and master of the monastic school, but left in 1062, to become abbot of St. Stephen's Abbey, Caen, and later Archbishop of Canterbury. He was followed as abbot by Anselm, also later an Archbishop of Canterbury, as was the fifth abbot, Theobald of Bec. Many distinguished ecclesiastics, probably including the future Pope Alexander II and Saint Ivo of Chartres, were educated in the school at Bec. The life of the founder (Vita Herluini) was written by Gilbert Crispin. Archbishop Lanfranc also wrote a Chronicon Beccense of the life of Herlui. Milo Crispin's biography of the first four abbots was published at Paris in 1648.1 . The followers of William the Conqueror supported the abbey, enriching it with extensive properties in England. Bec also owned and managed St Neots Priory as well as a number of other British foundations, including Goldcliff Priory in Monmouthshire founded in 1113 by Robert de Chandos. The village of Tooting Bec, now a London suburb, is so named because the abbey owned the land. Bec Abbey was the original burial place of the Empress Matilda, whose bones were later transferred to Rouen Cathedral. Bec Abbey was damaged during the Wars of Religion and left a ruin in the French Revolution but the 15th-century St. Nicholas Tower (') from the medieval monastery is still standing.1 . Second foundation In 1948 the site was re-settled as the Abbaye de Notre-Dame du Bec by Olivetan monks led by Dom Grammont, who effected some restorations. The abbey is known for its links with Anglicanism and has been visited by successive archbishops of Canterbury. The abbey library contains the John Graham Bishop deposit of 5,000 works concerning Anglicanism. Today the Abbey is probably best known for the pottery the monks produce.

Exhibited Dec. 2011 at the Big Bang exhibition Mus√©e des beaux-arts de Montr√©al Paul-√âmile Borduas (November 1, 1905 ‚Äì February 22, 1960) was a Qu√©becois artist known for his abstract paintings. He was the leader of the avant-garde Automatiste movement and the chief author of the Refus Global manifesto of 1948. Borduas had a profound impact on the development of the arts and of thought, both in the province of Quebec and in Canada.  Biography  Borduas was born on November the first, 1905, in Saint-Hilaire, Quebec (a small village 50 kilometers from Montr√©al). He was the fourth child of Magloire Borduas and √âva Perrault. As a child he engaged in bricolage - his first known artistic activity. He received five years of formal elementary school education, (which ended at the age of twelve) and some private lessons from a village resident.Gagnon, Fran√ßois-Marc. Paul-√âmile Borduas, Biographie critique et analyse de l'oeuvre, Fides: Montr√©al, 1978. Fortuitously, Borduas met Ozias Leduc in the winter of 1921-1922, and Leduc agreed to take the young artist under his wing. At the age of sixteen he became an apprentice to Ozias Leduc, who was a church painter and decorator. Leduc provided Borduas with a basic artistic training, teaching him how to restore and decorate churches. Leduc arranged for Borduas' instruction at the √âcole Technique, in 1919, in Sherbrooke, Qu√©bec. In 1923, assisted by a scholarship Leduc had secured for him, he enrolled in the √âcole des Beaux-Arts de Montr√©al, continuing to work for Leduc at the same time. He received prizes for his paintings at both of these institutions. Despite discord between Borduas and the school administration, he continued his studies at Leduc's urgings. Upon graduation in 1927 Borduas was hired by the Montr√©al Catholic School Board as a high school art teacher. In January 1929 he began studies at the Ateliers d'Art Sacr√© in Paris, which he left to pursue church decoration work of Rambucourt, in the Meuse Valley, with Pierre Dubois in April. He returned to Saint-Hilaire in June 1930 (his funds being depleted), began teaching part-time, and in 1933 returned to teaching high school for the Catholic School Board of Montr√©al. In 1937 Borduas began teaching at l'√âcole du Meuble. This was an important time in Borduas' life: ¬´by meeting young men of his own generation with the same tastes and the same need for action, he finally discovered a stimulating intellectual and social environment¬ª. In 1938 he encountered John Lyman, a Montr√©al painter and critic, at the first exhibition of one of Borduas' paintings. Lyman encouraged Borduas' involvement with the Contemporary Arts Society, and in January 1938 he was elected vice- president of this group. In 1941 he resumed painting after several years of study and teaching, during which time he and a group of students had met regularly to discuss recent trends in European art. His first abstract paintings date from this year, and in April 1942 he exhibited forty-five gouaches inspired by the abstract surrealism of Joan Mir√≥. He became increasingly involved with about a dozen of his students, and they became known collectively as the Automatistes for their attempts to paint with pure psychic automatism as per the writings of Andr√© Breton. In January 1946, the first group exhibit of Borduas and his students was held in New York City, followed in April by an exhibit in Montreal. This was the first exhibit by a group of abstract painters in Canada.Reid, Dennis (1988). A Concise History of Canadian Painting, Second Edition. Don Mills: Oxford University Press Canada p=228 A second Montreal exhibit followed in February‚ÄìMarch 1947. A critic, responding to this exhibit, coined the name \\"Automatists\\" for the group, after Borduas' painting Automatisme 1.47. Borduas wrote Refus Global (or \\"Total Refusal\\", anglicized) in late 1947- early 1948. It was disseminated in a folder that contained other Automatists' writings. This piece was originally intended to accompany an Automatist showing, however it was actually distributed alone. \\"Global Refusal\\" served as an important manifesto that advocated the separation of church and state in Quebec, especially for the arts. In it Borduas \\"denounces the forces of oppression that had made of Quebec a suffocating environment. hostile to both individual and collective creativity\\". > We foresee a future in which man is freed from useless chains, to realize a > plenitude of individual gifts, in necessary unpredictability, spontaneity > and resplendent anarchy. Until then, without surrender or rest, in community > of feeling with those who thirst for better life, without fear of set-backs, > in encouragement or persecution, we shall pursue in joy our overwhelming > need for liberation.Gagnon and Dennis Young. The Press of the Nova Scotia > College of Art and Design: Halifax, 1978.p.54 Four hundred copies of the manifesto went on sale August 9, 1948. Borduas was dismissed from l'√âcole du Meuble on September 2 as a direct result of his involvement in this social critique. Even those who had tired of the repressive Duplessis r√©gime, and advocated great social changes in Qu√©bec, were reluctant to back Borduas' thorough condemnation of the Catholic Church√âthier-Blais, Les Presses de l'Universit√© de Montr√©al, 1979--such a central influence on the French Canadian populace. Borduas was ostracized, he was unable to attain employment and this was necessarily problematic as he was a father. He decided to take matters into his own hands. Borduas produced another piece in his defence, ¬´Projections Lib√©rantes¬ª (¬´Liberating Projections¬ª), which he completed in February 1949.Gagnon and Dennis Young. The Press of the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design: Halifax, 1978. p.80-115 Unfortunately, this more moderate composition, which clearly communicated Borduas' intentions in releasing ¬´Refus Global¬ª, was not enthusiastically received by the public or the presses. However, despite early denouncements, the manifesto marked the beginning of profound social change in Quebec and signaled the dawn of the Quiet Revolution. In 1953 Borduas moved to New York, where he saw the works of Jackson Pollock, Franz Kline and Mark Rothko and began to use the palette knife to apply his paint. In 1955 he moved back to Paris where he died of a heart attack in 1960. In 1954, works by Borduas, along with those of B. C. Binning and Jean-Paul Riopelle represented Canada at the Venice Biennale. In 1955 he represented Canada at the 3rd Bienal de S√£o Paulo. In 1960 the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam gave him the posthumous exhibition, ¬´Borduas 1905‚Äì1960¬ª . In 1988 the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts gave him an enormous retrospective exhibition curated by Fran√ßois- Marc Gagnon. In May 2012 his painting Froissement Multicolore sold for $663,750 at auction, surpassing the artist's previous auction price record by $150,000.
