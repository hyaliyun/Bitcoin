Howie was born of four sisters and two brothers who include: Gertrude 'Kiki' Stange, Doris Stange, Frank Anthony Stange, Raymond Christopher Stange, Esther Madelyn Stange and Kathleen Leona Stange.

Howie Stange did not achieve significant fame or fortune during his lifetime: however, his music left a lasting impression on a generation of young listeners who were first being introduced to rock and roll music in the 1950s.

His musical talents certainly were passed down to his children, and at a very early age the boys; Frank, Howie, and Raymond, all began to play music. At a very young age, Howie learned the rudiments of playing the guitar from a neighbor, Herbert LaMontagne.June Coffey in an exclusive phone interview on July 24, 2014 Howie attended school at St. Stanislaus School in Meriden for elementary and grammar school. Born a left-hander, the school nuns felt that writing with the left hand was improper, so they would bind Howie's left hand so he couldn't use it, and forced him to write with his right hand. Howie would spend the rest of his life writing with his right hand, and performing all other tasks with his left.interview with Karen Stange, daughter of Howie Stange, October 20, 2014 Howie's mother, Mary Stange, would work at New Departure , and remained a dutiful wife, mother, and homemaker her entire life. Howie's father died in 1938 when Howie was at the young and impressionable age of 14. His father's death would have a profound impact on young Howie, and shape his life in many ways, from his personal relationships to his love of music. Life and Career (Youth 1938‚Äì1948) After Thomas died in 1938, Howie left school in pursuit of work after completing eighth grade in order to help support the family. Brothers Frank and Raymond did the same. Howie and his family moved into a fourth floor apartment on top of a grocery store in downtown Meriden. This spot became the neighborhood hangout, as each weekend, the Stange siblings and friends would play music at jam sessions. During these early years, Howie was already expressing exceptionally rare musical talent, and excelled at playing the piano. During the summer of 1940, and free piano was offered to Howie, with the caveat 'if you can get it into the apartment, it's yours.' The boys spent the better part of the afternoon with the window frame removed, hoisting this piano up to the fourth floor apartment on the corner of Cook Ave and Summer Street, above an Italian Restaurant. This musical collaboration amongst the brothers would remain for a lifetime; Frank and Raymond would often join Howie up on stage as well as in the studio. The Stange family musicians had an inauspicious start: Warren Sattler relates a story from 1939, where he competed at a local talent show hosted at a Meriden movie theater, resulted in pitting four-year-old Warren performing yodeling against the three teenage Stange boys performing country music. The young yodeler won out over the Stange family band. The local kids played the usual boyhood activities, such as playing football as part of the 'Acorn' gang, hanging out at Spencer's garage on Main Street, and attending events at the Meriden Boys Club. It was at the Boys Club that Howie took up boxing, a sport he would pursue in earnest after World War II. The start of World War II disrupted Howie's life and propelled him, like many in his generation, to enlist when he turned eighteen. He chose to sign up for the Coast Guard, the same service as his brother Frank. Stationed for two years on Long Island, New York, Howie's time was spent with beach patrols, inspections, training, and drills. It was during this period that Howie married his first love, Jane Webster, on July 15, 1943. Howie and the other men of his unit would let off steam by participating in Coast Guard boxing matches. Howie received a medical discharge from the Coast Guard on January 5, 1944 for chronic asthma.United States Coast Guard Personnel Records as secured by the Freedom of Information Act In 1944, Howie settled down with his new family, wife and soon to be two children. During the day Howie worked at New Departure in the guard shack, but his passion at the time was with boxing. Howie was a promising you bantamweight fighter with a strong left punch. He earned the nickname of 'Lefty' during this time which stuck with him for the remainder of his life. Howie was good friends and sparring partner to Joe Coffee. In late 1947 Joe broke his left hand in 2 places in a fight, ending his career. Howie took this as a sign that he too should find other pursuits, as Howie knew that an injury such as Joe suffered would end his musical aspirations. Village Playboys (1949‚Äì1955) It was during the late 1940s and early 1950s that Howie ventured forth and began his solo act playing at clubs and small venues. His strong vocals and aggressive piano playing style really took the local community by surprise. As his popularity grew, offers of playing in a band soon arrived. Howie's break would come in 1952, when Andy Calabrese, Harold 'Slim' Huntley and Gus French, came looking for a vocalist. The trio had heard of a singer and piano player named Howie Stange. Slim and Gus went in search of Howie to see if they could interest him in joining the band. The two went to visit Howie while he was living in a trailer behind the Greenwood Lodge. Howie did not need much convincing, as he desperately wanted to get out and play his music for the public. Shortly thereafter, Andy left to form his own very successful group, The Top Hatters, and Bob Guyette was recruited, and the Village Playboys were born. Gus played on the big bass, Slim on the rhythm guitar, Bob on the lead guitar, and Howie on the piano, mandolin, rhythm guitar, banjo, fiddle, or vocals, or a combination thereof. Over the next four years, the group would play constantly, mainly in Connecticut and Massachusetts, at any venue they could get booked in. Clubs, diners, halls, auditoriums, restaurants, and family gatherings all became home away from home for the Playboys. The band kept a grueling schedule, with Howie earning $12.00 a show and each of the bandmates $10.00. They would play hour and a half sets, and then help move off all the tables and chairs for dancing the rest of the evening. Over time Robert Kowalczyk, aka Bob 'Cat' Gibson (Bob would go on to play lead guitar for Bill Flagg), came in to replace Bob Guyette. At this point in time, the type of music being played by the group was very traditional country ballads in the vein of George Jones, Hank Snow and Roy Acuff. The talents Howie possessed were an extremely rare phenomena, especially considering he did not have any formal music training.Gus French in an exclusive phone interview on March 17, 2014, Maurice Corley in an exclusive phone interview on April 16, 2014 Howie had perfect pitch, and he could pick up any music by hearing it only once. Howie could play the piano, the Gibson flattop guitar, the fiddle, Gibson mandolin, the five string banjo, harmonica, and provide vocals. Howie was technically proficient, and played his instruments with clean, crisp breaks and a fast play style. He modeled his piano play after Chuck Berry and Jerry Lee Lewis,Marion Dickerman exclusive interview Ormond Beach, Florida on August 10, 2009 and his tenor voice was a beautiful cross of George JonesGus French in an exclusive phone interview on March 17, 2014, Rita Burgess in an exclusive phone interview on April 30, 2014 and Elvis Presley.Gus French in an exclusive phone interview on March 17, 2014, Rita Burgess in an exclusive phone interview on April 30, 2014 Howie's rendition of \\"Are You Lonesome To- Night?\\" is perhaps the finest example of Howie's vocal talents, and his play on the piano is unsurpassed on \\"This Old Bomb of Mine.\\" Playing at the Mountain View Lodge in 1956 to a packed house, the band performed \\"What Would You Do If Jesus Came to Your House\\" for the finale, and when done, the audience was completely silent, in awe of how strong the vocal performance was. Howie then turned back towards the bass player, Gus French, and said, \\"that is the biggest tribute they [the audience] could ever pay you.\\" Upon hearing this, the audience burst into applause. During this time, Howie struck up a friendship with the Sycz family in Newington, Connecticut. The Sycz's had built a sound studio in their basement, and Howie spent time recording in the studio, often being accompanied by a then teenage Jean Syck (whose later married name was Jean Perron). The Sycz family gave Howie a portable record cutting machine, which from now on accompanied Howie most places, and would serve as the vehicle that created the Howie Stange Music Catalogue. This catalogue is being hosted online at www.realgonedaddyrecords.com. Many of the venues where rough and tumble joints; for example, the Lake Besek Grill of Middlefield was also known as the 'Bucket of Blood.' It was at one such event that Howie showed just how feisty he could be. A bar patron stood up out of the audience while Howie was playing the piano and began shouting \\"you knocked out two of my brothers in the boxing ring, and now I'm going to kick your a**!\\" And with that, the patron came up onto the stage and up and over the piano, and took a mighty swing at Howie, who, without skipping a musical note, raised his left hand off the ivories and gave him a stout left hook right to the head, knocking him off the stage and into the floor speakers, leaving him unconscious. Howie continued right on playing. Another such memorable night happened at the Long Lane Farm School for Girls in Middletown. Being an all- girls school, and one with strict curfews, the students did not have much exposure to neither the opposite sex, nor the new type of music being played, rock and roll. The band played to a packed house, and by the end of the evening it had turned into a riot of screaming girls running to and fro. The Band barely escaped, fleeing in a Cadillac as dawn broke. Howie also possessed a great sense of humor, in one instance, as the set was winding down, an obviously drunk bar patron pulled a gun out and confronted one of the band members. Howie shouted from behind the piano \\"go ahead and take a swing at 'em, don't worry, he's too chicken to use it\\". At this point, the patron swung the gun around and pointed it right at Gus French. This distraction enabled others to jump in and subdue the man. In 1955 there was more transition with band members, with Slim Huntley joining the Jim Flaherty's Western Caravan, and Richard N. 'Moon' Burgess Sr. joining up with Howie. Others musicians joined: Pete Hazelwood, Leroy 'Shadow' Dontigney, and Maurice Corely. This new group called themselves the Valley Playboys. Rita Burgess recalled the good times: \\"it does bring back some good memory's Saturday night at the Shamrock Howie on the piano, Corley on lead guitar Moon on guitar and Shadow on drums. One night there was a fight and they took Leroy Dontigney, \\"Shadow,\\" drums and all, right out the door and he never stopped playing\\". The \\"Shadow\\" would earn his moniker as one minute he would be there, and the next moment gone. The advent of Moon and the other musicians allowed for a new style of music to emerge, with Moon playing his signature Martin guitar. This new combination of talent brought an entirely different sound to the group. The group was also being influenced by popular culture of the times, with rock and roll splashing all over new radio stations and television stations. A brand of music called Rockabilly was just starting to take off in popularity, and the group began to adopt these sounds. This type of music was being performed by the likes of such artists as Chuck Berry, Bill Flagg, and Elvis Presley. Jim Flaherty's Western Caravan (1956‚Äì1960) As the Playboys' popularity grew, in 1956 the group was offered a Saturday morning radio show at WMMW 1470 AM.Gus French in an exclusive phone interview on March 17, 2014, Marion Dickerman exclusive interview Ormond Beach, Florida on August 10, 2009 Howie hosted the show and would invite the Village Playboys and other local musicians to come in and play. This exposure at WMMW brought Howie to come into contact with Jim Flaherty. In 1956, Howie was invited to join the Jim Flaherty's Western Caravan, and Howie brought with him Gus French. This group, with manager and lead guitar player Jim Flaherty, would be a significant step-up for Howie from his previous band. Jim was a very popular DJ at WHAY in New Britain, Connecticut, a successful concert promoter, and manager of the popular Belmont Record Shop located on Washington Street in Hartford, Connecticut.\\"Connecticut Rocks\\" retrieved on January 1, 2014, www.collectorsfrenzy.com/details150392178617 Howie played with the Jim Flaherty's Western Caravan, providing lead vocals, and playing instruments as needed, with a particular emphasis on the banjo, piano, and fiddle. The group would tour tirelessly throughout New England during these years and became quite popular. This time in Howie's life was certainly the pinnacle of his commercial and musical career. A dedicated self-promoter, Jim Flaherty secured multiple recording contracts with A&R; man Morty Craft\\"Connecticut Rocks\\" retrieved on January 1, 2014, James T. Flaherty obituary Hartford Courant, June 27, 1977 in New York City from 1957 through 1960. The band began at Bell Studios as a studio band for other larger acts managed by Morty at the time. Morty was a hard-taskmaster, Gus French recalls \\"Morty would have us play for 12 hours plus, one day my fingers were bleeding we stayed at it for so long, we asked if we could take a break, Morty replied put some tape on 'em and keep playing.\\".interview with Gus French, March 17, 2014 The working relationship however soon evolved into actual productions by the band on the Indie labels of MELL, JENN, & Frankie. The band would go on to record at the Bell Sound Studios in New York City, with Morty Craft acting as producer. These recordings, beginning with \\"Real Gone Daddy\\" began to get much radio airtime throughout New England and put Howie and the band on the map. A total of 4 commercially produced 45's were released during this time. There was even a Howie Stange Fan Club, according to past President Mary Jane Papallo, who fell in love with the music after seeing Howie open for the Everly Brothers. On September 1, 1958 the band opened for the Wilburn Brothers and Johnny Cash at Lake Compounce in Bristol, Connecticut. As was typical of the practices in the music industry in those days, a song produced by a lesser known band would start to gain air time on the radio, the A&R; men would promote that song up to the bigger artists. This was the case with the bands rendition of \\"Are You Lonesome To-Night?\\" with vocals by Howie Stange. Howie's version of that song was passed along to Chet Atkins, RCA A&R; man, by Jim Flaherty at a DJ Convention in Nashville in November 1959. Chet was the A&R; man for Elvis at the time and passed this song along to Elvis for recording. Jim Flaherty had a close working relationship with Elvis's record labels, as letters, in the possession of Jim Flaherty's family, written by the labels in the 1950s attest to. Elvis would go on to send this song to the number 1 spot on the Billboard charts in 1960. Also, producers would 'doctor' the recordings to give them more of a 'commercial' appeal. This can be seen by the Morty Craft produced \\"Baby I'm Sorry\\" and \\"You Never Had It So Good\\" with vocals by Howie Stange.http://www.rockabillyhall.com/BillFlagg1.html These two songs were unlike anything produced by the band, and were entirely pop music productions, designed to draw in a larger audience. Dubbed over the original takes were harmonies by the Ray Charles Singers. Morty passed up Howie's particular version of \\"Baby I'm Sorry\\" to Ricky Nelson, who then charted the song into Billboar's top 10 Morty also 'sped up' the song of 'Real Gone Daddy' giving it a very up-tempo beat. During 1959, the group's popularity really began to take off. The band appeared twice in 1959 on \\"The Connecticut Bandstand.\\" The \\"Bandstand\\" was a daily TV show that was the forerunner of American Bandstand. Aired by WNHC-TV Channel 8 out of New Haven, it was hosted by Jim Gallant, and featured teenagers dancing while bands performed. Jim Flaherty's Western Caravan performed twice in 1959 to promote their first two recordings, Real Gone Daddy/This Old Bomb Of Mine, and Are You Lonesome To-Night?/My Foolish Heart. During this time, Howie was invited to perform at the Hayloft Jamboree in Boston, Massachusetts as well as the Hayloft Jamboree in Wheeling, West Virginia. He worked side-by-side with such notables as Harkshaw Hawkins, Web Pierce, and Lefty Frizzell. The band also opened for distiniguished acts like Johnny Cash and Dolly Parton. Ultimately, hard work and a hard life, coupled with a new wife and big family, finally took their toll, and in 1960, Howie left the band. The Jim Flaherty's Western Caravan would continue to enjoy much success in the 1960s with two notable lead men, Maury Dubois, who recorded \\"Am I Losing You\\" which cracked the Billboard's top 10, and Lou 'Dee' Demaria.

Slim Coxx hosted a benefit at an old dance hall in Farmington, Connecticut. Howie had a terrific sense of humor and a story told by Gertrude French illustrates this. in 1959, as a salesman for the Fuller Brush Company, Howie was out driving one day down a long, steep hill, and at the last moment as car turned out in front of him and a fender bender ensued. Howie got out, and checked on the elderly driver of the second car, and the driver exclaimed \\"I thought I could make it!\\".

It was published from 1926 to 1930 under the title Frauenliebe (Woman Love) and from 1930 to 1932 as Gar√ßonne. Title The magazine was named after Victor Margueritte's 1922 novel La Gar√ßonne‚Äîwhose title was translated for English readers as The Bachelor Girl‚Äîwhich was a critique of tomboys and flappers. The word gar√ßonne is derived from the French word for \\"boy\\" (gar√ßon) with the addition of a feminine suffix; its closest English translation is \\"tomboy\\". After the publication of Margueritte's novel, the term came into popular use as a descriptor for flappers, women who wore masculine clothing, and lesbians. According to Marsha Meskimmon, the relaunch of Frauenliebe as Gar√ßonne, \\"the more modish title\\", provided the magazine with a more marketable title that functioned as \\"a common currency as a lesbian type\\". History =Frauenliebe= Frauenliebe was established in Berlin in 1926 and its first issue was published on 9 June 1926. It was advertised with the description \\"Weekly for friendship, love and sexual enlightenment\\". At the time, it was one of three lesbian periodicals published in Berlin, alongside Die Freundin and Selli Engler's Die BIF ‚Äì Bl√§tter Idealer Frauenfreundschaften. Its target audience included lesbians and heterosexual male transvestites. Frauenliebe and Gar√ßonne, as the competing Freundin have been published, often edited and even partly written by men, as they were part of the male dominated homosexual movement of the 1920s and 1930s, who saw lesbian women as a possible supportive force in their fight. The only independent magazine, where only women were in charge, was the short-lived Die BIF. Frauenliebe was shut down for a time in 1928 by legal authorities, who were unable to name homosexual content as offensive under a law that prohibited \\"trashy and obscene\\" literature, but deemed that the \\"literary portion of the issues is worthless\\" and the advertisements that \\"facilitate sexual relationships [have] to be seen as obscene in the sense of the law\\". In 1930 the magazine's editors changed the name from Frauenliebe to Gar√ßonne to avoid legal troubles. =Gar√ßonne= The first issue of the magazine printed under the new title of Gar√ßonne was published on 15 October 1930. In addition to works of fiction and short stories, the magazine published lesbian-related news and opinion pieces from Germany and neighbouring countries; a 1931 article about the lack of lesbian organisations and publications in Switzerland led to the formation of the Swiss lesbian group Amicitia. Its issues contained ongoing debate about the nature of lesbianism and echoed the popular views of sexologists at the time that homosexuality was a form of natural biological variation. Although it was printed and distributed in Berlin, and focused mainly on Berlin's lesbian scene, it was accessible by subscription in regional areas of Germany where there was no local lesbian subculture. One reader from G√∂rlitz submitted a letter to Gar√ßonne in 1931 declaring that \\"this paper means everything to me\\", while another from Karlsruhe reported that \\"I cannot any longer do without this magazine\\". Gar√ßonne ceased publication in 1932.

The novel rose to prominence after Stephen Colbert urged his viewers to pre-order copies of the book from sellers other than Amazon.com ‚Äì part of an ongoing dispute between the online bookseller and Colbert's own publisher, the Hachette Book Group. On 21 July 2014, Colbert announced that the novel would debut on The New York Times Best Seller list at number 3. Plot Main characters Frida Ellis and Calvin Friedman are young lovers who, having fled a nearly-destroyed Los Angeles, are living in an abandoned house in Northern California as subsistence foragers and farmers. Wealthier survivors live in \\"Communities\\" with internet access, private security, and other luxuries. The couple leave their home when Frida discovers she is pregnant. The protagonists abandon their former lives and seek the support of a community in which to raise their child. The couple struggle to decide whether or not to tell their new community about Frida's pregnancy which might sway a communal vote to determine if the couple should be allowed to stay. The \\"Colbert Bump\\" On June 4, 2014, Colbert used his television show, The Colbert Report, to satirically attack bookseller Amazon over the company's decision to remove particular titles from sale, including books from the publisher of Colbert's own three books, the Hachette Book Group. Colbert retaliated by encouraging his viewers to pre-order copies of California, published by Hachette subsidiary Little, Brown, from independent retailer Powell's Books to demonstrate its popularity. The title was subsequently reviewed by national US papers including The Boston Globe, The Washington Post, The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times. The New York Times suggested that Lepucki had \\"won the literary Lotto\\". From plans for an initial print run of 12,000 copies, Hachette upped its inventory to 60,000 copies. The book became \\"one of the most preordered debut titles in Hachette history\\". Lepucki spent three days signing 10,000 copies at Powell's headquarters. Reception The novel received generally positive reviews, though many reviewers pointed out that the book might not have otherwise received national attention had it not been for Colbert's campaign against Amazon, thus \\"subjecting this modest post- apocalyptic tale to intense scrutiny\\". The Boston Globe, though, called the novel \\"a mostly solid first book\\". The Washington Post suggested specific elements (including Lepucki's plot twist) were \\"thrilling\\" and \\"amusing\\". The New York Post included the book in its \\"29 best books of the summer\\" and the Orlando Weekly listed it in its \\"2014 Summer Guide\\".

In Indian philosophy the notion of individuality, which is the third level of personality and the seed of all thoughts, speeches and actions is called Pashyanti , meaning 'that which witnesses'. The Shiva-Shakti dance generated a rhythmic spiritual sound which the Vedic Rishis termed as NƒÅda Brahman, the initial primordial sound of extremely high frequencies that were beyond one‚Äôs imagination. They were aware of the subtle secrets of nature and knew that the gross-level sound related to corresponding spiritual, cosmic and semi-cosmic vibrations which were divine sounds. Solving the subtle riddle they found the four states of VƒÅni (speech or sound) ‚Äì ParƒÅ (the spiritual sound of Brahman), Madhyama (the cosmic sound of VƒÅstu=Purusha), Pashyanti (the semi-cosmic sounds of Vibhootis) and Vaikhari (the gross-level sounds of gross objects and living beings). The ripples of Samashti-PrƒÅnas produce semi-cosmic vibrations which are visible through cosmic sight alone; the Rishis applied the term Pashyanti to this observation because they could observe the semi-cosmic colours of the stimulated Samashti-PrƒÅnas corresponding to spoken alphabets, which observation is also known as Dar≈õana, Indian philosophy is called Dar≈õana. They concluded that all vowels are divine alphabets for they produce divine words or Mantras. Thus, Pashyanti refers to the visible sound which is ordinarily experienced as a feeling or a mental picture. Each level or state of sound corresponds to a certain plane of existence, a certain state of consciousness; the ability to experience the different levels of sounds depends upon the refinement of consciousness. When sound out through the mouth as spoken syllables it is named Vaikhari-vac; the finer sounds that exist as a thought prior to expression are inaudible sounds, the sound existing in between the formation of a thought as an idea, feelings and image, and its expression on the material level as speech or action is named Madhyama-vac but the sound that leaves its audible nature and manifests as a feeling, a wordless idea or some visual imagery is named Pashyanti-vac which is intuitive in nature and beyond defined linguistic forms or frameworks. Bhartrihari explains that Vaikhari, the most external and differentiated level of language, on which speech is uttered by the speaker and heard by the hearer has its temporal sequence fully developed; Madhyama represents the thinking level of the mind; Pashyanti is the finest relative level where there is no distinction between the word and the meaning and there is no temporal sequence, and ParƒÅ is the fully unmanifest level of language beyond Pashyanti. He associates the Pashyanti level of language with sphota, representing a meaning as a whole, existing in the mind of the speaker as a unity. Sphota or the whole-meaning comprises dhvani (the word-sound) and artha (word-meaning). Haney points out that the unity of name and form, of sound and meaning, on the level of sphota in Pashyanti applies mainly to Sanskrit language, and Artaud is of the opinion that the language beyond speech is the language of nature whose grammar has not yet been discovered; Pashyanti representing the subtlest level of nature is the closest to nature itself. Even though Bhartrihari considers Pashyanti to be the highest level of language for it is the word without temporal sequence but Pashyanti contains the inherent impulse toward expression in time and space. Pashyanti borders on two dimensions ‚Äì Jagrat chetna or refined ordinary waking consciousness which determines the force of expression, and Turiya chetna or the transcendental consciousness which determines the non-sequenced unity of sound and meaning intimated by the trace; these bring to the fore two kinds of infinity ‚Äì that of dissemination, of unlimited extension within space, time and causality; and that of Turiya and Pashyanti, of transcending duality through unity amidst diversity. According to Advaita school the access of the unity of language and consciousness on the level of Pashyanti and ParƒÅ results in the siddhis referred to as attainments or accomplishments in the Yoga Sutras. Pippalada tells Satyakama Jabala that the status of the seeker depends on the depth of meditation, he uses two significant words, Abhidhyanam (dhyana) and MƒÅtrƒÅ (degree), also used by Patanjali; meditation has three matras or levels, the one who has gone beyond Vaikhari and Madhyama and reached the Pashyanti stage of meditation can become one with the Absolute and need not be born. Sankara explains that Pashyanti corresponds to the junction point between the ordinary waking state and pure consciousness. A word spoken or thought in the ordinary waking state is only a partial expression of an eternal meaning or transcendental signified. Tantra, like the Vedas, recognizes four levels of speech. Vaikhari is the audible speech located in the throat and manifest during the waking state; Madhyama is thought located in the heart and manifest during the dream state; Pashyanti is illumined speech located in the navel and manifest during the deep-sleep state, and ParƒÅ is the transcendent located at the root center and manifest during Samadhi. The power of speech must be brought down to the base of the spine to allow the energy of consciousness to ascend upward as Kundalini to awaken higher potentials. Pashyanti is the state of seeing, the perceptive or the illumined word; it is the sound that perceives and reveals the truth. Tara represents the illumined word. Yogakundalyupanishad III.18-19 tells us that sound sprouts in ParƒÅ (supreme) form, it becomes two-leafed (that is first manifested) in Pashyanti (radiant) form, buds in the Madhyama (subliminal) form and blooms in Vaikhari (acoustic) form; sound thus produced will become unmanifested, when the order is reversed. Shabda Brahman is the source of sound and is in the form of sound which is unmanifest, therefore it is called ParƒÅ and appears to express the kinetic part of the static quiescent eternal reality.

Each white lump marks the top of a deep ground- freezing tap. Cross section of a ground freezing pipe as used in the Big Dig. Ground freezing is a construction technique used in circumstances where soil needs to be stabilized so it will not collapse next to excavations, or to prevent contaminants spilled into soil from being leached away. Ground freezing has been used for at least one hundred years. Pipes are run through the soil to be frozen, and then refrigerants are run through the pipes, freezing the soil. Frozen soil can be as hard as concrete. Soil contaminated with radioactive elements that leaked from Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was contained through ground freezing. A project in Boston known as the Big Dig used ground freezing during some of its tunneling, to allow its wide tunnels to be built under or through soil that supported existing infrastructure that would have been difficult or expensive to support using more traditional excavation methods. Some ground freezing projects use common salt brine as the refrigerant, but other projects benefit from using more exotic refrigerants, like liquid nitrogen. In northern Canada and arctic Alaska, passive pipe systems are used that do not require any external power to keep the ground frozen. These systems use in-ground evaporators and above- ground radiators filled with liquid refrigerant. When ambient temperatures fall below ground temperatures, the liquid vapor starts condensing in the radiator, reducing the pressure in the system causing the liquid in the evaporator to boil and evaporate. This process results in heat transfer from the ground to the air and keeps the ground in a permanent frozen state.

This period is most significant in the formation of the medieval Ethiopian state, the spread and consolidation of Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity (following the example set by the Zagwe kings in preserving the Axumite heritage) and propagating to the core provinces (besides Tigray/Eritrea, Wolkayt, and Lasta) of Bete Amhara, Gojam, Begemdir, northern Shewa, Gafat, and Damot The region‚Äôs recorded history, in fact, goes back to the first decades of the second millennium. For example, St. George‚Äôs Church in the town of Woreilu (whose Tabot is reputed to have been carried by Emperor Menelik at the Battle of Adwa) was established around 1200. The parish of Mekane Selassie (·àò·ä´·äê ·àµ·àã·à¥), near Neded and the home of the famous cathedral by the same name, served as a favorite royal playground. The construction of Mekane Selassie (meaning: the abode of the Trinity) was begun by Emperor Naod (1494-1508) and completed by his son Emperor Libna Dengel (royal nom-du- guerre, Wanag Seged). This was a year before the church (along with a large number of monasteries in the region) was sacked and burned down in 1531 by the infamously destructive Jihad led by Ahmad bin Ibrahim (aka Ahmed Gragn). Francisco Alvarez, who had earlier visited the church, confirms that its size was some 150 feet by 150 feet‚Äîwholly covered in gold leaf, inlaid with gems, pearls and corals Astounded by the wealth and workmanship, the Yemeni chronicler of Ahmed Gragn notes: \\"The imam asked all the Arabs who were with him, ‚ÄòIs there the like of this church, with its images and its gold, in Byzantium, or in India, or in any other place?' They replied, ‚ÄòWe never saw or heard of its like in Byzantium or India or anywhere in the world. The field on which Gragn‚Äôs soldiers encamped is still called Gragn Meda along with a big hole in the ground which is mythologized by the traumatized population as the spot where Gragn‚Äôs horse pounced with all his force. Abba Gregorius (1596-1658), the famous monk whose Jesuit association and global travels disseminated invaluable knowledge overseas about Ethiopia, is said to hail from Woreilu. In a 1650 letter to the German scholar Hiob Ludolf (1624-1704), the Ethiopologist deservedly known as the father of Ethiopian Studies, Abba Gregorius describes himself as follows: \\"As to my origins, do not imagine, my friend, that they are humble, for I am of the House of Amharawhich is a respected tribe; from it come the heads of the Ethiopian people, the governors, the military commanders, the judges and the advisers of the King of Ethiopia who appoint and dismiss, command and rule in the name of the King, his governors, and grandees. ‚Äù See also * Amhara Province References Category:Regions of Ethiopia ","title":"Bete Amhara"},{"id":"43363978","title":"2014 Pan American Combined Events Cup"},{"id":"43363988","text":"Antiochos (; ) was a high-ranking Byzantine official and governor of Sicily who participated in a conspiracy against Emperor Constantine V ().

According to Theophanes the Confessor, Antiochos was a former logothetes tou dromou and at the time serving as the military governor (strategos) of the theme of Sicily. The conspiracy included nineteen of the highest state officials, including several other strategoi, and was headed by the brothers Strategios and Constantine Podopagouros. After the plot's discovery, the conspirators were publicly paraded and humiliated at the Hippodrome of Constantinople on 25 August 766, following which Strategios and Constantine were beheaded at the Kynegion, while the others were blinded and exiled. Theophanes further reports that once every year, agents were dispatched by the emperor to deliver a hundred lashes to the exiled conspirators. In his chronicle, Theophanes portrays the conspiracy as part of a reaction against Constantine V's iconoclast policies, stating that some of the conspirators were adherents of the iconophile hermit Stephen the Younger of Mount Auxentios, whom the emperor had had publicly humiliated and executed the previous November. Modern scholarship on the other hand is not as clear as to the motivations of the emperor, i.e. whether the death of Stephen, the execution of the nineteen officials and other acts of persecution was due to his hardening stance against iconophile sentiment, or had political motives as a reaction to plots against his life (in which Stephen too may have been implicated).

The key feature of the information age is the networking of organizational structure. The rising networked organization will overcome the limitation of traditional geography and link the operational resources distributed widely to form a military action network which combine strike range, speed and lethality, three elements of originally different developing, fundamentally transforming our idea of battle space. With the trend of decentralization of forces, we need to develop more small units with independent combat functions; meanwhile we can join these small units into a whole network as the technology's development. The warfare based on this network is called networked swarming warfare. thumb  Definition  Networked swarming warfare (NSW) is the wide-scope maneuver warfare to attack dynamically the enemy in parallel by flexible utilization of \\"assembly\\" and \\"dispersion\\", which integrates the multiple forces distributed widely into the operational network with obvious flowing feature in a multi-dimensional space. It provides us with a networked form of operations which allows organizational flowing that amount of dispersed combat units on battlefield could rapidly formulate the operational swarms which centering on objectives and rebuild according to the requirements of battlefield environment.  Connotations  * For the organization of forces, supported by information technology, abide by the networking logic of organizational structureÔºåit can integrate multiple operational resources dispersed widely into an intact force network to achieve information interaction, functional coupling and capabilities clustering. * For the deployment of forces, in form of nonlinear deployment with multidimensional space, NSW is the greatly dispersed, flexible and irregular deployment and changes the mode of \\"deploying before striking\\", focusing on deploying during the moving and the combination of deployment and attacks, and dominating the situation development by flexible maneuvering, stop and dash, dispersion and assembly. * In space distribution, NSW emphasizes mobile and dispersed in wide-scope space. * In time distribution, NSW is non-sequential and conducts parallel operations to the common target or a series of interrelated targets. * In patterns of operations, it adopts the method of dispersed deployment of forces and dynamic assembling of operations by combinations of small combat units with rapid assembly and dispersion which similar to the pattern of \\"long-range raid\\".  Features  Networked swarming warfare has three essential features: * Organizational flowing On informationized battlefield, the flowing of elements of combat effectiveness would be further strengthened, which is the inevitable result of the combination of dispersion and fast pace. The mutual influence and integration of network space and traditional geographic space make the flow of force, firepower, information and organizational interaction become the dominant advantage of warfare in information age. \\"Clustering forces by flowing\\" become its fundamental form. To adapt to these requirements, we do not only need the flow of force, firepower and information but also the flowing of organizational structure, that is to say, a flexible and dynamic force structure. To some extent, as an objective-oriented organization, NSW unite the operational elements and units in different fields into a military network according to the operational objectives, once the objectives be achieved it would be dispersed immediately and rebuild according to new objectives. Hence, NSW is an organizational form of forces based on overall reflection and flexibility, achieves the integration of flow of material forces and information by efficient coordination. Like an amoeba, it can continuously change its shapes according to the changes of living environment. During the operations, led by objectives and supported by information network, mobilize material flow and force flow by information flow, the widely dispersed combat units on battlefield can rapidly formulate the combat swarms centered on targets and rebuild according to the changes of battlefield environment. The organizational flowing can ensure the immediate reflection and flexibility of the whole operational system; appropriately seize the opportunity for battle: and transfer the tasks to make the operational forces and tasks be best matched with each other. All the combat units dynamically change their roles in reconnaissance, strike and containment and realize the dominance of battlefield by the high-flexible form of operations. NSW is conducted in space of flows. \\"The flows in network change with time that neither the flows nor network are unalterable, they both reveal the forms of changes of adaptation in time and experience accumulation\\". To complete the dynamic assembly of operational forces in flowing, we need to explore and seize the opportunity for battle promptly in the complicated and changeable battlefield environment, center on objectives and unite the appropriate operational forces together to form an operational network and concentrate and release the effectiveness in flowing to achieve the operational objectives. Meanwhile, organizational flowing is inevitably based on flexibility to adapt to the rapid changes on the battlefield. That is also the necessity of information technology paradigm, that is to say, \\"information technology paradigm is based on flexibility\\", that is one of the decisive features of social organizations characterized as changeable and flowing. Similar to dynamic rebuilding capability of enterprises in information age, \\"flexible\\" organizations can better adapt to the rapid changes of future battlefield, has quick adaptability and relatively stable operational efficiency. The key is information flowing, with constitution of organizational structure in favor of information flowing, it can strengthen the overall and multi-channel communication and connection, and promote overall adaptability, reflection and sustainability. * Objective-centered Liddell Hart figured out that \\"although be a generic term, 'objective' is not a perfect word. It has some material and geographical meaning which makes it easy to cause the confusion of thoughts.\\" Usually called objective, is the expected result of military actions, stipulates a common direction for various operational forces and actions. To some extent, objective here is the relatively abstract objective. But in the future warfare, objective of the military actions would be largely associated with the military targets; sometimes we may make definition and identification directly by military targets. In this sense, objective would have some material and geographical meaning, refers to the possible entity or object to be attacked or treated with some other actions. In the past, due to the limitations of technology and maneuvering capability, the relative location changes of the targets were relatively slow and the targets and combat areas usually tied with each other; tasks distribution and coordination for different operational groups usually clarified by combat areas or battle lines. While NSW's establishment is centered on flows, represents a dynamic space idea, operations of NSW are not limited to small geographical area any more but flows on wider battlefield. Therefore, in form of organizational coordination, NSW emphasizes the center of objective, that is to say, make precise deployment and coordination in accordance with the specific targets and points, distribute the targets to various operational groups or units, and command the whole operation by the control of specific targets of different durations and phases. The core idea of NSW is centered on objective; it is nonlinear operation in essence and smashes the traditional pattern of horizontally pushing from front to back that the whole operational process is led, designed and commanded by objective. With the investigation of the inter- connection of various elements of the enemy, start from the key nodes, select the targets that best serving for the objective achievement and be most favorable to disturb the integrated deployment of the enemy. NSW, having changed the traditional forms of tasks distribution and coordination organizing according to zones, weakening the combat boundary line and main direction of attack, it make objective-oriented task distribution that based on target deployment, target-action and target- coordination organizing. It emphasizes more on target selection and operational deployment, the overall combat is led by objective and makes appropriate operational deployment around the achievement of objective also conduct coordination that centered on objectives. For specific coordination, distributes obvious tasks for each operational swarm (unit) and deadlines of task completion but leaves no specific methods or steps for task completion, so that centering on the objective and tasks the commanders at different levels can conduct relatively independent command and control according to the overall operational intention and practice on the battlefield. Such kind of coordination can better match with the requirements of organization flowing, maximize the information efficiency, being prompt, flexible and precise, so as to achieve the operational objectives with the most appropriate force and method. To understand \\"objective-centered\\", we shall understand the relationship between the specific military targets and operational objective (purpose). NSW is to dynamically constitute a military operational network which centering on targets (operational objective) and organize the coordination centering on the objective (specific target), which is the opposite of traditional forms of tasks distribution and coordination organizing according to zones. While centering on objective, the combat shall not become the mechanical process of detailed information collecting of the strike targets and launching assault. If focuses too much on specific targets in tactics level but not objective or task, it may draw the attention of the commanders to tactics of weaponry and platform but not to the operational and strategic situation, which might lead to the war of attrition in operational or strategic level. As Liddell Hart said that objective is not a perfect word, to understand it we shall put it into various levels. * Multi-directional maneuvering attacks Emphasizing on multi-direction maneuvering attacks, NSW would rush forward to the enemy in multi-forms, from multi-positions and directions to achieve the unexpected attack purpose. \\"Multi-direction maneuvering attacks\\" aim to explore and create the weaknesses of the enemy, then conduct powerful strikes. In the future warfare, facing the three-dimensional, rapid and in-depth assaults of the powerful enemy, one can never win to play hard ball with the enemy by assembling the main forces assembly; it is necessary to use wide forces and firepower maneuvering to mobilize and pin down the enemy and deduct its overall structure to explore and create the weaknesses of the enemy. While pitting against each other, the two armies are always in different locations and the locations would be dynamically changed, that the opportunity for battle are just occurs at the moment of situation changing. That is the glamour of maneuvering. The precise maneuvering dominated by information can make the army be more flexible and be able to deploy troops on wider zones to make prompt attacks to the weakest position of the enemy, then to disrupt and dismantle the order and integration of the enemy. Emphasizing on winning by maneuvering does not mean to ignore the effect of firepower but to strike the balance between firepower and maneuvering, regard information and firepower as the insurance of maneuver conducting, then use firepower destroy the enemy by maneuvering. Nowadays, people pay too much attention to firepower and even emphasizing firepower at the expense of maneuvering, which would make the future warfare reach the situation of impasse and consumption. Though the view of winning by firepower is once common, by the analysis of war history, the advantage of winning by maneuvering is obvious and we Chinese army has fine tradition in maneuver warfare which shall not be lightly thrown away. Actually, the organic combination of information, maneuvering and firepower in information age has fundamentally changed the characteristics of firepower and maneuvering. A networked troop has the capability of dispersing into smaller combat units and the independent distributed combat units can make rapid multi-directional maneuvering and have the flexibility of synchronously using various kinds of firepower, that the mobility of battlefield is more apparent. Hence, the warfare in information age is formulated around flows; flows of forces, firepower, information and organizational interaction have become the dominant advantage of warfare in information age. In forces deployment and application, NSW strive for \\"a nonlinear attack dynamic enabled by distributed operations\\", that is to say, conduct attacks dynamically in multi-position, multi-line and multi-direction, be assembled during the moving, be assembled while striking the enemy, disperse immediately once the task be completed and seek next opportunity for battle. Dispersed deployed operational forces, by time synchronization and accelerated selection of targets, deploy assembly in time with the advantages in space to conduct multi-directional maneuvering attacks to the enemy. Achieve the surprise effect by multi-directional maneuvering attacks while keeping the multi-directional security with the surprise. Multi-directional maneuvering attacks aim to attack the weaknesses of the enemy surprisingly, destroy the mental and material cohesion of the enemy by surprise \\"precise maneuvering\\". By the application of speed advantage and flexibility of deployment, \\"identify actual situation of the enemy and initiate attack against the enemy's potential hazardous parts\\", analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the enemy in changing situation and then crack the connections to seize the dominance on battlefield.

The main tasks of the museum are the research and popularisation of History of the Jews in Latvia, as well as the collection and preservation of evidence regarding the community of Latvian Jews from its beginning until the present time. The museum was founded in 1989. It is part of the Latvian Jewish community and one of the few private museums in Latvia accredited by the state.Jewish community: history, tragedy, renascence The current director since 2008 is Latvian historian Iƒºja ƒªenskis. History The museum was founded by a group of Holocaust survivors, under the leadership of the historian Marƒ£ers Vestermanis in 1989. In the beginning, the museum acted as a centre of documentation, but in 1996 the first small, permanent exhibition was organised. Currently, the museum is located in three halls, showcasing the history of Latvian Jews from the 16th century until 1945. Lectures, educational programmes and different cultural events are organised in the museum. Exhibition Exhibition in the museum \\"Jews in Latvia\\" The museum's exhibition consists of three parts ‚Äì Jews in Latvia until the year 1918, Jews in Latvia in the years 1918 ‚Äì 1941 and Jews in Nazi-occupied Latvia. The exhibition opens with the early period of Latvian Jewish history ‚Äì from the arrival of Jews on Latvian territory in the 16th century until the 19th century. The exhibition speaks about social, economic, political, intellectual and religious life, the legal status of Jews as well as their participation in various historical events in Latvia. The third hall is devoted to the tragic events of the Holocaust on Latvian territory. A special chapter is devoted to the honourable deeds of those Latvian citizens who rescued Jews from nearly complete extermination. Building The museum is located in the building of the Riga Jewish community, a historical building which was once a Jewish club and theatre. It was built in the years 1913-1914 by the architects Edmund von Trompowsky and Paul Mandelstamm.Riga Jewish Community Here in 1926 a Jewish theatre troupe started its performances, and thus the building was renovated. Various public organisations and a Jewish library were also located in this building. Jewish celebrations were often organised here‚Äì weddings, lectures, shows and meetings. During the years 1941-1944, the Nazi occupation of Latvia, a German officers' club was located here. During Soviet times the building served as a place of political education: various ideological events, as well as congresses of the Communist Party, were held there. The building was given back to the Jewish community in the early 1990s. Currently, the building is a state-protected architectural monument. Collection of museum The collection of the museum ‚ÄúJews in Latvia‚Äù is the foundation on which the museum bases its organisation of exhibitions and research. Currently, the museum has around 14,000 items. Of these items, more than 5,000 make up the main stock, which is included in the Latvian National collection of museums. The collection consists of documents, photos, books and objects. A collection of memoirs from the 19th-20th century, a plentiful collection of family photos and materials of various Jewish organisations in the interwar period are to be noted separately.

Quality loss is visible in the text and along the rectangle edges. Webdriver Torso is a YouTube automated performance testing account that became famous in 2014 for speculations about its (then unexplained) nature and jokes featured in some of its videos. Created by Google on 7 March 2013, the channel began uploading videos on 23 September of the same year, consisting of simple slides accompanied by beeps. It was brought to public attention in 2014, when it became a source of speculation for viewers who discovered it and noted three atypical videos featuring jokes. It remained a popular mystery until YouTube humorously acknowledged that the channel exists as an internal testing utility. The channel stopped posting videos at its same rate after 624,774 videos as of 4 May 2017. The channel posted a few more videos in May, August and October 2018, followed by uploads in July and October 2019. As of September 2020, the channel has not posted any new videos. Videos From 30 September 2016 to 26 October 2018, the channel uploaded a total of 624,774 videos. The interval between one upload and another usually lasted between 1 and 15 minutes, but sometimes up to one hour. With the exception of three, all videos follow the set of standards described below. The channel stopped uploading on 4 May 2017, but resumed uploading on 18 May 2018 until another halt four days later. The last video was uploaded on 31 October 2019. Most of the videos are 11 seconds long, although some are also around 1 minute, 5 minutes, or 25 minutes long. They are slideshows showing slides about 1 second long each. Each slide consists of a solid white background overlapped by two solid color opaque rectangles, one red and the other blue. Both rectangles have a random size, shape, and position on the slide. When the two overlap, the red rectangle always appears over the blue one, and on rare occasions, the red rectangle completely covers up the blue one. Each slide has a random computer-generated wave tone. In the corner of each video, it says \\"aqua.flv - slide (slide number with four digits)\\". Early videos were called \\"aqua\\", which was then changed to \\"tmp\\", an abbreviation for the word \\"template\\" or \\"temporary\\", followed by random characters. =Abnormal uploads= The channel has three videos which do not follow the channel's standards, featuring instead internal references or jokes. One of them, titled \\"tmpRkRL85\\" (Presumably standing for \\"Temporary Rick Roll 1985\\"), plays normally until the red rectangle becomes a silhouette of Rick Astley dancing (referencing the rickrolling phenomenon) in the second half of the video. The video \\"00014\\" is a piece of footage recorded in Paris that shows the Eiffel Tower being lit up at night. At the end of the video, the camera is put down, and the Webdriver Torso Facebook page is visible for a few frames. The last one, \\"0.455442373793\\", is only viewable in France, requires a payment of 1.99 euros to watch, and is only payable with a French credit card. It shows an episode of the American adult cartoon Aqua Teen Hunger Force dubbed in Spanish. Speculation Prior to YouTube's confirmation of the channel as a test channel, there was some speculation about the identity and content of the videos. Hypotheses about the channel's purposes included spy messages, contact by extraterrestrial life-forms, construction plans and a Cicada 3301 recruitment program. =Unexplained references= Despite Google having clarified the channel's purpose, this did not explain the seemingly humorous references contained in some of the videos. These include the Aqua Teen Hunger Force episode, the Rick Astley silhouette, and the Eiffel Tower footage. Additionally, Webdriver Torso at one time commented \\"Matei is highly intelligent\\". The \\"Matei\\" in question is unknown, but Basarab Matei, Matei Mancas, Matei Gruber, Matei Ciocarlie, and Cinemassacre producer Mike Matei have all been suspected. The \\"Matei\\" comment was apparently removed at some later time. =Soggetto Ventuno's investigation= An Italian blogger named \\"Soggetto Ventuno\\" found out that Webdriver Torso belongs to a network of accounts called \\"ytuploadtestpartner_torso\\". Ventuno then discovered some other accounts with similar videos, many of which were pulled or made private after Ventuno's investigations were published. The network linked to a Facebook page and a Twitter page, which have now both been taken down. The Facebook page had mentioned \\"Johannes Leitner\\", a Google Z√ºrich employee. Leitner was friends with another employee, \\"Matei Gruber\\". A \\"Matei\\" is mentioned on 00014 (see above). Ventuno then compared scenes from pulled videos with Google Z√ºrich photos, and noticed matching things, indicating that the pulled videos were recorded at Google Z√ºrich, and that the channel and all similar channels were run from Google Z√ºrich. =Purpose of videos= The videos are made to test YouTube video quality. After creation, the videos are uploaded to YouTube. The uploaded videos are then compared to the videos before they were uploaded, to see how much quality was lost. =YouTube's reply= When YouTube was asked about Webdriver Torso, they replied: \\"We're never gonna give you uploading that's slow or loses video quality, and we're never gonna let you down by playing YouTube in poor video quality. That's why we're always running tests like Webdriver Torso.\\" This is a reference to Rick Astley's song \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\". Easter eggs Google Webdriver Torso logo. When \\"Webdriver Torso\\" is searched into Google, the Google logo will look like a Webdriver Torso video. Another Easter egg is that in the Android L developer builds, the Android Version Easter Egg is a reference to Webdriver Torso videos. However, if a Google Doodle is running, it will not appear. See also Test card Other and Subsequent accounts Webdriver Torso stopped recording videos on October 31, 2019, when it released the video StmpavbMLW. Since then, nothing new has been released on the channel. However, if we focus on ending regular fast uploads, we will get to the date of October 26, 2018. After the Webdriver Torso channel, there were several similar \\"Webdriver\\" channels. The biggest is probably Webdriver IVPE, which has 614,120 videos, followed by it Webdriver YPP 590 558 videos, and for example WebdriverUploader Basic 83,943 videos. We find a lot of similar channels, I also found one, Webdriverlittle helper. Currently the most active channel is Better Bandai 816,582 videos. Recently, the Transmitter 35 channel was discovered, which could also be a test channel for youtube.

Life and work Mahinder Watsa's father was a military physician. Watsa is Punjabi. When he was around 7 years old, his family spent some time in Rangoon. During his time at a medical college in Mumbai, Watsa stayed with friends of his family. Through them, he met his future wife, Promila. Despite coming from different backgrounds and castes (he is Punjabi, she was originally from Sindh), and going against a tradition of arranged marriages, the two wed after being friends for a number of years. The couple had a son and lived for a while in the 1950s in the United Kingdom, during which time Watsa worked as a hospital houseman and registrar. The family returned to India after his father fell ill and Watsa found work in for Glaxo as a medical officer, while simultaneously running a private practice as a gynecologist and obstetrician. Watsa began a career as a columnist in the 1960s when, in his late 30s, he was asked to start writing a medical advice column for a women's magazine. He continued authoring health columns for several women's magazines, such as Femina, Flair, and Trend, into the 1970s until he encountered resistance from an editor who insisted upon censoring queries about sexual health. Watsa however maintained his writing through numerous alternative outlets including men's magazines (such as 'Fantasy') and, later, websites. One of the readers of the Femina column had filed an obscenity lawsuit claiming that the publishers were fabricating the letters to increase readership. The editor, Sathya Saran, managed to convince the judge to drop the case by delivering a sack of unopened letters to him. Through his work as a columnist he became aware of the lack of sex education in India. In 1974, while working as a consultant for the Family Planning Association of India (FPAI), Watsa proposed that a sexual counselling and education program should be introduced. Despite oppositions, FPAI accepted his advice and started India's first sex education, counselling and therapy centre. In 1976, he organised India's first workshop on human sexuality and family life. The workshop was also addressed by Ashok Row Kavi, a notable LGBT rights activist in India. In the early 1980s, Watsa left his practice to work full-time in counselling and education. =Ask the Sexpert column= In 2005, aged 80, Watsa began writing a column called Ask the Sexpert for the newspaper Mumbai Mirror, which is noted for its witty replies to queries. The newspaper has subsequently been threatened with lawsuits and accusations of obscenity. Suchitra Dalvie, a gynaecologist, conducted a study by analysing more than 500 letters sent to the column. According to her, the study revealed a lack of sex education even among urban and relatively well-educated Indians. In August 2014, his editor estimated that he has received more 40,000 queries for the column.

Xiaomi held an event to formally introduce the high- end phone, and its complementary smart-accessory, the Xiaomi MiBand, during the Xiaomi New Product Launch Event 2014 on 22 July 2014. Similar to the principle of the Xiaomi Mi2, the Mi 4 is a highly revamped version of its predecessor, the Xiaomi Mi3. The phone is of a different design to its predecessor. It was also released slightly before the new MIUI 6, which was introduced in August 2014. Reception towards the device was generally positive, though there were still a high amount of negative feedback from users of Apple's iPhone due to its similar design and quality. Some media companies hailed it to be one of the best smartphones available in the market due to its high-end hardware which is sold for a comparably at a lower price compared to competitor smartphones. However, others criticized it for being too similar to Apple's iPhone 5S.  History  Before its official unveiling, media speculation primarily focused on leaks; including photos of the early prototypes of the device and screenshots of MIUI 6, these leaks were later proven to be fake. Xiaomi announced the Mi 4 and MiBand during a media event at the CNCC on 22 July 2014. While the device was announced in July 2014, it didn't become available until August 2014, shortly before unveiling MIUI 6. In August 2014, the Mi 4 was released in China and then to other countries. Xiaomi operated in a limited, however expanding, list of countries and consumers outside of the countries it operates in have to buy it online. Features =Operating system and software= The Xiaomi Mi 4 ships with MIUI V5 (upgradable to MIUI V10), Xiaomi's variant of the Android operating system. The user interface of MIUI is based on the concept of direct manipulation, using multi-touch gestures. Interface control elements consist of sliders, switches, and buttons. Interaction with the OS includes gestures such as swipe, tap, pinch and reverse pinch, all of which have specific definitions within the context of the Android operating system and its multi- touch interface. Internal accelerometers are used by some applications to respond to the movement of the device such as rotating it vertically (one common result is switching from portrait to landscape mode). The device includes an updater application which allows it to update its OS to the latest version of MIUI available for it. Windows 10 ROM Port In March 2015, it was announced that selected registered users of Mi 4 devices in China would receive a ROM port of the Windows 10 Mobile operating system as a trial partnership between Xiaomi and Microsoft. The ROM flash download was released for these users in June 2015, who could then test the software on their devices and provide feedback to both Microsoft and Xiaomi. =Design= The device has a 5-inch (12.7 cm) Sharp/JDI OGS fully laminated touchscreen, with a screen resolution of 1080x1920 at a pixel density of 441 ppi. Its home button is similar to its predecessor and is mainly touch-based with adjustable haptic feedback. The phone itself weighs 149 grams (5.26 oz) and uses a stainless steel frame. The device is currently available in three color finishes, black, white and rose gold. =Hardware= The Xiaomi Mi 4 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 (MSM8974-AC) chipset, which, at one point made it the fastest Android smartphone to date according to the AnTuTu benchmark application. Its processor is a quad-core 2.5 GHz Krait 400 and its graphics card is an Adreno 330. The phone includes a 3080 mAh battery, which provides 280 hours of standby time. It comes with a 13 megapixel primary camera and an 8 megapixel secondary camera. Xiaomi also released another model of Mi 4 with 64 GB of internal memory. =Accessories= The Xiaomi Mi 4 was announced with a complementary US$12 smart-accessory known as the Xiaomi Mi Band which is a waterproof sleep-cycle smart alarm, fitness monitor, sleep tracker and remote smartphone unlocker. It comes in various exchangeable bands and has a 30-day battery capacity. Compatibility with CyanogenMod and dual- boot The phone is compatible with CM13, CM14.1 and supports true dual-boot.

Rationing controls the size of the ration, which is one person's allotted portion of the resources being distributed on a particular day or at a particular time. Rationing in the US was introduced in stages during World War II. World War I Although the United States did not have food rationing in World War I, it relied heavily on propaganda campaigns to persuade people to curb their food consumption. Through slogans such as \\"Food Will Win the War\\", \\"Meatless Meals\\", and \\"Wheatless Wednesdays\\", the United States Food Administration under Herbert Hoover reduced national consumption by 15%. World War II In the summer of 1941, the British appealed to Americans to conserve food to provide more to go to Britain's fighting men in World War II. The Office of Price Administration (OPA) warned Americans of potential gasoline, steel, aluminum, and electricity shortages. It believed that with factories converting to military production and consuming many critical supplies, rationing would become necessary if the country entered the war. It established a rationing system after the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December. =Ration books, stamps, and tokens= An anti- hoarding, pro-rationing poster from the United States in World War II. The work of issuing ration books and exchanging used stamps for certificates was handled by some 5,500 local ration boards of mostly volunteer workers selected by local officials. Many levels of rationing went into effect. Some items, such as sugar, were distributed evenly based on the number of people in a household. Other items, like gasoline or fuel oil, were rationed only to those who could justify a need. Restaurant owners and other merchants were accorded more availability, but had to collect ration stamps to restock their supplies. In exchange for used ration stamps, ration boards delivered certificates to restaurants and merchants to authorize procurement of more products. Each ration stamp had a generic drawing of an airplane, gun, tank, aircraft carrier, ear of wheat, fruit, etc. and a serial number. Some stamps also had alphabetic lettering. The kind and amount of rationed commodities were not specified on most of the stamps and were not defined until later when local newspapers published, for example, that beginning on a specified date, one airplane stamp was required (in addition to cash) to buy one pair of shoes and one stamp number 30 from ration book four was required to buy 5 pounds of sugar. The commodity amounts changed from time to time depending on availability. Red stamps were used to ration meat and butter, and blue stamps were used to ration processed foods. To enable making change for ration stamps, the government issued \\"red point\\" tokens to be given in change for red stamps, and \\"blue point\\" tokens in change for blue stamps. The red and blue tokens were about the size of dimes () and were made of thin compressed wood fiber material, because metals were in short supply.Joseph A. Lowande, U.S. Ration Currency & Tokens 1942-1945. There was a black market in stamps. To prevent this, the OPA ordered vendors not to accept stamps that they themselves did not tear out of books. Buyers, however, circumvented this by saying (sometimes accurately, as the books were not well-made) that the stamps had \\"fallen out.\\" In actuality, they may have acquired stamps from other family members or friends, or the black market..yahoo.com/, Voices, rationing for the war Most rationing restrictions ended in August 1945 except for sugar rationing, which lasted until 1947 in some parts of the country.World War Ii Rationing On The U.S. Homefront =Tires, gasoline, and automobiles= Tires were the first item to be rationed by the OPA, which ordered the temporary end of sales on 11 December 1941 while it created 7,500 unpaid, volunteer three- person tire ration boards around the country. By 5 January 1942 the boards were ready. Each received a monthly allotment of tires based on the number of local vehicle registrations, and allocated them to applicants based on OPA rules. There was a shortage of natural rubber for tires since the Japanese quickly conquered the rubber-producing regions of Southeast Asia. Although synthetic rubber had been invented before the war, it had been unable to compete with natural rubber commercially, so the US did not have enough manufacturing capacity at the start of the war to make synthetic rubber. Throughout the war, rationing of gasoline was motivated by a desire to conserve rubber as much as by a desire to conserve gasoline.World War II on the Home Front The War Production Board (WPB) ordered the temporary end of all civilian automobile sales on 1 January 1942, leaving dealers with one half million unsold cars. Ration boards grew in size as they began evaluating automobile sales in February (only certain professions, such as doctors and clergymen, qualified to purchase the remaining inventory of new automobiles), typewriters in March, and bicycles in May. Automobile factories stopped manufacturing civilian models by early February 1942 and converted to producing tanks, aircraft, weapons, and other military products, with the United States government as the only customer. Henry Segerstrom in front of an automobile with \\"A\\" sticker in windshield showing lowest priority of gasoline rationing and entitled the car owner to 3 to 4 US gallons of gasoline per week. A national speed limit of 35 miles per hour was imposed to save fuel and rubber for tires. Later that month volunteers again helped distribute gasoline cards in 17 Atlantic and Pacific Northwest states. To get a classification and rationing stamps, one had to appear before a local War Price and Rationing Board which reported to the OPA. Each person in a household received a ration book, including babies and small children who qualified for canned milk not available to others. To receive a gasoline ration card, a person had to certify a need for gasoline and ownership of no more than five tires. All tires in excess of five per driver were confiscated by the government, because of rubber shortages. An \\"A\\" sticker on a car was the lowest priority of gasoline rationing and entitled the car owner to of gasoline per week. B stickers were issued to workers in the military industry, entitling their holder to up to of gasoline per week.

National World War II Museum Posters with, 'When you ride ALONE you ride with Hitler!' was created to reinforce the message that it is the Americans patriotic duty to share rides to help the war cause. During the duration that the United States entered the war to the August 1945 Japanese surrender, there was a dramatic shift where Americans drove cars less, carpooled when they did drive, walked and used their bicycle more, and increased the use of public transportation.Between 1941 and 1944 the total amount of gas consumed from highway use in the United States dropped to 32 percent. The federal agency named the Office of Defense Transportation (ODT) was put in charge during the war to focus on controlling the domestic transportation and was responsible for collecting data, conducting research and analysis, setting goals for fuel consumption and helped determine rationing coupon values. ODT deemed controlling the amount of gasoline to civilians by rationing, the car owner would drive less, extending the car's tires and conserving fuel at the same time. This led to resources such as oil and rubber to be conserved and used for war efforts. In January 1942 there was a study published by the Public Roads Administration that discovered that driving 35 m.p.h helped tires last four times as long than if the speed was 65 m.p.h. In order to extend the lifespan of tires and reduce the use, the ODT contacted the governors of all the states to establish lower speed limits. In March of the same year to decrease the large amount of single occupied drivers, car sharing programs were encouraged for workplaces that had more than 100 employees from the ODT and the Highway Traffic Advisory Committee. =Food and consumer goods= Civilians first received ration books--War Ration Book Number One, or the \\"Sugar Book\\"--on 4 May 1942, through more than 100,000 schoolteachers, PTA groups, and other volunteers.

Point Rationing of Foods, a 1943 animated propaganda short directed by Chuck Jones Sugar was the first consumer commodity rationed, with all sales ended on 27 April 1942 and resumed on 5 May with a ration of per person per week, half of normal consumption. Bakeries, ice cream makers, and other commercial users received rations of about 70% of normal usage. Coffee was rationed nationally on 29 November 1942 to every five weeks, about half of normal consumption, in part because of German U-boat attacks on shipping from Brazil. As of 1 March 1942, dog food could no longer be sold in tin cans, and manufacturers switched to dehydrated versions. As of 1 April 1942, anyone wishing to purchase a new toothpaste tube, then made from metal, had to turn in an empty one. By June 1942 companies also stopped manufacturing metal office furniture, radios, television sets, phonographs, refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, washing machines, and sewing machines for civilians. By the end of 1942, ration coupons were used for nine other items: typewriters, gasoline, bicycles, shoes, rubber footwear, silk, nylon, fuel oil, and stoves. Meat, lard, shortening and food oils, cheese, butter, margarine, processed foods (canned, bottled, and frozen), dried fruits, canned milk, firewood and coal, jams, jellies, and fruit butter were rationed by November 1943.rationed items Many retailers welcomed rationing because they were already experiencing shortages of many items due to rumors and panics, such as flashlights and batteries after Pearl Harbor. =Medicines= Scarce medicines such as penicillin were rationed by triage officers in the US military during World War II.Kenneth V.

It is the first novel in the trilogy. The second book is called The Rose Society and was released on October 13, 2015. The third book, The Midnight Star , was released October 11, 2016. Plot It follows the story of Adelina Amouteru. A decade after the blood fever swept through the nation, most survivors‚Äîall of whom were children‚Äîgained strange markings during their time of illness. Those with visible markings became known as ‚Ä≥malfettos‚Ä≥. When people close to ‚Ä≥malfettos‚Ä≥ or people who have family members who are ‚Ä≥malfettos‚Ä≥ began having strange accidents or sometimes even death, people began to believe that these ‚Ä≥malfettos‚Ä≥ were bad luck and began treating them like second-class citizens. What people didn't originally know was that the blood fever gifted some of these ‚Ä≥malfetto‚Ä≥ children with strange abilities, and the children with these powers became known as The Young Elites. The Inquisition Axis believes that Young Elites are dangerous and vengeful and will destroy the nation. Thus, they seek to destroy them before they can do so. Adelina Amouteru was a survivor of the blood fever and, as a result, her black hair turned silver and she lost her left eye. Unfortunately, she grew up with an abusive father who wished to exploit any possible abilities that she may have developed. What both of them didn't know was that Adelina is a Young Elite with the power to weave illusions that can trick the sense of sight, touch, smell, and sound. One night, in an attempt to escape from her father, she accidentally murdered him using her hidden powers. She was then caught by The Inquisition Axis and was to be later executed. In the middle of her execution, she was rescued by The Dagger Society, a group of Young Elites that seek for others like themselves and teach them how to control and use their gifts. Though it seemed that the Dagger Society saved her out of kindness at first, the reader learns of the motives of Enzo, the leader of the society and the former heir of the throne. After his parents‚Äô deaths, his sister removed his title and banished him from the palace due to him being a \\"malfetto\\". She then married a duke, who became king, and started denouncing malfettos so Enzo could not regain the throne. Enzo seeks to overthrow the current king and gain control of the kingdom with the help of the Dagger Society. Yet, as the story continues, Enzo and Adelina start to develop feelings towards each other. Characters * Adelina Amouteru Adelina is the 16 year old main character of the story. A malfetto herself, her once brown hair has turned silver, and she's missing her left eye. After the death of her mother during the blood fever, she grows up with her cruel and abusive father, leaving a vengeful darkness in her heart. After silently witnessing how he sells her to a merchant as a paramour (not even wife), she flees her home in the middle of the night. Her father notices, follows her and intends to forcefully bring her back. Adelina, in a sudden and heavy outburst of her illusionist powers, accidentally kills him. She is subsequently captured by the Inquisition and sentenced to the stake. Shortly before being burned alive, she is saved by members of The Dagger Society and ultimately joins their ranks. She there finds out her powers are strongly linked to fear and anger, mirroring her horrifying childhood. During the training with the leader of the group, Enzo Valenciano, her powers of illusion quickly grow. She is very protective of her little sister Violetta and finds herself torn apart between fear and a bad conscience when Violetta's life is threatened by Teren Santoro. * Enzo Valenciano Enzo is the founder of The Dagger Society. Publicly only known as The Reaper, Enzo is the son of the late king, crown prince to Kenettra and the rightful heir to the throne. Enzo was deposed by his elder sister Giulietta who gained the throne along with her husband, a powerful duke. After she became queen, Giulietta banished Enzo from the palace. The monarchs encourage the hunt of malfettos and portray them as demons and bringers of ill fortune in order to keep Enzo unfit for the throne. Seeking vengeance, Enzo forms the Dagger Society, planning to assassinate the king and queen and rightfully take the throne. The blood fever turned his hair and eyes dark red. He has the power to create and manipulate fire in all sorts of ways. * Teren Santoro Teren Santoro works for the queen, whom he has a secret love affair with. As leader of the Inquisition, it is his job to seek out the Young Elites, to destroy them before they destroy the nation. He believes the elites to be unworthy scum, but still dangerous. Yet, unbeknownst to most people, Teren himself is also an elite and has the ability to instantly heal all kinds of wounds on himself as well as superhuman strength. The blood fever marked him with light blonde hair and formerly blue, now almost colourless eyes. He was once a childhood friend of Enzo's, having grown up in the palace as son of the First Inquisitor, but since Enzo became a malfetto and got dispelled from the court, the friendship quickly vanished. Teren does not know Enzo is The Reaper and is very surprised and upset to discover his former friend under the mask of his now greatest enemy when they duel at the end of the novel. * Violetta Amouteru She is two years younger than her sister Adelina. Until the very end of the volume, she is believed to have no powers and to be \\"pure\\" and no malfetto, thus being her and Adelina's father's favourite, spoiled and seemingly happy and carefree child. She has a friendly, compassionate soul and frequently tried to persuade their father to let go of Adelina when he was tormenting her. She also tried to save Adelina from the Inquisition after she got captured, risking her own life and getting taken prisoner by Teren Santoro. Yet she turns out to be an elite, having the ability to take other elites' powers temporarily and to sense them. Due to her kind of power, she has no marks and doesn't get recognized as a malfetto. * Raffaele Laurent Bessette Second in command and second founding member of the Dagger Society, Raffaele has the ability to manipulate other people's emotions - which he mostly uses for calm and comfort - and to sense the powers of Young Elites. He is very calm and thoughtful, a foresightful tactician and a scholar in some way. Also known as The Messenger, he collects information about the elites and their abilities, wishing to preserve them for future generations. He has two markings, one being the blue streaks in his black hair, and the other being his eyes, one of which has an emerald colour, the other one bright amber. Knowing of Adelina's inclination to fear and anger, he is worried about what she might become and counsels Enzo to kill her before she can betray or murder them. *Lucent Also known as Windwalker, Lucent has the ability to manipulate air and wind, and do whatever those can do (scream, howl, fly, whistle etc.). She is an outcast of her homeland of Beldain and became a member of The Dagger Society a couple of years earlier. She has red-blonde, curly hair. Her marks are grey spirals going up her arms. *Michel He has the ability to \\"unravel\\" non-living objects and make them appear in another place, similar to teleportation. Michel is a skilled artist, and taught Adelina to create more realistic illusions while she was in The Dagger Society. His nickname is The Architect. *Gemma Salvatore Gemma is known as the Star Thief and can command and control animals with her powers. She is a member of The Dagger Society as well as of the gentry class of Kenettra. Her father being a powerful and influential man among nobility, this is the only reason she's still allowed to walk around publicly and to participate in public events despite being a malfetto. Adelina is secretly envious of this loving and supportive father- daughter-relationship. Gemma's powers are linked to kindness, and she finds herself more often than not followed randomly by stray animals. She has a crimson marking that covers half her face. *Dante Dante is another recruit of The Dagger Society and was once a blacksmith apprentice. His mark from the blood fever is dark, irregular markings that stretch from across his neck to part of his chest. He‚Äôs known as the Spider for his strength and quickness and his ability to see in darkness. From the very beginning he was wary of Adelina‚Äôs presence on the team and her powers and shows open distrust and aggression towards her. He frequently mocks and threatens Adelina and tries to persuade the others to get rid of her. His main argument in trying to convince Enzo is the developing mutual infatuation between Enzo and Adelina. Dante believes Enzo's feelings blind him on the one hand and are actually directed towards Enzo's former (and deceased) girlfriend Daphne on the other hand, who looked very similar to Adelina. Dante is also the only one who early on realises that Adelina is giving information about the Daggers to Teren Santoro, but, not knowing she does so in order to save her sister, suspects her of treason. Blinded by his assumptions and rage, he attacks Adelina and tries to kill her, only to be killed by her when she loses control of her powers. Reception The Guardian gave it 3.5 stars. The book reached number 4 on the New York Times bestseller list. Sequels The second novel in the series is called The Rose Society and was released on October 13, 2015. The third and final book, The Midnight Star, was released on October 11, 2016.

The change of state of air parcels following isentropic surfaces does not involve exchange of heat with the environment. Such an analysis can also evaluate the airmass stability in the vertical dimension and whether an air parcel crossing such a surface will result in convective or stratiform clouds. It is based on the study of weather maps or vertical cross-sections of the potential temperature values in the troposphere. On a synoptic scale, isentropic analysis is associated with weather fronts: warm fronts are found where the wind crosses lines of a chosen potential temperature from lower heights to higher ones, while cold fronts are where the wind crosses descending heights. Synoptic clouds and precipitations can thus be better found with these areas of advection than with conventional isobaric maps. From a mesoscale point of view, an air parcel moving vertically will cross isolines of potential temperature and it will be unstable if the value of those lines decrease with altitude, or stable if they increase.

He represented his nation Kyrgyzstan in two editions of the Olympic Games (2000 and 2004) and also captured two silver medals each in the 54 and 55-kg division at the 2001 Asian Wrestling Championships in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia and at the 2002 Asian Games in Busan, South Korea. Kalilov also trained throughout his sporting career for Ryon Wrestling Club in Bishkek under his father and personal coach Yusup Kalilov. Kalilov made his international debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, competing in the men's bantamweight division (). In the preliminary pool, he opened his match by easily throwing U.S. wrestler Steven Mays off the mat on technical superiority and wrestled his way to edge past Egypt's Mohamed Abou Elela with a 3‚Äì1 verdict. Facing against Ukraine's Andriy Kalashnykov to close the pool, Kalilov could not hold tightly over his opponent and lost the match by a comfortable 3‚Äì0 decision. Placing second in the pool and eighth in the final standings, Kalilov's performance fell short to put him through to the next round. Shortly after the Games, Kalilov came strong with a bronze medal effort at the 2001 Asian Wrestling Championships in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, and went on to finish fourth at the World Championships in Patras, Greece few months later, losing 1‚Äì3 to Olympic silver medalist L√°zaro Rivas of Cuba. He also entered the 2002 Asian Games in Busan, South Korea as a medal favorite in the 55 kg class, and picked up a bronze over China's Wang Hui by a close 6‚Äì5 verdict. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Kalilov qualified for his second Kyrgyz squad, as a 23-year-old, in the men's 55 kg class. Earlier in the process, he placed sixth and received a spot on the Kyrgyz wrestling team from the 2003 World Wrestling Championships in Cr√©teil, France. Unlike his previous Olympics, Kalilov delivered a catastrophic game plan in the prelim pool. He lost three straight matches each to China's Sheng Jiang by a 3‚Äì3 draw and a double warning, to Greece's Artiom Kiouregkian by a pin, and to Denmark's H√•kan Nyblom by a satisfying 3‚Äì0 verdict, leaving him on the bottom of the pool and placing eighteenth in the final standings.

Baldy. Taken from a drawing of proposed Pikes Peak Railway made in 1883. Seven Lakes is an abandoned, historical populated place in Teller County, Colorado on the Pikes Peak mountain. It was once the site of the Seven Lakes Hotel along a carriage road to the summit of Pikes Peak. Its waters flow from Beaver Creek to the Lake Moraine reservoir, a supplier of water to Colorado Springs. History Seven Lakes cabin hotel and Pikes Peak, taken by Robert N. Dennis between 1865 and 1905.Seven Lakes Hotel, taken before it burned down in the 1880s Seven Lakes Park was a horse shoe basin nearly enclosed by Bald Mountain's (generally now called Almagre Mountain) walls. In the late 1870s a wagon road from Colorado City (now Old Colorado City) to Jones Park was extended to Seven Lakes. From there it was about five mile hike to the top of Pikes Peak. In 1889 the carriage road was completed from Seven Lakes to the Pikes Peak summit. Another route could be taken in 1904 on the Colorado Springs and Cripple Creek District Railway (Short Line) to the Clyde station. It was about via trails and the carriage road to Seven Lakes. A one-story log cabin built about 1877 in a ravine at in elevation served as hotel. In 1880, Mayo G. Smith bought the Seven Lakes Park property and ran the hotel from 1882 to 1883. It was visited in 1887 by the Boyden Expedition of Harvard College who took atmospheric measurements of Seven Lakes and Pikes Peak. The hotel was expanded to several stories and fitted with a billiard room and bowling alley, and burned down in the 1880s. Visitors came to the area to camp and fish. The Pike's Peak and Seven Lakes Toll Road Company was established by 1890. Tourists at Seven Lakes near Pikes Peak, taken about 1876 by L.K. Oldroyd Railway lines In 1896 the Colorado Springs & Cripple Creek Short Line company planned to build a railway branch through Seven Lakes to Pikes Peak. In 1909, the mode of transportation into Seven Lakes was via horses. The Seven Lakes‚ÄìPike's Peak Railway Company was formed in the fall of 1901 to build an electric trolley line from Clyde to Pikes Peak through Seven Lakes. It was expected to be completed within a year at the cost of $250,000 (). Henry C. Hall was one of the company's railroad directors. Hall made a proposal during a citizens meeting in the Colorado Springs council chambers in August 1901 regarding water at Seven Lakes. He asked for a review of the use of Seven Falls as a source of water for the city. He claimed it would be an expensive investment, but might not provide as much water as anticipated. Seven Lakes water supply =Background= The Seven Lakes water supply of one hundred or more acres consists of small bodies of water at in altitude which flow south into Beaver Creek and then Lake Moraine, a source of water for the city of Colorado Springs by 1899. The seven natural lakes formed by glaciers were: Isoetes Lake, Lake of the Rocks, Marsh Lake, Michigan Lake, Mirror Lake, Ramona Lake, and Ribbon Lake. The city of Colorado Springs purchased Seven Lakes land for $70,000 in 1891. That year they built the Lake Moraine Dam. An injunction to prevent the City of Colorado Springs from paying for and receiving title to the Seven Lakes property was refused in January 1902. =Reservoirs built= In 1905, the Mason and McReynolds reservoirs were built in the Seven Lakes area. Marsh, Ribbon, and Mirror Lakes were used to make one of the reservoirs and another reservoir was formed in the Seven Lakes area. Water from the two reservoirs flows through the St. John tunnel to Lake Moraine. In 1909, the City of Colorado Springs restricted access to McReynolds and Mason Reservoirs (Seven Lakes), a source of the municipality's water, which closed off transportation opportunities through that area. Closed since the 1900s, the two South Slope Recreation Area reservoirs were opened for fishing in 2014, subject to a reservation with the City of Colorado Springs and a Colorado fishing license.

The villa must have been already abandoned in the 3rd century when part of its architectural decoration was reused in the other Roman villa in Sirmione, the one located on the present-day Via Antiche Mura. Between the 4th and 5th centuries the imposing surviving structures of the villa were included in the fortifications that enclosed the Sirmione peninsula and burials were built inside the remains of the Roman building, used a cemetery. Over the centuries several chroniclers and travelers visited the ruins, but the first concrete studies on them were carried out only in 1801 by General Lacombe-Saint-Michel, commander of the Napoleonic army. Subsequently, the Veronese count Giovanni Girolamo Orti Manara carried out some excavations and surveys, whose results were published in 1856. In 1939 the National Superintendence for Archaeological Heritage started an extensive program of excavations and restorations, finally acquiring the entire area in 1948 to allow adequate protection of the complex and in its natural environment. During the 1990s further studies confirmed that the construction was carried out through a unitary project, which defined the orientation and distribution of the internal spaces according to a precise criterion of axiality and symmetry. In 1999 an Archeological Museum collecting finds from the area was inaugurated. Site description Section of the residential building The archaeological complex, still partially unearthed today, covers an area of about two hectares. The villa has a rectangular plan with two foreparts on the north and south sides. To overcome the inclination of the rocky bank on which the building was set, large support substructures were created in the northern part and considerable cuts were made to model the rocky bank. The main floor, corresponding to the owner's home, is the most damaged, both because it was the most exposed and because the villa, after its abandonment, has been a quarry for materials for several centuries. The intermediate and lower floors instead are better preserved. The main entrance to the building was located in the southern forepart. The villa was characterized by long porches and terraces open towards the lake along the east and west sides, communicating to the north with a large belvedere terrace, equipped with a velarium. Along the western side, today you can visit the cryptoporticus, a long walk once covered. The residential parts of the building were located in the north and south areas, while the central part, made up today of the Grande Oliveto (\\"Big Olive Grove\\"), was occupied by a garden. On the southern side, under an opus spicatum floor, there is a large cistern almost 43 meters long, which collected the water necessary for daily use. The large thermal sector of the villa, consisting of several rooms located in the south-western area, including a swimming pool, was probably obtained at the beginning of the 2nd century.

Its common names include green citrus aphid, Spirea aphid, and apple aphid. is distributed worldwide, and is most abundant in the United States. It has a diploid chromosome number of 2n=8.  Discovery  This species was first discovered by Edith Marion Patch in 1914. Patch discovered that A. pomi would feed and develop on Spiraea and A. spiraecola would feed and develop on Malus which confirmed that aphids were a highly variable species. Patch‚Äôs colonies on apple were decimated by a fungus so all transfer attempts to secondary hosts, which would have demonstrated the limited host range of A. pomi, were made using A. spiraecola from Spiraea instead. Later she suggested using the names A. pomi and A. spiraecola on the basis of the plants on which they were found. thus leading to the names each species is known by today. Another species, A. citricola was described by van der Groot in 1912 while doing a study in Chile. This aphid became a synonym for another citrus aphid- Toxoptera citricida. In 1975, Hille Ris Lambers demonstrated that Toxoptera citricida referred to A. spiraecola, thus synonymizing T. citricola with A. spiraecola.  Anatomy  This species of aphid can range from a bright greenish-yellow color to an apple green, hence their common name. They have a dark-brown head and thorax, and a yellowish-green abdomen with dusky lateral patches on each segment with a membranous and pale dorsum. They are often confused with Aphis pomi (apple aphid) due to overlapping host plants that they aggregate to; However, they are also morphologically different as A. pomi have marginal tubercles on their lower abdomen while A. spiraecola do not.  Reproduction  A. spiraecola is an holocyclic species, meaning that they undergo sexual reproduction during part of its life cycle and reproduces entirely parthenogenetically over most of its geographical range. Where it is holocyclic and produces sexual morphs, the primary hosts are Spiraea or Citrus.  Diet  Aphis spiraecola is found on over 65 plant genera including economically important crops like citrus, cacao, papaya anona, Malus sp., Pirus sp., Prunus sp. etc. Except the Lavandula sp. and Paliurus spina- christi, all the host plants are evergreen and Aphis spiraecola is found on these two host plants mostly during the plants flowering time. This species is polyphagous, meaning it can feed on a variety of different foods allowing it to survive in a plethora of environments. They typically feed on young buds/flowers, shoots and leaves of host plants. If introduced to a new place, the odds of it surviving and reproducing are very good, barring cold climates as mentioned previously. Primary (winter) hosts are Spiraea spp. and Citrus spp. with numerous secondary host plants, in well over 20 families, particularly in the Caprifoliaceae, Compositae, Rosaceae, Rubiaceae and Rutaceae families. This aphid has been found to have a preference for woody plants of a shrubby growth habit with citrus and apples being the most important/affected crop hosts.  Distribution  A. spiraecola is globally distributed among temperate and tropical regions, including Asia, Africa, North America, Europe, and Oceanic regions with the exception of cold regions. This species is thought to have originated in the Far East, dating back to at least 1907 in North America, Australia in 1926, New Zealand in 1931, the Mediterranean in 1939, Africa in 196, and Israel in 1970. Today, A. spiraecola is found all over the world , whether they are native or introduced to the area, and have been found to be invasive almost everywhere they reside. There are many possibilities and risks of introducing this species to new geographic areas. One of which is the movement of fruits or ornamental plants which can transport this organism to a new geographic area, and since it has the ability to feed on almost any food source, it can easily survive and reproduce in almost any environment, thus introducing them to a new area where they can survive.  Environmental impact  A. spiraecola is a pest of citrus, apples and ornamentals. They also transmit a large portion of plant viruses which can cause entire crop yields to be at risk of being affected. Therefore A. spiraecola poses a significant negative impact on crop production and possibly economic loss, however they don't seem to impact much else in terms of human/animal health, aquaculture, native fauna/flora, tourism, trade, transportation, or the environment/biodiversity.  Prevention and control  Despite being native in certain terrestrial regions, this species can be severely detrimental to crops in a variety of regions, making them invasive virtually everywhere they inhabit. Many predators prey on A. spiraecola colonies but this doesn't result in ample population control. Insecticides are recommended for pest control on citrus crop hosts affected by A. spiraecola. Several studies tested a range of insecticides in citrus groves, which compared treatments in apple orchards. A study also described the effect of different insecticide treatments on cucurbits in South America. Examples of suitable insecticide treatment for A. spiraecola are ethion, parathion-ethyl, dimethoate, fenitrothion, and dimefox via stem bandages. The favored insecticide is imidacloprid for orchard control, as shown in an experiment comparing efficacy of plant regulation on apple/pear trees in Florida.

History The Regulation and Supervision Bureau was founded in 1999 following the passing of an Emirate law reference Law No (2) of 1998. During 1997 and 1998 a privatisation committee was formed by the Abu Dhabi Government to study the UK model of un-bundling and privatisation of the then Water and Electricity Department (WED) which was a government owned vertically integrated organisation. Eventually, the WED Sector was broken into 12 companies including: production (4 off), transmission, distribution and supply (2 off) a single buyer and a number of smaller companies such as the remote services and islands grouping. One of the guiding principles of the new law was the promotion of privately funded power and water production companies, generally referred to as independent water and power producers (IWPPs). As of August 2014 10 such companies have been established using project finance as the basis for a build, own and operate BOO model. The latest addition being Al Mirfa located some 200 km West of the capital Abu Dhabi.

In 1981, dancers Sonia Arova and Thor Sutowski decided to start a bona fide ballet company in the state and created Alabama Ballet. Fifteen years later, in 1996, Wes Chapman and Roger Van Fleteren became co-directors of the company. Nearly a decade later, in 2005, Tracey Alvey became Ballet Mistress and, two years later, Artistic Director.Todd Keith, Insiders' Guide to Birmingham, Globe Pequot, 2011, pp. 92-93 After Chapman left, Van Fleteren became Associate Artistic Director and Resident Choreographer.

The earliest known use of corrosion casting was by Robert Boyle in 1663.J Hyrtl. Corrosions-Anatomie und ihre Ergebnisse. Braumu Ãàller, Wien, 1873. Technique Vascular corrosion casting requires the use of a solidifying material such as a resin. The most common resin used for vascular corrosion casting is Batson's 17.http://www.polysciences.com/SiteData/docs/105/1ecebbad32a1c59d52b985f6c81a391e/105.pdf The process begins with the draining of blood from vessels to prevent blockage from clotting, this can be achieved by perfusing blood vessels with a physiological fluid such as phosphate buffered saline. Subsequently, the blood vessels of interest are filled with resin (or alternative solidifying material). The resin is allowed to cure resulting in the blood vessel network containing a solid plastic material. Surrounding tissue is dissolved away using a corrosive chemical, commonly potassium hydroxide. Corrosion should not affect the resin, only dissolving tissue. The final product is a 3D network of blood vessels.

From 2001 to 2002, Singapore held a rotational seat on the United Nations Security Council and has participated in UN peacekeeping/observer missions in Kuwait, Angola, Kenya, Cambodia and Timor Leste. History Before independence, Singapore had merged with the Federation of Malaya with North Borneo and Sarawak to form Malaysia on August 31, 1963 and at that time, the Federation of Malaya was already a member of the UN. Due to distrust and ideological differences between leaders of the State of Singapore and the federal government of Malaysia, Singapore became an independent state about 2 years after the union, on August 9, 1965. Requirements for joining the United Nations under the UN Charter of the time required sponsorship by minimum of 2 members on the United Nations Security Council, support from the members on the council and about 67% of the votes during the United Nations General Assembly to be successfully admitted into the organisation. After independence, Singapore applied to join the UN on September 2, 1965 with the sponsorship of Malaysia, the United Kingdom, Ivory Coast and Jordan. On September 20, 1965, Singapore's admission to the UN was put into vote in the security council and the result of the vote was unanimous. Singapore was then officially registered as a member of the UN on September 21, 1965, with Abu Bakar bin Pawanchee serving as the first permanent representative to the UN. Since then, Singapore has been actively participating in UN peacekeeping operations. In 1997, the country became only the seventh country to sign the Memorandum of Understanding on UN Standby Arrangements. Activities =Security Council= During the 2000 United Nations Security Council election, Singapore was elected as one of the five non-permanent members of the UN Security Council and served a two-year term from 2001 to 2002. In January 2001 and May 2002, Ambassador Kishore Mahbubani, the permanent representative of Singapore then, served as the President of the United Nations Security Council together with Ambassador S. Jayakumar. During Singapore's time on the security council, it managed to lobbied for a time extension for the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor until East Timor's independence, despite objection from a permanent member on the council. =Peacekeeping and observer missions= Singapore's first peacekeeping mission was to oversee Namibia‚Äôs transition to independence, was in response to an urgent call for help from then UN General-Secretary Javier Perez de Cuellar on 29 March 1989. Since 1989, Singapore has taken part in 17 peacekeeping and observer missions with personnel from the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and Singapore Police Force (SPF).

Its purpose is to promote a balanced approach to internet privacy between consumers and content providers by blocking advertisements and tracking cookies that do not respect the Do Not Track setting in a user's web browser. A second purpose, served by free distribution, has been to encourage membership in and donation to the EFF.  Description  The EFF states: \\"If an advertiser seems to be tracking you across multiple websites without your permission, Privacy Badger automatically blocks that advertiser from loading any more content in your browser. To the advertiser, it's like you suddenly disappeared.\\" Privacy Badger works by detecting the presence of content loaded from third-party domains when you visit a website, then blocking those domains which are determined to be tracking you. Controls on the software allow selective blocking of the third- party domains based on user preference. While some of its code is based on Adblock Plus, Privacy Badger only blocks those ads which come with embedded trackers. Privacy Badger has been noted as one recommended tool in a set of tools to protect online privacy.  History  The alpha version was released on 1 May 2014, followed by a beta on 21 July 2014. In April 2017, the EFF announced that Privacy Badger had surpassed one million users. Reception Several publications reported on Privacy Badger in May 2014, following its alpha release. Ian Paul, for PC World, mentions that Privacy Badger \\"only blocks third-party tracking, not first party\\", and mentions that prevention of browser fingerprinting is planned for a future release.

Two Italian carabinieri (gendarmes) with capes A cape is a sleeveless outer garment, which drapes the wearer's back, arms, and chest, and connects at the neck. History Pazyryk horseman wearing cape 300 BCE Capes were common in medieval Europe, especially when combined with a hood in the chaperon. They have had periodic returns to fashion - for example, in nineteenth-century Europe. Roman Catholic clergy wear a type of cape known as a ferraiolo, which is worn for formal events outside a ritualistic context. The cope is a liturgical vestment in the form of a cape. Capes are often highly decorated with elaborate embroidery. Capes remain in regular use as rainwear in various military units and police forces, in France for example. A gas cape was a voluminous military garment designed to give rain protection to someone wearing the bulky gas masks used in twentieth-century wars. Semantic distinction A young woman in a crocheted cape. In fashion, the word ‚Äúcape‚Äù usually refers to a shorter garment and ‚Äúcloak‚Äù to a full-length version of the different types of garment, though the two terms are sometimes used synonymously for full-length coverings. The fashion cape does not cover the front to any appreciable degree. In raingear, a cape is usually a long and roomy protective garment worn to keep one dry in the rain. Use in formal wear In full evening dress, ladies frequently use the cape as a fashion statement, or to protect the wearer or the fine fabrics of their evening-wear from the elements, especially where a coat would crush‚Äîor hide‚Äîthe garment. These capes may be short (over the shoulders or to the waist) or a full-length cloak. Short capes were usually made of, or trimmed in, fur; however, because fur is less accepted as a fashion accessory in modern times, other expensive materials are substituted for it, with an opulent lining and trim. Typical fabrics used are velvet, silk, and satin. Capes are still authorized as an alternative to the more utilitarian trench coat for U.S. Army officers in mess dress, formal evening uniform. The caped overcoat variant Caped overcoats were popular for men during the Victorian era, with some caped Ulsters featuring multiple layered capes, and the Inverness coat (both formal evening and working day variants) had a cape. The Inverness coat is no longer commonly worn (though it has begun to be revived, on a limited scale, in steampunk fashion), and the Ulster lost its cape in the 1920s. As protection In modern times, capes are commonly used by hair and beauty salons for the purpose of hair styling services, in which usage they protect clothing from loose strands of hair being cut from the head and/or from the chemicals often used in such styling. In fiction Batman and Robin The cape is a popular clothing item for superheroes (like Superman) in the American comic book genre. They are often used by comic book artists to create the illusion of motion in a still image. Most often, they are worn merely as a costume adornment. Other times, as in the case of Batman, The Shroud, and Cloak of Cloak & Dagger, the cape serves a functional purpose, such as gliding (Batman), transporting one to the Darkforce dimension (The Shroud), or initiating teleportation (Cloak). The supernatural character Spawn has a cape (actually a part of his living symbiotic costume) that obeys Spawn's mental commands, changing shape to scare, confuse or even kill would-be attackers, while Meta Knight of Kirby fame disguises his wings as a cape. Some media, such as Watchmen or The Incredibles, comment on the potentially lethal hazards of a cape.

It was his first published book under that name (though he had published several works under his birth name Patrick Russ as a teenager). The thirteen stories are largely about rural experiences, focusing on hunting, shooting and fishing. Published by Secker and Warburg, the collection included several stories that would later be republished in The Walker and other stories. The collection was both a critical and financial success for O'Brian. Contents The collection includes the following stories: #\\"The Last Pool\\" #\\"The Green creature\\" #\\"The Returns\\" #\\"The Happy despatch\\" #\\"The Virtuous Pelga\\" #\\"The Drawing of the Curranwood badgers\\" #\\"It must have been a branch, they said\\" #\\"The Steep slope of Gally y Wenallt\\" #\\"The Long day running\\" #\\"Name calls\\" #\\"The Dawn flighting\\" #\\"The Trap\\" #\\"The Little death\\" Themes and style The writer and critic Steve Bodio described the stories as \\"some straight forward,\\" and \\"some supernatural\\" and \\"uncanny\\" in the tradition of tales by T.H. White from the 1930s and Geoffrey Household from the 1950s. He noted that some have a \\"touch of terror.\\" The book was published when O'Brian's English birth was not well known, some reviewers focused on the \\"Irish\\" elements within the stories. Bodio described the book as capturing something Irish in its \\"uncanny atmosphere\\". And an Observer reviewer wrote \\"This Charming book by an Irish sportsman is a genuine collection of tales of the Irish countryside.\\" Reception and success Reviews of the collection were generally favourable. Both The Irish Times and the Irish novelist and playwright Lord Dunsany in The Observer gave positive reviews. The Western Morning News described the stories as taking \\"their tense drama in hunting, fishing and shooting, and their realism in the author's intimate knowledge.\\" The reviewer particularly liked the story \\"The Trap\\" that had \\"rare poetical qualities\\" and that \\"exhibits a fine sense of period and of the mind of a dolish poacher\\". In his book Sportsman's Library, Steve Bodio described the collection as containing \\"some of the best fishing and hunting writing I have seen\\". Sales of the collection gave O'Brian more confidence in his writing, and he earned ¬£30 beyond the advance from his publisher Secker and Warburg. According to his one of his biographers, Dean King, O'Brian used the advance to pay for hot water and electricity for the flat that he was living in with his wife.

Owens was the long-time head coach of Colorado College. Career Scott Owens made his first appearance for the Colorado College Tigers during the 1975‚Äì76 season during one of their better (though still nominally bad) periods. While none of his four years saw CC finish with a winning record, they did earn their only conference title in school history in 1978. Once he had graduated Owens became a player-assistant coach with TSV Kottern, which played in varying levels of West Germany's amateur leagues, for five years before returning to North America. Owens' next job came in his home town of Madison as general manager for the newly formed Madison Capitols. After two seasons in that position, Owens added the responsibilities as head coach to his duties with the Capitols, and under his leadership the team routinely finished in the top half of league standings. Owens left after the 1989‚Äì90 season to accept a position at Wisconsin as an assistant under his old head coach Jeff Sauer and moved back to his alma mater in the same capacity the following season. After four more seasons with the Tigers Owens headed back to the USHL as head coach of the Des Moines Buccaneers. Despite a rocky start that saw his first losing record as a head coach, Owen's tenure in Des Moines was even more successful than his time with the Capitols. In his third year the Buccaneers won the Anderson Cup as the best regular season team and followed it up with a repeat performance in addition to a Clark Cup for winning the league title. Now a proven champion, Owens matriculated back to Colorado Springs to take over as head coach. With the departed Don Lucia having revived the moribund program Owens stepped in and had immediate success, making the NCAA three straight seasons early on. The fourth year culminated with Peter Sejna, a player Owens had coached in and recruited from Des Moines, winning the Hobey Baker Award, the first in school history. Two years later Owens has his best season with Colorado College, winning 31 games and marching all the way into the 2005 Frozen Four and earning CC its second Hobey Baker winner, Marty Sertich. After the huge success in the early years Colorado College began to slip back into the rest of the pack. While still recording winning seasons over the next seven years, CC would only top 20 wins three times and win only one more game in the NCAA Tournament before CC posted its first losing season in 20 years at 18‚Äì19‚Äì5 in 2012‚Äì13. The following year was much worse as the Tigers won only seven games and after it was over Owens stepped down as head coach after 15 seasons. At the time of his retirement Owens was both the longest tenured and winningest coach in Colorado College's ice hockey program history. On May 21, 2015 Owens returned to coaching and the USHL when he was named head coach of the Sioux Falls Stampede. He announced his retirement from coaching on March 26, 2020.

It belongs to the Diocese of Lule√•. The church is the northernmost medieval church of Sweden. History External view with the bell tower The presently visible church was preceded by a wooden chapel. The exact time of construction of the church is not known, but it was probably constructed during the late 15th century. The church is mentioned for the first time in 1472 when archbishop Jakob Ulvsson from Uppsala visited the church in connection with the inauguration of the altarpiece of the church. The event is mentioned in a letter of indulgence, which is also the oldest written record from Kalix as well as the only letter of indulgence that is known to have been issued from the Diocese of Lule√•. The inauguration of the altarpiece may have been done in connection with either the inauguration of the new church or with the start of the construction of it. The church was damaged by fire in 1595, in which a set of medieval frescos were destroyed. A wooden church porch was replaced with one made of stone in the late 17th century. In 1747 the windows were enlarged and in 1753‚Äì54 the church was renovated. The church has been pillaged by Russian troops on two occasions: in 1716, when cash and church vestments were carried off, and again in 1809, when it was used by Russian troops as a stable during the Finnish War. The church was renovated in 1955 and again in 1972. Architecture Interior view towards the choir Kalix Church is a typical representative of a type of late medieval hall churches found in the north of Sweden. The gables of the church display brick ornaments and the building has two medieval portals in its south fa√ßade. It lies close to Kalix river in what used to be a so-called church village () where congregation members who came from far away would have a small house or cottage in which to stay during church holidays, but of this church village only a single house remains today. Not far from the church lies the old parsonage. An external wooden bell tower, built by carpenters from Ostrobothnia, stands in the cemetery. All in all, the church and its environs constitute a typical representative of a church complex in Norrland. Inside, the church ceiling rests on three star-shaped vaults. The church contains several medieval items. The aforementioned altarpiece still stands behind the main altar and is adorned with statues depicting, on the central panel, the Holy Virgin with the infant Christ, and on each side of her statues of James the Greater and James the Lesser. The baptismal font is also medieval, as are two separate sculptures of saints. The pulpit is one of the oldest in Norrland, and Baroque in style. The rood screen with its ornamented obelisks dates from the mid-18th century, while two more free-standing sculptures come from an altarpiece made in the 1880s. The choir window dates from 1972 and is made by artist P√§r Andersson.

Owing to lack of maintenance it is currently in a much dilapidated condition. Ranpur State was one of many princely non-salute states of India during the period of the British Raj. It was one of the four native states located in present-day Nayagarh district, Odisha. The state was bounded in the west by Nayagarh State and in all other directions by Puri district. It was very close to the seashore but had no coastline. Its southwestern part was thickly forested and was mostly uninhabited.

The legendary date of its foundation is placed some time in the 18th century BCRanpur (Princely State) when the founder, a hunter named Basara Basuk, having defeated a giant demon named Ranasura, established his rule in the area. The name of the place is derived from the demon's name and was initially known as Ranasurapura, shortened to Ranpur in the course of time. The state became a British protectorate in 1803.

Kelly), also known as Cap D, is an underground rapper and lawyer from Chicago, Illinois. He is known for his solo work, his collaboration with Tony Fields as the duo \\"All Natural,\\" and for founding the label All Natural Records, on which all his music has been released. Early life and education Kelly grew up in a Catholic family on the South Side of Chicago, before his family moved to Flossmoor, where he attended Homewood- Flossmoor High School. He later attended Morehouse College (B.A., 1996) and the University of Illinois Law School. (J.D., 2004). Musical career Kelly started the label \\"All Natural\\" in 1997, on which he released his first solo album, Writer's Block (The Movie), in 2002. He was also a member of a rap group, also called \\"All Natural\\", with Tony Fields, aka \\"Tony B. Nimble\\", which they started in 1993. This duo intended to release their first single, \\"50 Years\\", on the short-lived label Wild Pitch. After this label folded, they started the All Natural label to release \\"50 Years,\\" and on which they released their debut album, No Additives, No Preservatives, in 1998. Greg Kot praised the album as one of \\"the year's freshest rap releases\\" and wrote that \\"Though it lacks the cinematic production of the best East Coast hip-hop, it marks the arrival of an assertive and unusually insightful new voice in Kelly.\\" He released his second solo album, Insomnia, in 2004 on the same label, shortly after he received his law degree. Insomnia was noted for its heavily political themes, which led some critics to compare it to Noam Chomsky, and was also highlighted for addressing Kelly's newfound religion of Islam. All Natural's third album, Vintage, was released in 2005 and was also heavily influenced by Kelly's religious views. Kelly released his third album, Return of the Renegade, as \\"Cap D\\" in 2007. He described this album as more for the sake of hip-hop and less of a bold political statement than Insomnia had been. His fourth album, Polymath, was released in 2010, also under the alias of \\"Cap D\\". Kot ranked it as the best indie Chicago album of that year.

The MINDS Foundation, a nonprofit located in India, uses a grassroots approach to eliminate stigma and provide educational, medical, and moral support for patients with mental illness in rural India. (1) The organization conducts ongoing research and develops curriculum to expand education about mental health and increase the number of trained staff who can support patients suffering from mental illness. MINDS works with a broad team of directors, advisors, field workers and assistants and receives support through a variety of foundations, grants and NGOs. Since its creation in 2010, MINDS has increased the level of education and treatment with regards to mental illness, overcoming many of the challenges of rural health work in India.  Approach  MINDS uses a three-phase approach for education, treatment and reintegration. Phase 1 focuses on community-wide education held in each village by social workers, MINDS staff and Community Mental Health Workers. After a short 45-minute film explaining the basics of mental illness and the effectiveness of treatment, there are facilitated discussions and Q&A; sessions which focus on de-stigmatization of mental illness. Research suggests that lack of health education in rural India contributes to serious misunderstandings, stigma and denial about the existence and causes of mental illness. According to current studies, psychologists believe education programs about mental illness are one of the most effective ways to reduce this stigma and encourage patients to receive the treatment they need. Phase 2 focuses on effective, free treatment for any mentally ill person who wishes to receive help. MINDS is committed to working in relation with communities and hospitals across Gujarat and, therefore, provides free daily transport to local hospitals, free consultation with local doctors and free medication. Furthermore, to ease the treatment process, families of patients are welcome to accompany the patients to the hospitals and doctors appointments. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, 70-90% of all global mentally ill patients who receive treatment partially or completely recover. Phase 3 focuses on each patient's reintegration into the local community after treatment. With the help of Community Mental Health Workers, patients receive continued medical support and education. Families of patients also benefit from support and education during this transition. The Phase 1 education and de-stigmatization pave the way for this third phase of MINDS work.  Programs and Research  In addition to the three-phase program running in villages across Gujarat, India, MINDS continually develops programs and conducts research to expand programing. Below is a summary of current, developing programing. Community Mental Health Worker (CMHW) Training Community Mental Health Workers (CMHWs) work as advisors and mentors in each village where MINDS programming is run. The CMHWs go through extensive training that focuses on identifying mental illness, connecting patients to hospital care, advising and educating families of mentally ill, supporting the phase 3 reintegration process and facilitating phase 1 education workshops. The training for CMHWs was developed in partnership with the Nossal Institute for Global Health, adapted from An Introduction to Mental Health: Facilitator‚Äôs Manual for Training Community Health Workers in India by the Nossal Institute for Global Health & BasicNeeds Teacher Training Currently MINDS is developing a training program, based on the WHO advocation of Task-Shifting, which trains teachers at local schools to identify and support mentally ill youth. The program follows a four-step model focused on understanding why mental illness is a problem, identifying possible signs of mental illness in students, supporting students through active listening and de-stigmatization of classrooms and referring students to CMHWs for further consolation and screening. Gender Workshops Additionally, MINDS is considering how discussions and education about gender-specific concerns surrounding mental illness and well-being could further deepen the Phase 1 programming.

Organization and Administration  In order to manage field work, project development and research, MINDS has a multi-level organizational system that combines full-time employees with professional volunteers and advisors around the world. The core team, associates and field team manage the non-profit, monitor the three-phase education treatment & reintegration program and organize ongoing research. The Global and Indian Board of Directors, consisting of notable professors and professionals, monitor the progress of MINDS and support the key values of the NGO. Lastly, the Advisors offer professional advice for program development and research. In addition to the year-round team, board and advisors, MINDS runs a Leadership Development Development Program where interns from across the US partner with members of the core team to receive training and hands-on experience in marketing, publicity, research and program development. The program aims to develop future leaders in the non-profit arena. For students and professionals looking for field experience, the MINDS Fellowship Program allows volunteers to work in Gujarat on research and programing projects.  History  The MINDS Foundation was founded as nonprofit in August 2010 and is registered in Massachusetts as an NGO; additionally it partners with an NGO of the same name located in India, and thus is run through global offices. Currently MINDS runs programs in 19 villages in Gujarat and will expand to other villages in the near future. In India, there is no official mental health policy and resources are extremely limited, with only 0.3 psychiatrists/100,000 people and just 0.06% of the national health budget going towards mental illness education and treatment. Furthermore, rural areas in India tend to be some of the most neglected: out of 626 districts in India, only 125 have any sort of mental health program in place. Health resources in India are usually funded, provided and accessed through the private sector.  Partners and Sponsors  The MINDS Foundation partners with Mount Sinai School of Medicine for program advice and review. MINDS also partners with Sumandeep Vidyapeeth University, located just outside Vadodara. Starting in July 2011, MINDs began working with the Departments of Psychiatry and Community Medicine at Diharaj General Hospital, which provides treatment support and local staff. The MINDS Foundation has campus chapters at Wesleyan University and at GlobeMed at University of Washington. The MINDS Foundation also receives sponsorship, funding or donations from: The Mentor Network, The International Monetary Fund, Newman's Own Foundation, Gray Matters Capital, Google Grants, Hill Holiday, Korn Ferry International, Podio, The Salesforce Foundation, Fried Frank Legal Support, Proskauer Rose LLP, Thomson Reuters Foundation, Health Radio, The Next Mile Project, the Partricelli Center for Social Entrepreneurship, MC Mass Challenge, Dell Social Innovation Challenge, StartingBloc, mHealth Alliance and the Gulbenkian Mental Health Platform.

It is the first feature film ever to be made in the language of Shertukpen, which is an indigenous dialect native to the state Arunachal Pradesh in India. The film premiered on 27 September at the Mumbai International Film Festival in 2013. It received the National Film Award for Best Film in Shertukpen in 2013. Synopsis A middle-aged man named Tashi returns to his native village in Arunachal Pradesh after losing his job. As he waits for word of any new openings in the city, the culture and history of his people begins to have a profound effect on him and force him to reconsider his life and career choices. Production Director Sange Dorjee's idea for the film started when he was considering the social and economic displacement of tribal peoples of India. He mentioned that \\"My generation has had to leave home to get better higher-education and employment outside as the north eastern region doesn‚Äôt have the required infrastructure. The huge cultural difference we faced outside was always a shock to many. Coming back home has always been a difficult proposition, as after years of adjusting to the life outside we suddenly feel like an outsider in our own culture.\\" Due to the film's microbudget, which was wholly funded by the director's father who \\"believed it was important for the community of Arunachal Pradesh\\", Dorjee decided to shoot the movie completely with a Canon 5D camera. He was surprised by the quality of such a standard personal use camera that he and cinematographer Pooja Gupte went ahead with it. Critical reception Crossing Bridges opened to positive acclaim amongst critics. Pooja Gupte's cinematography and the theme of 're- discovering home' were particularly praised, while the films limited appeal to mass audiences but large appeal to film enthusiasts and cinephiles were noted. Suprateek Chatterjee of FirstPost praised the film's simplicity in its production and compared the film to Swades stating, \\"At a time when movies are pulling every trick in the book in an attempt to lure in audiences, Crossing Bridges relies on getting the basics right and transporting its audience to another world\\" Subhash K. Jha of Odisha Sun Times gave the film a 3/5 saying, \\"It‚Äôs that supreme serenity, the splendid synthesis of ambiance and mood that qualifies and eventually absorbs our interest. These dull lives are unique in their absolute lack of affectations.\\" Johnson Thomas of The Free Press Journal gave a positive review and praised the cinematography stating \\"The cinematography by Pooja Gupte, who shot the film in Cannon 5D is simply breathtaking, allowing for a gradual cultural immurement in the land and its spiritual enchantment. The narrative is kept spare and economical by editor Sanglap Bhowmick , while the story-telling limits itself to being drawn on realism rather than melodrama. Needless to say, this film is a completely enveloping experience.\\" Pronoti Datta of Mumbai Boss e-magazine gave the film 3/5 and stated, \\"The state is shown in all its picturesque glory: rolling green valleys, Buddhist monasteries, tribal dancers, phlegmatic villagers with faces weathered by the elements, fast-flowing brooks, snow-dusted trees and so on. But it‚Äôs not just pretty images. Thongdok‚Äôs quiet film in Shertukpen, a dialect spoken in the western part of Arunachal Pradesh, is about a man seduced by his own homeland, which circumstances compel him to revisit.\\" E-magazine India News Hub summarized the film as \\"an honest, return-to-roots story set against a captivating backdrop.\\" in a positive review. BollywoodTrade an online trade magazine was much more critical of the film, giving it a 1.5/5 mentioning how the film has a very little appeal to India's mass audience saying, \\"many of the short, interesting, dramatic, and visually appealing occasional glimpses are not well integrated into the main narrative. That‚Äôs why the film looks disjointed and incoherent.\\" Anup Pandey of e-magazine W14 gave the film 3.5/5 saying, \\"For many such metaphors that the film is built on, Crossing Bridges is quite a revealing journey of a search for identity and to find answers to where does one actually belong.\\" Siraj Syed of FilmFestival.com gave the film a 3/5 saying, \\"If you are likely to be moved to deep emotions and tears by the idea of a Mumbai-based IT professional rediscovering his remote countryside roots in North-East India, and making the life-defining move of permanent homecoming, you will most likely feel you have a seen a minor classic.\\"  References  External links * Category:2013 films Category:Indian films Category:Northeast Indian films ","title":"Crossing Bridges (film)"},{"id":"43365637","text":"150pxThe 100th Battalion (Winnipeg Grenadiers), CEF, was an infantry battalion of the Great War Canadian Expeditionary Force.

Early in his career, Mark was a local reporter, and then worked briefly for The Associated Press. He moved to Washington, D.C., in 2000, to become a House floor/leadership reporter for Congressional Quarterly's daily publication. He then served as editor-in-chief of Campaigns & Elections magazine, which covers the business and trends of politics. Today, Mark is editor-in-chief of the Politix website.

He often speaks to academic, business, educational and international groups, spanning the globe from Australia, Austria, Belgium, Fiji, Finland, France, Israel, Lithuania, The Netherlands, to New Zealand.  Work  Mark's first book, Going Dirty: The Art of Negative Campaigning, was published in March 2006, with two subsequent updated editions. Going Dirty is a history of negative campaigning in American politics and an examination of how candidates and political consultants have employed this often- controversial technique. Going Dirty has gone on to be utilized by numerous college courses and news sources.

Originally published in Astounding Science Fiction under the title We Have Fed Our Sea__, it was a nominee for the 1959 Hugo Award for Best Novel. The original title refers to a line in a poem by Rudyard Kipling. Premise In the scientific speculation that underlies the story, humanity has reached out to the stars in ships that move at half the speed of light. At that speed the ships will take years, decades, even centuries to reach their destinations. And yet the ships' crews serve month-long tours of duty, teleporting to and from their bases on Earth and other worlds instantaneously through what Anderson calls a mattercaster. At the end of Chapter 5 Anderson provides a description of how a mattercaster works. In 1967, Gerald Feinberg hypothesized the existence of tachyons as particles represented by the imaginary solutions of relativistic quantum wave equations, such as the Klein‚ÄìGordon equation. To accommodate that new hypothesis Anderson rewrote his description. Plot summary The first ship that Humanity sent into interstellar space was the Southern Cross, sent on a four-and-a-half century voyage to Alpha Crucis. On autopilot she accelerated at over one hundred gees until she was flying away from Sol at half the speed of light. Then the autopilot shut down the ion drive, the ship went into free fall, and the first crew went into the mattercaster on Earth's moon to be teleported aboard the ship for their month- long tour of duty. Ten generations later, when she is one hundred light years from Sol, Southern Cross receives her last crew, though the four men who come through the mattercaster do not know that they are the last crew. Terangi Maclaren, an astrophysicist of Polynesian ancestry, has convinced officials of the Protectorate, the dictatorship under which he lives, to take a great risk. Previous crews have made observations indicating that Southern Cross will pass close enough to a burnt-out star that she could be diverted, decelerate, and go into orbit around it in order that the crew can make further studies. The risk comes from the fact that if the crew cannot find a roughly asteroid-sized body to provide feedstock for the mattercaster, the Exploration Authority will not be able to teleport enough mercury to the ship to provide enough propellant for Southern Cross to resume her journey to Alpha Crucis. More playboy than scientist, Maclaren is assigned to the mission he had promoted. David Ryerson is a graviticist/tachyonicist born and raised in Scotland's Outer Hebrides. He has just married an Indonesian woman, Tamara Suwito, and has brought her home to meet his father, Captain Magnus Ryerson. The couple are preparing to emigrate to a planet just opened for colonization, but Magnus demands that David first serve a tour on the Southern Cross. Reluctantly David agrees, if only for the extra pay. Seiichi Nakamura lives on Sarai, an Earth- like moon of a gas-giant planet in the 40 Eridani system. He has been selected to serve as Southern Cross's pilot and captain on this particular tour. Old traumas haunt him and his Zen discipline cannot relieve him of his fear of the dark star. Chang Sverdlov, on Krasna, one of the planets of Tau Ceti, has been assigned to be Southern Cross's engineer. Member of a nascent revolutionary movement, he is told to observe anything about the dead star that may be of military value. He is also being sent \\"out of town\\" to allay suspicions that are beginning to arise regarding his loyalty to the Protectorate. Maclaren and Ryerson travel from Earth to the moon together and from the moon teleport onto the Southern Cross. On the ship they find Nakamura and Sverdlov waiting for them and the four men immediately set to the tasks necessary to bring Southern Cross as close as possible to the dead star. As Nakamura backs the ship down its trajectory to put it into a close orbit around the star, the ion drive suddenly begins to vaporize itself and the mattercaster web: they have encountered interference from the star's magnetic field, which is far stiffer than anyone thought possible. In order to avoid crashing into the star Nakamura must fire the drive enough to put the ship into a stable orbit, doing so at the expense of further damage to the drive's ion accelerators and to the mattercaster web. After making the necessary inspections Sverdlov states that the drive can be repaired well enough that the ship can maneuver around the dead star as they need and Ryerson states that he can repair the mattercaster web only to a certain point. To make a full repair of the mattercaster, so that the men can go home, Ryerson needs four kilograms of pure germanium in order to build the large and complex transistors that the web needs. Sverdlov and Ryerson go outside to repair the drive and while Nakamura is testing the drive under Sverdlov's directions, Sverdlov slips and falls, breaches his spacesuit, and dies. Some months later the men find a planet, a ball of nickel-iron alloy a little smaller than Earth. From this planet's material they will extract the germanium that Ryerson needs. But first they must land Southern Cross on the planet and the ship was not meant to land on a planet. Using material scavenged from the ship's landers and other non-essential items, the three men build a tripod to protect the ion drive and the mattercaster web. Nakamura backs the ship down onto the planet, but one leg of the tripod buckles. Acting intuitively, Nakamura turns the ship to protect the mattercaster, but in so doing he puts the control turret he occupies directly under one thousand tonnes of crash-landing spaceship. For weeks Maclaren cuts pieces out of the planet's metal surface and Ryerson extracts the little germanium they contain. Even on short rations they are running out of food. They get the germanium they need, Ryerson makes his transistors and finishes repairing the web, and then the two men begin the task of using their uncalibrated mattercaster to find a resonance that will take them to another ship or base, whence they can be rescued. One day, as they are on the verge of starving to death, they find a resonance. In desperation Ryerson teleports himself to the receiver, leaving the more cautious Maclaren behind. Some time later Maclaren decides to follow Ryerson, but before he can do so Ryerson returns... draped across the arms of an alien wearing a spacesuit full of chlorine. Some months later, still recovering his health from his ordeal, Maclaren goes to Sumatra to meet Ryerson's widow and give her his few small personal possessions. He tells her that the alien had examined his cobbled- together mattercaster, had located and marked resonances that led to his people's ships or bases, and then teleported back to his own ship. It had taken another week for Maclaren to find the resonance that took him to a human base, whence he was rescued. Taking Tamara with him, Maclaren flies his aircar to the Outer Hebrides. She points out the house where Magnus Ryerson waits for them. Maclaren has come to tell Magnus about his son and to answer the old man's questions. Tamara's outburst, crying out the uselessness of going to the stars, touches Maclaren's own doubts. But Magnus simply says, \\"For that is our doom and our pride,\\" quoting from Rudyard Kipling's poem \\"The Song of the Dead\\". Magnus goes on to read from that poem the stanza that begins, \\"We have fed our sea for a thousand years....\\" Maclaren understands then and asks Magnus for his blessing. =Sequel ‚Äì \\"The Ways of Love\\"= First published in Destinies, Vol 1, No 2 (Jan 1979), this novelette was first incorporated into The Enemy Stars in the 1987 Baen Books edition. The story is told in the first person, narrated by Voah, the alien who had brought David Ryerson's body back to the Southern Cross. Native to Arvel, a planet with a chlorine-rich atmosphere, Voah-and-Rero, husband and wife, had been serving a tour of duty on the starship Fleetwing, also headed toward Alpha Crucis, when David Ryerson teleported into their receiver and died. Voah describes how he-and-Rero made the decision that he would take Ryerson's body back to Southern Cross and how he had helped Maclaren by finding and marking the resonances that led to Arvelan mattercasters. Now, ten years later, he-and-Rero have come to Earth to participate in the tenth anniversary celebration of that first contact. In the midst of the celebration the Arvelans are taken secretly to Taiwan to meet with Terangi and Tamara Maclaren. The secret trip has been arranged by Vincent Indigo, their guide and general factotum while they are on Earth. Voah-and- Rero hope that in the time they spend with the Maclarens they will gain new insights into the nature of humans as they differ from Arvelans. During the visit Indigo and three henchgoons invade the Maclaren house and kidnap the Arvelans. When it becomes clear that the kidnappers intend to kill one of them, Voah-and-Rero attack them, killing two of the terrorists and, with the help of Terangi, disabling the other two. Under interrogation Indigo admits that the kidnapping was carried out at the behest of the dictator to convince the Arvelans to withdraw from contact with humans. Voah then decides that he will recommend to his people that they negotiate a treaty that will lead to humans and Arvelans using each other's mattercaster networks. Explanation of the novel's title The Enemy Stars was originally published in Astounding Science Fiction under the title We Have Fed Our Sea__. That title refers to the first stanza of the second part of Rudyard Kipling's poem \\"The Song of the Dead\\",Kipling, Joseph Rudyard, ‚ÄúA Song of the English‚Äù, Hodder & Stoughton, London, 1909, available for reading online at Archive.org https://archive.org/details/songofenglishill00kipluoft which Anderson quoted at the end of his story. The poem refers to the British sailors who have died at sea in their efforts to give England mastery of Earth's oceans, and Anderson discerned an analogous sacrifice that will be made by Terrans in their efforts to reach the stars.

Early chroniclers are in conflict over her parentage. Tomb monument of Stephanie in Santa Mar√≠a la Real, N√°jera, La Rioja. Origins =Parentage= Stephanie was born at an unknown date,II #56, III.1 #145; Moriarty, Plantagenet Ancestry of King Edward III and Queen Philippa of Hainault, p80, 109 and is first recorded as wife of Garc√≠a in a document dated 1038/40. The Chronicle of Saint-Pierre-le-Vif would make Stephanie wife first of Roger I of Tosny, then of Garc√≠a, and sister of Ramon Berenguer I, Count of Barcelona and hence daughter of Berenguer Ramon I, Count of Barcelona. This would call for prohibitively tight chronology, and does not fit with Roger's known widow, Godehildis, marrying a Norman lord. Ad√©mar de Chabannes has Roger marrying an unnamed daughter of Ermesinde of Carcassonne, widow of Ramon Borrell, count of Barcelona and mother of Berenguer Ramon I, but he makes no mention of Roger's wife then marrying Garc√≠a. It is uncertain if the Chronicle misplaced Stephanie by a generation or was mistaken in identifying Roger's wife with the later queen of Navarre. French historians of Languedoc tend to see Garc√≠a's wife as daughter of Ermesinde's brother Bernard-Roger, Count of Bigorre and his wife Garsenda, and thus sister of Gerberge, wife of Ramiro I of Arag√≥n. =Possible first marriage= There are other hints, besides the dubious account of the Chronicle of Saint-Pierre-le- Vif, to an earlier marriage by Stephanie. Histoire G√©n√©rale de Languedoc, giving no quote or source reference, reports the existence of a 1036 marriage contract attributed to Stephanie.Histoire G√©n√©rale de Languedoc; 3rd edn. Tome IV, p. 117, citing Marca (B√©arn), p. 709. An episode related in the Chronica Naierensis tells that a daughter of queen Stephanie by a prior husband was promised as wife to Sancho II of Castile, but she was abducted and married by an illegitimate son of Garc√≠a. Jaime de Salazar y Acha suggests that this represents the authentic account of the marriage of Garc√≠a's bastard son, Sancho Garc√©s, Lord of Uncastillo, to his wife Constanza, though traditional accounts give her different parentage. He recognizes the problem with identifying the father with Roger I of Tosny and follows an alternative reconstruction that would make the Iberian crusader a distinct Roger de Tosny, nephew of Roger I.Jaime de Salazar y Acha, \\"Nuevos datos para la identificaci√≥n familiar de la reina Estefan√≠a de Pamplona\\", Pr√≠ncipe de Viana vol. 68 (2007), no. 242, pp. 853-864 Issue Stephanie had the following children by Garc√≠a: *Sancho IV \\"El de Pe√±al√©n\\", king of Navarre, married Placencia *Ramiro (d.1083), lord of Calahorra *Ferdinand Garc√©s, lord of Bucesta *Raymond Garc√©s \\"the Fratricide\\" (Ram√≥n el Fratricida), lord of Murillo and Cameros *Ermesinda Garc√©s, married Fort√∫n S√°nchez de Yarnoz *Mayor Garc√©sHer alleged marriage to Guy II de Ma√ß√≥n has been contested.

According to the Zhang Zhou PZH Pharmaceutical Company, research on the history of Pien Tze Huang has produced the tale of a royal physician who fled the imperial court with the recipe for PZH, using it to cure scores of locals and increasing its renown as an 'almighty medicine'. Its primary ingredients are musk, ox gallstone, snake gall, and Tienchi. It has been used as a folk remedy for cancer, inflammation, fever, stomach pain, and acne. Modern research While there have been in vitro and animals studies, no clinical trials or studies on humans have so far been performed. Side effects A case of drug-induced pneumonia caused by Pien Tze Huang has been reported. With many traditional Chinese herbal medicines the short-term side effects of headache, nausea or mild gastrointestinal symptoms are frequently seen, although there is little data or statistics due to the lack of research and information.

Its original stated purpose was to provide an \\"international home for tap dance, perpetuate tap as a contemporary art form, preserve it through performance and an archival library, provide educational programming, and establish a formal school for tap dance.\\" History Originally called the American Tap Dance Orchestra (ATDO), the American Tap Dance Foundation was founded in 1986 by tap dancers Brenda Bufalino, Tony Waag, and Charles \\"Honi\\" Coles. Bufalino began working with Coles in 1973 when Bufalino produced the documentary, \\"Great Feats of Feet: Portraits Of the Jazz Tap Dancer\\" featuring Coles and The Copasetics. ATDO's first major engagement was on July 4, 1986, at the Statue of Liberty Festival in Battery Park in lower New York City. For the next 15 years, American Tap Dance Orchestra toured the U.S. and Europe. In 1989, ATDO appeared on PBS \\"Great Performances Tap Dance In America with Gregory Hines\\". =Woodpeckers Tap Dance Center (1989-1995)= On November 10, 1989, the ATDO opened Woodpeckers Tap Dance Center at 170 Mercer Street, near Houston Street in New York City. Mr. Coles served as Woodpeckers's chairman; Gregory Hines (who claimed that Woodpeckers was \\"the world's only tap-only center and had \\"the finest tap floor I've been on\\") was a member of the board. Woodpeckers began creating, producing, and presenting various educational programs for adults and children. It also initiated an annual winter tap intensive with master classes, courses and workshops taught by leading International artists and master tap dancers. A review in The New York Times in 1990 said, \\"The rough-hewn little theater has the air of both a place where hard and serious work is done and a cozy family living room.\\" The Center closed in 1995 due to limited funding. =1996 through 2010= The Intervening Years ATDO continued to perform and offer classes and workshops, renting classroom and rehearsal studios at various NYC locations and presenting new and classic works around the country and the world. Venues included Lincoln Center's Walter Reade Theater, the Sammy Davis Jr. Festival Plaza in L.A., and Gus Giordano's Jazz Dance Congress 96, (Washington, D.C.'s Kennedy Center) as well as on live television in Rome, Italy, at the Stadttheater Furth Germany, and at the Rio de Janeiro Tap Festival, Brazil. A New Name and Focus Towards the end of 2001, ATDO was renamed the American Tap Dance Foundation (ATDF). The reasons were twofold: first, the new name allowed for a broader focus. The change reflected a new generation of tap dancers and a renewed focus on establishing the first-ever Center for Tap ‚Äì an international home for dancers, based in New York City. Bufalino stayed on as an artistic mentor and Tony Waag became the Artistic/Executive Director. The new name also reflected the fact that an organized ensemble no longer existed. In 2009 the Foundation was awarded an American Masterpiece Grant from the National Endowment for the Arts to reconstruct two ATDO pieces, \\"Buff Loves Basie Blues,\\" and \\"Haitian Fight Song,\\". Both have been subsequently performed by ATDF at various venues around the country including Symphony Space and the Joyce Theater in New York City. =A New Home (2010 to the Present)= On January 4, 2010, the ATDF relocated to a 3,000 square foot space in Greenwich Village that includes two large dance studios as well as office space. Activities The ATDF presents a variety of year-round educational programs, performances, festivals, classes, and public city-wide events. =Rhythm in Motion= Rhythm in Motion, is an annual showcase for tap choreographers to showcase their work. The showcase includes works by emerging and established tappers and aims to highlight the \\"rich diversity of contemporary tap dance.\\" In 2015, RIM featured new choreography by MacArthur Fellow, Michelle Dorrance, Brenda Bufalino, Derick K. Grant, Chloe Arnold, and others over a five-day, six-performance program. =Tap City= The ATDF organizes \\"Tap City\\", which has been called, \\"The preeminent annual tap dance festival of the world.\\". This annual week-long international event features classes, panels, screenings, and performances. Highlights include awards ceremonies, concert performances, and Tap it Out, a free, public, outdoor event performed in Times Square by a chorus of 300 people \\"in a pre-choreographed orchestral collage of a cappella unison rhythms, contrapuntal sequences, individual riffs, movements and grooves.\\" =Other= In 2001, ATDF created the annual Hoofer Award to be presented to prominent tap artists as leaders in the community for their unique contribution to the form and for inspiring future generations. Recipients have included: *2001 - Gregory Hines *2002 - Jimmy Slyde and Buster Brown *2003 - Brenda Bufalino *2004 - Dianne Walker, LaVaughn Robinson and Ernest Brown *2005 - Sarah Petronio *2006 - Lynn Dally *2007 - Deborah Mitchell *2008 - Derick K.

It founded the International Tap Dance Hall of Fame in 2002 which includes such notable tap dancers as Bill Robinson, Eleanor Powell, Fred Astaire, the Nicholas Brothers, Jeni Le Gon, Ann Miller, Gregory Hines, and Gene Kelly among many others. ATDF co-created the Gregory Hines Collection of American Tap Dance with the Jerome Robbins Dance Division at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts.

Overview NDA was created by the Ugandan legislature in 1993. It began operations in 1994 as the National Drug Authority (NDA). At that time, the mission of the NDA was to regulate the manufacture, importation, and use of human and veterinary drugs in the country. In 2014, the Ugandan Cabinet approved plans to expand the NDA into the NFDA by adding food, food additives, food supplements, cosmetics, and commercial animal feeds to the items under the organization's supervision. The relevant laws transforming NDA into NFDA are before the Ugandan Parliament for promulgation. Location The headquarters of the NDA was located at 46-48 Lumumba Avenue but has moved to Rummee Towers, in Kampala Central Division, on Nakasero Hill, in the central business district of Kampala, the capital and largest city of Uganda. The coordinates of the head office are 0¬∞19'36.0\\"N, 32¬∞34'32.0\\"E (Latitude:0.326667; Longitude:32.575556). NDA maintains regional offices at the following locations: The agency works in collaboration with the Uganda Ministry of Health and the Uganda Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries. History As far back as 2010, elements of the Uganda government recognized the need to regulate food manufacture, importation, labeling, distribution, and marketing to reduce food and water- borne diseases in the country as well as to ensure food safety. Efforts to assign the regulatory function to the then existing NDA began then. Governance The agency is governed by a 17-person member board, which serves for a four-year renewable term. Its members include the following individuals, effective January 2017: # Medard Bitekyerezo: Chairman # Brigadier Ambrose Musinguzi # Raymond Agaba # Muhammad Mbabali # Yahaya Hills Sekagya # Fadhiru Kamba Pakoyo # Hanifa Sengendo Namaala # Sembatya Kimbowa # Bildard Baguma # Grace Nambatya Kyeyune # Sylvia Angubua Baluka # Rose Okurut Ademun # Baterana Byarugaba # Moses Kamabare # Daniel Obua # Morris Seru # Grace Akullo.

He was a successful artist who worked in Antwerp and Brussels.Frans Jozef Peter Van den Branden, Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche schilderschool, Antwerpen, 1883, pp. 1147‚Äì1148 Life Jan Baptist Morel was born in Antwerp where he was baptized on 26 October 1662. He studied c. 1674 under the Antwerp still life painter Nicolaes van Verendael who specialized in flower pieces and garlands.Jean Baptiste Morel at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Still life with fruit He achieved success as a painter in Antwerp. He married Maria Lomboy on 2 February 1689. The couple had six children. After his wife died in 1696, he was called to Brussels. There was at the time a significant demand for his work there to decorate buildings that were being reconstructed after the vile Bombardment of Brussels by the French. He became a member of the Brussels Guild of Saint Luke in 1699. He obtained commissions from Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria, the governor of the Southern Netherlands, whose palaces in Brussels he decorated.Jan Baptist Morel (referred to as Nicolaas Morel) in: A.J. van der Aa, Biographisch woordenboek der Nederlanden, Volume 12.2, J.J. van Brederode, Haarlem 1852, pp. 1053-4 He returned to Antwerp in 1710 as a wealthy man. He married a second time with Anne-Marie van Heymissen, who came from an aristocratic family of Brussels. He had problems with the local Guild of Saint Luke as he refused to join it. The Guild went so far as to seize works that he had exhibited. The paintings were sold by the Guild in 1713.De liggeren en andere historische archieven der Antwerpsche sint Lucasgilde Volume 2, by Ph. Rombouts and Th. van Lerius, Antwerp, 1864, p. 385, on Google books Flowers before a sculpted pyramid Morel is recorded back to Brussels in 1729 where he had rejoined the local Guild. He is believed to have died in Brussels in 1732.Oeuvres; √©tudes et notices relatives √† l'histoire de l'art dans les Pays- Bas (1920), Volume 2, p. 283 Work Like his master Nicolaes van Verendael, Morel was a still-life painter specialized in flower pieces and garlands. His 'garland paintings' go back on a genre of flower representation invented in early 17th century Antwerp by Jan Brueghel the Elder. The genre was subsequently practised by leading Flemish still life painters, such as Daniel Seghers. Paintings in this genre typically show a flower or, less frequently, fruit garland around a devotional image or portrait. In the later development of the genre, the devotional image was replaced by other subjects such as portraits, mythological subjects and allegorical scenes.Susan Merriam, Seventeenth-Century Flemish Garland Paintings. Still Life, Vision and the Devotional Image, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2012David Freedberg, \\"The Origins and Rise of the Flemish Madonnas in Flower Garlands, Decoration and Devotion\\", M√ºnchener Jahrbuch der bildenden Kunst, xxxii, 1981, pp. 115‚Äì150. Garland paintings were usually collaborations between a still life and a figure painter. Sometimes the still life painter would paint the garland and only much later another painter would add the figures or image in the centre. The centre in some of the garland paintings that have been preserved were never filled by an image. The cartouche in the center of Morel's garland paintings was usually filled with religious imagery and portraits. The Virgin annunciate in a carved niche with a floral garland and its companion piece Christ as salvator mundi in a carved niche with a floral garland (Auctioned at Sotheby's 29‚Äì30 January 2016, New York lot 691) are examples of garland paintings by Morel. These paintings were at an earlier auction by Christie's attributed to Jan Baptist Bosschaert, a contemporary still life painter with whose work Morel's compositions bear a strong similarity.

Richard Neville Aldworth Neville Life The only son of Richard Aldworth of Stanlake, by Catherine, daughter of Richard Neville of Billingbear House, he was born on 3 September 1717; through his mother he was descended from Sir Henry Neville. He was educated at Eton College, where he was on good terms with Lord Sandwich, Lord Rochford, Lord Orford, Owen Cambridge, and Jacob Bryant. On 12 July 1736 he matriculated at Merton College, Oxford. Instead of finishing his course at Oxford Aldworth travelled abroad. In 1739 he visited Geneva, and he spent every winter there till 1744, with other English visitors: John Hervey, 2nd Baron Hervey, William Windham Sr., and Benjamin Stillingfleet. He later contributed to William Coxe's Literary life and Select works of Benjamin Stillingfleet (1811). At the general election of 1747 Neville became Member of Parliament for . He represented from 1754 to 1761, and from 1761 to 1768, and again till 1774. He joined the Whigs, and had the support of the Duke of Bedford. He was appointed under-secretary of state for the southern department on 13 February 1748, under Bedford, and held office till his chief's resignation, 12 July 1751. He was also joint secretary to the council of regency in 1748 and 1750. Aldworth assumed the name and arms of Neville in August 1762, when, on the death of the Countess of Portsmouth, widow of his maternal uncle Henry Neville Grey, he succeeded to the estate of Billingbear. On 4 September 1762 he became secretary to the embassy at Paris. Bedford was acting as British plenipotentiary at the conference then summoned to consider the terms of peace between England and France in the Seven Years' War. Walpole credited Neville with causing a delay in the signature of the preliminaries, till the capture of Havana had become known. By way of reward, Neville was made paymaster of the band of pensioners. On 15 February he arrived in England with the definitive treaty, which had been signed on the 10th at Paris. Billingbear House, Berkshire in 1669 Neville soon returned to Paris to act as plenipotentiary until the arrival of the Earl of Hertford, Bedford's successor, in May 1763. While he was at Compi√®gne in August, John Wilkes visited him; Louis XVI gave him his picture set with diamonds. After his return England he took no significant part in public affairs. He suffered from gout, and died at Billingbear House, after a lingering illness, on 17 July 1793. Family By his wife Magdalen, daughter of Francis Calandrini, first syndic of Geneva, whom he married in 1748, and who died in 1750, Neville had two children: a daughter Frances, who became the wife of Francis Jalabert, and Richard.

He was the first president of the Federation of Canadian Artists (1942‚Äì1944), and was instrumental in the foundation of the Canada Council and the Agnes Etherington Art Centre in Kingston, Ontario. Early years Andr√© Charles Bi√©ler was born in Lausanne, Switzerland on 8 October 1896. His father, Charles Bi√©ler, was director of the Coll√®ge Galliard. His mother Blanche was the daughter of the historian Jean- Henri Merle d'Aubign√© (1794‚Äì1872). His family moved to Paris for twelve years, then immigrated to Canada in 1908. Bi√©ler's father took a position as a teacher at the Presbyterian College, Montreal. Bi√©ler studied at Westmount Academy and then the Institut Technique de Montreal. He intended to study architecture. During World War I (1914‚Äì18) Bi√©ler joined the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry in 1915. He was wounded and seriously gassed. Artistic training and development After being released from the army Bi√©ler studied at the Lyc√©e Carnot in Paris. In 1919 he returned to Canada, then went to Florida to recuperate, where Harry Davis Fluhart (1861‚Äì1938) gave him art lessons. He received a veteran's grant that allowed him to study under Charles Rosen (1878‚Äì1950) and Eugene Speicher (1883‚Äì1962) at the Art Students League of New York in Woodstock, New York. He returned to Montreal, where he became acquainted with members of the Beaver Hall Group. From 1922 to 1926 Bi√©ler spent most of his time in Switzerland, studying under his uncle Ernest Bi√©ler, a painter and muralist. He helped his uncle with several frescoes in the town hall of Le Locle in the Canton of Neuch√¢tel. He also spent some time in Paris, France, and studied at the Acad√©mie Ranson under Maurice Denis (1870‚Äì1943) and Paul S√©rusier (1864‚Äì1927). In 1924 Bi√©ler had his first solo exhibition, at the Montreal Art Association. He lived on the √éle d'Orl√©ans in Quebec from 1927 to 1929, where he painted the habitants. He met A. Y. Jackson (1882‚Äì1974) at this time. In 1930 Bi√©ler set up a studio in Montreal, earning a living by undertaking commercial commissions and by teaching. He and John Goodwin Lyman founded the Atelier art school, which only lasted for a short period. Bi√©ler and Edwin Holgate led the \\"Oxford Group\\" in Montreal, which met in a below-ground room at the Oxford tavern at lunchtime. The group had roughly equal numbers of francophone and anglophone members. Other members were Albert Edward Cloutier, Adrien H√©bert, the art critic Jean Chauvin and the editor Carrier. Bi√©ler worked with Jeannette Meunier, a young interior decorator and designer. Through her he became involved in design of theater sets and costumes, furniture, interiors, fabrics and posters. He promoted interior decoration using the homespun textiles made by spinners and weavers from the lower St. Lawrence region. In 1931 Bi√©ler and Jeannette Meunier married. Bi√©ler often visited the Laurentian Mountains on painting expeditions. In 1935 the Bi√©lers moved to Saint-Ad√®le, a quiet town in the Laurentians. Bi√©ler made some of the illustrations for Kingdom of the Saguenay (1936) by Marius Barbeau. Professor In 1936 Bi√©ler became a professor of art at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. Bi√©ler organized the first conference of Canadian artists in 1941. This led to the foundation of the Federation of Canadian Artists, of which Bi√©ler was the first president. Bi√©ler taught at the Banff School of Fine Arts in the summers of 1940, 1947, 1949 and 1952. In 1953-54 he took a one-year sabbatical from Queen's to study and paint in Europe. Bi√©ler provided impetus that led to the formation of the Canada Council in 1957. He was also the main organizer of the Agnes Etherington Art Centre in Kingston in 1957, and was its first director. He returned to Europe to travel and paint in the summer of 1959. Bi√©ler retired from Queens University in 1963. With more freedom to travel, he visited Mexico in 1964, 1966, and 1972. Bi√©ler belonged to the Canadian Group of Painters and the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts. He developed a pneumatic relief printing press, and formed a company that ran the press. In 1957 he received the J. W. L. Forster Award from the Ontario Society of Artists. He was awarded the Canadian Centennial Medal and an honorary doctorate, and in 1987 was made a member of the Order of Canada. Andr√© Charles Bi√©ler died in Kingston, Ontario on 1 December 1989. He was survived by his wife Jeannette and four children. His son, Ted Bi√©ler, became a well-known sculptor. Work =Style= Bi√©ler's style was closer to that of contemporary French painters, in particular to the \\"School of Paris,\\" then to Canadian movements. His early work shows the influence of his uncle Ernest, with the close attention to line and form essential for stained glass and mosaic work. His later paintings, prints, sculptures and murals treat traditional subjects in a modernist style. He made lively genre pictures of life in rural Quebec, showing figures working in groups or gathering around churches, in harmony with the landscape. He has said, In his later years Bi√©ler reinterpreted many of his earlier sketches in terms of light and colour. Nancy Baele wrote in 1982 of his work, =Selected works= Bi√©ler's major works include: *Large mural, 19 by 16 feet, for the Shipshaw plant of the Aluminum Company of Canada, depicting hydro electric power and the aluminum industry in the Quebec region of Lac Saint Jean and the Saguenay River (1945‚Äì48) *Large painting for Canadian Pulp and Paper Association (1948) *Mural for Veterans' Affairs Building, Ottawa (1955) *Seventy five colour woodcuts for the Queen Elizabeth Hotel, Montreal (1957) *Mosaic mural for Chalmers United Church, Kingston (1957) *Mosaic mural for the Frontenac Wall & Tile, Kingston (1958) *Mural for Procter & Gamble, Dorval (1958) *Plaster & aluminum relief mural for Aluminum Laboratories, Kingston (1968). =Exhibitions= Bi√©ler held more than twenty five solo exhibitions in locations that included Geneva, Montreal, Kingston, Quebec City, Edmonton, Calgary, Banff, Winnipeg, Ottawa, Toronto, and San Miguel de Allende in Mexico. Major retrospective exhibitions were held at the Agnes Etherington Art Centre in Kingston in 1963, showing 115 works, and in 1970. The 1970 retrospective titled Andr√© Bi√©ler, 50 years: a retrospective exhibition 1920-1970 traveled to ten galleries in Canada.

He is the founder and managing partner of Mediafin.  Education and career  T√©treau was born in Soissons, France, and attended the Jesuit school Lyc√©e Saint-Louis-de- Gonzague in Paris. He graduated from HEC Paris in 1992 with a degree in entrepreneurship. He has worked for international organizations such as the European Council on Foreign Relations, AXA Private Equity in New York City, and Schroders in London. In 2004, he founded Mediafin, a strategic consulting firm through which he advises a number of European industrial families, financial institutions and CEOs of European Fortune 500 companies. A weekly columnist for French financial newspaper Les √âchos, he writes on matters concerning politics, digital challenges, and finance, from a pro-European perspective. He is a regular television commentator and radio contributor on macroeconomic and policy issues. T√©treau serves as a trustee of the Committee for Economic Development (CED), a public policy organization based in Washington, D.C. He is also a member of the Advisory Board of La Maison Fran√ßaise at Columbia University and an affiliate professor at HEC Paris, where he taught a course titled \\"Managing in times of financial crises.\\"  Writing  T√©treau has frequently called for the creation of the \\"United States of Europe\\" in his articles in Le Monde and Le Figaro and Les √âchos, and in his public interventions with the French Parliament, in China, and in New York City. In his book Analyste, published in 2005, T√©treau discusses the excesses and short-termism of the financial system during the internet bubble.T√©treau, √âdouard. Analyste: au c≈ìur de la folie financi√®re, Paris, √âditions Grasset et Fasquelle, 2005 T√©treau then published his second book 20 000 milliards de dollars upon his return to France in the fall of 2010, after having spent three years in New York City. The book discusses the national debt of the United States following the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis and the country's transition from the Bush to the Obama administration.T√©treau, √âdouard. 20.000 milliards de dollars, Paris, √âditions Grasset et Fasquelle, 2010 It was later translated to Chinese and published by China Citic Press. T√©treau is also the author of Quand le dollar nous tue, published by Grasset in 2011. His book, Au-del√† du mur de l‚Äôargent, was published on 9 September 2015 by French publisher Stock. It follows an Autumn 2014 briefing paper for the Vatican's Pontifical Council for Culture, calling for an intervention of Pope Francis in New York in September 2015, during the Pope's scheduled visit to the U.S.http://www.cortiledeigentili.com/template/default.asp?i_menuID=45152 The book warns of the risks of a major and imminent \\"accident\\" in the global economy. It offers concrete answers for an alternative economic model based upon \\"Pope Francis economics\\" and various teachings from other religions, which, like many secular philosophies, give priority to the poorest and most fragile elements of our societies. On 16 February 2016, in a much discussed opinion piece in Le Figaro, T√©treau described a Brexit as a \\"tremendous opportunity\\" for France, writing that an EU without Britain would be dominated by a Franco-German bloc that would be able to proceed with closer integration of the EU in a way that would not be possible if the UK were to remain. T√©treau argued that it was Britain that was most responsible for enlarging the European Union to include the nations of Eastern Europe as a way of weakening the Franco-German bloc which had dominated the European Economic Community (as the EU was known until 1993) since its founding with the 1957 Treaty of Rome. T√©treau maintained that none of the Eastern European nations should have been admitted to the EU, and that an EU without Britain would not take in new members that did not belong. Furthermore, T√©treau argued that it was the expansion of the EU into Eastern Europe that caused the war in the Ukraine as it awakened \\"Russia's paranoia\\" and argued that British participation in the Iraq war had gratuitously damaged Europe's relations with the Muslim world. T√©treau maintained that an EU without the United Kingdom would have better relations with both Russia and the Muslim world. Finally, T√©treau argued that if a Brexit were to occur, it would allow the French to make Paris the financial and economic capital of Europe in place of London as a number of multinational firms, especially American firms would relocate to Paris in order to maintain access to the European common market.  Recognition  On 16 March 2000, as a financial analyst for Cr√©dit Lyonnais, T√©treau published an analysis of an imminent internet crash titled \\"Take your e-profits before a potential e-crash.\\" In Mercury Rising, he predicted the danger of bankruptcy for Vivendi Universal, leading to the departure of Vivendi head Jean-Marie Messier. In 2005, T√©treau received the S√©nat Reader Prize for an Economics Book for his book Analyste: au c≈ìur de la folie financi√®re.6600 lecteurs- internautes ont √©lu en ligne √âdouard T√©treau Prix des lecteurs du Livre d'√âconomie 2005 On 10 May 2006, T√©treau spoke before the French Senate‚Äôs Commission on Finances, underlining the need for the French economy and society to prepare itself for an inevitable, brutal end to the period of financial excess and overabundance. In China, where T√©treau's last book was published in 2012, he became a 2013 Young Leader of the France China Foundation Programme.

Synopsis  In 2011, protests against Syrian president Bashar al-Assad turned into a violent conflict between the Syrian government and revolutionaries. As the revolution continues, wealthy Syrian socialite-turned-activist Razan teams up with Syrian-American lobbyist Mouaz to forge a link between the Free Syrian Army, the Syrian Emergency Task Force, and the West.

It stars Edward Furlong in three roles, playing different personalities of the same character, who prepares for the end of the world by sequestering himself in a Las Vegas hotel while he grapples with existential questions. The score was composed by musician Slash. It premiered at the Morelia International Film Festival in 2010 and was released in Mexico on January 28, 2011.  Plot  Concerned that he cannot remember his past, Pete Nelson prepares for the end of the world by going to Las Vegas. In his hotel room, three distinct personalities emerge and argue with each other over the nature of reality and how to best spend the remaining time. The first personality, a bitter man who blames his failed life on \\"the system\\", wants to explore his forgotten past. The second personality, a drunken hedonist, wants to leave the hotel and take advantage of the prostitution and gambling in Las Vegas. A third personality, which emerges after debates between the first two, questions the nature of reality and states that they are all fictional characters in the screenplay of a hack writer. Eventually, a ghost appears, whom Pete identifies as Jimmy, a friend who died years ago. Jimmy points out plot holes in the film, including the fact that he can perceive each of the three personalities. With this evidence, Pete's personalities become more convinced that they are in a film, though they also debate the idea that he whole situation is a dream, which the third personality decries as further evidence that the writer is a hack. Nelson experiences a series of hallucinations or dreams in the form of parodic short films and trailers laced with conspiracy theories. One lampoons the Apple \\"think different\\" ad campaign and states that anyone who actually thinks differently is assassinated. Another posits a cabal of world leaders and businessmen who control the world through a company called Propaganda. Films like Empire Strikes Back, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Delta Force, Leaving Las Vegas, and The Holy Mountain are spoofed, mentioned or referenced. There is a scene where Pete confronts the audience (and himself) by breaking the fourth wall and threatening to kill the camera. The first personality tires of the other two personalities and shoots both. Jimmy's ghost then shoots him, but Pete does not die. Instead, the CEO of Propaganda reappears as a disembodied voice and guides Pete to place where they can talk face-to-face. There, the man reveals himself as a former CIA agent and the screenwriter who created Pete. Depressed about his lack of success in finishing the screenplay, the writer explains that he has become suicidal and threatens to kill himself, which was the source of the apocalypse in Pete's world. The writer berates Pete for derailing the writing process and taking over the character. Pete is unable to talk the writer out his course of action, and the film ends as the writer shoots himself in the head.  Cast  * Edward Furlong as Pete Nelson * Peter Coyote as CEO of Propaganda / screenwriter * Edi Gathegi as Ghost of Jimmy  Production  The film was shot in Mexico City and Las Vegas and was produced from 2003 to 2008 with a budget of $3 million. Slash scored the film, and it features songs by Monster Magnet. The Deleted scenes available in the Blu-ray edition include an animated sequence where Alice Cooper plays on the soundtrack.  Release  This Is Not a Movie premiered at the Morelia International Film Festival and was released in Mexico on January 28, 2011. Lorber released it on DVD in the United States on March 20, 2012.  Reception  Howard Feinstein of Screen Daily wrote that the themes are \\"all wrong for a film\\" and \\"go nowhere\\". Harry H. Long of the Lebanon Daily News said the film's themes are unclear and scattershot, but the film is \\"masterfully done\\" and features a \\"tour-de-force performance\\" from Furlong. Jamie S. Rich of DVD Talk rated it 0.5/5 stars and wrote that although the film is not poorly made, the writing is shallow and immature. Devon Ashby of CraveOnline rated it 2.5/10 stars and wrote that it \\"[fails] to compensate for its lack of superficial content with convincing thematic resonance or formal commentary\\". Luis Tovar of Mexican newspaper La Jornada wrote that the film \\"is a terrific con-job that allows the filmmaker to, among other things, navigate convincingly between fantasy and reality\\".

From 1922 to 1942 he was a curator at the Freer Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.\\"Bishop, Carl Whiting (1881‚Äì1942),\\" David Shavit, ed., The United States in Asia (Greenwood 1990) p. 48. At his death Bishop was praised for his ability to synthesize a wide range of evidence and present them \\"in ordered and highly engaging fashion\\", which was \\"the best sort of popularization of prehistory\\". He argued for the then popular theory of hyperdiffusionism, the theory that all civilizations originated in one place and spread to others, in this case, from the Near East to China. He was criticized, however, for going beyond the accepted evidence. Early years  Bishop was born on July 12, 1881, in Tokyo, Japan, where his parents were Methodist missionaries. He attended the English School in Tokyo from 1888 to 1897. In 1898 he entered the Northwestern Academy, Evanston, Illinois, then attended DePauw University, in Greencastle, Indiana, from 1901 to 1904; Hampden-Sydney College in Hampden-Sydney, Virginia, 1905‚Äì06; and Business College in Poughkeepsie, New York, from 1906 to 1907. Bishop developed his interest in anthropology and archaeology during 1907‚Äì12 when he traveled in the southwestern United States and Central America and was silver assayer in Mexico during the Yaqui Wars there in 1905‚Äì06. He returned to DePauw University and received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1912 and in 1913 was awarded a Master of Arts degree by the Department of Anthropology at Columbia University. On February 24, 1909, Bishop married Nettie E. Brooks (1893‚Äì1933) in Tarrytown, New York. The couple had six children. His second wife was Daisy Furscott Bishop (1887‚Äì1966). Career Bishop began his professional career as a member of Harvard University's Peabody Museum Expedition to Central America in 1913. In 1914 he became Associate Curator of Oriental Art at the University of Pennsylvania Museum, and traveled to China for the first time from 1915 to 1917. He joined the United States Navy during World War I, serving in naval intelligence. From 1918 to 1920, Bishop was lieutenant, junior grade and served as assistant naval attach√© in Shanghai. He became a professor of archaeology at Columbia University in October 1921, and in April 1922, he joined the Freer Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution. He served as Associate Curator, then Curator, from 1922 until his death in 1942. The Freer appointed Bishop with a mandate to undertake archaeological research and excavation in China, where he spent nine of his twenty years with the Freer. The first expedition lasted from February 20, 1923, until August 6, 1927. The second trip to China lasted from November 16, 1929, until April 11, 1934. The first tour was only partially successful but began optimistically. Shortly after arriving in China in 1923, Bishop responded to reports of the discovery of ancient ritual bronzes in Xinzheng (Hsin Cheng), Henan, the legendary home of the Yellow Emperor. There he met and befriended Li Ji, an American trained Chinese archeologist who had himself recently returned to China. Bishop reported to the Smithsonian that the situation in Xinzheng was \\"most deplorable, in that no trained investigator was present to show how the objects could be removed from their setting without injury to themselves and to note down the information brought to light in the course of the digging but now, of course, lost forever.\\" He felt fortunate to enlist Li Ji, who he employed for the Smithsonian and provided advanced training. Bishop negotiated with the Historical Museum in Peking to be appointed an archaeological adviser to the Chinese government. According to Bishop's plan, the Smithsonian Institution was to be the sole foreign excavator and exporter of objects, though the work was to be carried out with Chinese colleagues. Unfortunately for these plans, China at this time was in a state of reaction against foreign intrusions and a foreign archaeologist could not get permission to dig. Fighting between warlord armies made the situation worse, and even Bishop's headquarters in Peking came under gunfire or air raids. Chinese were often suspicious that Westerners had come to China to dig for artifacts to take out of the country. Li Ji left Bishop to join the Academia Sinica, where he went on to become one of the founders of Chinese modern archaeology, and he was one of the Chinese archaeologists who helped to draft laws that prohibited foreigners from conducting digs or exporting antiquities. Bishop wrote in his journal: :We had already long since learned that under conditions as they existed in China at that time, official permits alone were apt to have a negative rather than positive value. They by no means assured us of liberty to proceed with an enterprise unmolested; but without them we were certain to be hindered, blackmailed, or even stopped altogether. (Feb. 1925). Feeling frustrated and disillusioned, Bishop left China in 1927. When he returned to China in 1929, opposition to foreign archaeology had strengthened, and foreign archaeologists could do little useful excavation. By 1934, the directors of the Freer Gallery concluded that the benefits from Bishop's expeditions did not justify the $30,000 annual expense and abandoned the program. Bishop as a photographer Bishop's contributions to photography were also lasting. When he first arrived in China in 1915, he set out to record sites of interest in Peking, and succeeded in photographing most of them. His photographs of imperial sites now stand as almost unique parts of the documentary record., pp. 17, 110‚Äì111, 142‚Äì143. Bishop also used his spare time to photograph street life and social customs, architecture (especially historic buildings), and scenery. These photographs, which Bishop classified with his own system and annotated with extensive notes, were not put on display, but mounted in twelve notebooks, though the negatives were kept in storage at the Smithsonian. Some 4,000 of these images are included in the Carl Whiting Bishop Papers Brill Publishers microform edition.Carl Whiting Bishop Papers Advocacy of hyperdiffusionism Bishop produced a series of articles presented \\"in ordered and highly engaging fashion\\", arguing for hyperdiffusionism, the theory that all civilizations originated in one place and spread to others. Among the scholars influenced by Bishop was Owen Lattimore, who was intrigued by Bishop's emphasis on geography as a shaping factor in Chinese civilization and his emphasis on field work rather than library research., p. 24 Roswell Britton, however, criticized Bishop's 1942 Handbook in the Far Eastern Quarterly for going beyond the evidence. Bishop, wrote Britton, argued that :the ingredients of progress are represented as flowing eastward into China, mostly by the steppe belt and a little (rice, chicken, metallurgy) by the southern route which coincides in part with the Burma Road. China appears an outpost of the Old World civilization, a sub-center of diffusion enlightening the Far East. There is no consideration of possible westward drift in early time, notwithstanding that cases in Han time and later are well known. Britton added that Bishop was \\"not at ease in the Chinese language, and contributions of a decisive order are consequently missed...\\" But he concluded that \\"the serious student will prize this Handbook as Mr. Bishop's final work, and value his correlations of cultural milestones in the Near and Far East even though overworked unilaterally, and willingly allow for inconsistencies of individual interpretation with mentioned archaeological fact.

Education and academic career Schirn completed his doctoral degree at the University of Freiburg in 1974 with a thesis on identity and synonymy in logic and semantics and subsequently taught at University of Oxford, University of Cambridge and Michigan State University. Schirn‚Äôs research during this time focused on theories of meaning and intensional semantics. He continued working in this area at the University of California at Berkeley, St. John‚Äôs College (Oxford), Harvard University and at Wolfson College (Oxford). In 1985, Schirn was awarded his habilitation at the University of Regensburg. Since 1987 he has held a distinguished Fiebiger- Professorship at the University of Munich (LMU) and since 2012 he has been a member of the Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy. He has also taught at the University of Minnesota (1989), the State University of Campinas (1991), the Catholic University of S√£o Paulo (1998), the National University of Buenos Aires (1992), the National Autonomous University of Mexico (1993, 1994, 1997), the National University San Marcos in Lima (2009) and numerous other universities in Europe and Latin America.

He has given invited lectures at the most prestigious universities in Europe, Asia, Latin America and South Africa as well as at some of the most distinguished universities in the United States of America and Australia. In 2014, he delivered a series of lectures on Frege‚Äôs philosophy of mathematics at the University of Oxford and carried out related research at Wolfson College. In the same year, he was invited to work as a research professor at Kyoto University and received a research fellowship from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science. Research Schirn has made contributions to the philosophy of language and epistemology and is best known for his work on Frege‚Äôs logic and philosophy of mathematics as well as on Hilbert‚Äôs metamathematics and related issues in the history and philosophy of logic and the foundations of mathematics. Concerning Frege‚Äôs philosophy of mathematics, Schirn has more recently focused and published on the introduction of logical objects by means of second-order abstraction principles, their logical, semantic and epistemological nature, the problem of referential indeterminacy of abstract singular terms to which those principles give rise in a Fregean context, the foundations of real analysis and of geometry and last but not least on some aspects of neo-logicism. In a series of articles co-authored by Karl-Georg Niebergall, Niebergall and Schirn presented Hilbert‚Äôs finitist proof-theoretic approach in a new light by paying close attention to the development of his metamathematical work in the period 1922-1939 and by using the logical resources of modern proof theory. One important result of their published work is that Peano Arithmetic proves its own consistency indirectly in one step and that recursively enumerable extensions of QF-IA (QF = quantifier free ‚Äî IA = induction axiom) likewise prove their own consistency indirectly in one step. Schirn and Niebergall are also known for their analysis of Hilbert‚Äôs extensions of the finitist point of view in the light of G√∂del‚Äôs incompleteness theorems and their attempted refutation of W. W.

It was selected to compete for the Golden Lion at the 71st Venice International Film Festival. It was also screened in the Special Presentations section of the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival. Plot Pier Paolo Pasolini (Willem Dafoe) is fifty-three, and lives in the rowdy Rome of the 1970s. He has just finished shooting his latest film Sal√≤, or the 120 Days of Sodom, a film that has shocked both critics and audiences. Pasolini is increasingly opposed by the people, critics and politicians, both for his homosexuality, and because he is considered impulsive and scandalous in showing his reality to the public. Pasolini is going to shoot a new film (which was never made), in which he cast Eduardo De Filippo (Ninetto Davoli) and Ninetto Davoli (Riccardo Scamarcio) - with whom he has a special relationship. While Pasolini is working on the film, his mother (Adriana Asti) and his sister try to dissuade him from the project, because it would be too wild and visionary for the Italian public to accept. Pasolini continues with his work, missing many interviews with journalists. He begins a relationship with a boy from the suburbs of Rome, Pino Pelosi, and takes him to a restaurant in the seaside village of Ostia. Pasolini wants to be with him in a loving relationship, but the boy gets mad at him, attacking him and some other companions. Pasolini is later beaten up, and then run over with his own car. In the days following, the press says Pasolini's murder was politically motivated by the police and those whom the poet had always loved and immortalized in his works. Cast * Willem Dafoe as Pier Paolo Pasolini * Ninetto Davoli as Eduardo De Filippo * Riccardo Scamarcio as Ninetto Davoli * Valerio Mastandrea as Domenico \\"Nico\\" Naldini * Adriana Asti as Susanna Pasolini * Giada Colagrande as Graziella Chiarcossi * Maria de Medeiros as Laura Betti * Francesco Siciliano as Furio Colombo * Luca Lionello as narrator Production According to Ferrara, his plans to make a film about Pasolini have gone far back as the 1990s. Originally, the project was not meant to have been an actual biopic of Pasolini's life. Instead, it was to have starred Zo√´ Tamerlis Lund as \\"a female director living the life that Pasolini lived.\\" However, Lund's death prevented this idea. Reception On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 79% approval rating, based on 52 reviews, with a weighted average of 6.9/10.

She was a member of the Tuscan branch of the Imperial House of Habsburg, an Archduchess of Austria and Princess of Tuscany by birth. Born and raised in the twilight years of the Austrian Empire, Archduchess Assunta lived in exile in Barcelona, Spain after the fall of the Habsburg monarchy. She entered religious life in a convent in Barcelona, but was forced to leave it in 1936 due to disturbances during the Spanish Civil War. In 1939, she married Joseph Hopfinger, a Polish doctor. In 1942 the couple emigrated to the United States. Archduchess Assunta and her husband had two daughters, but they divorced in 1950. She moved to San Antonio, Texas where she had a variety of jobs living in anonymity until her death.  Early life Archduchess Assunta of Austria was born on 10 August 1902 in Vienna, Austria. She was the eighth of ten children of Archduke Leopold Salvator of Austria (1863‚Äì1931) and his wife Infanta Blanca of Spain (1868‚Äì1949). She was given the baptismal names Assunta Alice Ferdinandine Blanca Leopoldina Margarethe Beatrix Raphaela Michaela Philomena.McIntosh, The Archduchess From Texas, p. 36 Archduchess Assunta grew up in the last period of the Habsburg monarchy. She was raised with her many brothers and sisters in the various properties owned by her parents enjoying a comfortable and privileged life. Their main residence was the Palais Toskana in the district of Wiede in Viena with Schloss Wilhelminenberg, on the Eastern slopes of the Gallitzinberg, in the Wienerwald Western parts of the Austrian capital as their country state. Vacations were spent near Viareggio, Italy where Infanta Blanca owned, la Tenuata Real, a rural property. Theirs was a multicultural household as Assunta's paternal ancestors had reigned in Austria, Tuscany and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Her maternal family had reigned in Spain, Parma, Modena, Portugal and France. The youngest of five sisters, Archduchess Assunta was raised paired with her sister Archduchess Maria Antonia.  Exile Archduchess Assunta was sixteen years old at the fall of Habsburg monarchy, following the end of World War I. This marked a sharpdown turn in her family's prosperity. The republican government of Austria confiscated the properties of the Habsburgs. The family lost all their fortune.McIntosh, The Unknown Habsburgs, p. 48 Assunta's eldest brothers, Archdukes Rainer and Leopold, remained in Austria and they recognized the new republic. The rest of the family moved to Spain in January 1919. They settled in Barcelona living with simplicity as they had limited means. Assunta's three elder sisters, Archduchess Dolores, Inmaculata and Margaretha were pliable; Archduchesses Assunta and Maria Antonia were more rebellious and clashed often with their mother Infanta Blanca. While living in Barcelona, Assunta following in the footsteps of her sister, Maria Antonia, turned increasingly towards religion.Harding, Lost Waltz, p. 115 Although their parents were observant Catholics, they found their youngest daughters religious fervor worrisome. Archduchess Maria Antonia abandoned her desire to become a nun and married an impoverished Majorcan aristocrat, but Assunta remained adamant in her determination to become a nun.Harding, Lost Waltz, p. 135 After running away in a ship to South America, Assumpta, still a minor, was returned to her parents who relented their opposition.Harding, Lost Waltz, p. 140 With their permission, she entered the convent of Santa Teresa de Tortosa near Barcelona.Harding, Lost Waltz, p. 145 At the outbreak of the Spanish civil war, the convent was attacked and the nuns were forced to flee for their lives. Those, like Assunta, who had not yet taken their final vows were free to follow a secular life. Assunta obtained permission to leave her order and joined her mother and unmarried siblings who were then living in Viareggio.Harding, Lost Waltz, p. 237 In the late 1930s, through one of her brothers, Archduchess Assunta met Joseph Hopfinger (1905-1992), a Jewish Polish doctor.Harding, Lost Waltz, p. 280 Against her mother opposition, they married in September 1939 at Ouchy, Switzerland. Shortly after, her husband was called to service in the army until the fall of France when he was demobilized.Harding, Lost Waltz, p. 281 They were reunited in London and moved to Barcelona where their eldest daughter, Teresa, was born in October 1940.Harding, Lost Waltz, p. 282  Later life The German persecution of the Jews compelled them to leave Europe. Both of her husband's parents were killed by the Russians, as their property was within the mineral-rich region of modern-day Lviv, Ukraine. As her husband was Jewish, they decided to emigrate to the United States with the help of Assunta's brothers, Leopold and Franz Joseph, who were living in America and paid for their trip to New York.Harding, Lost Waltz, p. 291 Assuntas's husband worked as a doctor and a second daughter was born in New York City in 1942.Harding, Lost Waltz, p. 292 Archduchess Assumpta had two daughters from her marriage to Joseph Hopfinger: * Maria Teresa Hopfinger b. 5 Dec 1940 ‚àû (1961-1967) Edward Joseph Hetsko, Jr ‚àû 1969 Anatole Ferlet.

However, the marriage was not a success.McIntosh, The Archduchess From Texas, p. 37 Assunta's husband, having married a European princess, had hoped to inherit a fortune from his wife. As this never materialized, he became disenchanted with the marriage. The couple separated after the war, divorcing on 25 July 1950. Archduchess Assunta moved with her daughters to San Antonio Texas where she lived for the rest of her life. She remained very attached to the catholic church and held a variety of jobs to support herself. For some time she worked as a claim clerk. Late in her life, she made one trip to Europe to visit her surviving siblings. She died on 24 January 1993 at age 90 at San Antonio, Texas, U.S.A Notes Ancestry Bibliography *Harding, Bertita.

He played as a half-back ‚Äì at wing half in the early part of his career, and at centre half later on ‚Äì and could also play as a forward. Life and career Burridge was born in Beamish, County Durham, in 1898. He was playing for Houghton Rovers in the North Eastern League in April 1921, but in November he signed for Third Division North club Darlington from Northern Alliance club Annfield Plain. Despite interest from \\"clubs in higher spheres\\", he was reported as preferring to remain near home. In the 1924‚Äì25 Football League season, Darlington were promoted to the Second Division as champions of the Northern Section. Burridge was not a regular member of the side, but his versatility ‚Äì he could play across the half-back line or as a forward ‚Äì meant he was able to establish himself as first reserve, and the supporters included him among those to receive a presentation in appreciation of the team's success. Burridge became one of a number of new signings from the lower leagues made by Second Division champions Sheffield Wednesday ahead of their First Division campaign. He played only rarely in his first season with Wednesday, and although the ¬£2,000 proceeds of his sale helped Darlington financially, his absence significantly weakened their team and they were relegated in 1926. By November 1927, he was playing more regularly for the first team, and the Derby Daily Telegraph assessed his strengths as \\"resolute tackling and robust defensive work\\". In 1928‚Äì29, Burridge appeared twice as Wednesday won the League championship and made a greater contribution to their reserve team winning the Central League title. In his last season with Wednesday, he again appeared twice as they retained their title, and then joined Second Division Oldham Athletic for an undisclosed fee. A year later, he moved back into non-league football. By now playing at centre half, he captained Macclesfield to the 1931‚Äì32 Cheshire County League championship and appeared less frequently the following season as they retained the title. After a season with Hyde United, Burridge made his debut for Hurst in a Cheshire League match against former club Macclesfield. He remained with Hurst as a player into the war years, making more than 100 appearances in all competitions, and was appointed player-manager in 1935 and acting secretary in 1937. Burridge died in 1977 at the age of 79.

He was a candidate for Attorney General of the District of Columbia in 2014 and a former adviser to the FCC. Early life and education Smith was born in Washington, D.C. and grew up in the working-class neighborhoods of Congress Heights and LeDroit Park. His family moved to the District of Columbia in 1943 and he is the third generation to live there. His father taught physics at Ballou High School and his mother worked in the federal government. After winning scholarships to attend the Beauvoir School and the Potomac School, Smith earned a Bachelor's degree with honors from Brown University, where he was captain of the track team, and a J.D. from Harvard Law School. Career Smith began his legal career as an associate attorney at the Washington, D.C. law firm Hogan & Hartson. After several years with the firm, he left to work on Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign. After the election, he was named Deputy General Counsel of the Presidential Inaugural Committee, and then joined the Department of Commerce, where he worked on the economic development of low-income communities. At the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, Smith was named Program Director of the State Broadband Data and Development Grant Program. Under his leadership, and with funds allocated by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the SBDDGP established the $4.7 billion Broadband Technology Opportunities Program, which extended and developed broadband services to reach rural and underserved areas, improved broadband access for public safety agencies, and provided financial assistance to low-income families to facilitate the transition from analog to digital television.Broadband Stimulus Post-Game Recap October 5, 2010National Telecommunications and Information Administration Smith later joined the FCC, where he was appointed Chief of Staff and Senior Counsel of the Incentive Auction Task Force, a multibillion-dollar radio spectrum allocation project assessing whether to set bidding limits on Verizon and AT&T;, ensuring that the wavelengths at auction remained reserved for smaller carriers. On May 15, 2014, he spoke before an open meeting of the FCC in favor of bidding limits, and the Commissioners subsequently voted 3-2 in favor of the limits. Following his campaign for Attorney General, Smith joined DC government to run the District of Columbia's Justice Grants Administration. He then rejoined the FCC as an advisor before joining the law firm DLA Piper. He works with DC Vote, an organization that advocates for D.C. voting rights, and he sits on the Board of Directors of the We the People Project, which pursues litigation in support of ‚Äúfull and equal citizenship‚Äù for residents of D.C. and U.S. territories. Campaign for Attorney General On July 12, 2014, Smith announced his candidacy for D.C. Attorney General at the former home of his grandmother in Washington, D.C.'s Shaw neighborhood. Smith emphasized the need for reform of D.C.'s juvenile justice system. He saw the Attorney General's role as ‚Äúcooperative‚Äù with the Council of the District of Columbia, and has expressed disagreement with sitting Attorney General Irvin B. Nathan's contention that the 2012 budget autonomy act approved by the Council violates the District of Columbia Home Rule Act. On August 6, the campaign submitted 6,500 petition signatures, more than double the 3,000 required to get Smith's name on the ballot. Shortly before Smith's campaign finance report was released on August 11, he announced he had raised over $185,000 during the first fundraising quarter of the campaign, including more from outside donors than all other Attorney General candidates combined (Karl Racine raised nearly $257,000, but he donated or loaned $225,000 of that total to his own campaign). According to the finance report, Smith's campaign paid a company owned by Jauhar Abraham for petition signature collection. In an interview at the hearing for S.132, the New Columbia Admission Act, Smith told an interviewer at The Atlantic that ‚Äúas Americans, under no conditions should issues of political convenience or expedience dictate fundamental rights. The fact that [D.C. statehood] might prove politically inconvenient for either party is not a just reason for continuing to deny citizens those rights.‚Äù A mid-October poll conducted by local NPR affiliate WAMU and the Washington City Paper showed Smith tied for second place with Lorie Masters and Paul Zukerberg behind Karl Racine, although a large plurality remained undecided. According to the City Paper, Smith's campaign tried to persuade two of his rivals, Lorie Masters and Paul Zukerberg, to drop out of the race in order to ‚Äú[consolidate] the anti-Racine vote,‚Äù but both rivals declined. =Endorsements= * Metropolitan Washington Council AFL-CIOKaminski, Matthew. \\"What Labor Wants.\\" Wall Street Journal.

It belongs to the Diocese of Lule√•. The church is the largest medieval church in the Swedish land of Norrland. It forms a part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Gammelstad Church Town. History One of the medieval frescos, made by a pupil of Albertus Pictor The presently visible stone church was probably preceded by a wooden chapel. Construction of the stone church started in the 15th century and continued into the early 16th century. The church was however inaugurated already in 1492, by Jakob Ulvsson, Archbishop of Uppsala. Arrowslits preserved in the church indicate that apart from its religious use, it also served a defensive purpose. The church remained largely unchanged until the 18th century. In 1745 the medieval frescos were painted over, and during the same decade the windows were enlarged. In 1776-78 the church was painted red, externally, a new entrance was made and more windows added. In 1848 the windows were altered, again. Successive changes to the interior, with old furnishings removed and new added, have also been carried out since the 18th century. During a renovation in 1909 the medieval frescos were uncovered again and the choir portal regained its original appearance, which had been altered during the 18th century. Additional renovations have been carried out in 1936, 1954 and 1969-71. The free-standing bell tower dates from 1851 and replaced an earlier, wooden bell tower. The two bells date from 1554 and 1684, but have both been re-cast in later times. Architecture The altarpiece (1520), one of the finest of its kind in Sweden The church is built of fieldstone (consisting of about 40 types of rock), with details made of brick. The roof is made of shake, as was the original roof. The church is surrounded by a wall in which two lychgates are preserved. Inside, the church is a vaulted single- nave church with a choir of the same height as the nave. A sacristy protrudes from the northern fa√ßade, and a church porch from the southern. The vaults are decorated with frescos, probably made by a pupil of Albertus Pictor. Among the church furnishings, the altarpiece is the most noteworthy. It dates from circa 1520 and was made in Antwerp. Its central part contains intricately carved figures depicting the Passion of Christ. The altarpiece is one of the finest of its kind in Sweden. The congregation is supposed to have paid the sum of 900 silver marks, in cash, for the altarpiece ‚Äì a great sum for the mostly peasant congregation. Among other furnishings, the triumphal cross and the marble baptismal font date from the late Middle Ages. The richly carved pulpit dates from 1712. Some of the pews are medieval, while some were at least elaborated in 1749. The organ dates from 1971.

Being small and situated just south of Frederiksbjerg, Marselisborg is often considered part of Frederiksbjerg.  History  Like most of the boroughs outside the inner city of Aarhus, Marselisborg is a relatively new neighbourhood and got its name from the Marselisborg Manor, when the city council of Aarhus acquired the estate from the Marselis family in 1896. The Marselisborg Manor accidentally burned down soon after, and was replaced by the Marselisborg Gymnasium in 1911. The majority of the buildings in Marselisborg are from the early part of the 1900s and the borough is one of the most affluent areas in Aarhus Municipality, presenting large villas and mansions. Marselisborg means Marselis-castle, a name invented for the Marselisborg Manor by Constantin Marselis, to replace the older name of Havreballeg√•rd.  Overview  Placed in the northern outskirts of the Marselisborg Forests, Marselisborg is both close to nature and has several buildings and highlights, that attracts people from all over Aarhus. The large event venue of Tangkrogen at the Bay of Aarhus, hosts several major events throughout the year and the adjacent Marselisborg Yacht Harbour, attracts many tourists in the summer.

It is the world's largest and most powerful one-piece solid-fuel rocket engine.  History  The P80's development was led by a joint team of ESA, CNES and ASI since 2005, with Avio selected as the prime contractor. The first test of the P80 engine was completed at Centre Spatial Guyanais in November 2006 followed by qualification tests in December 2007. The first launch was completed on 13 February 2012, with the first commercial launch following on 7 May 2012. Total development cost of the engine reached ‚Ç¨76 million.  Overview  P80FW is a single monolithic solid rocket motor propelled by hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene which burns for 114 seconds and is jettisoned at an altitude of 53 km after achieving a relative speed of 1.7 km/s. The engine shares specifications with Ariane 5 solid rocket boosters - it has the same 3 meter diameter and similar height to the largest segments of the booster. This allows using the same facilities and equipment at the Guiana Propellant Plant for loading the propellant and transporting the engine to the launch site. The nozzle of the P80 is also a direct evolution of the one used in Ariane 5 boosters. The manufacture process is divided among several European companies. Italian Avio manufactures the main motor case loaded with fuel, performs integration of the components, and final testing. French-Italian Europropulsion manufactures the P80 motor while Regulus performs propellant loading. Aerospace Propulsion Products B.V. from Netherlands builds the igniter. Belgian SABCA produces components for thrust vectoring and the staging skirt. French Herakles manufactures the engine nozzle.  Related development  The P120C a wider version of the engine with increased propellant mass to 143.6 tons, is in development for use as Ariane 6 boosters and Vega C first stage.http://www.avio.com/en/ariane/ariane-6/p120c-motor/ See also * P120 (rocket stage) * Zefiro (rocket stage) * Solid rocket * Vega (rocket) References Category:Rocket stages Category:Solid-fuel rockets ","title":"P80 (rocket stage)"},{"id":"43366733","title":"The New Girlfriend (film)"},{"id":"43366735","text":"Chama Cha Kijamii (CCK) is a political party in Tanzania.

He became a master in the local Guild of Saint Luke in 1670. He moved to Mechelen in 1674 where he joined the local order of the Friars Minor called the Recollects. On becoming a monk he changed his first name from Wouter to Gualterus. He died in Mechelen in or after 1677.Gualterus Gysaerts at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Work He mainly painted still lifes of flowers in vases and paintings with garlands in the style of the Flemish monk painter Daniel Seghers.

Garland paintings are a special type of still life developed in Antwerp by artists such as Jan Brueghel the Elder, Hendrick van Balen, Frans Francken the Younger, Peter Paul Rubens and Daniel Seghers. They typically show a flower garland around a devotional image or portrait. Garland paintings were usually collaborations between a still life and a figure painter.Ursula H√§rting, Review of Susan Merriam, Seventeenth-Century Flemish Garland Paintings. Still Life, Vision and the Devotional Image In 1676 Gualterus Gysaerts collaborated with his uncle David Teniers the Younger on a series of 19 garland paintings depicting the martyrs of Gorkum. The series was made for the Minorite Church in Mechelen following the beatification of the martyrs on 9 July 1676. Teniers painted the monochrome bust portrait of each martyr in a cartouche while Gysaerts painted the cartouche and the flower garland surrounding it. Of these paintings, 8 are still known to exist, one of which is in the Rijksmuseum. Both Gysaerts and Teniers signed the painting in the Rijksmuseum.

Content The work is an unorthodox piece of historical writing since it explores the character and life of Maximilien Robespierre via a conversation between four imagined characters, all of whom represent facets of Hampson's own mind. The effect of this structure is to make it clear that it is difficult for Hampson to draw clear or firm conclusions about such a complex historical figure as Robespierre. This is a way of showing uncertainty and a multi-faceted perspective on such an enigmatic figure as Robespierre that is markedly different from the approach taken by most historians towards their subject-matter when writing biographies. In contrast to his dismissal of figures such as Jean-Paul Marat or Louis Antoine de Saint-Just, whom he see as lacking humanity let alone reasonable political motivations, Hampson grants Robespierre the existence of a 'potential humanity'. In particular, Hampson's ambivalence towards Robespierre is the result of the conflict between the apparent purity and integrity of Robespierre's principles on the one hand and his espousal of violent political tactics on the other. This tension has been a hallmark of much of the subsequent historiography relating to him, with many biographers being emphatically 'for' or 'against' him in ways that have tended to limit nuanced and complex representations of the man, his aims, and his actions.

Abraham became a monk at the Monastery of Saint Ananias, near Mardin, and had been ordained a priest by 1355. He succeeded his brother Joseph as Archbishop of Amid on his death in 1375, and assumed the name Cyril. Abraham was appointed as Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Mardin in 1382. He attempted to ensure the office of patriarch remained under the control of his family by designating his brother as his successor, but he predeceased Abraham. In 1396, Mardin was sacked by Timur, and the door, wall, and cells of the Monastery of Saint Ananias were destroyed. With donations and funds raised from the sale of the monastery's vessels, furniture, and manuscripts, Abraham spent 50,000 coins on the monastery's restoration. He served as patriarch of Mardin until his death in 1412.

History  In partnership with the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS), the AJRR was founded in 2009 with the goal to optimize patient outcomes through collection of data on all primary and revision total joint replacement procedures in the U.S., while enhancing patient safety, improving quality of care, and reducing the cost for patients. Since then, the AJRR has grown to over 620 participating hospitals with over 400,000 procedures in their database. Both figures are expected to increase by year's end, and will continue to do so as more participants join the registry. In February 2010, The AAOS ratified the AJRR Board of Directors. In November 2010, AJRR received 501(c)(3) status, and in December 2010, their Business Plan was finalized and approved by the AJRR Board of Directors. In March 2011, the Pilot Program was initiated, with successful Level I data transmission and collection from pilot sites completed in July of the same year. In 2012, the national registry software was launched. In August 2012, Jeffrey P. Knezovich, CAE, was hired as AJRR's first Executive Director. In November 2013, AJRR launched a pilot program of Level II, Level III, and Level IV data collection systems. That pilot study is expected to be concluded by the end of the third quarter 2014. In February 2014, the AJRR was named to the National Quality Registry Network (NQRN) Council, an initiative of the American Medical Association; and, in May, 2014, the AJRR was named a Qualified Clinical Data Registry (QCDR) by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). On January 1, 2015, the AJRR officially became a freestanding association. 2015 also marked the formation of the AJRR User Group Network, the merger of the California Joint Replacement Registry (CJRR) into AJRR, and the enrolling of the 600th hospital.

After graduating from the University of Damascus in 1930 with a law degree, he practiced law in Beirut, Lebanon until 1938, when he immigrated to the United States. Freije married Evelyn Haddad in Brooklyn, NY in 1943. Mr. Freije eventually settled in New London, CT, owning and operating a business on State Street in downtown New London. They had one son, Philip Freije. ' Career When he arrived in the United States, he served in the military intelligence unit of the U.S. Army during World War II, but was released to teach Arabic to the troops, teaching Arabic at Princeton University. Under the supervision of Philip K. Hitti, Freije and Farhat Jacob Ziadeh began work on the first full- length history of the United States ever to appear in Arabic. Hitti supervised the project with the cooperation of Princeton‚Äôs Department of Oriental Languages and Department of History. The three co-authors finalized the roughly 350-page book entitled, ‚ÄúHistory of the American People,‚Äù and published the book under Princeton University Press. The book was printed at the American Press, Beirut, to accommodate the need for Arabic printing by linotype.

Born in Milan, she became a student of the Brera Academy, where she studied under the direction of Giuseppe Longhi. She was recognized as a brilliant student, and won the prize in 1810 for the design of the Academy. In 1811 she married Giuseppe Bisi from Genoa, a painter and professor of the Academy, by whom she had five children. She was a strong supporter of Italian independence, and a friend of many women of the Carbonari (the so-called charcoal burners), such as the painter Bianca Milesi. In his poem \\"Dodes sonitt all'abaa Giovan\\", Carlo Porta remembered her: \\"√à in tra i donn la Milesi, la Legnana\\" (\\"Among the women, Milesi, Legnana\\"). In her artistic activity Bisi devoted herself mainly to portraits. In the field of engraving on copper she reproduced five works of France, Marco d'Oggiono, Giacomo Cavedone, Palma il Giovane and Paris Bordone for the Art Gallery of the Palazzo Reale in Milan, and the portraits of Maria Gaetana Agnesi, Vittoria Colonna and Giovanni Battista Monteggia for the Lives and portraits of illustrious Italians.

In a racing career which lasted from August 1975 until October 1976 he won three of his twelve races. He was rated the best horse of his generation in Europe in 1975 when he won the Prix Yacowlef by eight lengths before defeating strong opposition in both the Prix de la Salamandre and Grand Crit√©rium. In 1976 he failed to win in eight starts but ran well in several major races. He was retired at the end of the season and stood as a breeding stallion in Ireland and Japan, but made little impact as a sire of winners. Background Manado was a bay horse with no white markings bred in Ireland by J Coggan. He was probably the best horse sired by Captain's Gig, an American stallion who won the 1967 Belmont Futurity Stakes. Manado's dam, Slipstream, was a moderate racehorse, with her only success in ten start coming in a minor race at Wolverhampton. She did, however, come from a good family, being a descendant of the broodmare Millstream and therefore closely related to the Goodwood Cup winner Medway and the Nassau Stakes winner Reel In. As a yearling Manado was offered for sale and bought for 4,200 guineas by the Newmarket Bloodstock Agency, acting on behalf of Souren Vanian. He was sent into training with Fracois Boutin, and was ridden in most of his races by Boutin's stable jockey Philippe Paquet. Racing career =1975: two-year- old season= Manado his made his racecourse debut in early August when he contested the Prix Yacowlef, a race for previously unraced juveniles over 1000 metres at Deauville Racecourse. He won impressively by eight lengths and was then moved up in class for the Group One Prix Morny over 1200 metres at the same course two weeks later. Ridden by Paquet, he started the 7/2 second favourite behind Vitiges, the winner of the Prix Robert Papin. Manado and Vitiges disputed the lead until 400 metres from the finish, when Manado swerved abruptly to the left, colliding with the rail and losing any chance of winning. He failed to recover and finished eighth of the thirteen runners. On 14 September, Manado faced Vitiges for the second time in the Prix de la Salamandre over 1400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. The other runners included two challengers from Britain: the Richmond Stakes winner Stand To Reason and the Chesham Stakes winner Smuggler. Rather than challenging the leaders from the start as he had done in the Morny, Paquet restrained the colt before making a forward move in the straight. He accelerated to overtake Vitiges inside the last 200 metres and won by a length, with Comeram, ridden by Lester Piggott half a lengths away. in third. For his final appearance of the season, Manado started the 18/10 favourite for the Group One Grand Crit√©rium over 1600 metres at Longchamp on 12 October. He was again opposed by Vitiges and Comeram, with the other runners including the Prix des Ch√™nes winner French Swanee, and the future Epsom Derby winner Empery. Paquet settled the favourite just behind the leaders before producing a strong run along the inside rail in the straight. He took the lead 200 metres from the finish and won by one and a half lengths from Comeram with French Swanee in third ahead of Pier. Kano finished fifth ahead of Vitiges and Empery but was disqualified for causing interference. The form of the race was subsequently boosted when Kano won the Crit√©rium de Saint-Cloud, whilst Comeram finished second under top weight in the Prix Thomas Bryon. At the end of the year, a half-share in Manado was sold for a sum reported to be in excess of ¬£250,000 to the Irish breeder Tim Rogers, and it was announced that his principal objective would be the following year's 2000 Guineas. =1976: three-year-old season= Manado began his second season in the Prix Djebel at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse on 9 April. He started the 5/10 favourite despite being less than fully fit, but was beaten a length by Vitiges. Manado was then sent to England for the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket and started the 4/1 second favourite behind Wollow. He traveled well in the early stages but then began to struggle on the firm ground and finished ninth of the seventeen runners. He returned two weeks later for the Prix Lupin over 2100 metres at Longchamp and finished seventh behind Youth: he tired badly in the closing stages and was never again raced at a distance of further than 1600 metres. Manado returned to action in the Prix Maurice de Gheest over 1300 metres at Deauville in which he raced against specialist sprinters and finished fourth, beaten just over a length by the filly Girl Friend. A week later at the same course he contested the Group One Prix Jacques Le Marois over 1600 metres. In a blanket finish in which the first seven runners crossed the line together he finished fourth behind Gravelines, Radetzky and Vitiges. Boutin commented that the horse might have won if Paquet had delayed his challenge. Manado's last three races were at Longchamp in autumn. On 5 September, he started favourite for the Prix du Rond Point but in another bunched finish he took third behind the four-year- olds Monsanto and Nurabad, beaten half a length and a short head. He was equipped with blinkers in the Prix du Moulin three weeks later and finished third behind Gravelines and Dona Barod. He made his final appearance on 24 October when he was ridden by Lester Piggott and finished third behind the two-year-olds Pharly and Lady Mere in the Prix de la For√™t over 1400 metres, having been somewhat impeded by the runner-up in the straight. Assessment There was no International Classification of European two-year-olds in 1975: the official handicappers of Britain, Ireland and France compiled separate rankings for horses which competed in those countries. In the French Free Handicap, Manado was rated the best two-year-old of the year, two pounds ahead of Vitiges. The independent Timeform organisation awarded him a rating of 130, making him their best two-year-old of the season ahead of Vitiges and the British colt Wollow. In their annual Racehorses of 1975 Timeform described him as having \\"the best form of any two-year-old colt who raced in England, France or Ireland in 1975\\". In 1976, the official handicappers of Britain and France again produced separate ratings. In the French handicap, Manado was rated the thirteenth best three-year-old colt, ten pounds behind Youth. Timeform rated him on 123, thirteen pounds behind Youth, their Horse of the Year. Stud career At the end of his three-year-old season, Manado was retired from racing. In 1978 he began his career as a breeding stallion at the Simmonstown Stud in County Kildare at an initial fee of 1,750 guineas. He was not a success at stud but sired some good winners including Erin's Hope (Desmond Stakes), and Solva (Autumn Days Handicap). Manado was exported to Japan in 1982. His last reported foal were born in 1987. Manado died in Japan on 18 March 1988. Pedigree * as a son of Captain's Gig, Manado was inbred 4 x 4 to Lavendula, meaning that this broodmare appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

From 1979 on, most tasks are executed by the tennis branches of the Flemish and Francophone Communities. The Belgian Federation is one of the 15 inaugural members of the International Tennis Federation. Its headquarters are located in the Brussels Capital Region, in the municipality of Ixelles. History On 23 March 1902 the Belgian Lawn Tennis League was founded by 12 tennis clubs. In 1914 the name was changed into Belgian Lawn Tennis Federation and in 1931 the predicate \\"Royal\\" was added. Since 1979, all tennis administration - including the organisation, co-ordination and promotion of tennis - is taken care of by the local leagues of the respective Flemish and Francophone Communities. Tennis Vlaanderen (previously Vlaamse Tennisvereniging) is the Flemish wing, and Association Francophone de Tennis is the association of French-speaking Belgium. Organisation The roles of the separate Flemish and Francophone leagues include organising tennis competitions in Belgium, supporting and co- ordinating tennis clubs. At the national level only the Belgian championships for the youth (de Borman Cup) and for veterans are still organised. Since 2005 the Belgian championships for men's and women's tennis are not organised anymore. At the international level the following tournament delegations are composed by the Belgian Tennis Federation: * Belgian team at the Davis Cup * Belgian team at the Fed Cup * Belgian team at the Hopman Cup If there are games from these tournaments that take place in Belgium, these are alternately organised by Tennis Vlaanderen and the Association Francophone de Tennis.

In the United Kingdom care homes and care homes with nursing are regulated by separate organisations in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. To enter a care home, a candidate patient needs an assessment of needs and of their financial condition from their local council. The candidate may also have an assessment by a nurse, should the patient require nursing care. History =The workhouse= Workhouses were the first implemented national framework to provide a basic level of care to the old and infirm. Pictured, is \\"The workroom at St James's workhouse\\" from The Microcosm of London (1808). The first government attempts at providing basic care for the elderly and the infirm took place at the dawn of the industrial era with the New Poor Law of 1834. Mass unemployment followed the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 and the introduction of new technology to replace agricultural workers and the rise of factories in the urbanized towns meant that the established system of poor relief was unsustainable. The New Poor Law curbed the cost of poor relief, which had been spiralling throughout the previous decades, and led to the creation of workhouses for those who were unemployed. Most workers in the workhouse were set tasks such as breaking stones, bone crushing to produce fertilizer, or picking oakum using a large metal nail known as a spike. Although conditions in the workhouse were intended to be harsh to act as a deterrent, in areas such as the provision of free medical care and education for children, inmates were advantaged over the general population. By the late 1840s most workhouses outside London and the larger provincial towns housed only \\"the incapable, elderly and sick\\". Responsibility for administration of the Poor Law passed to the Local Government Board in 1871, and the emphasis soon shifted from the workhouse as \\"a receptacle for the helpless poor\\" to its role in the care of the sick and elderly. By the end of the century only about 20 per cent admitted to workhouses were unemployed or destitute, but about 30 per cent of the population over 70 were in workhouses. The introduction of pensions for those over 70 in 1908 did not result in a reduction in the number of elderly housed in workhouses, but it reduced the number of those on outdoor relief by 25 per cent. A Royal Commission of 1905 reported that workhouses were unsuited to deal with the different categories of resident they had traditionally housed, and recommended that specialised institutions for each class of pauper should be established in which they could be treated appropriately by properly-trained staff. The Local Government Act of 1929 gave local authorities the power to take over workhouse infirmaries as municipal hospitals and elderly care homes, although outside London few did so.Eventide: A Scene in the Westminster Union (workhouse), 1878, by Sir Hubert von Herkomer =Public Assistance Institutions= Although the Act formally abolished the workhouse system in 1930, many workhouses, renamed Public Assistance Institutions, continued under the control of local county councils. It was not until the National Assistance Act of 1948 that the last vestiges of the Poor Law disappeared, and with them the workhouses. Many of the buildings were converted into old folks' homes run by local authorities; slightly more than 50 percent of local authority accommodation for the elderly was provided in former workhouses in 1960. Many workhouses were also converted into hospitals. Private nursing homes Before 1914, those who could afford private nursing care were generally looked after in their own homes, but in the 1920s that began to change. In 1921, there were 25,981 patients in nursing and convalescent homes. In the 1931 census, there were 54,920. The standards of nursing care, however, were low. In 1977, there were 1,249 Registered Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes in the UK with 34,546 beds. These figures include 117 private hospitals with facilities for surgery. There were at that time 116,564 people aged 65 or over in residential accommodation provided by or on behalf of local authorities, compared with 51,800 patients in NHS hospital departments of geriatric medicine. In 2019, according to NHS England, there were about 17,000 nursing and residential care homes in England housing about 400,000 people. They were prescribed an average of seven medicines a day, and 14% of the residents were 85 or over. =Quality= In the 1950s and 1960s, the quality of nursing care steadily improved, with the mandatory introduction of central heating, single rooms and en-suite lavatories. In the 1980s, a significant shift from the public sector provision of care for the elderly to private sector homes occurred, with the proportion of private facilities increasing from just 18% in 1980 to 85% by the end of the twentieth century. There is concern that fees paid to private care homes are insufficient to provide adequate quality care. Rises in fees paid by councils have not kept pace with rising costs of care. That led to falling standards, and many care homes are closing as a result. Professor Martin Green of 'Care England', urged the government to take \\"urgent action\\" and provide extra funding to councils and ring-fence that funding for social care. Green stated, \\"We have been warning about these problems for some time. There is a lot of churn in the sector. Contracts changing hands as providers leave and services stopping. There is simply not enough money in the system.\\"Care sector woes leave frail at risk, regulator says BBC There has been a steady increase in number of care home providers entering insolvency from 35 in 2012-13 to 47 in 2014-15. Nursing home care can sometimes be seriously inadequate.Secret film exposes care home failures Cornwall care homes rated 'grim and unsafe' BBC Means testing The cost of a care home is means tested in England. As of April 2009, the lower capital limit is ¬£13,500. At that level, all income from pensions, savings, benefits and other sources, except a \\"personal expenses allowance\\" (currently ¬£21.90 per week), goes towards paying the care home fees. The local council pays the remaining contribution if the room occupied is not more expensive than the local council's normal rate.Care Advice from carehome.co.uk url=http://www.carehome.co.uk/advice/ The NHS has full responsibility for funding the whole placement if the resident meets the criteria for NHS continuing healthcare. That is identified by a multidisciplinary assessment process, as detailed on the Department of Health website. Regulation Care homes for adults in England are regulated by Care Quality Commission, which replaced the Commission for Social Care Inspection, and each care home is inspected at least every three years. In Wales the Care Standards Inspectorate for Wales has responsibility for oversight, In Scotland Social Care and Social Work Improvement Scotland otherwise known as the Care Inspectorate, and in Northern Ireland the Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority in Northern Ireland. There are complaints that some care homes react to legitimate complaints by barring people from seeing their relative in care.Care homes ban relatives who complain BBC In May 2010, the Coalition Government announced the formation of an independent commission on the funding of long-term care, which was due to report within 12 months on the financing of care for an Ageing population. It delivered its recommendations on Monday 4 July 2011. The Care Quality Commission have themselves implemented a re- registration process, completed in October 2010, which will result in a new form of regulation being outlined in April 2011. Inspection found some care homes were inadequate. In many private care homes, an investigation found that elderly residents soiling themselves because staff did not attend to them in time, residents with autism suffering inappropriate and disproportionate physical force, patients waiting excessively long after ringing bells because staff are under pressure, elderly residents not treated with respect with underwear exposed and faeces smeared on a cushion, patients put at risk of attack from other patients and medicines handled unsafely.Companies running 'inadequate' UK care homes make ¬£113m profit The Guardian In 2019, the London Fire Brigade published the findings of its inspections of 177 care homes and demanded the urgent review of their fire risk assessments, emergency plans and staff training. Most of the fire risk assessments was said to have been completed by in-house managers who did not understand basic fire safety principles.

He was known for his stained glass work. Early years Peter Haworth was born in 1889 in Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, England. During World War I (1914‚Äì1918) he served in the Royal Flying Corps and won the Distinguished Flying Cross. After the war he studied at the Royal College of Art in London under William Rothenstein and Robert Anning Bell. He specialized in stained glass at an early stage in his career. Hawarth married Zema Barbara Cogill (1900‚Äì1988), a painter from South Africa who also studied at the Royal College of Art under Rothenstein. She used the name Bobs Cogill Haworth. Pre-war Canada In 1923 the Haworths immigrated to Canada, where Peter was appointed Director of Art at the Central Technical School in Toronto. Bobs Haworth taught ceramics at the Central Technical School from 1929 to 1963. Peter Haworth accepted Doris McCarthy for a teaching job at the school late in 1931 on the basis of a portfolio of her work. She says of him in her autobiography, \\"Peter Haworth was a young, good-looking, curly-headed autocrat, who was gradually transforming a mediocre secondary-school art department into a dynamic powerhouse. Instead of hiring teachers who had taken summer courses in art, he hired artists and hoped they could teach.\\" He gave the artists very little guidance, expecting them to work out how to do the job. While teaching Peter Haworth also accepted commissions to undertake stained glass work. These included fourteen panels for the First Baptist Church, Ottawa, which drew favorable attention to his work in 1929. In 1931 he exhibited a painting Outhouses with the Canadian Society of Painters in Water Colour. The National Gallery of Canada bought this painting in 1932. He was elected president of the Canadian Society of Painters in Water Colour by 1936. Haworth was also a member of the Ontario Society of Artists. Both Peter and Bobs Haworth made illustrations for Kingdom of the Saguenay (1936) by Marius Barbeau. In 1938 three of his watercolors were exhibited at the Tate in London in the show A Century of Canadian Art. The Haworths also collaborated on illustrating James Edward Le Rossignol's The Habitant Merchant (1939). World War II and after Haworth kept his teaching job at the Central Technical School during and after World War II (1939‚Äì1945). Peter Haworth was also employed by the University of Toronto as an instructor in Design and Drawing in 1939. From 1943 to 1956 Bobs taught at the University of Toronto in the fine arts department, while still teaching at the Central Technical School. After the outbreak of war the Hawarths were both commissioned by the Canadian government to record the activities of the armed forces on the coast of British Columbia. In the period before World War II the Haworths would take the train from Toronto to make long visits in the summer to the region of Baie-Saint-Paul and Saint-Urbain in Quebec, as did many other Canadian and American artists. Haworth and his wife Bobs would stay at Cap-√†-l'Aigle during their painting trips. On one such trip, just after the war, Doris McCarthy and three friends shared the same pension and painted with the Haworths, the start of an important friendship. Haworth was still primarily a stained glass artist in the 1950s. He held a one-man show in 1959 at the Roberts Gallery in Toronto. Another show of his semi-abstract paintings was given at the Roberts Gallery in 1961. After his retirement from teaching he continued to paint in Toronto until his death in 1986 at the age of 97. He died in Toronto. Reception The Vancouver Art Gallery showed thirty nine of the Haworths' wartime works. A review in the Vancouver Province in January 1944 said, The Canadian sculptor Elizabeth Wyn Wood gave a speech on \\"Handicrafts in Relation to Community Art Centres in Canada\\". at the National Arts Club in New York City on 21 March 1945 that was reproduced in part in the summer issue of Canadian Art. She noted the important role of the Canadian Guild of Potters, and of ceramic educators such as the Haworths at the Central Technical School.

Hezbollah is designated a terrorist organization in the United States. Sanctions would also be applied to Hezbollah's television station, Al-Manar. The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background Hezbollah (pronounced ; ', literally \\"Party of Allah\\" or \\"Party of God\\") is a Shia Islamist militant group and political party based in Lebanon. Hezbollah's paramilitary wing is the Jihad Council; once seen as a resistance movement throughout much of the Arab world, this image upon which the group's legitimacy rested has been severely damaged due to the sectarian nature of the Syrian Civil War in which it has become involved since 2012. The group's paramilitary is considered more powerful than the Lebanese Army. Hezbollah, which started with only a small militia, has grown to an organization with seats in the Lebanese government, a radio and a satellite television-station, programs for social development and large-scale military deployment of fighters beyond Lebanon's borders. The organization has been called a state within a state. Hezbollah maintains strong support among Lebanon's Shia population. After the death of Abbas al- Musawi in 1992, the organisation has been headed by Hassan Nasrallah, its Secretary-General. Hezbollah receives military training, weapons, and financial support from Iran, and political support from Syria. Following the end of the Israeli occupation of South Lebanon in 2000, its military strength grew significantly. Despite a June 2000 certification by the United Nations that Israel had withdrawn from all Lebanese territory. Hezbollah fought against Israel in the 2006 Hezbollah-Israel War. After the 2006‚Äì2008 Lebanese political protests and clashes, a national unity government was formed in 2008, giving Hezbollah and its opposition allies control of eleven of thirty cabinets seats; effectively veto power. In August 2008, Lebanon's new Cabinet unanimously approved a draft policy statement which secures Hezbollah's existence as an armed organization and guarantees its right to \\"liberate or recover occupied lands\\". Since 2012, Hezbollah has helped the Syrian government during the Syrian civil war in its fight against the Syrian opposition, which Hezbollah has described as a Zionist plot and a \\"Wahhabi- Zionist conspiracy\\" to destroy its alliance with Assad against Israel. The United States, France, the Gulf Cooperation Council, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands,Muriel Asseraf, \\"Prospects for Adding Hezbollah to the EU Terrorist List\\" , September 2007 the European Union and Israel classify Hezbollah as a terrorist organization, in whole or in part. The governments of Iran, Russia and China do not share this view of the organization. The United States designated Hezbollah as a terrorist organization in 1995. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Hezbollah International Financing Prevention Act of 2014 would state that it shall be U.S. policy to: (1) prevent Hezbollah's global logistics and financial network from operating in order to curtail funding of its domestic and international activities; and (2) utilize diplomatic, legislative, and executive avenues to combat Hezbollah's criminal activities in order to block that organization's ability to fund its global terrorist activities. The bill would direct the President to report to Congress: (1) a list of satellite, broadcast, or other providers that knowingly transmit the content of al-Manar TV; and (2) the identity of those providers that have or have not been sanctioned pursuant to Executive Order 13224. The bill would direct the United States Secretary of the Treasury to prohibit or impose strict conditions on the opening or maintaining in the United States of a correspondent account or a payable-through account by a foreign financial institution that knowingly: (1) facilitates the activities of Hezbollah or its agents, instrumentalities, affiliates, or successors; (2) facilitates the activities of a person acting on behalf of or owned or controlled by an agent, instrumentality, affiliate, or successor; (3) engages in money laundering to carry out such an activity; (4) facilitates a significant transaction or provides significant financial services to carry out such an activity, including services that involve a transaction of gold, silver, platinum, or other precious metals; or (5) facilitates any of these activities, conspires to facilitate or participate in such an activity, or is owned or controlled by a foreign financial institution that knowingly engages in such an activity. The bill would direct the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe reporting, information sharing, and due diligence requirements for domestic financial institutions that maintain a correspondent account or payable-through account in the United States for a foreign financial institution. Authorizes the Secretary to waive such requirements if in the U.S. national security interests, and with congressional notification. The bill would direct the Secretary of the Treasury to identify to Congress every 180 days each foreign central bank that carries out an activity prohibited under this Act. The bill would set forth penalty requirements for specified violations under this Act. The bill would direct the President to designate Hezbollah as: (1) a significant foreign narcotics trafficker if Hezbollah meets the criteria set forth under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act, and (2) a significant transnational criminal organization if Hezbollah meets the criteria set forth under specified executive orders and statutes. Requires the President to report to Congress which of these criteria the President determines that Hezbollah has not met, if it does not. The bill would direct the United States Secretary of State to report to Congress regarding Hezbollah's involvement in the trade in rough diamonds outside of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme. The bill would declare that nothing in this Act shall apply to authorized U.S. intelligence activities. The bill would state that any requirement of this Act shall cease to be in effect 30 days after the President certifies to Congress that Hezbollah: (1) is no longer designated as a foreign terrorist organization; (2) is no longer listed in the Annex to Executive Order 13224 (blocking property and prohibiting transactions with persons who commit or support terrorism); and (3) poses no significant threat to U.S. national security, interests, or allies. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Foreign Affairs on June 26, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 4411 would impose sanctions on foreign financial institutions that facilitate transactions or money laundering on behalf of Hezbollah‚Äîa terrorist organization‚Äîor its agents. It would require several reports and briefings on Hezbollah and the Administration's efforts to deter its activities. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing the bill would cost $3 million over the 2015-2019 period, assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts. Pay-as-you-go procedures apply to this legislation because it would affect direct spending and revenues; however, CBO estimates that those effects would not be significant. Procedural history The Hezbollah International Financing Prevention Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on April 7, 2014 by Rep. Mark Meadows (R, NC-11). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the United States House Committee on Financial Services. On July 22, 2014, the House voted in Roll Call Vote 434 to pass the bill 404‚Äì0. Debate and discussion Rep. Meadows, who sponsored the bill, said that \\"we must pass this legislation to make sure that we can do is cripple their ability to finance and put people out of harm's way.\\" Another supporter, Rep. Brad Schneider (D-IL), said that the legislation \\"would give the administration the means necessary to combat Hezbollah's global financial network.\\" Rep. Eliot Engel (D-NY) thought that sanctions would help persuade Hezbollah to negotiate.

Between 2015 and 2018 he was the Chair of the International Brigade Memorial Trust. As of 2020 he is a research fellow at the London School of Economics. British Volunteers in the Spanish Civil War (2004) British Volunteers in the Spanish Civil War: The British Volunteers in the International Brigades, 1936‚Äì1939 was published by Routledge in 2004. The book engages with questions relating to the numbers, origins and motivations of Britons in the International Brigades, and utilises material from the Public Record Office and the Marx Memorial Library's International Brigade archives. Baxell argues that the British Battalion was not composed of poets, nor were its volunteers drawn from the unemployed and the lumpenproletariat; rather, Baxell argues, they were predominantly working- and lower-middle-class. George Esenwein, writing in European History Quarterly questioned \\"Baxell's pointed efforts to shift attention away from the complex web of political and ideological circumstances that inevitably shaped the experiences of the British battalion\\", including their connections to the Soviet Union and Stalinism; and argued that he fails to \\"offer a compelling case in support of his view that the British battalion was composed mostly of independent-minded volunteers who maintained a considerable degree of autonomy from the communist command structures of the International Brigades.\\" Esenwein concluded by noting that \\"Even if Baxell's own advocacy of the brigadiers' cause tends to colour his historical judgements, we have him to thank for correcting misconceptions that have unfairly tarnished the reputation of this distinguished group of committed citizens.\\" In the journal Saothar, published by the Irish Labour History Society, Manus O'Riordan questioned Baxell's treatment of alleged \\"friction between some British and Irish volunteers\\" but praised his demonstration of \\"how other writers have got it wrong in maintaining that some Irish volunteers were wantonly executed by their own side\\". Laurie Lee in the International Brigades (2004) In Laurie Lee in the International Brigades: Writer or Fighter?, delivered as a Len Crome Memorial Lecture and published by the International Brigade Memorial Trust in 2004, Baxell argues that, though the English writer was certainly a member of the International Brigades, Laurie Lee's memoir - particularly his claim to have fought in Spain - is likely to have been largely fictitious. Antifascistas (2010) Baxell is also the co-author, with Angela Jackson and Jim Jump, of Antifascistas: British & Irish Volunteers in the Spanish Civil War (2010), a book of short texts and pictures. Antifascistas accompanied an exhibition of the same name which opened in May 2010 and included photographs, posters, banners and personal accounts, many of which were taken from the Marx Memorial Library. An updated Spanish edition with an introduction by Angel Vi√±as was published as Help Spain by Pamiela in 2016. Unlikely Warriors (2012) Unlikely Warriors: The British in the Spanish Civil War and the Struggle Against Fascism was published by Aurum Press in 2012. Baxell described the book as \\"the first to place the Spanish Civil War within the context of the volunteers' lives, rather than the other way round\\"; and said it seeks to deliver its narrative \\"from the perspective of the participants themselves using, wherever possible, their own words\\".

Overview Baxell described the book as \\"the first to place the Spanish Civil War within the context of the volunteers' lives, rather than the other way round\\"; and seeks to deliver its narrative \\"from the perspective of the participants themselves using, wherever possible, their own words\\". Set against the context of the 1930s in Britain-- marked by the Great Depression, the growth of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) and the emergence of Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists --the book primarily deals with the International Brigades and their volunteers, but also covers those who were involved in other capacities, including George Orwell who fought with the POUM, British journalists who worked in Spain during the Civil War, and the small number of Britons who fought on the side of Francisco Franco. Baxell describes the May Days of 1937 in Barcelona and British participation in the Siege of Madrid and the Battles of Jarama, Brunete and the Ebro. He continues by describing the experiences of the British volunteers who departed Spain at the end of the war and those who were taken prisoner, and Civil War veterans' experiences of the Second World War. These included Tom Wintringham who helped to found the Home Guard and Bernard Knox, who joined the Office of Strategic Services. The book begins with three chapters discussing the Brigadiers' responses to Depression-era Britain, campaigns against fascism in the UK, and the debates and varying responses to the Spanish Civil War in British society. The final three chapters and the epilogue look at events after Franco's victory, including the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact and the CPGB's withdrawal of support for the Second World War, which it deemed imperialist (a position it later reversed). The intervening seventeen chapters deal with the Civil War itself and cover, among other topics, Britons working in medical aid, foreign correspondents, the involvement of the Independent Labour Party, and the experience of those imprisoned in camps by Franco's Nationalists. Critical reception Writing in The Volunteer, a publication of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives, historian Peter Stansky described Unlikely Warriors as \\"a culminating and I believe definitive accomplishment.\\" Stansky praised Baxell's treatment of \\"the endless paradox of war\\"--that war \\"could not be ... more dreadful yet for many though not all who participated and survived, it was the most important and rewarding experience of their lives\\"--and his unromanticised account, concluding \\"This is a colorful, heroic, tragic and deeply troubling tale ... Based on an extraordinary range of material, it is a splendid thing to have this full and satisfying account.\\" Alan Lloyd of the Morning Star praised Baxell's \\"pre-eminent knowledge of the British volunteers\\" and use of their own words to tell the stories; and wrote \\"The book is beautifully written and it's a totally absorbing read\\". Historian Francis Beckett, writing in The Tablet praised Baxell's detachment as bringing \\"something new\\" to the historiography of the Civil War and described Unlikely Warriors as \\"Well researched and luminously written\\". Unite the Union named Unlikely Warriors as one of two \\"books of the month\\" for June 2013 and published a review by the historian Lewis Mates. Mates identified Baxell's inclusion of a chapter on those who fought for the Nationalists and \\"the wealth of detail [he] provides of the individual experiences of British fighters\\" as strengths, and praised his collation of published and unpublished accounts, interviews, correspondence and archival sources. Mates also published a review in the academic journal Contemporary British History in which he also noted Baxell's attentiveness to the conflicts between the International Brigades and the anti-Stalinist POUM, who some Communists claimed were acting on behalf of the fascists. However, Mates also described the six chapters dealing with events before and after the war as \\"a little disappointing\\", and questioned Baxell's treatment of Irish volunteers in Spain, his engagement with historiographical debates including whether the events constituted a war or a revolution and the International Brigades' relationship with the Communist International, and methodological questions relating to Baxell's varied sources. Concluding, Mates noted \\"that Unlikely Warriors is tailored to appeal to a wider market than simply academics\\" and described the book as \\"a well researched, largely balanced, highly readable and accessible narrative\\". Unlikely Warriors was shortlisted for the 2013 Political Book Awards political history book of the year.

Bianca Milesi was born into a family of wealthy merchants in Milan, daughter of Giovan Battista Milesi and Elena Viscontini. She had four sisters, Antoinette, Francesca, Agostina, Louise, and a brother, Charles, who would join in marriage with his cousin Elena Viscontini, sister of Matilda. She was brought up from six to ten years in a convent in Florence, in Milan in the monasteries of St. Sophia and the Holy Spirit, and finally with a governess. A journey made together with her mother in Tuscany and Switzerland gave her the opportunity to broaden her horizons and study the philosophy of the Enlightenment. Even after returning to Milan, she continued to travel, periodically visiting Florence and Rome. In Florence he met the Countess of Albany Princess Louise of Stolberg-Gedern, who had been the mistress of Vittorio Alfieri. In Rome she came into relationship with Antonio Canova and the German painter Sophie Reinhard. Portrait of Gaspare Raimondi by Bianca Milesi, Ospedale Maggiore, 1821 She had a leading role in the Carbonari uprisings in Milan in 1821. She later went on to become a drawer and painter, and taught at schools, particularly training girls to become interested in the arts. She died in Paris on June 8, 1849.

They are one of the very few Christian burial places that have always been accessible. The first of the former four floors is now almost completely destroyed. The toponym In ancient times the catacombs were simply known with the name in catacumbas, a Greek term composed by two words, kat√† and kymbe, literally meaning \\"close to the cavity\\". Actually, along the Appian Way, close to the cemetery, an evident dip in the ground is visible even now. Moreover, before its employment as a burial ground, the area was occupied by pozzolan mines, now placed about ten meters above the floor of the Basilica of San Sebastiano fuori le mura: these mines gave rise to a pagan cemetery, then used by Christians. The word catacumbas, through a process of extension and assimilation, was gradually used to identify all the hypogeum burial sites, thus simply called catacombs. The underground graveyard, called di San Sebastiano since the Early Middle Ages, was known since the 3rd century as in memoria apostolorum, a toponym referred to the presence within the catacomb, for some time, of the relics of the Apostles Peter and Paul. In effect, the Depositio Martyrum (half of the 4th century), at the date of 29 June, talks about the recurrence of Peter in catacumbas and Paul on Via Ostiensis. The Martyrologium Hieronymianum (5th century), at the same date, cites the recurrence of Peter in Vatican, Paul on Via Ostiensis and utrumque in catacumbas, Tusco et Basso consulibus (during the consulship of Tuscus and Bassus, that is in 258). The martyrs of the cemetery Ancient sources attest the presence of three martyrs within the cemetery on the Appian Way: Sebastian, Quirinus and Eutychius. The names of the martyrs are mentioned in a 7th-century catalogue, called Notula oleorum, while the Early Middle Ages itineraries for pilgrims do not cite Eutychius, because its sepulchre was hard to reach. As regards Sebastian, the Depositio Martyrum remembers his death and his entombment in catacumbas on 20 January. Little is known about him: Saint Ambrose (end of the 5th century) tells that he was born in Milan and that suffered martyrdom in Rome during the persecution of Diocletian; the 5th-century Passio refers that he was a soldier from Narbonne, in Gaul, born of a family from Milan and died in Rome under Diocletian. His relics stood in the catacomb until the 9th century, then they were moved within the town walls and now are kept on the Appian Way again, in the Chapel of Saint Sebastian in the basilica above the cemetery. Quirinus was a bishop of Sescia, in Pannonia, whose relics were moved to Rome by pilgrims from that region between 4th and 5th century. Nothing is known about Eutychius but his grave, discovered during excavations carried out in the 20th century in a crumbly area of the catacombs; a poem dedicated to him, by Pope Damasus I, is now displayed at the entry of the basilica. History Thanks to the excavations carried out at the end of 19th and during the 20th century, it was possible to recreate the topographic and architectural history of the area - consisting of three levels of galleries - in which the catacombs lie. The area used to be a pozzolan mine; it was abandoned at the end of the 2nd century and then used by Romans as a place for pagan burial: simple graves for slaves and freedmen have been discovered, as well as monumental tombs, particularly in the so-called piazzola (\\"little square\\"), a circular compartment that had been an opencast mine, in which walls three mausoleums were dug. The presence, in these mausoleums and particularly in the so-called Mausoleum of Innocentiores, of typically Christian iconographies, such as the anchor and the fish, suggests that the mausoleums were used, at a later stage, also for the sepulture of Christians. Beside the piazzola, the dig of the cemetery galleries was started in this period. Around the half of the 3rd century the whole piazzola was filled in, so as to create an embankment at an upper level. Three monuments have been brought to light on this shelf: the so-called triclia, a covered porticoed hall used for burial banquets, whose walls display more than 600 graffiti with invocations to the Apostles Peter and Paul; a marble-upholstered aedicule that, according to archaeologists, was the place where the relics of the two Apostles were kept during the period when they were moved in catacumbas; and a covered room with a well to draw water. The transfer of the relics of the Apostles to San Sebastiano in the mid-3rd century and their relocation in the former places at the beginning of the 4th century is still a debated issue among researchers and archaeologists. Finally, in the first half of the 4th century also these spaces were buried, in order to build the embankment on which the Constantinian basilica was erected. Description Within the right nave of the former basilica - rebuilt in 1933 above ancient remains - is it possible to see on the left the arches connecting with the middle nave of the present church, walled up in the 13th century, and the exterior of the apse of the Chapel of Relics. Here are gathered some sarcophagi, both entire and fragmentary (mostly dating from the 4th century), discovered during the excavations. A ladder leads to the tunnels, with several cubicles; here, the paintings of Jonah's cubicle, dating back to the end of the 4th century and depicting four scenes of the life of the prophet, are quite outstanding. The restored Crypt of Saint Sebastian houses an altar shelf replacing the former one (of which some traces of the base still remain) and the bust of Saint Sebastian attributed to Bernini. Soon after there is the lay-by, under which lies a sandstone cavity that perhaps gave rise to the name \\"ad catacumbas\\", given to this cemetery and then extended to the other ones. In the lay-by rise three mausolea dating back to the second half of the 2nd century, later re-used. * The first one on the right is externally decorated with paintings (funeral banquets and the exorcism of the Gerasene demoniac) and still bears an inscription with the name of the owner, Marcus Clodius Hermes; the interior houses graves and pictures and shows a vault decorated with the head of a gorgon. * The second one, called Mausoleum of Innocentiores referring to the funeral college to which it belonged, has a vault decorated with refined stuccoes; some recesses show inscriptions with Greek characters but written in Latin, as well as a graffito with the initials of the Greek words meaning \\"Jesus Christ Son of God Savior\\" (Ichtys). * On the left there is the Mausoleum of the Adze, from the tool depicted on the exterior, whose decoration consists of shoots of vine sprouting from kantharoi placed on false pillars.

These uniforms are the same one used by US Marine Corps in the Pacific. To clear barricades, mine fields, fill in caters and break through thick hedgerows the 17th used M4 Sherman Tanks mounting with M1 bulldozer. Also used was Caterpillar D7 with armor plates added to the engine and cab. The tank bulldozer broke through the hedgerows in France. Germans learned to wait until the tanks cross with infantry following on foot then fire on both. To counter, forces started with their main guns loaded with canister and pointed to the rear and to the flanks.

The bridge was started at 8am, opened at 6pm, it was 720 ft. in length. 17th bridge company did not have enough saddles to put on top of the floating pontoons, so a short trestle bridge was built near the far part of the bridge. Approaches to the bridge were made of sommerfeld mat over chespaling mat, with three inches of gravel.  Rhine crossing  Night of 23 March 1945, as part of the Western Allied invasion of Germany and Operation Plunder, Company E and C of the 17th Armored Engineer Battalion, constructed two treadway rafts to prepare of the crossing of the Rhine River about five kilometers south of Wesel. Bridge construction started at 9:45 am and by 4:00 pm the first truck crossed the floating bridge. Over 1152 feet of M2 treadway and 93 pneumatic floats were used in just six hours and fifteen minute construction project, record setting for the size of the bridge. It took twenty five 2 half tons GMC CCKW trucks to transport the bridge parts to the construction site, part of the Red Ball Express. A steel treadway bridge needed floating pontoons. A saddles on top of the pontoon put the weight of the bridge on the pontoon. A 12-foot sections of treadway track was bolted to the saddles. The treadway sections were put together on the spot unloaded for many truck. The sections were taken out to the end of the bridge in construction. The sections were connected together with large steel pins. The 17th was experienced with treadway bridges, but this was the largest one. To cross the Rhine would need 80 or 90 sections to complete the bridge. Moving the sections then pounding in the large pins was hard work. These bridge could carry a heavy load including a 66,800 pound M4 tanks. The floating pontoon was an 18-ton pressurized rubber bag. The saddle was the metal and plywood frame was placed on the float and supported the treadway tracks. To prefabricate the bridge the pontoon had to be inflated; the saddles had to be assembled and lashed to the top of the pontoon.THEY REMEMBER WARfacesbeyondthegraves.com 2nd Armored WW2 On 30 March 1945 Company \\"C\\", constructed a treadway bridge across the canal near Alvert.

Design and development Yves Chasle worked as an A√©rospatiale stress engineer and independently designed several light aircraft, starting with the Chasle YC-12 Tourbillon. His YC-100 Hirondelle is a largely wooden framed and fabric covered single-seat sports aircraft of conventional pusher layout. It has a strut braced high wing of constant chord with styrofoam ribs. The fuselage of the Hirondelle is a slender, rectangular cross-sectioned beam with the pilot's seat upon it ahead of the wing leading edge. Behind the pilot a central structure supports the wing just above head level; on its trailing edge, one of several types of small piston engine, with power outputs typically around , drives a pusher propeller. The fin is broad and straight-tapered and the horizontal tail is attached to the fuselage underside. The Hirondelle has a short, fixed tricycle undercarriage. Its first flight was on 1 May 1985, powered by a K√∂nig SC 430 engine, a 430 cc (26.2 cu in), air-cooled, three-cylinder radial. The second prototype, built in Brazil, had a JPX PUL 425/503 engine, a 212 cc (12.9 cu in) air-cooled flat-twin two stroke. The number built is uncertain; in 2009 two examples, both YC-100s, appeared on European civil registers, one in Spain and one in France. Variants Plans for these were available but only the YC-100 is known to have been built. ;YC-100: As described below but could also be fitted with a JPX PUL 425/503. ;YC-101: As YC-100 but span increased to .

The station is run primarily by North Korean refugees and defectors and frequently broadcasts short-wave transmissions of news and information to the general population inside North Korea. The radio was established by Kim Seong-min, a former North Korean military monitor for foreign broadcasts, who was influenced by the foreign broadcasts that he monitored and defected from North Korea in 1996. Free North Korea Radio has received an award from Reporters Without Borders in acknowledgement of its efforts. Free North Korea Radio started broadcasting from Seoul in 2004. It is a project of the Defense Forum Foundation, a U.S.-based nonprofit organization. Threats Free North Korea Radio staff have been assaulted repeatedly by South Korean extremist groups who support the North Korean regime or fear the destabilizing effect of their broadcasts. Radio staff had to relocate to the outskirts of Seoul in 2005. In July 2020, the Washington Times reported on a cyber attack targeting individuals involved with Free North Korea Radio, including its co-founder Suzanne Scholte. The phishing scam impersonated a prominent journalist from The Atlantic, Uri Friedman, and asked interview questions of Scholte, which security experts told the Washington Times were part of a larger cyber operation. In response to news of the cyber attack, Col. David Maxwell, an analyst on North Korea, commented: \\"It‚Äôs not surprising that [Scholte] would have been targeted.\\" Maxwell said, \\"I think the regime is focused on her organization because of the radio broadcasts...Shortwave radio broadcasts are one of the most effective ways to get outside information into North Korea, and the information has an effect.\\" Types of broadcasts Free North Korea Radio broadcasts a variety of news and information into North Korea, including news of current events happening within North Korea. The organization relies on a network of anonymous sources inside North Korea for this information, which it also publishes on its Korean-language website. Funding As of 2008, Free North Korea Radio received an annual grant from the U.S. National Endowment for Democracy. In 2019 former special envoy for North Korea human rights Robert R. King stated it was \\"supported by some U.S. government funds\\". As of 2020, Free North Korea Radio's English language website stated that it no longer received funding of any kind from the U.S. government.

Background He was born at Cuddington Heath, Cheshire, the eldest son and heir of John Stockton (died 1643), who was Lord of the Manor of Cuddington, and his second wife Sarah. The Stockton family suffered heavily for their loyalty to the Crown during the English Civil War, but they recovered their estates after the Restoration of Charles II, when Thomas received high praise for his personal fidelity to the King. The second son, Richard Stockton, left England during the English Civil War for the Colonies where he disembarked in New York which was in Dutch hands at the time. Richard Stockton was a signer of the Flushing Remonstrance, and Richard Stockton's great-grandson, another Richard, was the signer of the Declaration of Independence for New Jersey. Career He entered Gray's Inn in 1634 and became an Ancient of the Inn in 1658. He was called to the Bar in 1641. He went to Ireland in 1657, took up legal practice there and was admitted to the King's Inn. At the Restoration, his legal training together with his long and loyal service to the Crown made him an obvious choice for judicial office, and he was made third justice of the Court of King's Bench (Ireland). He went regularly on assize to Connaught and Ulster. Unlike many of his colleagues, he is not known to have received a knighthood. He died in Dublin in 1674 and was buried in St. Michael's Church, Dublin; according to family tradition, his body was later reinterred in the family tomb at St Oswald's Church, Malpas.

It was constituted as part of the old county of Dublin. Today, it lies in the modern county of South Dublin. At the heart of the barony is the civil parish of the same name - Newcastle - which is one of eleven civil parishes in the barony. The ruins of the eponymous castle, also known as Newcastle-Lyons, are located in the townland of Newcastle South. The town with the biggest population in the barony is Lucan.CSO 2006 - combining Lucan Esker, Heights and St Helen's Location It is one of seven and a half baronies that used to comprise the old county of Dublin.According to the \\"Local Government Act, 2001\\", section 10(2): \\"The State continues to stand divided into local government areas to be known as counties and cities which are the areas set out in Parts 1 and 2, respectively, of Schedule 5.\\" It is clear from SCHEDULE 5, Local Government Areas (Counties and Cities, PART 1, that \\"Dublin\\" is defined only as a city (as distinct from a county). It stretches from the River Liffey to the Wicklow Mountains (from north to south) and from the border with County Kildare to Clondalkin and Palmerstown (from west to east). It is located between the baronies of Castleknock (north of the river), Uppercross (to the east) and South Salt, County Kildare (to the south and west). Apart from an exclave of the civil parish of Leixlip that lies beyond the river, the rest of the barony is contained within the modern county of South Dublin and it is subject to South Dublin County Council. Legal context and history Baronies were created after the Norman invasion of Ireland as subdivisions of counties and were used for administration. While baronies continue to be officially defined units, they are no longer used for many administrative purposes. They have been administratively obsolete since 1898. Nevertheless, they continue to be used in land registration and specification such as in planning permissions. In many cases, a barony corresponds to an earlier Gaelic t√∫ath which had submitted to the Crown. This is true of Newcastle, which at the time of its creation, was part of the t√∫ath of Ui Donnchad. The Ui Donnchad, or sept the Mac Giolla Mocholmog, was also home to Vikings of Dublin (Dyflyn) who were allies and trading partners of the Chieftain Dermot Mac Giolla Mocholmog during the century period. Following the initial Hiberno-Norman policy of integration and assimilation, the descendants of this chief became the FitzDermots. Through grants and intermarriage, by the time of the shiring of County Dublin, Newcastle-Lyons was raised to the status of an Irish feudal barony. In 1627 a disputed claim to the barony led to tragedy when Edmond Butler, 3rd/13th Baron Dunboyne killed his rival James Prendergast; James' brother Edmond was recognised as baron, but later forfeited. It eventually came into the Newcomen family who secured succession in the seventeenth century. The village and castle bawn was fortified with walls and multiple tower houses. It later became a pocket borough until the Parliamentary Union of Dublin with Westminster in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801. After the Union, and the famine, the Barony like Dublin City and County went into a long period of economic and population decline.

It is being developed by the Forewind consortium. It is expected that the Dogger Bank development will consist of four offshore wind farms, each with a capacity of up to 1.2 GW, creating a combined capacity of 4.8 GW. Planning consent for the first phase of the project (Creyke Beck A and Creyke Beck B) was granted by the UK government in February 2015, and consent for the second phase (Teesside A and Teesside B) was granted in August 2015. The farms were all successful in the 2019 contract for difference auction and have a delivery date between 2023 and 2025. In 2019, GE was chosen to provide the turbines for the project. Project overview Dogger Bank is in the North Sea, located between and off the east coast of Yorkshire. It is one of nine offshore zones belonging to the Crown Estate which formed part of the third licence round for UK offshore wind farms. The Dogger Bank is an attractive location for offshore wind farms because it is far away from shore, avoiding complaints about the visual impact of wind turbines, yet the water depth is shallow enough for traditional fixed foundation wind turbine designs. Fixed- foundation wind turbines are economically limited to maximum water depths of , at greater water depths new floating wind turbine designs are required, which currently cost significantly more to build. The Forewind consortium was formed by the four owner companies - SSE, RWE, Statoil and Statkraft - in November 2008 in response to the third licence round. In January 2010, Forewind was announced as the developer for the Dogger Bank Zone, the largest of the Round 3 zones. Statoil increases its share from Statkraft, beginning in 2017. In August 2017 new ownership arrangements were announced, SSE and Equinor (formerly Statoil) have each taken 50% share in Dogger Bank Creyke Beck A, B and Teeside A, while Innogy (RWE subsidiary) has taken Teesside B and renamed it to Sofia Offshore Wind Farm. Originally projected to produce up to 9 GW of power, the plan was scaled down to 7.2 GW in 2014, and scaled down even further to 4.8 GW in 2015. The wind farm is planning to use the Haliade-X 12 MW from GE, one of the world's largest wind turbines, to be installed by the wind turbine installation vessel Voltaire. Dogger Bank Creyke Beck A and B The first phase will be for Dogger Bank Creyke Beck A and B. This will comprise two offshore wind farms each generating up to 1.2 GW of electricity, with a total installed capacity of up to 2.4 GW. They would connect to the existing Creyke Beck substation near Cottingham, in the East Riding of Yorkshire. The two sites lie from the East Yorkshire coast. Dogger Bank Creyke Beck A will cover an area of , and Dogger Bank Creyke Beck B will cover an area of . Planning consent was granted for 400 turbines on 17 February 2015. These two projects are owned by SSE and Equinor. ABB was chosen for the HVDC light power transfer cables to shore. On 21 September 2020, it was announced that Dogger Bank A and B will use 190 GE Haliade-X 13MW offshore wind turbines over both sites, meaning that 95 turbines will be used on each site. Dogger Bank Teesside Dogger Bank Teesside is intended to be the second stage of development of the Dogger Bank Zone. It was divided into two phases of development: Dogger Bank Teesside A & B and Dogger Bank Teesside C & D. These would connect to the National Grid at a substation in Redcar and Cleveland, Teesside. =Dogger Bank Teesside= Dogger Bank Teesside A & B comprises two wind farms, each generating up to 1.2 GW of electricity. Dogger Bank Teesside A lies from the shore and will cover an area of . Dogger Bank Teesside B lies from the shore and will cover an area of . Planning consent was granted for 400 turbines on 5 August 2015. Construction of the wind farms must begin before August 2022. Since 2017 SSE and Equinor own Dogger Bank Teesside A, while Dogger Bank Teesside B was taken by Innogy and renamed Sofia Offshore Wind Farm. =Dogger Bank Teesside C & D= This second application (C and D) was planned to comprise two wind farms, each generating up to 1.2 GW of electricity. It was originally expected that planning consent would be determined in 2017. However, in August 2015 Forewind scrapped the final phase and returned the remaining area of the Dogger Bank development zone to the Crown Estate. North Sea Wind Power Hub Dutch, German, and Danish electrical grid operators are cooperating in a project to build a North Sea Wind Power Hub complex on one or more artificial islands to be constructed on Dogger Bank as part of a European system for sustainable electricity. The power hub would interconnect the three national power grids with each other and with the Dogger Bank Wind Farm. A study commissioned by Dutch electrical grid operator TenneT reported in February 2017 that as much as 110 gigawatts of wind energy generating capacity could ultimately be developed at the Dogger Bank location. At the North Seas Energy Forum in Brussels on 23 March 2017, Energinet.dk will sign a contract to work with the German and Dutch branches of TenneT; thereafter a feasibility study will be produced.
