He also gave him the penname of Qamar which means moon, and Jalalabadi was added for his native town. It was the general trend in those days for writers to name themselves after the towns they hailed from. After completing his matriculation from Amritsar, he embarked on his journalistic career journey by writing for Lahore-based newspapers like Daily Milap, Daily Pratap, Nirala, Star Sahakar. Career Attracted by the promise of a career in the film industry, Qamar Jalalabadi came to Pune in the early 1940s. In 1942, he wrote lyrics for his first film Zamindar which was a Pancholi Pictures production and the songs of this film were very well received, especially the song sung by Shamshad Begum \\"Duniya me garibonko aaraam nahi milta\\", which also had a line or two written by writer and poet Behzad Lucknawi. Subsequently, Jalalabadi relocated to Bombay, and worked there as a lyricist for nearly 4 decades. His songs were sung by many notable singers including Shiv Dayal Batish, Noor Jehan, G. M. Durrani, Zeenat Begum, Manju, Amirbai Karnataki, Mohammad Rafi, Talat Mahmood, Geeta Roy, Suraiya, Mukesh, Manna Dey, Asha Bhonsle, Kishore Kumar and Lata Mangeshkar. He worked with many popular composers including Sachin Dev Burman and Sardar Malik. Some of his memorable songs from his early include \\"sunti nahi duniya kabhi fariyaad kissi ki\\" (Renuka, 1947) and the ghazal \\"Dil kis liye rota hai...pyar ki duniya me, aisa hi hota hai\\" (sung by Naseem Banu for the film Mulaquat in 1947). The noted dancer Sitara Devi performed some of his songs in Chand (1944). Chand was one of the earliest of Qamarji's successful and memorable films. \\"Ik dilke tukde hazaar huye, koyi yahan gira koyi wahan gira‚Ä¶\\" in Pyar Ki Jeet (1948 film), reflected his own tragedies and philosophy of life.Lyricists His brush with comedy was in Aansoo Aur Muskan with, \\" Guni jano, Bhakt jano‚Ä¶\\" sung by Kishore Kumar as an actor in the movie.Subhashini Swar (Daughter) As a lyricist, Qamar Jalalabadi was very versatile. On one hand he wrote mesmeric duets like \\"sun meri saanwari mujhko kahin tum bhool na jana‚Ä¶\\" sung by Lata Mangeshkar and Mohd. Rafi (film: Aansoo 1953) and on the other hand he penned comic relief songs like \\"khush hai zamana aaj pehli tarikh hai\\" endured with full throttle gusto by Kishore Kumar (film: Pehli Tarikh-1954). This song turned into veritable anthem and was played on Radio Ceylon on the first of every month for decades, and it probably still is. The film Howrah Bridge (1958) skyrocketed his career as lyricist to unpredescented heights. Songs like \\"Mera Naam Chin Chin Chu\\" (Geeta Dutt) and \\"aaiye meherbaan, baithiye janejaan‚Ä¶.\\" (Asha Bhosle) became highly popular. In his long career span he worked for several Film Companies like; Prabhat Film Company, Pancholi Pictures, Filmistan Ltd., Famous Pictures, Minerva Movietone, Prakash Pictures, Wadia Films Ltd., Filmkar Ltd., Sippy Films, N.C Sippy Films, Shri Shakti Films, Mitra Productions and many more. He was one of the founder members of prestigious organisations like Film Writers Association & IPRS in Mumbai. The music composers he worked with were: Ghulam Haider, G. Damle, Pandit Amarnath, Khemchand Prakash, Husnlal Bhagatram, S.D. Burman, Anil Biswas, Shyam Sunder, Sajjad Hussain, C. Ramchandra, Madan Mohan, Sudhir Phadke, Shiv Dayal Batish, Sardar Malik, Ravi, Avinash Vyas and in the latter phase of his career with O.P. Nayyar, Kalyanji-Anandji, Sonik Omi, Uttam Singh and Laxmikant‚ÄìPyarelal as well. Qamar Jalalabadi wrote song lyrics for about 156 films by writing a total of approximately 700 songs in his long career. He was an acclaimed poet (shayar) and read poetry at several mushairas all over India.  Personal life  In his personal life, Jalalabadi was a highly religious person and he chanted excerpts from the Bhagavad Gita, the Koran as well as the Bible. He was deeply into transcendental meditation, and was mostly embedded in his writing for most part of the day. He once gifted a bungalow in Khar, Mumbai to one of his married sisters to save her from a difficult marriage, and shifted to simpler accommodation in Juhu with his own family. He and his wife Leelawati had seven children. He had several friends and hundreds of fans whom he lovingly called his \\"pankhe\\". His fan mail came in various languages; Hindi, English, Urdu and many regional languages as well. He replied to all his fan mail and judiciously sent an autographed photo as well. Some of his favorite people were Pakistani poet Qateel Shifai, broadcaster Ameen Sayani, Kalyanji and Anandji, O.P Nayyar, S. D. Batish, C.L Kavish and D.D. Kashyap. From his past associations, he remembered G. Damle of Prabhat Film Company, Dattaram Pai of Filmistan, Babubhai Mitra, Husnlal Bhagatram and S. Mukherji the most as they had been a part of his initial glorious days as a lyricist.

Employing a strategy he called \\"urban barnraising,\\" he engaged neighborhood residents, volunteer professionals, students, youth teams, social activists, and community gardeners in envisioning, designing, and constructing instant, temporary, and permanent gathering spaces in neighborhoods, on college campuses, and at sites of major conferences and events. \\"Linn is considered 'Father of American Participatory Architecture' by many academic colleagues and architectural and environmental experts of the National Endowment for the Arts.\\" In the 1990s his focus shifted to creating commons in community gardens. Many of his pilot projects, designed to cultivate community and peace among people, are documented in his book Building Commons and Community (New Village Press, 2007).  Youth  = Early life in rural Germany = Karl grew up on a fruit tree farm in Dessow, a small village northwest of Berlin. His mother, Henriette (Henny) Rosenthal, had purchased the parcel of 20 morgen (over 12 acres) in 1913 from Eigene Scholle (literally: own soil), a company who, inspired by the land reform movement and the writings of Franz Oppenheimer, had bought and parceled the manor estate of Dessow.Elisabeth Meyer- Renschhausen, \\"Kommunale Bodenvorratshaltung statt Abwicklung der Bodenreform in Ostdeutschland\\", in: Zeitschrift f√ºr Sozial√∂konomie, No. 148 (2006), pp. 20-23, here p. 22. Henny designed and supervised the building of a house, planted orchards, and named the property the Immenhof (literally: \\"bee colony farm\\"). The bees in the 36 hives she kept were good pollinators. Her cherries, apples, pears, plums, and berries were eagerly awaited in Berlin marketplaces.\\"Community Gardens ‚Äì Ein ¬´Anarchist¬´ des G√§rtnerns: Karl Linn¬ª , in: Contraste - Monatszeitung f√ºr Selbstorganisation, No. 250/251 (Sommer 2005), retrieved on 16 January 2011. The farm was also an accredited training center for gardeners and one of the first sites to practice horticultural therapy. The impact of living on a farm and seeing his mother and other women tilling the land stayed with Karl throughout his life. In 1921 Henny married Josef Lin, a widower with three children, whom she adopted. Josef was Chief Librarian of the Jewish Community Center in Berlin. He had edited Hakeshet (The Rainbow), the first magazine of modern Hebrew writers and poets, published from 1903 to 1906, and wrote a seminal reference book on the evolution of the Hebrew press, first published in 1928 and still used today. The only Jews in their village, the Lins became a target for Nazi persecution. Josef was forced to flee to Palestine in 1933. Henny, Karl, and his older sister, Bella, followed in 1934 after selling the Immenhof at about an eighth of its value. = Youth in Palestine = The Lin family started a small farm near Haifa, and at age 14 Karl left school to farm and support his parents, who had become too sick to work. He returned to school later when his parents moved inland to be close to Karl's older sister, Bella, and her family. Karl graduated from the Kadoorie Agricultural High School, with specialization in landscape gardening. He put his skills to use as he joined 35 youth from the coeducational scout movement to found Kibbutz Maagan Michael.Karl Linn - landscape architect devoted to social justice Although inspired by the vision of creating a new homeland, Karl was sometimes puzzled and uneasy about how fellow Jews treated their Arab neighbors. At age 20, when a back injury limited his capacity to contribute physically to the work of the kibbutz, he moved to Tel Aviv to be closer to his brother Theo, who was guiding his intellectual development. There Karl directed an elementary school gardening program that engaged students in growing food for their own lunches.  Career  = Becoming a psychologist = Influenced by the writings of A. S. Neill and Wilhelm Reich, Karl entered psychoanalysis to heal his personal wounds and become a more effective human being. He was driven by a desire to understand the roots of the prejudice, brutality, and fanaticism he had observed and experienced. At age 23, he moved to Switzerland and was trained as a psychoanalyst at the Institute for Applied Psychology in Zurich. He immigrated to New York in 1948, with the goal of engaging in the new body-oriented therapy developed by Wilhelm Reich. To further his education Karl attended night classes at the New School for Social Research, studying with prominent gestalt psychologists. Through one of his Swiss professors Karl was introduced to social psychologist Lawrence K. Frank, who became an important mentor. Ellen Reece, a friend of Frank, hired Karl as the founding director of the Reece School for emotionally disturbed children. Karl also conducted a private practice as a child psychoanalyst. After 2 ¬Ω years of Reichian therapy he decided to give up his work as a teacher and therapist so he could focus on his own therapeutic process. Eager to exercise his creativity he decided to re-enter landscape architecture, which he felt had potential as a healing profession. = Private practice in landscape architecture = Starting as a laborer, Karl gradually developed a landscape contracting business and later a highly respected private practice in landscape architecture. His most complex and prestigious project was designing an interior landscape for The Four Seasons Restaurant in the newly constructed Seagram Building.The New York Times > Arts > Art & Design > Karl Linn, Architect of Urban Landscapes, Dies at 81 His ground-breaking work helped pave the way for the emerging field of large-scale interior landscape architecture. He designed landscapes for affluent owners of residential and corporate properties in and around Manhattan and along the Eastern seaboard. Despite critical acclaim, access to the highest quality materials, and the satisfaction of designing beautiful spaces, he was increasingly disturbed by the isolation of nuclear families that his designs reinforced and disheartened by the declining social relevance of his work. = Professor of environmental design = In 1959 he decided to accept the invitation of Ian McHarg to join the Landscape Architecture department at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, as the second full-time faculty member. While McHarg was expanding landscape architecture by developing the science of physical ecology and applying it to regional planning, Karl focused on the small-scale neighborhood environment, probing the intimate and qualitative relationships between people of all ages and their physical surroundings. Karl's innovative curriculum for the first-year graduate students engaged them as artists and philosophers, as craftspersons, and as social activists. Wishing to nurture the development of livable neighborhood communities Karl took his students into inner city neighborhoods where they provided community design-and-build service to the economically disenfranchised residents. Using a participatory process they engaged residents with volunteer professionals and work teams in envisioning, designing, and constructing \\"neighborhood commons\\"‚Äîcombination park / playground / community gathering places ‚Äì on derelict vacant lots. Karl likened this \\"urban barnraising\\" to his experience as a young man in Palestine collaboratively building a kibbutz. While at Penn, Karl developed a strong friendship with architect Louis Kahn, a fellow professor, who became another important mentor and supporter. When the dean argued that Karl was confusing landscape architecture with social service, Kahn wrote him a letter explaining the value of Karl's approach to the students' development. Social philosopher Lewis Mumford was another Penn professor who encouraged Karl in his work. The success of community-design-service education led Karl to found and direct pioneering community design-and-build centers, which became models for the Domestic Peace Corps‚Äîthe Neighborhood Renewal Corps Nonprofit Corporation of Philadelphia in 1961 and the Neighborhood Commons Nonprofit Corporation of Washington, D.C. in 1962. That same year he also developed the first landscape technicians training program for high school dropouts in Washington, D.C. Thereafter he inspired into being community design-and-build centers in eight other cities, and conducted community-design-service-education programs at various universities in the United States and abroad. For the next twenty-five years Karl served on the faculties of prominent universities, such as Massachusetts Institute of Technology and New Jersey Institute of Technology, promoting community landscape design and resource development in the service of social justice and peace. He was active in the American Society of Landscape Architects and gave lectures and workshops at conferences and universities throughout the world. = Mentors reflecting on Karl's work = \\"He [Karl] is not merely a theorist, but a maker bent on expressing environmental validity through his natural adjustability and resourcefulness. His design tendencies are noble. He is often forced to use frugal means, but always rejects what is done through design only for design's sake.\\" \\\\--Louis I. Kahn, architect, 1967 \\"If Karl Linn can get his ideas recognized and applied, I believe we can have a profound improvement in city living and a reduction in the present untoward consequences of urban development which so completely overlooks children and youth and forgets about providing for people to live and enjoy living.\\"‚ÄîLawrence K. Frank, social psychologist, Belmont, Massachusetts, 1962 (Letter to Editor, published in Landscape Architecture.) \\"I am delighted with the vigorous ways you are challenging current clich√©s, not only in theory but in practice. I can plainly see, in the work you are doing, the fresh shoots that will flower in a new age.\\" \\\\--Lewis Mumford, social philosopher and urban planner, 1961 = Working for peace = During his sabbatical in 1984, Karl worked full-time for nuclear disarmament. In Chicago, he collaborated with colleagues from a number of different cities to found the national organization Architects/Designers/Planners for Social Responsibility (ADPSR) Architects/Designers/Planners for Social Responsibility and served as chair of its Committee on Education. In 1986 the urgency of that work convinced him to take an early retirement from his tenured position at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. Drawing upon the \\"Despair and Empowerment\\" process developed by Buddhist scholar Joanna Macy and her colleagues, Karl worked with groups of students and colleagues to stage conferences and other events to help members come to grips emotionally with the threat of nuclear war. They designed and constructed temporary indoor commons to humanize large institutional spaces and provide a welcoming space for participants could gather to share thoughts, feelings, and stories and give one another support. Karl organized many charettes for the design of peace centers, gardens, and monuments and staged ceremonial peace tree plantings. At the 1986 annual meeting of the American Society of Landscape Architects in San Francisco he and colleagues created a program and small book called \\"The Emerging Landscape of Peace.\\" They called on the organization to approve a policy recommending a nuclear-free future, which was passed by the Board. At the 1988 Congress of the International Federation of Landscape Architects in Boston, Karl recruited 20 colleagues to present papers at workshops on \\"Places for Peace\\" and published them in a book by that name. = Community garden commons on the West Coast = After glasnost initiated by Michael Gorbachev lessened the threat of nuclear holocaust, Karl moved to the San Francisco Bay Area. In 1989 he collaborated with architect Carl Anthony, a long-time friend and colleague to found the Urban Habitat Program, initially sponsored by Earth Island Institute.The New York Times > Arts > Art & Design > Karl Linn, Architect of Urban Landscapes, Dies at 81 Urban Habitat's mission was to develop multicultural environmental leadership and restore inner-city neighborhoods. Linn had previously inspired Anthony to coordinate the creation of a neighborhood commons in Harlem in 1963, and Anthony credits Linn with advocating for environmental justice two decades before the field had a name.Karl Linn 1923-2005: Building a just world, one garden at a time by Diana Young Karl served on the boards of San Francisco League of Urban Gardeners and Berkeley Partners for Parks and on the steering committee of Berkeley's Community Gardening Collaborative. He helped found East Bay Urban Gardeners and the People of Color Greening Network. Karl often spoke and wrote about the need to reclaim the commons and counter the ongoing privatization of public lands. He viewed the destruction of community gardens in New York City as the final enclosure of the commons. He believed strongly that guidelines to secure public land for community gardens should be incorporated in cities' general plans as was done in Seattle. He worked hard to include such guidelines in Berkeley's General Plan, convinced that through the creation and use of accessible community garden commons, neighborhood blocks can become arenas for a new kind of extended family living. In 1993, for his 70th birthday, a community garden in north Berkeley was dedicated in his name to honor his lifelong service to community and peace. During the next two years Karl worked with volunteer wood artists, landscape architecture students, and AmeriCorps teams to revitalize the garden and add a handcrafted commons. With an overflowing wait list for plots in the refurbished Karl Linn Community Garden, he set his sights on a large weed-filled vacant lot across the street where the light rail tracks of the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) enter a tunnel. In 1995 he and City Council representative Linda Maio began to negotiate with BART for use of the land. Karl proceeded to coordinate the envisioning, planning, and construction of the Peralta and Northside Community Art Gardens, where ecological innovations and works of art intermingle with lush vegetation. The circular commons of the Peralta Garden, surrounded by a mosaic Snake Bench and colorful native California plants, is widely used for meetings, workshops, and special events by neighbors and organizations. Karl was actively involved in a local Jewish-Palestinian dialog group, which used the Peralta Commons for some of their activities, including the planting of a peace pole and dedication of the garden as a peace park.Berkeley Daily Planet In 1999, Karl collaborated with community and environmental activists, city officials, and other supporters to establish Berkeley's EcoHouse, purchasing a small run-down residence adjacent to the Karl Linn Community Garden and transforming it into a model of affordable ecological technologies. EcoHouse is now a project of the Ecology Center. The same year Karl conceptualized the transformation of the nearby section of the Ohlone Greenway into an interpretive exhibit of the natural and cultural history of the area. Artists, teachers, designers, engineers, and native plant restorationists worked tirelessly to develop and construct exhibits that evoke the Spanish ranchero period, the agricultural era, and the rich culture of the Ohlone people, who inhabited the area for at least 10,000 years. A 24-yard-long mural \\"From Elk Tracks to BART Tracks\\" depicts the history of the neighborhood from pre- settlement to the present, serving as an enormous picture book and inspiring passers-by to stop, reflect, and converse. This cluster of commons projects contributes to the social and ecological vitality of the Westbrae neighborhood and is maintained and developed by the volunteer Friends of the Westbrae Commons.  Works  *Building Commons and Community (2007 Oakland: New Village Press) (published posthumously) *\\"Reclaiming the Sacred Commons\\" (1999 New Village Journal, Issue 1)  Documentation of Linn's life and work  In 2003 filmmaker Rick Bacigalupi released his hour-long documentary A Lot in Common chronicling the planning and construction of the Peralta Community Art Garden and Commons.

It is part of Province 2 of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America. Its cathedral, Holy Trinity () located in the corner of Ave. Mgr. Guilloux & Rue Pav√©e in downtown Port-au-Prince, has been destroyed six times, including in the 2010 Haiti earthquake. It is the largest diocese in the Episcopal Church, with 89,717 members reported in 2018. Jean-Zach√© Duracin is the current bishop of Haiti. Og√© Beauvoir is bishop suffragan. History Holy Trinity parish was established in Port-au- Prince on Pentecost, May 25, 1863. Its church has since been destroyed six times. The first church was set on fire by Sylvain Salnave in 1866; possibly the second, and definitely the third, were destroyed by fire in 1873; yet another by fire on July 4, 1888; and a fifth by fire on July 5, 1908. Construction of the sixth Holy Trinity began in 1924. In 1864, the first Diocesan Synod was held. Then known as the Haitian Apostolic Orthodox Church, it was recognized as a member of the Anglican Communion in 1870. The Diocese of Haiti formally joined The Episcopal Church of the United States on May 15, 1875. The first Haitian bishop of the diocese was Luc Garnier. =2010 earthquake= The 2010 Haiti earthquake destroyed much of the infrastructure of the diocese, including Holy Trinity Cathedral and its school, the diocesan offices, the Couvent Sainte Marguerite, the College Saint Pierre, at least four of the diocese's more than 200 schools, and the home of Duracin and his injured wife. Duracin and the church leadership set up a camp in Port-au- Prince \\"the size of a football field\\" where destitute and injured Haitians could seek refuge. Episcopal Relief and Development began working with the Episcopal Diocese of the Dominican Republic to help with Haitians who cross the border, and with IMA World Health to medical help to the wounded around Port-au-Prince. Prior to the earthquake the Episcopal Diocese of Haiti's Development Office had trained a network of 28 community development workers for disaster management. Since the quake, these development agents completed initial needs assessments for their own communities. Two weeks after the quake the Episcopal Diocese of Haiti and Episcopal Relief & Development were helping over 25,000 survivors in 23 camps. Many of the camps are located at the sites of Episcopal churches and schools and range in size from a few hundred people to approximately 8000. Six of the camps inhabited by more than 15,000 survivors were not accessible by vehicles and were supplied by helicopter. Sanitation and clean water facilities were constructed for many of the camps.Episcopal Relief & Development Collaborating on Earthquake Response in Haiti Updated February 4, 2010 Bishops # James Theodore Holly (1874‚Äì1911) # Harry Roberts Carson (1923‚Äì43) * Spence Burton (Suffragan) (1939‚Äì1942) # C.

Lillian Exum Clement (1894‚Äì1925), also known as Lillian Stafford after marrying, was the first woman elected to the North Carolina General Assembly and the first woman to serve in any state legislature in the Southern United States.  Personal life  Lillian Exum Clement, known as \\"Exum\\" or \\"Ex\\" was the sixth of seven children born to George Washington Clement and Sara Elizabeth Burnett. Clement attended high school in Asheville, North Carolina and then Asheville Business College, after being encouraged to do so by prominent Asheville-area philanthropist Edith Vanderbilt. Clement's father was employed as a foreman by Edith's husband, George Vanderbilt. Clement took a job as an office deputy in the Buncombe County sheriff's department at the age of 14 and studied law with James Jefferson Britt and Robert G. Goldstein in her spare time. In 1916, she earned one of the highest scores on the state bar exam among 70 students and received an award. She became a criminal lawyer in 1917 and was the first female attorney in North Carolina without male partners. She served as chief clerk of the Buncombe County draft board. There is some dispute over Clement's date of birth, which is widely reported as 1894. According to the North Carolina State Archives, the 1900 U.S. Federal Census records her birth as taking place in March 1886, while the 1910 census records her year as 22, which would make her birth year 1888. Zoe Rhine, special collections librarian at Pack Memorial Library, contends that \\"Close research of the federal census records, the Asheville City Directories, the All Souls' Parish Yearbook and early newspaper articles leads this writer to believe that Exum [as she is often referred to] changed her birth year from 1886 to 1894. Given the times, as well as her public life at the time, she may have believed that there would have been a negative reaction to her marriage to a man nine years younger than herself‚Ä¶.‚Äù NC state archivist Fran Tracy-Wells also speculates that \\"It is possible that Exum listed her age on her marriage certificate as some eight years younger in order to be closer in age to her husband, born around 1894. Although ahead of her time, Exum was traditional in some ways and possibly feared the scorn of those who disapproved of a woman marrying a man some years her junior.\\" In 1921 Clement married E. Eller Stafford, a staff writer and telegraph editor for the Asheville Citizen. She gave birth prematurely to a daughter, Nancy, in 1923. Clement died of pneumonia in 1925 and is buried in Riverside Cemetery. Her last home, located in downtown Asheville, was designated with a historic preservation easement.  Political career  In 1920, Clement was nominated as a candidate by the Buncombe County Democrats and was elected to the General Assembly of 1921's House of Representatives by an all-male electorate by the overwhelming margin of 10,368 to 41. While in office, she introduced seventeen bills, sixteen of which passed. She introduced legislation to reduce the time required for a woman to show abandonment by her husband as grounds for divorce from 10 years to five years. One of her landmark bills required inoculations of cows against tuberculosis. She was the first lawmaker in NC to sponsor a bill requiring voting privacy. Two bills specifically addressed maternity and reproduction. First, a bill that was considered controversial at the time appropriated state funds for the Lindley Home for Unwed Mothers. Second, Clement introduced a bill that would allow the state to sterilize \\"mentally incompetent\\" individuals. Sterilization laws such as these were part of the eugenics movement in the United States and in North Carolina included the creation of the Eugenics Board of North Carolina in 1933. Clement served one term and was then appointed by the governor of North Carolina to be director of the State Hospital at Morgantown.  Legacy  A North Carolina progressive fundraising group, founded in 1997, is named \\"Lillian's List\\" in her honor. The organization provides training and support for pro-choice women candidates for North Carolina state elected offices. A state historical marker located at Charlotte Street at College Street, Asheville, North Carolina, honors Clement. It reads, \\"First female legislator in the South. Elected to N.C. House, 1920. Her law office was 400 yds. west; home 1/2 mi. NE.\\" In 2014 it was announced that \\"the historic Lillian Exum Clement house at 34 Hollywood Street will be forever protected by a donation of a preservation easement to the Preservation Society of Asheville and Buncombe County. Wingate Anders of Greensboro, NC, owner of the historic house and widower of Lillian's only daughter, made the donation of the easement to ensure the protection and preservation of this noteworthy historic site.\\" See also *Gertrude Dills McKee, first woman elected to the North Carolina State Senate, in 1930 References  External links  *Lillian's List *Women in the General Assembly *This Month in North Carolina History (November 1920) *Ibiblio.org *Western North Carolina Woman Category:Members of the North Carolina House of Representatives Category:1894 births Category:1925 deaths Category:North Carolina Democrats Category:Women state legislators in North Carolina Category:Politicians from Asheville, North Carolina Category:North Carolina lawyers Category:20th- century American lawyers Category:Deaths from pneumonia Category:Infectious disease deaths in North Carolina Category:20th-century American politicians Category:20th-century American women politicians Category:20th-century American women lawyers ","title":"Lillian Exum Clement"},{"id":"14037243","text":"Oc√©an was a wooden-hulled, armored frigate built for the French Navy in the mid to late 1860s and the lead ship of her class.

It became one of the most celebrated naval actions of the war, despite its relatively small size and a considerable dispute over what had actually occurred. Franco- American squadron During September 1779, the four remaining vessels from a seven-strong squadron, which had departed from the anchorage at Groix off L‚ÄôOrient in France on 14 August, nominally under the command of American Continental Navy captain John Paul Jones, voyaged from a brief stop off Ireland, round the north of Scotland, and down the east coast of Britain, creating havoc wherever possible. Although sailing under the American flag, all the vessels were loaned or donated by France, with French captains, except for the Alliance, which had been built in Amesbury, Massachusetts specifically for the Continental Navy (although it had a French captain too). The crews included Americans, French volunteers, British sailors previously captured by the Americans and offered the chance to get out of captivity, and many others seeking glory or prize money. On the evening of 22 September, Jones in Bonhomme Richard (an armed East India trading vessel he had reluctantly adapted for military use), accompanied by the little brigantine Vengeance under Captain Philippe Nicolas Ricot, had been off Spurn Head, hoping to catch a few prizes emerging from the Humber estuary, but he decided to head northward during the hours of darkness, and rendezvous with his frigates Alliance and Pallas, which had parted company from him further up the coast. Shortly after midnight, two vessels were seen, so signal lanterns were set. The strangers did not give the response that would identify them as members of his squadron. Jones's crew was called to quarters, but when daylight approached, about 5:30 am, and a chequered flag was hoisted on the mizzen mast, the mystery vessels finally identified themselves as the Alliance and Pallas. Captain Cottineau of the Pallas (in full, Denis Nicolas Cottineau de Kerloguen) later reported that Captain Pierre Landais of the Alliance had advised a rapid retreat if the approaching warship proved to be British‚Äînot a reassuring suggestion, given that his frigate, which had been acclaimed as the best warship yet made in America, was by a fair margin the faster and more manoeuvrable of the two. Early in the afternoon, the reunited squadron sighted a brig in Bridlington Bay, so at about 3:30 pm, a small schooner, captured just the previous day, was sent with a 15-man boarding party. There is a discrepancy at this point between Jones's official report and Bonhomme Richard‚Äôs log, but the reason for sending the schooner may have been not because the brig was in very shallow water, but because the main squadron was on its way to investigate a sighting of a ship further north near Flamborough Head. Shortly after the schooner was dispatched, Alliance, which had been somewhat ahead of the others, hoisted a signal and set off at speed. At least two large vessels had been sighted in the distance, so the schooner was immediately recalled by firing a signal gun, and the entire squadron headed towards the potentially rich prizes. The courses of the opponents up to the moment just before the first sighting, early afternoon, 23 September British convoy On 15 September, a convoy of more than 50 ships, which had been trading with ports in the Baltic, had set sail from a rendezvous off the Norwegian coast at the mouth of the Skagerrak channel to cross the North Sea. Some ships left the convoy before Britain came in sight, heading for northern ports such as Leith and the River Tyne. When the Yorkshire coast was sighted early on 23 September, just over 40 remained, mostly carrying iron or timber (often in the form of planks and masts for ships), bound for ports all around the southern half of the British Isles, from Hull round to Bristol, and Waterford in Ireland. Although the Baltic convoy had received a warning from Scarborough that an enemy squadron was in the vicinity, some ships ignored the signals (by both flags and guns) from the 44-gun escort ship to stay close for protection. Early in the afternoon, as they approached Flamborough Head, the lookouts of the foremost ships saw the danger in Bridlington Bay for themselves. Hastily tacking, they attempted to run for the safety of Scarborough. Serapis put on all sail to get between the fleeing merchant vessels and a potential attack from the Franco-American squadron, while the smaller (a hired armed ship built by private subscription and hired to the Admiralty for escort duty) shepherded the convoy. About 4 pm, with the whole convoy to his north, and the squadron of strangers clearly in sight to the south, Captain Richard Pearson of the Serapis signalled Countess of Scarborough to join him. As the squadron caught up, the Royal Navy vessels made sure to position themselves so that the presumed enemy could not easily sail round them to reach the slower merchant ships. First shots As the situation became clear, Alliance gradually slowed, allowing the rest of Jones's squadron to catch up (except for the little schooner carrying the boarding party, which could not sail fast enough). About 6 pm, Commodore Jones ordered Pallas to ride directly in his wake, to confuse the opposition about the squadron's strength, and half an hour later he hoisted signals ordering all vessels to form a single-file line of battle, to make best use of their broadsides as they passed the two British ships. Captain Landais, who unlike Jones had a great deal of formal training in naval leadership and tactics (and was aware of the latest French battle plans, used with considerable success against the Royal Navy at this time), decided to try a different plan. He used Alliance‚Äôs superior handling to sail off to one side, against the wind. In order to prevent him from sailing right past and chasing the convoy, Captain Thomas Piercy of the Countess of Scarborough had to do the same, leaving Serapis alone against the remaining three American ships. Finally, a little after 7 pm, Bonhomme Richard was within pistol-shot of the battle-ready Serapis. In the gathering dark, Pearson then hailed the potentially hostile ship to ask some pertinent questions: its name, its nationality etc. The answer was a few evasive remarks, followed by a shot (as he recalled it, but possibly a broadside) which Serapis answered with a broadside. A minute or two later, as soon as he was within range, Landais fired his own broadside at the Countess of Scarborough (theoretically just over of shot from 18 guns). Piercy soon replied (his maximum broadside being about 60 lb from 10 guns). Bonhomme Richard was about the same length as Alliance, and originally had almost the same armament, with a broadside of just over 200 pounds (91 kg) from 18 guns, but Jones had been able to add six second-hand 18-pound guns, mounted in such a way that they could be rotated to fire through ports low down on either side, adding 108 pounds (49 kg) of shot to a full broadside. In the event, though, these big guns only fired eight shots between them, because two of them quickly burst open under the strain, killing most of the people around them, so the remainder were abandoned. Serapis, one of the Royal Navy's newest ships, also had 18-pound guns (10 on each side, contributing 180 pounds (82 kg) to a total 22-gun broadside of around 280 pounds (130 kg)) which were in good condition. Additionally, being designed as a warship, Serapis was more manoeuvrable than the Bonhomme Richard. By coincidence, due to desertions and the need to crew captured vessels, Bonhomme Richard‚Äôs crew had been reduced from around 400 to about the same as Serapis, 320. First half-hour While Commodore Jones and Captain Landais were fighting their unexpectedly separate battles, Captains Cottineau of the Pallas and Ricot of Vengeance were left wondering what to do. In a well-organised formation, they might have been able to make a contribution, but to intervene in a ship-to-ship duel would be very dangerous. In theory, they could have taken advantage of the confusion to sail off after the stragglers of the convoy, but night had now fallen, and until the moon rose, they would not be able to see their prey. Also, it quickly became clear that Bonhomme Richard would need help. Therefore, they waited until they could be useful. About this time, the little schooner caught up with them, but there was no way to transfer the potentially very useful boarding team to Bonhomme Richard or Alliance. Commodore Jones, accepting that if he could not use the 18-pounders, he could not win a gun fight, quickly adopted a policy of trying to grapple and board his opponent. Pearson‚Äôs crew spotted the change and adapted rapidly, using the superior maneuverability of Serapis to keep out of reach, while continuing to bombard the slower ship. On one occasion though, according to the later recollection of First Lieutenant Richard Dale, Bonhomme Richard‚Äôs bow ran into Serapis‚Äô stern and, with neither side able to take advantage of the situation, Captain Pearson cheekily asked the punning question, \\"Has your ship struck?\\". Dale reports Jones's reply as, very simply, \\"I have not yet begun to fight!\\" Meanwhile, after two or three broadsides exchanged with Alliance, less than 20 minutes after the first shot, Captain Piercy was astonished to see his opponent (with just one of the little shots from the Countess of Scarborough stuck in its tough timberwork) move away to rejoin Pallas, which was still waiting for an opportunity to be useful. Landais later claimed that his opponent had sailed away under cover of smoke. Piercy, his ship relatively unharmed, and out of range of any of the four Americans, headed straight for the main battle, to see if he could help Serapis, but Jones's close-quarters policy meant that to intervene now would be madness. Quite possibly shots fired by the Countess of Scarborough at the Bonhomme Richard would hit Serapis, or worse still, massive shots from Serapis could accidentally hit the Countess of Scarborough. Instead, Piercy simply gave the impression that he was going to intervene, trying to attract the attention of Alliance and Pallas. Cottineau saw the potential danger (or responded to a request by Landais) and quickly steered towards the Countess of Scarborough, so Piercy slowly retreated, sailing with the wind. Two gunnery duels Shortly afterwards, John Paul Jones got the opportunity he had been striving for‚Äînot a moment too soon, as his ship had been holed below the waterline and was becoming increasingly unresponsive. Serapis‚Äô jib-boom caught in the rigging of Bonhomme Richard‚Äôs mizzen mast, and Jones immediately led his crew in attaching the two ships together as strongly as they could. Seeing the danger, Pearson dropped anchor. Because both ships were under sail, when Serapis came to an abrupt halt, Bonhomme Richard would keep going, and with luck, tear free. Jones‚Äô men had been very efficient, so what actually happened was that Bonhomme Richard‚Äôs motion was turned into a rotation, and the two ships, still firmly attached, ended up side-by-side, facing in opposite directions, their great guns touching each other‚Äôs hull planks. Better still for Jones, Serapis‚Äô spare anchor caught in the woodwork of Bonhomme Richard‚Äôs stern, locking the two ships in that extraordinary position. Making a virtue of necessity, Pearson‚Äôs crew fired broadsides straight into Bonhomme Richard‚Äôs hull, tearing huge holes in its side, and doing terrible damage to the gun- decks. For Jones‚Äôs boarding plan to succeed, he needed to drive all the Royal Navy sailors from Serapis‚Äô deck before his ship was destroyed beneath him. He had prepared well for such an eventuality, and his men at stations up the masts were equipped both with small guns and with incendiary grenades. Three 9-pound guns on the quarter-deck (the rear part of the upper deck) were still usable, although one was on the wrong side, and had to be dragged around. Two of these guns were loaded with anti-personnel grapeshot to help drive Pearson's men from the deck, but the third was used with solid bar-shot (see Naval Artillery page) aimed at Serapis‚Äô main-mast. By this time, towards 8:30 pm, the moon had risen. Moving slowly downwind away from the anchored ships, Pallas and Countess of Scarborough began a second battle of broadsides (which for Pallas meant 16 guns firing just over of shot together). Hovering in the background, still, were Vengeance and the schooner, with the boarding party which John Paul Jones really needed. Captain Landais, of the Alliance, after observing for a time, formed another plan, and set off after Pallas. On the way, Alliance passed the two locked ships, still anchored, still firing broadsides at each other. As the direction of shots was now predictable, Captain Landais could safely approach within firing range of Serapis, from the right direction- bow or stern rather than flank. This he did, firing a broadside including round-shot, bar-shot and grapeshot at Serapis‚Äô bow. Right next to that bow, still, was Bonhomme Richard‚Äôs stern. As much lethal shot hit Jones‚Äôs men as Pearson‚Äôs, and metal also flew along Bonhomme Richard‚Äôs gun- deck, killing some of the remaining gunners and wrecking several gun- carriages. Landais then continued on his way. After that, Bonhomme Richard started definitively losing the battle. Still, efforts to make the situation too hot for the British, both figuratively and literally, continued. Just after 9:30 pm, one of these attempts succeeded in spectacular fashion. According to Jones's published campaign report, grenade-thrower William Hamilton ventured right out along a yard-arm until he could look almost straight down on the deck of Serapis (by this time, almost cleared of men), and began trying to drop grenades, not onto the deck but down the hatches. By good fortune, one of these ignited a charge of gunpowder placed in readiness (contrary to standard fire safety practice, but Captain Pearson had encouraged his men to \\"fire briskly\\") for loading into one of Serapis‚Äô 18-pound guns. The problem with this version of the story is that the 18-pounders were on the lower deck, so it would take a very lucky drop to reach them from high above. Captain Pearson speculated that either a grenade had been thrown through a hole in the hull, from Bonhomme Richard‚Äôs gun deck, or that the charge had been ignited by accident. Whatever the cause, the effect was devastating. As the ignited charge blew up, it scattered burning gunpowder, setting off other charges nearby, and ultimately the chain reaction covered the entire rear half of Serapis‚Äô lower gun-deck, killing or severely burning many of the gunnery crewmen, forcing some to leap into the sea to extinguish their burning clothes, and putting five guns out of action. In the confusion, some of the crew clambering back on board after jumping into the sea were nearly mistaken for American boarders. Still in action, still moving with the wind away from the main fight, were Pallas and the Countess of Scarborough. Alliance was catching up fast, though, and as the near-undamaged, speedy, well-armed frigate approached, Captain Piercy understood that with seven of his own guns dismounted, four of his crew dead, twenty wounded, his rigging and sails too badly damaged to make a speedy getaway, he could neither win nor escape. With Landais hovering just beyond the range of his guns, he therefore struck his colours. Alliance approached him, seeking to take the Captain's formal surrender, but after brief exchanges with both Piercy and Cottineau, Captain Landais accepted that his colleague should take the surrender and attend to casualties, while Alliance returned to the main battle. Because the return journey would be against the wind, this would, as Captain Piercy presumably intended, take a while. Jones vs. Pearson (plus Landais) The English myth: \\"Paul Jones, shooting Lieut. Grubb, for attempting to strike the Colours\\", from \\"The Life and History of PAUL JONES, the English Corsair\\", c1820 The absence of any other combatants had bought Serapis a considerable amount of time. Bonhomme Richard‚Äôs gun decks were now so badly damaged that most of the British shots were passing straight through without touching anything, and the great guns were almost completely silenced. There were almost as many fires to be extinguished as there were aboard Serapis, but on the other hand, the hold was filling with water because one of the pumps was in ruins. Commodore Jones was exhausted, and apparently slumped on the chicken coop for a brief rest. Somehow (according to his later memoirs), a rumour went around that he was dead or dying, and his gunner and carpenter, both wounded, hastily consulted with the master-at-arms. Together they decided, a little before 10 pm, to surrender by striking the ship‚Äôs colours, but the flag had already been shot away, so their only option was to shout. Captain Pearson shouted back, asking whether the Americans had really struck their colours. Possibly his Lieutenant of Marines relayed this message. Certainly, Jones‚Äôs reply was firmly negative. Jones himself recalled shouting something along the lines of \\"I have not yet thought of it, but I am determined to make you strike,\\" at which point, presumably, the surrendering officers realised he was still very much alive and returned to their duties. A much more dramatic version appeared in newspapers within days of the event, allegedly based on the testimony of an ex-crewman who thought he heard something like \\"I may sink, but I‚Äôll be damned if I strike\\", and witnessed the captain using his pistols to shoot the three officers who were attempting to surrender (another version of the story also circulated, with the chicken coop but without the shootings, which fits better with Jones's memory). In all the noise, Pearson could not actually hear the reply to his question, so he decided to send a boarding team. At this point, once again, Jones's preparation paid off. The boarders were met by a previously hidden defensive force, which swiftly drove them back to Serapis. By this time, the attempts to bring down Serapis‚Äô main mast had also borne some fruit (ironically, the only reason why it had not fallen down was because it was leaning on Bonhomme Richard‚Äôs rigging). And then, perhaps about 10:15 pm, Alliance returned, and Landais delivered another of his helpful broadsides. Jones‚Äôs men yelled at him to stop, and the commodore attempted to send orders for Alliance to help with a boarding operation. The moon was full, brightly illuminating the distinctive yellow livery of Serapis. Bonhomme Richard was clearly showing agreed lantern signals, but Landais stuck to his plan, sailing round the \\"safe\\" sides of the locked ships to fire broadsides aimed, in his theory, at both bow and stern of Serapis. In reality, Bonhomme Richard, yet again, was holed below the waterline and started settling so rapidly that the master-at-arms took it upon himself to release the hundred or so prisoners from previous captures, who had been held on the lower decks. As they had not been put in manacles, they were completely free and could potentially have helped Serapis‚Äô crew to overrun the American ship. Jones reacted quickly to the new crisis, successfully urging the prisoners to put all their efforts into working the three remaining pumps to save their own lives. John Paul Jones, from an engraving by c. 1779 after his victory at the Battle of Flamborough Head. Captain Pearson of Serapis had only limited knowledge of the escalating chaos aboard Bonhomme Richard. He too was losing many men from Alliance‚Äôs attacks, and he could not move his ship. Alliance, still effectively undamaged, could keep firing at will. On the other hand, nearly every ship in the convoy he had been sent to protect had reached safety before the battle even began. Following the second of Alliance‚Äôs new round of broadsides, like Piercy before him, he decided that he could achieve nothing more by continuing to fight. Not long after 10:30 pm, he called for quarter and struck his colours in person. Thus the Americans finally got the chance to board the Serapis, but this did not go quite as well as it could have. Three shots were fired by British sailors who had not got the message. Midshipman John Mayrant, following First Lieutenant Dale aboard, got a pike stuck through his leg. Pearson's first lieutenant was among those reluctant to believe that his captain had surrendered, and Dale made sure that he stayed with Pearson rather than leaving him to his own devices. A short time later, as Captain Pearson was boarding Bonhomme Richard to hand over his ceremonial sword, the main-mast of Serapis finally fell overboard, perhaps as a result of work to separate the two ships, dragging the damaged mizzen-top-mast with it. As Bonhomme Richard got under way, Dale attempted to follow in Serapis, and learned two important facts in quick succession. First, Serapis would not move, and second, he had a very large splinter in his leg, which now caused him to fall over. The first problem was rectified by cutting the anchor cable, the second by returning Dale to Bonhomme Richard for treatment. Boats from both Serapis and Alliance were used to begin the evacuation of Bonhomme Richard‚Äôs crew. One or two of these boats went missing during the night, as ex-captive British crewmen took the opportunity to go home (hence the eyewitness newspaper stories). The combatants, although they probably cared little, had been observed by thousands of onlookers, for on that clear night, with a near-full moon, the action could be seen from a long stretch of the high Yorkshire coastline, from Scarborough in the north to Flamborough Head itself in the south. There is no record of final casualty figures aboard the two main combatants. Captain Pearson, in a postscript to his battle report, stated that there were \\"many more than\\" 49 dead and 68 wounded aboard Serapis, but his figure of 300 casualties aboard Bonhomme Richard seems very high, unless it includes a great many of the captives stuck below decks during the battle. British press reports claimed 70 deaths on Bonhomme Richard, which, assuming a similar ratio to the Serapis figures would give around 100 wounded. Aftermath Overnight, pumping continued on Bonhomme Richard, and repairs began (also, the powder was removed from the magazine, which was threatened by the continued smouldering of the ship's woodwork). With the water still getting deeper, the guns from the lower decks were reluctantly heaved overboard‚Äînot a very difficult task, as much of the hull was missing. The dead went the same way, though with rather more dignity. At 2 pm the next day, with the carpenter insisting that the ship could not be saved, Commodore Jones took the ex-captain and lieutenant of Serapis to safety, but returned early in the evening to check on progress. Finding that the water was still rising, he ordered the wounded, who ideally should not have been moved, to be transferred to other vessels (Pearson was not aware of this nocturnal operation, and wrote in his official report that Jones had left the wounded aboard). At 10 pm, those who had been brought in from other ships to man the pumps were ordered to leave, and during the rest of the night the most important items aboard were removed. These did not include personal possessions, not even most of Jones's. The flotilla was slowly moving east-south-east away from the coast all this time, and was not seen from land again after night fell (as Flamborough Head is about high, ships‚Äô sails would be visible on a clear day up to away). At 4 am the next day, 25 September, pumping was abandoned, with the water almost up to the lower deck. The wind was getting stronger, so all personnel abandoned ship at 10 am, and just before 11, as a boat approached from the commodore's new command ship, Serapis, to try to salvage a few more items, Bonhomme Richard started to disappear beneath the waves. Several Royal Navy ships were on their way, but once again French obstinacy had a semi- beneficial effect. Jones wished to take his prizes to Dunkirk, but the French captains insisted on following the original orders from their government masters to head for the island of Texel in the neutral United Provinces (the Netherlands). They arrived safely on 3 October, while the British ships searched for them in all the wrong places, having ignored a correct preliminary estimate by observers in Yorkshire. Jones immediately wrote a report to his own government superior, Benjamin Franklin, one notable feature of which was, inevitably, the conduct of Captain Landais. Furious though he was, he wrote, \\"I forbear to take any steps With him until I have the advice and approbation of your Excellency\\". Captain Cottineau, on the other hand, placed himself under no such obligation, and called Landais a coward to his face. Landais challenged him to a duel during which Landais ran his sword through Cottineau's chest, just missing the heart. Landais‚Äô later history is in the Alliance article. While the ships were being repaired, Jones had to deal with the consequences of landing in a neutral port with prizes of war. He turned on the charm for diplomatic negotiations at The Hague and networking in Amsterdam, where he was the toast of society, known as \\"The Terror of the English\\". On 8 October, the British ambassador, Sir Joseph Yorke, wrote to the rulers of the United Provinces, claiming that under international law, Jones, not being accredited by a recognised state, was a rebel and a pirate. Therefore, the two captured ships should be detained for handing back to their rightful owners. Yorke also asked that the wounded from the two ships should be taken ashore and treated at British Government expense. That request was agreed to immediately, but it was over a fortnight later, during which repair work proceeded without any hindrance, when the Dutch replied that their neutrality meant they could not judge the legality of actions between foreigners on the open sea, but that that would also apply to any attempt made by the British to retake their ships once they left port. Furthermore, Jones's squadron was obliged to leave the Texel \\"as soon as possible\\", and could not be supplied with arms or ammunition except \\"what are absolutely necessary to carry them safe to the first foreign port they can come at\\". Yorke replied by quoting treaties, returning to the \\"pirate\\" theme, and pointing out that under Dutch law, commanders of foreign naval forces were obliged to present authorisation from their governments when docking in Dutch ports. As the United Provinces did not officially recognise the government of the United States, that was a very tricky legal point, which the Dutch took quite a while to consider. To get round the problem, Pallas and Vengeance were declared officially French, and Captain Cottineau became commodore of a French squadron, his flagship the captured Serapis. With Landais barred from command until the case against him could be heard, Jones became captain of the avowedly American Alliance, not associated in any way with the newly French squadron. Several Royal Navy ships were waiting just off the coast for the day he was obliged to leave‚Äîthe Dutch authorities making a great show of trying to eject him‚Äîbut as winter storms made it more and more difficult for them to keep station, John Paul Jones (after recruiting another American commander, Gustavus Conyngham, who had escaped from British captivity) slipped away among a group of Dutch ships on 27 December and sailed to France.Coconut Cup in Silver, presented to Pearson in 1780 by the Royal Exchange Assurance Back in England, something rather unexpected was happening. On the one hand, the overall effects of Jones's cruise and the activities of other raiders, such as the privateer duo of Black Prince and Black Princess, were reported with a sort of resentful admiration. On the other, although Pearson and Piercy had lost the battle, they were the only Royal Navy captains who had actually managed to engage Jones's squadron at all, and they had sunk his flagship. Their official reports appeared in British newspapers in mid-October, forcing the Americans to leak Jones's (some of which he definitely had not intended for publication). Most importantly, they had fully achieved their mission, which was to protect the convoy. When they returned home, about the beginning of November, they were honoured by the towns of Kingston upon Hull and Scarborough and were rewarded by both the Russia Company, principal owner of vessels in the convoy, and the Royal Exchange Assurance Company. Pearson even gained a knighthood. In 1780, to honour him for his actions in protecting the convoy, Pearson was presented with three Coconut Cups mounted in silver by Wakelin & Taylor. In 1782, the Royal Navy took the unusual step of naming a new ship Serapis- an acknowledgement rarely given to a vessel which lost a battle.

The film stars Kirk Cameron, Erin Bethea and Ken Bevel. Although the film received generally unfavorable reviews from film critics, Fireproof was successful at the box office, becoming a surprise hit, debuting at No. 4 and becoming the highest-grossing independent film of 2008, grossing over $33 million. It received awards from evangelical Christian organizations, including the Best Feature Film award at the 2009 San Antonio Independent Christian Film Festival. Plot Married couple Caleb (Kirk Cameron), a fire captain, and Catherine Holt (Erin Bethea), a hospital administrator, are experiencing marital difficulties. At work, Caleb underscores the importance of never leaving one's partner behind, but at home, he and Catherine argue constantly. Catherine accuses Caleb of being selfish because he prioritizes his desire for a $24,000 boat over paying for medical equipment and bills for Catherine's ailing mother. She is also frustrated about his habitual use of internet pornography. Caleb feels unappreciated and undervalued. Their constant arguing escalates to the point that Catherine demands a divorce, to which an enraged Caleb agrees. Caleb's best friend and fellow firefighter, Michael (Ken Bevel), and Caleb's father, John (Harris Malcom), convince him to hold off on divorce proceedings. His father persuades him to try the Love Dare, a 40-day challenge for marriage improvement wherein a spouse alters the way they treat their partner. Caleb reluctantly agrees, though he decides not to tell Catherine. At the hospital where she works, Catherine has been openly flirting with Dr. Gavin Keller (Perry Revell). Caleb begins The Love Dare halfheartedly, viewing the tasks as more of a checklist than outreach. Meanwhile, nurses at Catherine's hospital warn her not to trust Caleb, as they believe he is trying to butter her up to secure a more favorable divorce settlement. With encouragement from his father and Michael, Caleb continues, though Catherine eschews his affections and grows closer to Dr. Keller. Finding Catherine unmoved, Caleb is consoled by his father, while Michael reveals that he has been divorced. Caleb sustains burns on the job, is admitted to the hospital where his wife works, and is treated by Dr. Keller. During treatment, Dr. Keller discovers that Catherine is married and Caleb is her spouse. Caleb continues The Love Dare with a renewed faith, even destroying their home computer to distance himself from any pornographic addictions and temptations. However, Catherine gives him an envelope with a petition for divorce, leaving Caleb heartbroken. Catherine discovers that her mother's medical equipment costs have been paid anonymously and erroneously believes it was Dr. Keller, bringing them even closer. Caleb eventually discovers the burgeoning affair and discreetly confronts the doctor. After Caleb leaves, Dr. Keller produces a wedding band, revealing that he is also married, and terminates his pursuit of Catherine. Catherine confronts Caleb after discovering his Love Dare journal, and he reveals to her that he has completed the challenge but is still following its guidelines. Catherine says she needs time to reconsider the divorce. She later discovers that Caleb used his savings to pay for almost all of her mother's medical equipment, with Dr. Keller only contributing $300. Moved by Caleb's selflessness, Catherine reconciles with him. Caleb discovers that his mother, whom he has treated poorly, completed The Love Dare for his father, rather than vice versa as Caleb had originally thought. The film ends with Caleb and Catherine renewing their wedding vows.

Ed Gonzalez of LA Weekly said, \\"Fireproof stops becoming relatable to us all and only to the already, or easily, indoctrinated.\\" Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter said, \\"While hardly sophisticated in its approach and certainly not polished in its technical elements, the film does get its heartfelt message across with undeniable sincerity. Its success at the box office, which will no doubt continue on home video, demonstrates that there's no shortage of filmgoers dissatisfied with cynical Hollywood product.\\" Josh Rosenblatt of The Austin Chronicle criticized the film's story, saying it \\"makes for fruitful soul-fishing but lousy drama.\\" Joe Leydon of Variety gave the film a positive review, saying, \\"Cameron is genuinely compelling as Caleb, a work-obsessed firefighter on the verge of divorce from his neglected wife.\\" Cheryl Dickow of the Catholic Exchange said, \\"I feel it is necessary to send a message to Catholics everywhere that this is a movie worth seeing.\\" =Home media= Fireproof was released to DVD on January 27, 2009 and to Blu-ray on September 29, 2009. Included as special features are deleted scenes, bloopers, behind-the-scenes making-of featurettes, and a commentary by the Kendrick Brothers.

The Bootleg Beatles In 1979, aged 28, Harrison had joined the cast of the West End musical Beatlemania.Cast of Beatlemania: Neil Harrison, Rhythm Guitar In March 1980, after the musical's last West End show, Harrison formed The Bootleg Beatles with fellow cast members Andre Barreau and David Catlin-Birch. The band invested their dwindling finances in two guitars ‚Äì an Epiphone and a Gretsch ‚Äì as well as two Vox amplifiers, four black polo-necks and a wig.The Bootleg Beatles Souvenir Programme 2004‚Äì2005 On 26 March 2011 at a gig in St Albans, Neil Harrison ‚Äì otherwise known as 'Bootleg John' ‚Äì shocked the audience after coming to the stage to perform 'Imagine' as an encore by announcing that he was leaving the group 'to bring the average age down a bit'. He sang \\"Imagine\\" after shouts of support and thanks from the crowd and was presented with a bouquet of flowers and a further gift from the band. The Bootlegs then performed \\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\\" followed rather fittingly by the medley of songs from the Abbey Road album that culminates with \\"The End\\". The band left the stage to a standing ovation and further shouts of thanks to Neil. Meet the Beatles Harrison has stated that he has met two original Beatles, on three occasions. His first experience was in 1968, when he and some friends sang Christmas carols outside Paul McCartney's father's house on the Wirral. The second meeting was in 1996 at David Gilmour's 50th birthday party. Gilmour booked both the Bootleg Beatles and the Australian Pink Floyd Show as he'd \\"always wanted to have the Beatles support Pink Floyd\\". George Harrison was in the audience and quipped \\"you probably know the chords better than I do\\" and \\"Where's the Bootleg Brian Epstein? 'Cos he's got all the money!\\" The third meeting was at the Party at the Palace for the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II in 2002, where McCartney headlined. Other works Outside the Bootleg Beatles, Harrison released an album in 1974 on Deram Records called All Dressed Up and Nowhere To Go. The album sounds very similar to The Beatles' works. He also wrote several songs for Lulu's album Don't Take Love For Granted, including the title track and \\"I Could Never Miss You (More Than I Do)\\", which was released as a single in 1981 and also included on her 1981 self-titled album Lulu. He has released another solo album entitled Richmond Hill. He sang an acoustic version of \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" for the 2013 Spanish movie \\"Living is Easy with Eyes Closed\\".

In 2009 √òstfold Energi, together with Nord-Tr√∏ndelag Elektrisitetsverk, purchased Siso and Lakshola power plants in Nordland county. Combined production at the power plants totals around 1 TWh. This acquisition brings √òstfold Energi‚Äôs share of Norway‚Äôs total hydropower production to around 1.7 per cent. √òstfold Energi is co-owner of Kvalheim Kraft DA who owns and operates the windmill park Mehuken in Sogn og Fjordane on the west coast of Norway. The wind farm was opened in 2001 with five wind turbines. In 2010 the wind farm was extended with additional eight wind turbines. The annual production of electricity is now 65 GWh. The approximately 3,000 households in the V√•gs√∏y municipality are now self- supported with electricity from the wind turbines at Mehuken. √òstfold Energi owns and operates two modern waste-to-energy plants. The plant in Sarpsborg converts waste residue (house refuse and industrial waste) into thermal energy (process steam) to Borregaard. The plant in Rakkestad provides process steam and district heating to nearby industrial companies. Totally 181 GWh thermal energy was produced at the waste-to-energy plants during 2010. The company also holds ownership of Zephyr (33%), Norsk Gr√∏nnkraft (25%), Kvalheim Kraft (33%), Rygge sivile lufthavn (15%) and Hafslund (4.5%).

Prof. Macaulay was a graduate of the University of Texas and The Citadel and served two years with the U.S. Army in the Korean War where he managed the PX. After his army service, Macaulay joined the Cuban Revolution in 1958, to overthrow Fulgencio Batista. As Castro's forces closed in on Havana, in December 1958 Macaulay started training firing squads and was promoted to lieutenant. Members of Macaulay's unit included Rafael del Pino, who became chief of Cuba's air force, but later defected. After the revolution, Cuba gave Macaulay a tomato farm and he profitably shipped one crop to Pompano Beach, Florida. However, in 1961, when Castro announced intentions to control exports, he left for the U.S. where he had to fight a legal battle to retain his U.S. citizenship. Macaulay then earned a doctorate from the University of Texas and began teaching at the University of Florida (1964-1986) where he became known as an expert in Latin American history. He retired from teaching in 1986. Macaulay authored The Sandino Affair (1967) (a study of Nicaraguan resistance to U.S. occupation in the 1920-30s), A Rebel in Cuba (1970), The Prestes Column (1974) and Dom Pedro: the struggle for liberty in Brazil and Portugal, 1798‚Äì1834 (1986, ). He co-authored with David Bushnell The Emergence of Latin America in the Nineteenth Century (1988, 2nd: 1994, ). He returned to Cuba in 1991, after being repeatedly denied entry by the Castro government. He later made various other trips as an academic. Macaulay's experiences in Cuba helped inspire two documentaries Cuba: A Lifetime of Passion (2007) and Patria o Muerte (still in production).

Their innovative style creates a musical atmosphere that brings silent film into the modern era, synthesizing sounds of Eastern European music, Impressionism, and Jazz Fusion. The New Yorker said \\"This is music that bubbles up from the intersection of aesthetics and the id,\\" They have performed at Lincoln Center, Symphony Space, The Smithsonian, World Financial Center, SF Jazz, and their home at the Castro Theater in San Francisco, among many other venues in the US, Mexico, and Canada.  History  Founded by Beth Custer and Richard Marriott, the ensemble got its name from a performance art nightclub called the Club Foot which flourished during the 1980s in the Bayview district of San Francisco. Marriott, who lived upstairs, formed a house band that came to be called the \\"Club Foot Orchestra.\\" Two albums released on Ralph Records document the music of this period: Wild Beasts and Kidnapped. Richard Marriott still serves as the group's creative and artistic director. The Club Foot Orchestra performs live with a variety of feature-length and short-subject silent films ranging from German Expressionist to Comedy Their unique compositions often rely on a collaborative writing process that makes their scores both varied and cohesive. This collaborative process is a fundamental element in their unique musical style. They also perform music in other genres, such as Custer's score for choreographer Joe Goode's Maverick Strain performance installation and Marriott's scores for Della Davidson's Ten PM Dream and Eva Luna.

Later that night I saw a Lily Tomlin skit on Saturday > Night Live. She was reading the Dow Jones averages of various art trends. > She reported, \\"Pop art up 10... Op art up 20... Expressionism down 30.\\" I > turned the channel. And there was The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. The distorted > sets and dreamlike atmosphere in the film were the qualities that I always > envisioned accompanying our music. The subversive plot was drenched in the > unconscious. I was obsessed to write for that film. Marriott's score premiered at the 1987 Mill Valley Film Festival. After touring with Caligari, Marriott wrote a score for the 1922 F. W. Murnau horror classic Nosferatu, with sections contributed by Gino Robair, introducing the period of collaborative composition. Nosferatu is a powerful and evocative score and proved equally successful with audiences, and led to an appearance at New Music America in New York City in 1989. Over the next 10 years, new scores for the films Metropolis, Sherlock Jr., Pandora's Box and The Hands of Orlac were composed by the group and performed throughout the US, following their premieres at the Castro Theater. Many short subject films were also composed during this time. Francis Lederer, who played Alwa Sch√∂n in Pandora's Box, attended a screening of that film in 1995 at the Nuart Theater in Los Angeles. Buster Keaton's wife Eleanor attended a screening of Sherlock Jr. in 1993, and exclaimed, \\"Bravo Club Foot Orchestra! Buster would have loved your music.\\" In 1999 a smaller version of the orchestra, along with Gamelan Sekar Jaya, performed with the film Legong: Dance of the Virgins, co-written by Marriott and Indonesian composer Made Subandi. More recently, the group has performed new scores for Battleship Potemkin, Phantom of the Opera, and Go West, in addition to Marriott's reworking of Metropolis to match the newly restored and much longer print. Three new Buster Keaton short-subject films (The Blacksmith, One Week, Cops) were showcased in a Club Foot Orchestra retrospective hosted by the San Francisco Silent Film Festival at the Castro Theater in September 2018. The Club Foot Gamelan premiered a score for the silent Indonesian film Goona Goona at the 2019 San Francisco Silent Film Festival, featuring the Balinese virtuosos Nyoman Windha and Dewa Barata. In 2019 - 2020, the Club Foot Modern Machines has been performing yet another new score for Metropolis, this time featuring kinetic sound-producing sculptures created by Matt Heckert, Kal Spelletich, and Obtainium Works.  Twisted Tales of Felix the Cat  In 1995, The Club Foot Orchestra scored and recorded 39 episodes of the CBS cartoon series The Twisted Tales of Felix the Cat, produced by FIlm Roman.

He also played for Swansea Town. O'Driscoll was a dual international and played for both Ireland teams - the FAI XI and the IFA XI. Irish international When O'Driscoll began his international career in 1948 there were, in effect, two Ireland teams, chosen by two rival associations. Both associations, the Northern Ireland-based IFA and the Ireland-based FAI claimed jurisdiction over the whole of Ireland and selected players from the whole island. As a result, several notable Irish players from this era, including O'Driscoll, played for both teams. =IFA XI= Between 1948 and 1949 O'Driscoll made 3 appearances for the IFA XI . On 9 October 1948 he made his international debut for the IFA XI in a 6-2 defeat against England. On 17 November 1948 he made his second appearance for the IFA XI in a 3-2 defeat against Scotland. He made his last appearance for the IFA XI against Wales on 9 March 1949 in a 2-0 defeat. =FAI XI= Between 1948 and 1949 O'Driscoll also made 3 appearances for the FAI XI. He won his first cap on 5 December 1948 in a 1-0 defeat in a friendly Switzerland at Dalymount Park. He also played for the FAI XI on 24 April 1949 in another friendly at Dalymount against Belgium. This time the FAI XI lost 2-0. He won his final FAI XI cap on 2 June 1949 a in 3-1 away defeat against Sweden, a qualifier for the 1950 FIFA World Cup.

First discovering magnetic stripes on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean off the United States West Coast, he later also identified them around the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Career Mason received his doctorate in geophysics at Imperial College, London, in 1947. In 1955, while on sabbatical at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California, Mason secured permission to embark and tow the ASQ-3A fluxgate magnetometer, developed by Victor Vacquier of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, behind the United States Coast and Geodetic Surveys survey ship USC&GS; Pioneer (OSS 31) while she participated in a joint survey effort with the U.S. Navy. Scripps was cooperating in order to map any magnetic anomalies the magnetometer detected on the seafloor. During the summer of 1955, Mason arranged to have the ASQ-3A - originally designed for use aboard aircraft - housed in a non-magnetic, fishlike container, making it the first marine magnetometer. In August 1955, Pioneer conducted a survey in the Pacific Ocean along the United States West Coast from Point Conception, California, to Cape Flattery, Washington, with Mason aboard and the ASQ-3A trailing in her wake in its container. Within hours, Mason detected an unmistakable pattern of north-south magnetic \\"stripes\\" in the seafloor rocks; as Pioneers cruise continued, Mason continued to observe this pattern throughout the survey area. Masons work aboard Pioneer with the fluxgate magnetometer thus revealed \\"magnetic striping\\" on the floor of the Pacific, the first time it had been noted anywhere. The magnetic data he collected from the ocean crust later was interpreted as containing field reversals that were used by Canadian geophysicist Lawrence Morley to prove seafloor spreading and plate tectonics. Mason was appointed to the Chair of Pure Geophysics at Imperial College in 1967 and became head of the college's Geophysics Department in 1977. During the 1980s, he pioneered extremely accurate techniques for measuring the Earth's crust which further confirmed plate tectonic movements.

History  On 31 August 1967 in the city of Kursk the 245th Motor Rifle Division was formed. The division consisted of the 39th, 153rd, and 376th Motor Rifle Regiments, the 507th Tank Regiment, the 820th Artillery Regiment, and an anti-aircraft rocket regiment of unknown designation which had fought in the Second World War. From 1971 the Division was deployed at Gusinoozyorsk in Buryatia, as part of the Siberian Military District. To replace the 245th Motor Rifle Division at Kursk, the 196th Motor Rifle Division (Military Unit Number 52299, including the 595th MRR) was formed. On 1 December 1987 the 196th MRD became a territorial training centre (–¢–£–¶), and then on 25 January 1989 the centre was disbanded. The 255th 'Spare' MRD also existed in outline form under the 196th MRD in Kursk. The 245th MRD was a part of the 29th Army, then the 57th Army Corps, and since 2003 a part of the 29th Army again. When the 205th Separate Motor Rifle Brigade of the North Caucasus Military District was formed, one of its battalions was formed on the basis of the 245th MRD, having absorbed personnel from all over the Transbaikal Military District. On 1 September 1997, as part of the bilateral agreement between Russia and China on reductions of armaments covering the area up to 200 km from their mutual border, the 245th MRD was reduced to the 6803rd Weapons and Equipment Storage Base (BKhVT), codenamed army unit . The 245th MRD was reformed from 6803rd VKhVT in 2001, and given the 'Combat Banner' of the disbanded 2nd Guards Tank Division. The reformed division included the 39th and 376th Motor Rifle Regiments and the 507th Tank Regiment. The 363rd Motor Rifle Regiment joined the 122nd Guards Motor Rifle Division in the city of Aleysk, and the 376th Guards Motor Rifle Yassy-Mukden Order of the Red Banner Order of Kutuzov Regiment joined the division from the 122nd Guards MRD. In 2004 160th Guards Tank Regiment joined the division from the 5th Guards Tank Division, and the 507th Tank Regiment joined the 5th Guards Tank Division in its place. By 1 February 2006 245th Guards Motor Rifle Division was reorganised as 6th Guards Tatsinskaya (–¢–∞—Ü–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∞—è) Order of the Red Banner Order of Suvorov Base for Storage of Weapons and Equipment (Motor-Rifle forces).

Biography A possible member of the artisan guild,Roemer, p. 28 Haidar QassƒÅb served in the government of Khwaja Shams al-Din 'Ali as a collector of urban craft and trade taxes. When the accounts for the revenues generated by these taxes fell into arrears, Haidar was harshly punished by Shams al-Din 'Ali. In retaliation, Haidar had him assassinated in 1351 or 1352. Yahya Karawi, an aristocrat who had been informed by Haidar of the assassination plot, succeeded Shams al-Din 'Ali as head of state. Under him Haidar served in a military post and commanded the army forces in Astarabad after it was conquered in 1353/54. When Yahya was murdered in 1355 or 1356, several members of the party of Wajih ad-Din Mas'ud attempted to install Mas'ud's son Lutf Allah as ruler. Haidar QassƒÅb prevented this by marching from Astarabad to Sabzewar and forcing the conspirators to flee the city. When they sought refuge in a castle, he had it razed to the ground. After this he installed Yahya's nephew Zahir al-Din Karawi as head of state. Zahir al-Din quickly proved to be an unsatisfactory ruler for Haidar Qassib. Some of Mas'ud's followers had escaped Haidar's purge, and Luft Allah's atabeg Nasr Allah rebelled in Esfarayen. Ignoring Haidar's advice, Zahir al-Din refused to move against the rebels. Haidar then deposed him and took formal control of the government himself. His position was very weak, however; both the partisans of Mas'ud (who disliked him for his original affiliation with Shams al-Din 'Ali and his crackdown on Lutf Allah's supporters) and the dervishes (who hated him due to his murder of Shams al-Din 'Ali) were opposed to him.Roemer, p. 30 Before he and his army could reach Esfarayen to subdue the rebels, he was stabbed to death by the Turkish slave of Hasan Damghani in 1356. Hasan Damghani then installed Lutf Allah as head of the Sarbadars. Notes References *Roemer, H.

He resigned from his position in November 2017. Having been a member of the International Olympic Committee since 1988 (and thus representing the IOC in Taiwan, participating as Chinese Taipei), he was elected to its executive board in 2012. After serious allegations of financial mismanagement and accounting irregularities were made against Wu, a motion was passed against him by AIBA's Executive Committee at a meeting in Moscow in July 2017. Members of AIBA's governing body called for an Extraordinary Congress within 3 months to table a no-confidence motion against the AIBA president. It set up an Interim Management Committee to prevent Wu from having any further financial control over AIBA. Wu claimed that this was \\"political maneuvering\\" and refused to step down. However, with the boxing world in uproar over the financial mismanagement under Wu's watch, he had no option but to resign in November 2017. Career Wu Ching-kuo was a basketball player in his youth and later worked as an architect. Wu became Chinese Taipei's representative on the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1988. He served as a member of the evaluation commission for the 2016 Summer Olympics. =International Boxing Association= In November 2006 he won a vote 83 to 79 to replace 84-year-old Anwar Chowdhry of Pakistan to serve as AIBA's head for the next four years. When serving as an AIBA committee chairman, he proposed reforms such as increased marketing, new television contracts and the installation of scoreboards to allow fans to see how judges score fights in real time. After his election he let Price Waterhouse Coopers check the AIBA finances. Turkish General Secretary Caner Doganeli was soon suspended in February 2007 and the ethics commission headed by Fran√ßois Carrard discussed financial irregularities charges against Doganeli. =2013 Candidacy for IOC President= On May 23, 2013, Wu Ching-kuo confirmed that he would run for President of the IOC. He has served as an IOC member since 1988. At the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires he lost the election to Thomas Bach. As the president of AIBA, Wu believes Cuba‚Äôs historic first professional boxing bout in more than 50 years proves yet again to IOC members that he can deliver. He was proud to have been the facilitator of engineering the Cuban return to the professional boxing circuit. During Wu Ching-kuo's seventh trip to Africa in less than 10 years that he has established a relationship with his African colleagues since he became an IOC member 25 years ago, the longest tenure of any of the six hopefuls, he said ‚ÄúThe Olympic Games have taken place on all five continents but Africa, and therefore I will do my utmost to help bring about an African Games.‚Äù =Response to Olympic Controversy= There were two highly controversial decisions in the 2016 Summer Olympics where the widely regarded winners of the matches were judged to have actually lost the match. One of them responded by showing the judges his middle finger. Instead of promising to look into the issue concerning the judges and making public statements about cleaning up his organization Wu Ching-kuo responded with the following to AP journalist Greg Beacham: \\"He immediately showed his finger to the referee-judges. The IOC says this is totally unacceptable. You cannot humiliate people. They are officials. He put himself in a difficult position, I can tell you. A lot of disciplinary action will follow. You should show proper behaviour. If you are not happy about the result, you cannot humiliate in public our referee-judges. So that has already drawn a lot of people's attention who want to punish him. So we are going to have a disciplinary commission for the case.\\" A senior boxing official was quoted as saying that there is deep-rooted corruption in Olympic boxing, which led to controversial decisions. ‚ÄúAs predicted, corruption is alive and well and the decisions speak for themselves. It is clear that the AIBA will not do anything about this. It is time now for the IOC to step in,‚Äù the senior official told the Guardian, adding that amateur boxing is so rotten that only the removal of Wu, his administration and all of the officials at the Olympics could cut it out. ‚ÄúPresident Wu needs to resign, as well as the executive director and the senior staff. Every RJ [referee and judge] and ITO [international technical official] needs to be suspended. That‚Äôs the only way it‚Äôs going to change,‚Äù the official said. US head coach Billy Walsh was quoted by the Guardian as saying that he believed the decisions made at these Olympics are the worst since Roy Jones Jr infamously lost a light-middleweight contest in 1988 that became a byword for scandal. =Financial Allegations against Wu= Under Wu, AIBA faces the risk of bankruptcy after investors demanded it immediately pays back millions of pounds in loans and investments it does not have. Azerbaijani company Benkons has sent a letter, demanding AIBA immediately repay a $10 million loan from 2011. That is over $2 million more than AIBA has in its accounts. Benkons insists any claims by AIBA that a repayment schedule has been agreed are ‚Äúfalse‚Äù ‚Äì and they rejected such a proposal earlier in 2017. Hong Kong investor FCIT has also sent a legal notice to AIBA, demanding its CHF 19 million loan back. Under Wu, AIBA has also received large investments from Chinese companies AliSports and FCIT, with the money largely going towards meeting operational and legal expenses. International auditor KPMG refused to certify the accounts for two years 2015-2016, but finally signed these in April 2017 only after AIBA claimed its revenues would improve and promised a $10m loan repayment plan had been agreed with Benkons. This claim has now turned out to be untrue, creating the risk that KPMG will not certify the next accounts.

Twenty years later she returns to France from Buenos Aires believing that her son Raymond has died. Laroque (Ainsworth), a crook who aids her in her return to France, learns that she is the wife of a man of wealth and tries, with the help of his two associates M. Robert Parissard (Belmore) and M. Merival (Louis), to get possession of a fortune that rightfully belonged to Jacqueline. To protect her husband from violence, Jacqueline kills Laroque and, accused of murder, is brought to trial. Refusing to confer with her counsel and preferring death to freedom, during the course of the trial she receives the shocking revelation that the defendant attorney is her son Raymond (Ferguson). The tragic story ends with the reunion of the two and the death of the miserable mother.

Applicable to both unsigned and digitally signed data, this newer standard has been used by financial institutions and regulatory bodies to create trustworthy timestamps that cannot be altered without detection and to sustain an evidentiary trail of authenticity. Timestamps based on the X9.95 standard can be used to provide: * authenticity: trusted, non-refutable time when data was digitally signed * integrity: protection of the timestamp from tampering without detection * timeliness: proof that the time of the digital signature was in fact the actual time * an evidentiary trail of authenticity for legal sufficiency A superset of the IETF's RFC 3161 protocol, the X9.95 standard includes definitions for specific data objects, message protocols, and trusted timestamp methods, such as digital signature, MAC, linked token, linked-and- signature and transient-key methods. X9.95 compliance can be achieved via several technological approaches, such as transient-key cryptography. Several vendors market X9.95-compliant systems. Definitions From a timestamp authority, a requestor acquires a trusted timestamp, which is passed to a verifier. In an X9.95 trusted timestamp scheme, there are five entities: the time source entity, the Time Stamp Authority, the requestor, the verifier, and a relying party. * Time source entity - Most countries have an official source of time and this has been codified over the last hundred years through any number of Mutual Recognition Agreement's and Legal Metrological Agreements (see http://www.oiml.org for more information on Legal Metrology). Why this is important is now that the Internet has made it possible to reach directly into the laboratory that operates the official source of time for that jurisdiction, the many layers of \\"middlemen‚Äù who stood between the end-user and the source of time are now gone. As such, time that can be shown as traceable to the specific national measurement institute or master clock of that jurisdiction is the only source that provides the approved \\"Time Calibration Source\\" for X9.95. Examples include NIST in the US and Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM). Other regulatory frameworks also require that time that is moved through the Network Time Protocol ntp is properly certified and authenticated meaning unauthenticated use of time from any provider will fail X9.95 requirements for obtaining time in a provable manner. * Time Stamp Authority (TSA) - The issuer of timestamps, which can be internal to an organization or a third party or external (as in an Internet- based service). The TSA receives its provable \\"trusted time\\" from one or more reliable time sources and generates the timestamps requested from it according to the X9.95 scheme. * requestor - The entity requesting a timestamp. * verifier - The entity that verifies a timestamp. A verifier can be a relying party, regulatory body, or entity that employs a third-party verification service. * relying party - The entity receiving the timestamp. The relying party uses the time stamp token in operations. Creating a timestamp Generating a timestamp for unsigned data. Before a timestamp-service commences operations, the Time Stamp Authority calibrates its clock(s) with an upstream time source entity, such as a legally defined master clock for the jurisdiction the TSA is time-stamping evidence for. When trusted time has been acquired, the TSA can issue timestamps for unsigned and digitally signed data based on all of the jurisdictions it maintains timing solutions for. Applications using timestamps on unsigned data can provide evidence to a verifier that the underlying digital data has existed since the timestamp was generated. When a requestor requires a trusted timestamp for a piece of data, it creates a hash of the data using a cryptographic hash function and sends it to the TSA (through a network connection). The TSA then signs the hash and the time of signature to create a trusted timestamp. This trusted timestamp is finally returned to the requestor, who can store it along with the data. For applications using digitally signed data, the requestor signs the digital hash with its private key and submits the digital signature to the TSA, which performs the same operations as in the previous example: bind the submitted data with a timestamp using its cryptographic binding and return the results to the requestor. When the requestor receives the timestamp token from the TSA, it also optionally signs the token with its private key. The requestor now has evidence that the data existed at the time issued by the TSA. When verified by a verifier or relying party, the timestamp token also provides evidence that digital signature has existed since the timestamp was issued, provided that no challenges to the digital signature's authenticity repudiate that claim. Generating a timestamp for signed data. Timestamp tokens in open timestamping models can be obtained from different TSAs on the same data and can be verified at any time by a third party. Verifying a timestamp When verification is needed, the verifier uses the RSA public key for the purported interval to decrypt the timestamp token. If the original digital hash inside the token matches a hash generated on the spot, then the verifier has verified: # The hash in the time stamp token matches the data # The TSAs cryptographic binding # The requestor's digital signature These three verifications provide non-repudiable evidence of who signed the data (authentication), when it was signed (timeliness) and what data was signed (integrity). Since public keys are used to decrypt the tokens, this evidence can be provided to any third party. The American National Standard X9.95-2005 Trusted Time Stamps was developed based on RFC 3161 protocol [TSP] and the ISO/IEC 18014 standards [ISO] yet extends its analysis and offerings. The X9.95 standard can be applied to authenticating digitally signed data for financial transactions, regulatory compliance, and legal evidence.

For example, an octopus may emit a puff of atrament (see cephalopod ink). In ancient Rome, the term atramentum signified any black colouring substance used for any purpose. The Romans distinguished three principal kinds of atramentum, one called librarium (or scriptorium), another called sutorium, the third tectorium. Atramentum librarium was the writing ink of Roman times, atramentum sutorium was used by shoemakers for dyeing leather, atramentum tectorium (or pidorium) was used by painters for some purposes, apparently as a sort of varnish.William Smith (editor) Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, 1870 (text) Atramentous is a related adjective which means \\"black as ink\\". Historically, to atrament something would mean to write something down with ink. The word atrament is related to modern English atrocious: both originate from Latin atrare, which presumably meant to make something black. According to the pigment handbook,Nicholas Eastaugh, Valentine Walsh, Tracey Chaplin, Ruth Siddall, \\"Pigment Compendium: A Dictionary of Historical Pigments\\", Butterworth- Heinemann, 2004. atramentum is a historical pigment or ink based on carbon black. Apelles is credited of manufacturing method for atramentum elephantinum from burning ivory. In one modern commercial usage of the word, atramentum is deep black coloring substance manufactured by a reaction of an iron salt with tannic acid (the tannic acid for this purpose is often extracted from oak bark). It is a historically important black dye or pigment fundamentally different from carbon black or black iron oxide pigments. It was also sometimes called \\"ink stone\\". It appears greyish-black in water but the colour becomes very deep and lustrous in linseed oil. The iron-based atramentum called iron gall ink was in popular use from about the 12th to 19th century. It is currently a subject of conservation effort since many valuable collections are written using it but it causes ink corrosion.the ink corrosion website .Conservation Lab at the Maryland State Archives - Iron Gall Ink In Jewish tradition, scribes made use of copper sulphate crystals (copper vitriol) in writing holy writ, which did not cause the corrosion of the ink.Shulhan Arukh, Yoreh De'ah (Hil.

She served for a time as army transport USAT General Harry Taylor, and was reacquired by the navy in 1950 as USNS General Harry Taylor (T-AP-145). Placed in reserve in 1958, she was transferred to the U.S. Air Force in 1961 and renamed USAFS General Hoyt S. Vandenberg in 1963 in honor of the former Air Force Chief of Staff. She was reacquired by the U.S. Navy in 1964 as USNS General Hoyt S. Vandenberg (T-AGM-10). Retired in 1983, and struck from the Naval Vessel Register in 1993, she was to be sunk as an artificial reef originally intended for the spring of 2008, but instead was placed under Federal Lien to be auctioned off for payment recovery in December 2008 at Norfolk Federal Court. A group of banks and financiers from Key West bought the vessel off the auction block and it was docked at the East Quay Pier of Key West Harbor. The ship was sunk 27 May 2009 and is the second-largest artificial reef in the world, after the aircraft carrier . Operational history =Transport ship= The unnamed C4-S-A1-design transport was laid down under a Maritime Commission contract (MC Hull No. 702) on 22 February 1943 at Richmond, California, by Kaiser Co., Inc., Yard 3; named General Harry Taylor (AP-145) on 2 October 1943; launched on 10 October 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Mamie M. McHugh; acquired by the Navy on 29 March 1944; placed in ferry commission on 1 April 1944 for transfer to Portland, Oregon, for conversion to a transport by Kaiser Co., Inc., Vancouver, Washington; decommissioned on 10 April 1944; and commissioned on 8 May 1944 at Portland, Captain James L. Wyatt in command. Following shakedown off San Diego, General Harry Taylor sailed from San Francisco on 23 June 1944 with troop reinforcements for Milne Bay, New Guinea. After returning to San Francisco on 3 August with veterans of the Guadalcanal campaign embarked, she continued transport voyages between San Francisco and island bases in the western Pacific. During the next 10 months, she steamed to New Guinea, the Solomons, New Caledonia, the Marianas, the New Hebrides, the Palaus, and the Philippines, carrying troops and supplies, until 29 June 1945 when she departed San Francisco for duty in the Atlantic. With the European war over, General Harry Taylor made two \\"Magic Carpet\\" voyages to Marseilles and back, carrying returning veterans of the fighting in that theater. Next she sailed twice to Karachi, India, via the Suez Canal. Returning to New York on 3 January 1946, the transport then began the first of four voyages to Bremerhaven, Germany, and Le Havre, France. She reached New York again on 21 May 1946 and decommissioned on 13 June at Baltimore. She was stricken from the Navy Register on 3 July 1946. General Harry Taylor served for a time with the U.S. Army Transport Service, but was reacquired by the Navy on 1 March 1950 for use by the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS). She was reinstated on the Navy List on 28 April 1950. Her early duties consisted mainly of carrying troops, dependents, and large numbers of European refugees. USNS General Harry Taylor (T-AP-145) operated in a typical year to the Caribbean, Mediterranean, and in northern European waters. In 1957, she took part in the Hungarian Relief program, transporting several thousand refugees of the short- lived Hungarian Revolution to Australia. She was placed in ready reserve on 19 September 1957; stricken from the Naval Register on 10 July 1958 and transferred back to the Maritime Administration the same day. She was placed in the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Beaumont, Texas. =Missile range instrumentation ship= General Harry Taylor was then transferred to the U.S. Air Force on 15 July 1961 and was renamed USAFS General Hoyt S. Vandenberg on 11 June 1963. On 1 July 1964, General Hoyt S. Vandenberg was acquired by the Navy and designated T-AGM-10, as a missile range instrumentation ship, one of ten such ships transferred from the Commander, Air Force Eastern Test Range, to MSTS. in 1974 the ship commanded by Captain Anderson deployed to Dakar, Senegal, to participate in the Global Atmospheric Research Experiment. \\"Equipped with extremely accurate and discriminating radar and telemetry equipment,\\" she tracked and analyzed \\"re-entry bodies in the terminal phase of ballistic missile test flights,\\" carrying out those missile and spacecraft tracking duties in both Atlantic and Pacific waters until her retirement in 1983. She was ultimately stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 29 April 1993. General Hoyt S. Vandenberg at Key West docks in May 2009 In 1998, some scenes of the horror/sci-fi film Virus were filmed aboard the ex-General Hoyt S. Vandenberg. The ship substituted for a fictional Russian vessel called the Akademik Vladislav Volkov, and some of the Cyrillic lettering applied for the film is still visible on the hull today. The ship was transferred to the Maritime Administration on 1 May 1999. Her projected transfer to the state of Florida, for use as an artificial reef, received approval on 13 February 2007. The ship was sunk 6 miles (10 km) off the Florida Keys in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. The sinking was originally set to take place on 15 May 2008 but was postponed because the ship was placed under \\"Federal Arrest\\" by a US Federal Court for failure to pay shipyard fees related to the clean-up and preparation for the sinking. She was later ordered to be sold at auction to pay the shipyard fees. A group of banks and financiers from Key West was able to arrange to pay the fees and title of the ship was transferred to the city of Key West. On 12 April 2009, the Vandenberg left the shipyard and began the long tow to Key West. On 22 April 2009 she arrived in the Key West Harbor where she was moored at the East Quay Pier. The sinking took place on Wednesday, 27 May 2009. =Artificial Reef= USNS Vandenberg in 2015. The Vandenberg was deployed by Key West-based economic development company Reefmakers. Beginning in 1996, Reefmakers set out to create an artificial reef that benefited the local economy and ecosystem of whichever city it was set to be deployed in.http://www.reefmakers.com/projects.html From the pre- to post- USNS Vandenberg deployment period, there was a 40.1% increase in the total number of users (scuba divers, snorkelers, and others) on the surrounding natural reefs. A 23.5% increase in recreational scuba diving use occurred on the natural reefs representing 5,214 dives, which is in contrast to a 442% increase (34,394 dives) in the share of recreational scuba diving that occurred on artificial reefs. However, the share of total use on natural reefs did decline from 67% in the pre-deployment period to 46.5% in the post- deployment period. However, the increase in total demand effect dominated the substitution effect of switching from natural to artificial reefs resulting in an increase in total use on the surrounding natural reefs. Thus, the hypothesis that introduction of the USNS Vandenberg as an artificial reef would reduce use (pressure) on the surrounding natural reefs is not supported in a study made by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: The Economic Impact of the USS Vandenberg on the Monroe County Economy, July 2011. /, and University of Florida: The Economic Benefits Associated with Florida's Artificial Reefs Awards *Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal *European-African- Middle Eastern Campaign Medal *World War II Victory Medal *Navy Occupation Medal *National Defense Service Medal with star See also * Notes References * A second entry can be found here.

History of art in Cesar Department The first expressions of art in the Cesar Department were developed by the indigenous people's traditions, present since their arrival from Mesoamerica and the Caribbean. Then there are different cultural expressions from the extinct Taironas, the Arhuacos, Kankuamos mostly present in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountain range. The culture of the Arhuacos is specially rich in sawing wool and fique, drawings on stones, pottery, work on wood, and other handicrafts. With the arrival of the Spanish the European art expressions were also introduced, and the Spanish also introduced the African slaves who developed their own artistic expressions in the Cesar Department based on their African heritage. Due to the process of independence from Spain and the political struggle that followed, art expressions in Cesar Department decreased, only maintaining some of the indigenous traditional art, poetry, musical expressions that developed like cumbia and vallenato. The musical expression was born from the strong storytelling tradition, inherited from the three cultural expressions of local indigenous peoples, Europeans and African descendants. During the second half of the 20th Century and with the creation of Cesar Department the creation of local government secretaries intended to support and develop artistic expressions were created. in the Cesar Department the governor created the Education, Culture and Sports. Each municipal administration depending on its budget created a secretary of culture or through an associated institution such as the Casa de la Cultura (Cultural house) or the Escuela de Bellas Artes Fine Arts School in Valledupar.

Benzi championed the rights of the individual and founded his association to aid teenagers in their lives and their path to Jesus Christ while also striving to evangelize to those including the destitute. The cause for sainthood commenced in 2014 under Pope Francis and he is titled as a Servant of God. Life Oreste Benzi was born in San Clemente on 7 September 1925 as the seventh of nine children to the poor Achille Benzi and Rosa Silvagni - it was she who instilled a sense of great piousness in her children. Benzi had to repeat his first grade at school due to contracting the measles and being ill all winter which prevented him from attending school. His second grade teacher Olga Baldani spoke of a priest and of a scientist and explorer in a tale meant to challenge the students as to what would seem the better profession. This had a profound impact on Benzi who returned home and told his mother that he wanted to become a priest. He commenced his studies for the priesthood in 1937 first at Urbino for a brief period of time and then at Rimini. He transferred his studies to Bologna due to Allied bombings during World War II around Rimini. Benzi received his ordination to the priesthood on 29 June 1949 from the Bishop of Rimini Luigi Santa. He was appointed as the chaplain for the parish of San Nicol√≤ in Rimini on 5 July 1949 and in October 1950 was made a teacher of seminarians and later the vice-assistant for Catholic Youth; he became the assistant in 1952. Benzi was later made - in 1953 - the spiritual director of students in Rimini and he later oversaw the establishment of an Alpine vacation home for teenagers in Alba di Canazei (built between 1958 and 1961) that saw him make several visits to the United States of America in order to raise funds. In 1968 he founded the Associazione Comunit√† Papa Giovanni XXIII - in honor of Pope John XXIII - though formal establishment as an \\"association\\" was not until 1971. The priest opened the first home for families at Coriano on 3 July 1973 and he officiated at its official opening. The Italian government recognized the movement - for legal reasons - on 5 July 1972 while it received diocesan recognition on 25 May 1983 as an \\"ecclesial gathering\\". The Pontifical Council for the Laity recognized Benzi's movement as an \\"association of the faithful\\" on 7 October 1998. Benzi was known for his action in defense of those who were marginalised and his battle against prostitution and homosexual unions. His work bought him into contact several times with Pope John Paul II. From 1969 until 2000 he served as a parish priest at the Resurrection parish in the Grotta Rossa neighbourhood of Rimini. The likes of Saint Teresa of Calcutta and Saint Maximilian Kolbe inspired him and spiritual writers such as Cardinal Henri de Lubac and Blessed Antoine Chevrier also inspired him. Benzi died in the first hours of the morning on 2 November 2007 at 2:22 a.m. after suffering a heart attack. More than 10 000 mourners attended his funeral and it included several of the prostitutes that he had rescued; the Bishop of Rimini Francesco Lambiasi officiated the funeral. His movement is now present in a total of 27 European countries as well as being present in Asia and Africa as well as Latin America; amongst the nations it operates in are the United Kingdom and Australia. Beatification process The beatification process commenced under Pope Francis on 3 January 2014 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" and named him as a Servant of God; the Bishop of Rimini Francesco Lambiasi inaugurated the diocesan process on 27 September 2014 and it is still ongoing. The postulator for this cause - since its beginning - is Dr. Elisabetta Casadei.  Selected writings  Benzi wrote more than sixty books during his life, many of which are untranslated into English at 2019. Along with his activity of missionary and educator among the young children, he was devoted to the prayer in honour of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the Saints. He is the author of some unusual spiritual writings on the Real Presence the Triune of God into the human heart, ls called as Mistical Union of Christ. In such a way, he shared a spiritual life like the one testified by Itala Mela and Chiara Lubich.

Career Boyd came to Florida in 1939. He served in the United States Marine Corps during World War II and later graduated from the University of Miami School of Law in 1948. He then became the City Attorney for the city of Hialeah. He was elected to the Dade County Commission in 1958 and was re-elected in 1962 and 1965. He served as chairman of the commission and vice mayor of Dade County. Justice Boyd served 18 years on the Florida Supreme Court through 1987. He was chief justice from mid-1984 through mid-1986. Reprimand Boyd was reprimanded by his fellow justices in the mid-1970s for accepting a secret draft opinion from utility company lawyers. The Florida House of Representatives also investigated but declined to impeach him in 1975, after he agreed to take a psychiatric exam. He is famous for later boasting that he was the only officeholder in Tallahassee to be certified sane. Legacy When he retired, Boyd said he would like most to be remembered for his dissents to opinions that later were overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court. One of those cases was when he disagreed with the majority of the justices who had ordered The Miami Herald to give equal access on its editorial pages to a political candidate. The federal justices, though, agreed with Boyd and ruled that would violate the First Amendment's freedom of the press protections. He also once used Biblical logic in dissenting from a ruling that upheld Florida's vagrancy law. Boyd later said he believed that if Jerusalem had such a law, all the prophets, Old and New Testament, would have been jailed. The U.S. Supreme Court again agreed with him and struck down the vagrancy law.

The movie starred Peter Wechsberg, who also serves as director and writer, under the pseudonym Peter Wolf. It was the first American Sign Language feature film ever made. The film tells the story of a young man who cannot control his urge to kill people for their blood, and the police investigation searching for the murderer. Plot Steve Adams, a theology student, begins to suspect he may be a vampire after a series of blood- draining murders in his town. A detective in the small town has hired Inspector Butterfield, a bumbling expert from England, to be his assistant in the investigation of the 27 murders. While walking down the sidewalk, Steve is approached by a couple on a motorcycle and asks them to come to church with him. They laugh and try to rob him at knife point, but he suddenly transforms into a vampire, and hypnotizes them to drive off a cliff. At the police station, Butterfield explains how he had tracked down and defeated Dracula with a wooden stake and that these murders fit the same profile, but the detective tells him to stop talking and get to work. The two meet for a drink with Steve, who turns out to be the detective's best friend and has always loved eating peanuts without shelling them. Steve finds out that his father, the preacher, has a worsening heart condition and can no longer give Steve the monthly blood transfusions he needs to survive. There is a flashback showing that Steve's mother died giving birth, a doctor diagnosed the baby with a blood disease, and the mother's best friend Amy mysteriously disappeared. As Steve and his father are driving, Steve starts acting strange and the preacher asks if he's feeling okay. Steve pulls over and runs away to puke. The preacher tries to run after him, but has a heart attack and falls to the ground. Deeper in the woods, Steve sees a young couple kissing, and murders them both. Steve finds his father lying on the ground, and the preacher manages to give him a letter from Amy before passing away. When the detectives show up, Butterfield finds the other two bodies in the woods and tries to question Steve, but the detective won't allow him to interrogate his best friend. Before leaving the crime scene, Butterfield looks closely for evidence. Steve follows the letter's instructions to Amy's house, where he's greeted by her servant Zork who has no hands. She explains to Steve that she was there at his birth, and knows that his mother had been bitten by Dracula while she was pregnant. She has a magical ring which disappears each time Steve transforms into a vampire and reappears when he returns to normal. Zork hypnotizes Steve, and Amy tells him that he must go to the museum where Dracula is buried. In a deep cavern below the museum, he finds Dracula inside a coffin, with a stake in his heart. He removes the stake, and Dracula comes back to life, as well as Steve's mother. Dracula tries to hypnotize Steve, but he manages to kill Dracula. At that instant, Dracula and the mother vanish into smoke. Steve gives a sermon for his father, but cringes when he sees a girl accidentally prick her finger in one of the pews. After the funeral, Butterfield arrests Steve, explaining that he found peanut shells in the vomit near the most recent crime scene, and citing the fact that Steve cringed in response to the finger pricking. Steve asks for a few minutes to pray before going to jail, and he gives a rousing prayer to God asking for forgiveness. He touches the magic ring to a crucifix, which kills Amy and replaces Zork's hands. Steve dies on the floor of the church.

The film was an independent film created by the Deaf community for the Deaf community, and its original release was silent. Deafula was shot in Portland, Oregon in black and white. The world of the film is an imaginary one where no hearing people exist: all the characters communicate in ASL, make calls with a teletypewriter, and use visual doorbells. Some parts of the film's visual style are expressionistic. The film's end credits indicate which actors were Deaf and which were hearing. Release Deafula had its world premiere in Portland, Oregon in January 1975, and then premiered in Los Angeles on July 25th, 1975. Its East Coast premiere was screened as a part of the 1975 World Games for the Deaf on February 6 in Lake Placid, New York, and was so popular that a second screening was added later in the evening. This was the first film released by Signscope, which was a company started by Wechsberg and producer Gary Holstrom to create and distribute Deaf films. When the film was released on VHS, music and dubbed voices were added for English hearing audiences to understand the movie, including a dubbed voice for Dracula with a bad imitation of Bela Lugosi. The film also screened at the MoMA in 1997 as part of a retrospective on vampire films. In 1977, Wechsberg signed an agreement with the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to distribute twelve 16 mm prints of the film. The department then made additional VHS copies of the film in 1995, without the legal authority to do so. Wechsberg discovered this in 1998, immediately filed a copyright claim on the film, and filed a suit against the department. The suit made it to the United States Court of Federal Claims in 2002, Wechsberg v. United States, which ultimately said that while the Federal Government was wrong to have made the VHS copies, Wechsberg was not entitled to receive compensation because the film had not yet been registered at the copyright office at the time the VHS copies were made. Over the years it has developed a following as a cult film due to the use of sign language and no spoken dialogue. Reception Travis Sutton, in an essay about the portrayal of disability in horror films, compares Deafula to the 1972 blaxploitation film Blacula, as both are retellings of the classic vampire story through the lens of their filmmakers' own experiences. However, he wrote that the film's ideas of associating disability with the Devil are \\"a surprising theme in a film prepared by and distributed within a disabled community,\\" and adds that \\"although Deafula dramatizes an entirely non-normative world (absent hearing/able-bodied characters), it succeeds not only in demonizing queerness but also disability itself.\\" Kim Newman wrote in 2018 that the film is \\"sincere in its commitment to the Deaf community,\\" however \\"Wolf stretches thin resources and tries for expressionist effects, but that papier-m√¢ch√© nose and evil beard keep dragging the film to the level of Dracula, the Dirty Old Man.\\" Psychotronic Video magazine reviewed the film in 1999, lauding the cinematography as \\"actually pretty good\\" and describing the ending as \\"very Christian\\".

The Classic is one of the most highly acclaimed and attended high-school football games west of the Mississippi River and has taken place since 1925, the year of Garfield's establishment (with the exception of a span from 1939 to 1948 due to the Great Depression and World War II). The Classic brings out alumni from all parts of the world, usually fielding crowds in excess of 25,000 per gamehttp://www.lasports.org/lafacilities/display.php?s=Stadium&id;=17 and has been held at Weingart Stadium on the campus of East Los Angeles College, in Monterey Park, California, for much of its existence. The event was held at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum for a few years before returning to its original location at Weingart Stadium. On Feb. 12, 2011, the rivalry held its first alumni game with Garfield defeating Roosevelt, 19-12. In 2016 even U.S. Senate candidate Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez was in attendance.

North Cat Cay is a privately owned island and is run as a private members club by the Cat Cay Yacht Club. South Cat Cay is currently under development.  History  North Cat Cay is a small private island in the Bimini chain of The Bahamas. It is named after the \\"cat line\\" of a sailing vessel which it resembles, and was once used by pirates Edward Teach, also known as Blackbeard, and Charles Vane. Queen Victoria granted the original deed for Cat Cay to Captain William Henry Stuart in 1873, as a reward for his services as keeper of the Lighthouse on neighboring Gun Cay. Later, Captain Arthur Samuel Haigh, an Englishman, became the owner of Cat Cay. Captain Haigh established the island custom of dressing formally for dinner. While his original home burned, the cookhouse remained intact and its huge oven fireplace is part of the rebuilt cottage named Haigh House in his honor. Haigh is buried in the historic Anglican graveyard on North Bimini. Milo Strong and his wife bought the island in 1915 and they built and lived in the Manor House, extant today. They spent nine months out of the year on Cat Cay. The 1929 hurricane blew the roof off of their home and this was repaired but Strong died two years later and another storm damaged the Manor House, after which Mrs. Strong decided to sell. Friends of the Strongs, Louis and Rae Wasey purchased the island for $400,000 in 1931. Wasey, an advertising executive from New York City, intended the island to be a winter home for himself and his wife and as a place to entertain clients and friends. He enlarged the Manor House and built a number of English style ‚Äúcottages‚Äù for his guests. During the Great Depression, Wasey turned the island development over to a friend and architect Mike Smith who loved the Bahamian and old English architecture and used both in making the island buildings. He employed Bahamians, sent a schooner to Cuba for handmade tiles from deserted churches and had men search the Florida swamps for angled pieces of wood needed for his Tudor-style buildings. In 1935, Wasey converted the island to a private club and sold building lots to his friends. He had about 200 members paying annual dues of $500.00. Mrs. Wasey, who loved antiques, built the Cat Cay English Shoppe, where the island boutique now stands. There were many fishing tournaments held in the 1930s, late 40s and throughout the 1950s and 60s as the waters around Cat Cay were well stocked with fish and the deep water fishing lay just a mile offshore. The structure known as the tuna tower on many fishing yachts was invented on Cat Cay and first used by a skipper in the 1952 Cat Cay Tuna Tournament. While the first tower was rudimentary at best, its usefulness was quickly noted. In World War II, Cat Cay was a paramilitary base for PT boats of the British and Allied Forces. US General Hap Arnold, in charge of the US Army Air Corps, spent several months recuperating from a heart attack at Lou Wasey's Cat Cay home. An Air Force officer stationed there, Monk Forster, fell in love with the island and returned after the war to manage the club and he acquired the home \\"High Tide\\", built by Wasey's partner O.B. Winters. Lou Wasey built a nine-hole golf course that the former British king Edward VIII, later Duke of Windsor, enjoyed playing while Governor of the Bahamas during World War II. The course was named Windsor Downs in his honor. During one of his visits the Duke mentioned that it might be fun to have a little casino on the island for guests, Wasey readily agreed and the Duke issued a license in Lou Wasey's name. The American DuPont family, including members of the Carpenter and Crowninshield families, owned and had use of the property on the island for many years. Upon Wasey's death in 1963, the island's casino license expired. Wasey willed the island to his daughter Jane, a New York sculptress, who returned for two years. In 1965 Hurricane Betsy did enormous damage and, the island was closed. A few years later, Al Rockwell, head of Rockwell International, put together a small group of investors and purchased the island. It became a private club owned by members. The island has hosted many prominent guests over its many years from screen stars to royalty and including former American President Richard Nixon who was the frequent guest of Bob Abplanalp, a homeowner and long-time friend of Nixon. Fishing in Cat Cay remains strong. Tuna are less common now, but mahi mahi, Blue and White Marlin, Wahoo, Snapper and Grouper are available. The island remains a private club, but for visiting yachts entering The Bahamas it is an official port of entry for The Bahamas and Bahamas Customs and the Royal Bahamas Police Force are present on the island.

A number of the buildings he designed are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. Early life and education Sundeleaf was born in Portland's Goose Hollow neighborhood in 1900, and moved at age 6 to a neighborhood just north of Sellwood that was then known as City View Park. (Clackamas County edition). After graduating from Washington High School in 1918 he attended the University of Oregon's School of Architecture, in Eugene, graduating in 1923. He trained in the Beaux Arts style of traditional design. Career After graduation, Sundeleaf returned to Portland. He began working for the firm of A. E. Doyle in 1923 and remained with Doyle for a year. He then worked for four years with the firm of Sutton and Whitney. After working for other architecture firms, he decided to open his own firm in 1928. During the Great Depression, he worked for the Historic American Buildings Survey. During this time he became known for his imaginative work in industrial architecture. He combined his decorative training with a rugged functionalism in a series of distinctive warehouses and offices. In the 1940s, his style changed somewhat when he became a proponent of the Streamline Moderne style, \\"in which the spirit of the machine age and the concepts of aerodynamics shaped the design of the building\\", The Oregonian wrote in its obituary of Sundeleaf. He designed numerous residential and public buildings around Portland. Sundeleaf carried out several projects for Portland-based Jantzen Knitting Mills, including design of a new headquarters building and factory building in Portland, as well as buildings in Australia and England. In 1935, Sundeleaf designed a Tudor-style English cottage for the University of Oregon chapter of Chi Psi in Eugene, Oregon. The Chi Psi Fraternity House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1993. Many of Sundeleaf's English cottages would be constructed in suburban Portland. Sundeleaf lived in Lake Oswego, Oregon, from 1940 until his death, and he designed many homes in that area. One of the latter, the Dr. Walter Black House, is listed on the NRHP. Around 1930, Jantzen Knitting Mills co-founder Carl Jantzen also commissioned Sundeleaf to design his home in Oswego (now Lake Oswego), and the now-NRHP-listed Carl C. Jantzen Estate used Sundeleaf's designs for its boathouse and bridge. Sundeleaf also designed the NRHP-listed 1934 Paul F. Murphy House, in Northwest Portland. Personal With his wife, Mildred, to whom he was married from 1925 until his death, Sundeleaf also owned a ranch in southwestern Montana, acquired in 1956. Sundeleaf died on March 8, 1987, at his home in Lake Oswego. His career included over 3000 projects.

He was Professor of Music at Trinity College, Dublin for 20 years, founder of the Dowland Consort, conductor of the Dublin Orchestral Players, and a prolific broadcaster and writer on musical matters. He was also a prolific musicologist specialising in 18th-century Irish musical history. Early years Brian Boydell was born in Howth, County Dublin, into a prosperous Anglo-Irish family. His father James ran the family maltings business while his mother, Eileen Collins, was one of the first women graduates of Trinity College.The Irish Times, \\"Brian's double forte\\", 6 November 1997. Following their son's birth, the Boydells moved from Howth and lived in a succession of rented houses before settling in Shankill, County Dublin. The young Boydell began his formal education at Monkstown Park in Dublin and was subsequently sent to the Dragon School at Oxford. From there he went to Rugby, where he came under the influence of Kenneth Stubbs, the music master. Although Boydell later spoke of his resentment at the anti-Irish attitude he experienced at Rugby, he appreciated the very good education in science and music he received there. Having completed his secondary education, Boydell spent the summer of 1935 developing his musical knowledge at Heidelberg, where he wrote his first songs and also studied organ. He won a choral scholarship to Clare College, Cambridge, where, perhaps through parental pressure, he studied natural science, graduating in 1938 with a first-class degree.The Irish Times, \\"Composer Brian Boydell dies in Dublin aged 83\\", 9 November 2000. However, his love of music led him next to the Royal College of Music where he studied composition under Patrick Hadley, Herbert Howells, and Vaughan Williams. Already a good pianist, Boydell also became a proficient oboe player during this time. Upon the outbreak of World War II, Boydell returned to Dublin and achieved further academic success in 1942 with a Bachelor of Music degree from Trinity College. He also took further lessons in composition from John F. Larchet. Life and career Boydell's busy working life combined teaching, performing and composing. Following a brief stint in his father's business, Boydell plunged himself into Dublin's classical musical scene. In 1943, he succeeded Havelock Nelson as conductor of the Dublin Orchestral Players, beginning an association with the amateur orchestra that would endure for a quarter of a century (until 1966). In 1944, he was appointed Professor of Singing at the Royal Irish Academy of Music, a position he held for eight years. Along with fellow composers Edgar M. Deale, Aloys Fleischmann, and Frederick May he founded the Music Association of Ireland in 1948 as a vehicle to promote classical music throughout the country.The Irish Times, \\"Irish composer and musicologist who transformed Trinity's music syllabus\\", 11 November 2000. Boydell's interest in Renaissance music, in particular the madrigal, led in 1959 to founding the Dowland Consort, a vocal ensemble with which he performed for many years and recorded an LP. In 1962, having obtained a Doctorate in Music, he was appointed Professor of Music at Trinity College and immediately revamped the course making it more relevant to the second half of the twentieth century. He also found time to sit on the Arts Council throughout the 1960s, 70s, and early 80s. Boydell's communication skills combined with his infectious enthusiasm made him a natural broadcaster. The appeal of his programmes on the history and performance of music, first on RT√â Radio and later on Telef√≠s √âireann, went beyond a specialist audience and were, for many people, their introduction to a new world of aural pleasure.Kehoe, 174 ‚Äì175. Boydell had many interests beyond music. As a surrealist painter in the 1940s (he took lessons from Mainie Jellett), he was a member of The White Stag group. He was also passionate about cars and photography. Final years Following retirement from Trinity as Fellow Emeritus. Boydell devoted himself to musical scholarship, writing two books on the music of 18th century Dublin. He also contributed to the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians. He was elected to Aosd√°na in 1984.The Irish Times, \\"Singing music's praise\\", 31 January 2002. Brian Boydell died at his home in Howth at the age of 83 in the company of his wife of 56 years, Mary (n√©e Jones) and their sons, Cormac and Barra. A third son, Marnac, predeceased him. Music As a young composer, Boydell was influenced by the music of Delius, Bart√≥k, and Sibelius. He wanted to write modern Irish music that followed the European tradition. However, he also tried to avoid the temptation to incorporate folk tunes into his work to give it a distinctive national identity. His first major success came in 1948 with In Memoriam Mahatma Gandhi, Op. 30, a 12-minute orchestral piece written in tribute to the recently assassinated Indian leader whom Boydell admired. The composer conducted the Radio √âireann Symphony Orchestra at its premiere in the Phoenix Hall, Dublin. His first String Quartet, Op. 31, composed in 1949, won the Radio √âireann Chamber Music Prize. Boydell arranged an orchestral version of Amhr√°n na bhFiann for RT√â for the launch of their television service in 1961, which was played daily at the end of broadcasting for many years. Over the course of the next five decades, Boydell produced a great variety of music, ranging from orchestral works such as his Violin Concerto, Op. 36 and Masai Mara, Op. 87 to more intimate compositions for voice or solo instruments. An example of the latter is his piece for harp A Pack of Fancies for a Travelling Harper, Op. 66, premiered at the Dublin Festival of Twentieth Century Music in 1971. His final work, a short composition for brass band entitled Viking Lip-Music, Op. 91, was given its premiere by the Royal Danish Brass Ensemble at the Drogheda Arts Centre in November 1996 with the composer in attendance.The Irish Times, \\"Royal Danish Brass Ensemble\\", 19 November 1996. In his latter years Boydell viewed his place in the greater world of late twentieth-century music with a certain wry detachment. > \\"I've now become something of an old fogey, but in the 1940s I was regarded > as the naughty boy of frightfully modern music.\\" Selected works Orchestral *Pregaria a la Verge del Remei, Op. 14 (1941; rev. 1945) for string orchestra *The Strings are False, Op. 16 (1942) *La√Øsh, Op. 17 (1942) *Symphony for Strings, Op. 26 (1945; rev. 1946) for string orchestra *Magh Sleacht, Op. 29 (1947) *In memoriam Mahatma Gandhi, Op. 30 (1948) *Ballet Suite: The Buried Moon, Op. 32a (1949) *Violin Concerto, Op. 36 (1953; rev. 1954) *The Wooing of Etain, Op. 37a and Op. 37b (two suites, based on the incidental music to the play by Padraic Fallon, 1954) *Megalithic Ritual Dances, Op. 39 (1956) *Meditation & Fugue, Op. 40 (1956; rev. 1957) *Elegy and Capriccio, Op. 42 (1956) for clarinet and string orchestra *Ceol cas corach, Op. 46 (1958) *Shielmartin Suite, Op. 47 (1959) *Richard's Riot, Op. 51 (1961) for percussion and orchestra *Symphonic Inscapes, Op. 64 (1968) *Jubilee Music, Op. 73 (1976) *Partita Concertante, Op. 75 (1978) *A Wild Dance for Ceol Chumann na n√ìg, Op. 78 (1982) *Masai Mara, Op. 87 (1988) Cantatas *Hearing of Harvests, Op. 13 (W.H.

The (Lo) Monge de Montaudon (meaning \\"monk of Montaudon\\") (fl. 1193-1210Gaunt and Kay, Appendix I, 287.), born P√®ire de Vic, was a nobleman, monk, and troubadour from the Auvergne, born at the castle of Vic-sur-C√®re near Aurillac, where he became a Benedictine monk around 1180.Aubrey, 17. According to his vida, he composed \\"couplets while he was in the monastery and sirventes on subjects that were popular in the region.\\"Egan, 70. Life The Monge requested and received the priory of Montaudon from the abbot of Aurillac. Montaudon may be identified with MontaubanEgan, 70 n1. or perhaps with a Mons Odonis southeast of Clermont. He became so popular with local nobility that he was taken from his monastery to serve them, receiving honours and gifts in return. In this way he greatly improved the state of his priorate and, upon his request, was released from his monastic vocation by his abbot to follow Alfonso II of Aragon, whose vassal the viscount of Carlat and lord of Vic was. This is the view of his vida; he may have simply abandoned holy orders. Internal evidence in his poems suggests wide wanderings, to P√©rigord, Languedoc, and Catalonia, and the patronage of Dalfi d'Alvernha and Maria de Ventadorn. At Alfonso's court, according to his vida, he ate meat, courted women, and composed songs and poems. In return he was appointed lord of the poetical society of Puy Sainta Maria (Puy-Sainte-Marie) at Le-Puy-en-Velay (Podium Aniciense) and received a sparrow hawk, the prize the society granted for superb poetry. According to his vida, he held the \\"suzerainty\\" of the \\"court of Puy\\" (cour du Puy) until it was dissolved. After this he went to Roussillon, where he became prior of the Benedictine priory of Saint-Pierre-de-Belloc, near Villafranca, though this establishment was not, contrary to his vida, a dependent of Aurillac.Egan, 71. He is said to have \\"enriched [the priory] and improved it\\" before \\"ending his days\\" there. The monk receiving a sparrow hawk as a prize for his poetry. The bird is white and perched on his arm. Songs The Monge's earliest song which can be reliably dated refers to the captivity of Richard I of England in Austria (1192-1194). Though seven of his cansos survive, he is most well known for the genres he probably invented: the enueg and plazer. He wrote four enuegz: Be m'enuejan, per saint Marsal and Be m'enueja, per saint Salvaire being two. His cansos are \\"rich in feudal metaphors\\". Among the Monge's other works, Mout me platz deportz e gaieza and Be m'enueia, s'o auzes dire have been translated into English as \\"What I Like\\" and \\"What I Don't Like\\" respectively. He wrote fictional tensos with God. Around 1192-4 he wrote Pos Peire d'Alvernh' a chantat, a famous parody of a satire of Peire d'Alvernha.Aubrey, 8. In it he insults his contemporaries, such as Arnaut Daniel, Arnaut de Maruelh, Folquet de Marselha, Gaucelm Faidit, Guilhem Ademar, Guillem de Saint Didier, Peire Vidal, Peirol, Raimon Jordan, and Raimon de Miraval. Two of his melodies survive. One of these, the music for the enueg Fort m'enoja, so auzes dire was borrowed from a sirventes, Rassa, tan creis e mont, of Bertran de Born: the only piece of Bertran's music to survive.Aubrey, 112. Only one melody by the Monge himself--for a canso entitled Ara pot ma dona saber--survives. Nonetheless, this lone piece of work is characterised by phrase variation and motivic transformation, with an unexpected ending.Aubrey, 231. The poem S'eu vos voill tan gen lauzar was appended to a set of four by the Monge in the 13th century, but it is probably a work of Jausbert de Puycibot.Chambers, 320-322. Sources *Aubrey, Elizabeth.

It historically formed the landscaped park of the Kelsey Manor Estate. The river Beck runs through it. History Kelsey Manor (demolished in 1921) The original mansion was built around 1408 for William Kelshulle and demolished around 1800. A second mansion was built for Richard Bennett around that time and then acquired by Peter Richard Hoare, the elder (a partner in the banking firm C. Hoare & Co) in 1835. Peter Richard Hoare, the elder converted the manor into a rambling Gothic Revival house. The house passed to Peter Richard Hoare, the younger in 1849: he added a chapel, designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott, in 1869. It then passed to Charles Arthur Richard Hoare in 1877. The land adjoining Wickham Road was sold in the 1890s and laid out with large Arts and Crafts movement houses designed by Francis Hooper.Nairn's London, Ian Nairn, 1965 The house became a convent for the All Saints Sisters of the Poor in 1895 and then became Kepplestone School for the Daughters of Gentlemen in 1901. Following the death of Charles Arthur Richard Hoare in 1908, Beckenham Urban District Council acquired the estate in 1911. The River Beck in Kelsey Park Kelsey Park was officially opened to the public by Right Honourable John Burns MP, President of the Local Government Board, on 31 May 1913. The house itself was used by the British Army during the First World War and was demolished in 1921. Kelsey Park Sports College which was opened in 1968 takes its name from the fact it was built on the historic Kelsey Park Estate; however following Academy conversion in September 2011 it was renamed to Harris Academy Beckenham.

The policy became a formal act in 1935, and its legislative sponsors were from the state of North Carolina. Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Act into law on August 24, 1935. The law was enforced by the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA) to protect about 30,000 farmers who made their main living growing potatoes, and who feared that the potato market would be invaded by other farmers whose land became idle by other AAA controls. Potatoes The law restricted the export of potatoes and mandated that they be used instead to provide direct relief to those in need. Because of the federal government's direct involvement in the economic affairs of American potato growers, this law was widely regarded as one of the most radical and controversial pieces of legislation enacted during the New Deal. The United States Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional in 1936. The Potato Control legislation prevented individuals and companies from buying or offering to buy potatoes which were not packed in closed containers approved by the Secretary of Agriculture and bearing official government stamps. Penalties included a $1,000 fine on the first offense, while for a second offense, violators faced a year in jail and an additional $1,000 fine. Farmers and brokers could not receive the necessary official stamps unless they paid a tax of $0.45 per bushel, or if they received tax-exemption stamps from the Secretary of Agriculture.

We shall produce on our own land such potatoes as we may > wish to produce and will dispose of them in such manner as we may deem > proper.

The ABPS is one of three organizations overseeing Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) and Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) certification in the United States. The ABPS assists its Member Boards in developing and implementing educational and professional standards to evaluate and certify physician specialists. It is recognized by the U.S. Department of Labor as well as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). History The American Association of Physician Specialists (AAPS) is the smallest of three multi-specialty physician/surgeon certifying entities in the United States, providing board certification to both M.D. and D.O. physicians. The AAPS has grouped its certification activities within a single subdivision called the American Board of Physician Specialties (ABPS). In August 2005, the ABPS name was registered to AAPS. The ABPS implements certification functions under the direction of AAPS. AAPS (originally known as the American Association of Osteopathic Physicians was founded in 1952 by Dr. E.O. Martin. Since 1984, AAPS has provided a headquarters for medical specialty boards of certification. Recognition by state medical boards Today in the U.S. and its territories, there are seventy (70) state medical boards‚Äîsome state medical boards are composed of an M.D. board and a D.O. board while others are combined as one, called a \\"composite board\\". Of the 70 state boards, the vast majority do not differentiate between any of the three nationally recognized multi-specialty boards of certification (ABMS, ABPS, AOABOS). In other words, the majority of the state medical boards are silent (or neutral) as to which board a given physician is certified by. The remaining boards, approximately twenty (20), have established specific rules for physician advertising by which boards have to petition and receive permission for physicians to be able to advertise themselves as \\"board certified\\". Those twenty (20) boards are: * Arizona Medical Board * Arizona Board of Osteopathic Examiners * Medical Board of California Osteopathic * Medical Board of California * Florida Board of Medicine (ABPS is Recognized) * Florida Board of Osteopathic Medicine (ABPS is Recognized) * Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners * Missouri State Board of Registration for the Healing Arts * New Jersey State Board of Medical Examiners * New York State Board for Medicine (ABPS not recognized as equal to AMBS certification) * North Carolina Medical Board * Oklahoma State Board of Medical Licensure and Supervision (ABPS is Recognized) * Oklahoma State Board of Osteopathic Examiners (ABPS is Recognized) * Oregon Medical Board * Pennsylvania State Board of Medicine * Pennsylvania State Board of Osteopathic Medicine (ABPS is Recognized) * South Carolina Board of Medical Examiners * Texas Medical Board (ABPS is Recognized) * Utah Department of Commerce (Physicians Licensing Board) * Utah Department of Commerce (Board of Osteopathic Medicine) (ABPS is Recognized) Physicians certified by ABPS and licensed by the Medical Board of California are prohibited from using the term \\"board certified\\" unless they are also certified by an American Board of Medical Specialties board. It also appears that certification by an ABPS member board is not sufficient to allow use of the term \\"board certified\\" by physicians licensed in the State of New York. However, interpreting the law in New York is more complex.

It was first televised December 19, 1968, on NBC, and was followed by a sequel in 1976. Plot In the special, the narrator (Greer Garson) tells the story of a young Jewish boy named Aaron, who is a misanthropic orphan who finds enjoyment only from playing his drum for his animal friends: Samson the donkey, Joshua the camel and Baba the lamb. At one time, Aaron was a happy child who lived with his parents who gave him a drum for his birthday. But one night, bandits of the desert stole all the livestock, killed Aaron's parents (before they can try to intervene), and burned their house down, causing him to hate all humanity. Because his drumming can make the three animals dance, Aaron is forced to join Ben Haramed's caravan with rather inept performers. When performing in Jerusalem, Aaron becomes infuriated by the townspeople's amusement and lashes out at them for being thieves and knaves. Some time later, the troupe comes upon the Magi's caravan who are following a bright star in the sky. Seizing his chance, Ben greedily attempts to perform for the Magi, but they are uninterested as they try to make haste to get to the star's destination. One of the caravan camels becomes too weak to continue traveling, so Ben bargains with them that they use Joshua in exchange for some of their gold. Later, Aaron and his remaining animal companions escape and join up with the Magi as they journey toward Bethlehem. There, upon recognizing Joshua and trying to reunite with him, Baba is hit by a Roman chariot and Aaron takes the dying lamb to the Magi to be healed. However, they can do nothing. One of the men insists that maybe the baby could be of help. Having no material possession to give to the baby, Aaron decides that his \\"gift\\" to him and his parents will be his playing his drum for them. As a sign of gratitude, Baba is healed and runs into Aaron's arms. Aaron finally feels kindness for the first time since the death of his parents.

The film is based on the 1908 play Madame X by French playwright Alexandre Bisson (1848-1912). Plot Ullrich Haupt and Ruth Chatterton in Madame X Jacqueline Floriot (Chatterton) is thrown out into the street without any money by her jealous husband Louis (Lewis Stone) when he discovers she had been carrying on an affair. She is not even allowed to see their four- year-old son, and sinks into depravity. Twenty years later, she has become the mistress of Laroque (Ullrich Haupt), a cardsharp. When he finds out that her husband is now the attorney general, Laroque decides to blackmail him. Desperate to shield her son from her disgrace, she shoots and kills her lover. By chance, the lawyer assigned to her turns out to be her own son, on his first case. He is puzzled and frustrated when she refuses to defend herself in court. During the trial, her husband shows up in support of his son. When she sees that he recognizes her and is about to speak out, she makes an impassioned plea, not for mercy, but for understanding of what drove her to murder. As she had intended, the hidden message silences Louis. When Jacqueline faints from the strain, she is carried into a private chamber. There, she kisses her still-unaware son and dies.

This was four years before the merger of Goldwyn with two other film studios that led to MGM. MGM inherited the screen rights to the story following the 1924 merger. No music is heard under the opening or closing credits of Madame X, which was the result of a short-lived practice in which studios expected the local theater musicians to provide live accompaniment to the opening credits of sound films. Because keyboardists and orchestras were still working in the theaters in the late 1920s providing music for silent films still in distribution, live music was a way to make the screening more of a special event and not a purely \\"canned\\" presentation.\\"Madame X\\". Turner Classic Movies. Retrieved February 25, 2014. Barrymore consciously avoided the song-and-dance formula that dominated early sound pictures, treating Madame X as a dramatic play. To emphasize the film's credentials as a serious drama and avoid any music hall associations, MGM premiered the film in New York City's Sam H. Harris Theater, a legitimate stage venue that was rented for the occasion.

The installation features the world‚Äôs largest high-resolution video wall, built by Prysm, using their proprietary Laser Phosphor Display (LPD) technology, a new display technology that uses low-power, solid‚Äìstate lasers. The two walls will deliver more than 50 million pixels combined. The large-scale projection wall is visible from the West Side Highway/11th Avenue to tens of thousands of commuters each day, building brand awareness for IAC's online businesses. Brand-specific modules designed and conceived by Trollback + Company represent the essence of each brand, incorporating a range of 2D, 3D and live action elements. The modules are based on a theme reflecting the consumer experience associated with IAC‚Äôs online businesses, such as ‚ÄòI Date‚Äô, ‚ÄòI Travel‚Äù and ‚ÄòI Shop‚Äô, a concept conceived by Bruce Mau of Bruce Mau Design. The ‚ÄòI Date‚Äô module uses the main romantic icon, flowers, and creates a sensual sequence with dramatic details of the time-lapse flowers opening. The simple concept for ‚ÄòI Shop‚Äô was to illustrate the enormous quantity and diversity of products available from IAC‚Äôs retail websites, using the scale of the display to create an immense sense of depth and infinite choice of merchandise. Two of the modules incorporate dynamic data from the web. ‚ÄòI Experience‚Äô parses a daily xml feed that is programmed to visualize the movement of current music events across the USA, linking locations and forming connections between venues. ‚ÄòI Explore‚Äô creates an endless loop of current news. Emphasizing the public nature of the wall, creative director Jason Koxvold conceived two time-keeping modules that use innovative graphics to represent the progression. In one, graphic bars animate across the whole length of the wall, rendering a strong physicality of the passing of time. For the other clock, type is moving across the wall, spelling out date and time, as well as using relative positions to give an animated experience of time. In fall of 2007, a class was offered at NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program called \\"Big Screens\\", which culminated in a presentation of student works that were designed specifically for the IAC Video Wall.

The towers reach a height of 107.5 meters, making it the tallest church building in Mexico. History The cornerstone of the cathedral was laid on February 2, 1898, the feast of Candlemas, by the second bishop of Zamora, Don Jose Ma. C√†zares y Martinez. The architectural plan is attributed to the Zamoran architect Jes√∫s Hern√°ndez Segura. The diocese had been established in 1862 and needed a cathedral. Beginning The construction started in 1898, with a crew of more than 300 men working on the site. It was designed in the neogothic, or gothic revival style with an unusual twist, a dome over the crossing. The cathedral would contain 5 extensive naves, 4 of which had been roofed over by the end of 1910; vast amounts of quarry stone were required in order to accelerate the work. Abandonment The Mexican Revolution brought problems to Zamora, and to the country as a whole. In 1914 the work of construction was suspended due to the revolution and later, the Cristero War, for an indefinite time. During the intervening years, only half of the cathedral was complete, including 4 of the naves, and all the pillars were in place. Unfortunately, due to the continuing conflict, the original drafts were lost; all that remained were a drawing of the original facade and a general plan of construction. Also, much of the original quarry stone disappeared, and the cathedral was damaged when the army decided to use one of the stone walls as a place of execution; many died by firing squad for their faith. The evidence still exists in the form of hundreds of bullet holes etched in the wall; a silent memorial to those who died there. Reconstruction After many fits and starts, in 1988 Jos√® E. Jim√©nez Robles, eighth bishop of Zamora, was able to plan for restarting construction and in 1989, it was decided to dedicate the building to Our Lady of Guadalupe. Its completion seemed almost impossible to him; the lack of economic resources and the time needed to complete the project being the most daunting tasks. The work of reconstruction began in 1990, with a new facade instead of what was originally planned, and bearing a resemblance to the gothic cathedral in Milan, Italy. A spire was placed at the crossing instead of the planned dome, this being an element more in keeping with pure gothic architecture. The walls were cleaned of debris then cracks were repaired and the walls reinforced. The towers were redesigned to make them more spacious and the patio was paved in order to lend greater stability to the building. The Sanctuary today At the moment, construction is on the verge of completion and last details are being finished.

Kisspeptin is encoded by the metastasis suppressor gene KISS1, which is expressed in a variety of endocrine and gonadal tissues. Activation of the kisspeptin receptor is linked to the phospholipase C and inositol trisphosphate second messenger cascades inside the cell.  Function  Kisspeptin is involved in the regulation of endocrine function and the onset of puberty, with activation of the kisspeptin receptor triggering release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), and release of kisspeptin itself being inhibited by oestradiol but enhanced by GnRH. Reductions in kisspeptin levels with age may conversely be one of the reasons behind age- related declines in levels of other endocrine hormones such as luteinizing hormone.

It is about a young teenager who decides to become a different person and ends up being invited to join a secret society which is orchestrating a reign of terror at his new school. Since its first publication by Orion Children's Books it has been translated into more than ten languages and become a worldwide critically acclaimed bestseller. Setting Inventing Elliot is set in England, where Elliot lives with his mother and his father who has just been in a serious trauma. The main action takes place at a fictional school, Holminster High. Contrary to what some reviewers have said, Holminster High is a state school, not a private school.Confirmation provided by the author. Themes Inventing Elliot is a book about the ways in which most people lie about what they think and feel in order to fit in, and the extent to which that lying can compromise psychological integrity and emotional wellbeing. The clue is in the title: Inventing Elliot. The protagonist, Elliot, hides his real self, which he believes will attract unwelcome attention, behind a veneer of 'cool'. Inside, however, he is terrified and vulnerable. At various points during the story Elliot thinks of himself as wearing a 'mask', and a sympathetic teacher refers to 'the armour' that most people put on each day. The book was inspired by the experiences of the author, although the story is fiction rather than autobiography.See notes and epilogue in the Reclam edition of Inventing Elliot, edited by Ernst Kemner A secondary theme of the book might be 'unintended consequences', perhaps with the underlying 'message' of 'Be Careful What You Wish For'. Elliot wishes that he could fit in with the people in his school, but in doing this he allows evil to happen, risks becoming a bully himself, and ends up losing the two real friends that he has. Influences The book is extremely influenced by the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell, a story about a totalitarian state in which the government is attempting to eliminate freedom of thought. Like Winston Smith, the hero of Nineteen Eighty-Four, Elliot struggles to hide what he really thinks and feels, and is terrified of the truth coming out, yet also longs to be free. Holminster High is effectively ruled by a single organization, just like the fictional country of Airstrip One in Nineteen Eighty-Four. The key 'villain' of Inventing Elliot bases his strategy on ideas taken from Nineteen Eighty-Four. Another important influence is The Chocolate War, a controversial novel for young adults written by the US writer Robert Cormier. Graham Gardner has said that he could not have written Inventing Elliot in the way that he did without the lead set by The Chocolate War. The two books are similar in that they both feature a school ruled by a secret society, but also very different because of the contrasting actions of their respective protagonists. The protagonist of The Chocolate War is a boy who decides to take a stand against conformity; he 'dares to disturb the universe'.See Patty Campbell, Daring to Disturb the Universe, Random House, 2006 In contrast, the central character of Inventing Elliot; makes an active effort to conform, to fit in. Both characters suffer, but in very different ways and for very different reasons. The boy from The Chocolate War is innocent; before he makes his stand, he does not understand that his actions will represent a real threat to those in power, and that no one will support him. Elliot is far from being innocent: he knows just what the stakes are and what he must do in order to survive, and he uses that knowledge to his advantage.  Awards  Translated into 10 languages, including French, German, Spanish, Greek,Albanian, Korean and Dutch, Inventing Elliot has been a worldwide bestseller and received widespread critical acclaim. In the UK, Inventing Elliot was short-listed for six prizes, including the Branford Boase Award, given to the best debut novel for children, and the Angus Book Award. The Sunday Times called it 'gripping and gritty', the Financial Times described it as 'taut and compelling', and Time Out magazine deemed it one of the top five novels of 2003. The Scotsman, The Guardian and Books for Keeps included it amongst their top ten teenage reads for 2003, whilst The Scotsman also named it 'debut of the year'. In the U.S., Inventing Elliot was nominated for the American Library Association's Best Young Adult Book Award 2004, the Nutmeg Prize and the Heartland Award, whilst New York Public Library has made it a 'book for the teen age' and critic Patty Campbell has described it as 'stunning' and 'heartrending'. In 2005, Inventing Elliot won the Youth Jury Award of the Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis, Germany's most prestigious honour for children's books, voted for by young people aged 11‚Äì17 across Germany. The prize is given to books judged to be of 'outstanding' literary merit and that encourage young people to read. National German newspaper Die Zeit described Inventing Elliot ‚Äì German title, Im Schatten Der W√§chter (In the Shadow of the Guardians) ‚Äì as a story 'told with amazing intensity'. Critic Hans Peter Roentgen called it 'a disturbing chronicle of power, force and seduction. Inventing Elliot has since been shortlisted for Belgium's Farniente prize (2006) and Holland's Kinderjury prize (2008).For further details of awards and reviews, see the Inventing Elliott page Publication history The UK edition of Inventing Elliot first published in the UK as a hardback by Orion Children's Books in 2003. A trade paperback followed in 2004. The US edition, published by Dial, an imprint of Penguin Putnam, appeared in hardback in 2004, then in paperback a year later.

It opened in 1929 and has been redesigned several times since. History The area around Bournemouth Gardens was granted permission by the owners in 1859 to incorporate a public pleasure ground. Discussions for a fixed entertainment venue took place during the 1880s, and as part of the 1892 Bournemouth Improvement Act, the council were granted ¬£20,000 for constructing a pavilion in the gardens, which could accommodate a municipal orchestra. These plans were continually blocked by local residents who felt that licensed premises for drinking were immoral. A fixed plan for a venue in the gardens was approved in 1908, but saw further delays and was consequently postponed until after World War I. By the 1920s, the orchestra felt that the Bournemouth Winter Gardens was no longer a suitable venue and requested a more accommodating hall be built. In 1923, a competition was held to design the concert room, chaired by Edwin Cooper. The winners were by G Wyville Home and Shirley Knight, whose design was consulted with Owen Williams. Construction began in September 1925 with the laying of the foundation stone.(FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT.). \\"Music Pavilion For Bournemouth.\\" Times, 24 Sept. 1925, p. 10.

Accessed 3 Mar. 2020. In the early 1930s, the Pavillion was rebuilt to accommodate theatrical productions as well as orchestras. It re-opened with a production of The White Horse Inn on 7 July 1934. Several alterations were undertaken in the 1950s, including the addition of two storeys to either side of the main entrance. In 1975, the Oasis Bar was added as a western extension of the hall. This proved to be unpopular, and was demolished in 2007 when the theatre underwent a ¬£12 million restoration programme. The building was Grade II listed on 19 January 1998. It is currently owned by Bournemouth Borough Council and managed by BH Live. The Pavilion operates alongside its sister venue, the Bournemouth International Centre. In 2019, Lenny Henry complained that a historical photograph in the pavilion's dressing room, showing actors in blackface, was outdated, racist and offensive. A spokesman for the pavilion apologised.

He has also represented Chinese Taipei on many occasions before entering his professional career, and is sometimes named the best second baseman of his time. Baseball career Lu began his baseball career in elementary school, and has been playing on the national team since high school. Because of his skills, he was admitted into the Hu-feng baseball team (), the baseball team of the Taiwan Air Force. With his solid fielding skills, he was a frequent member of the Chinese Taipei national baseball team in the 1980s and won the bronze medal in the 1984 Olympics(as demonstration sport). He join Uni-President Lions in 1989 after being invited by a former coach. As a founding member of the Lions, Lu was well liked by his teammates and coaches. He was praised for his stable performance on the field, but had very little achievement elsewhere. When CPBL increased the number of foreign players on each team's roster in 1994, he eventually lost his position and became a backup infielder. He retired in 1998 due to age and lack of position on the team. He took up the fielding coach position in the Lions after retiring, and later left for Macoto Gida, which is now Macoto Cobras, who offered him the same position but more opportunity. He returned to the Lions after the Cobras underwent major organizational restructuring, and first took up outfield fielding coach position, later the manager position when Lo Kuo-chang, the bench coach at the time, declined the offer. Despite the short notice before taking the job, Lu did fairly well by leading the Lions to victory in the 2007 Taiwan Series. Lu won a total of four titles in his five years tenure as manager. In February 2012, Lu was investigated by the authority for possible leaking of information to sports betting groups. Lu admitted that he unintentionally leaked players' status to a sports betting group because he mistook them as baseball fans and was not aware that they were engaging in betting activities. He resigned his position following the incident. Since Lu is no longer able to coach baseball in Taiwan, in March 2012 he moved to New Zealand to help former CPBL, Japanese and MILB professional player Yeh Ming-Huang coach the New Zealand U17 team who will be competing in the 2012 Asia-Pacific Senior League Baseball championships, that runs from 4‚Äì9 July in Agana, Guam, in the hope of qualifying for the World Series, held in Bangor, Maine, USA. On his personal Facebook page, he stated that he was 'very optimistic' for the team and its players, stating that he thought the combination of himself and Coach Yeh as the coaching staff, along with the young talent in the team, could take New Zealand to its maiden World Championship Series at any age-group level. Sources have also stated that Lu could be the front-runner for New Zealand's World Baseball Classic manager job, the only barrier at this stage being the lack of English that Lu has.

Life and career Born Horace Edward Jenner,Thomas Ince; Hollywood's Independent Pioneer p.276 c.2012 by Brian Taves (some sources give Edward Sanger) Holmes Herbert emigrated to the United States in 1912. He was the first son of Edward Henry Jenner (stage name Ned Herbert), who worked as an actor and comedian in the British theatre. Holmes Herbert never made a film in his native country but managed to appear in 228 films during his career in the U.S., beginning with stalwart leading roles during the silent era and numerous supporting roles in many classic Hollywood films of the sound era, including Captain Blood (1935), The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936), The Life of Emile Zola (1937), The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938), and Foreign Correspondent (1940). In silent films Herbert could play different nationalities, as did his contemporaries like Wyndham Standing, but when sound films came in, their pronounced British accents were revealed. Herbert is perhaps best known for his role as Dr. Jekyll's friend Dr. Lanyon in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931), and made something of a career in horror films of the period, appearing in The Terror (1928), The Thirteenth Chair (1929 and 1937), The Mystery of the Wax Museum (1933), The Invisible Man (1933), Mark of the Vampire (1935), Tower of London (1939), The Ghost of Frankenstein (1942), The Undying Monster (1942), The Mummy's Curse and The Son of Dr. Jekyll (1952). He also played in several of Universal's cycle of Sherlock Holmes films during the 1940s. He retired from acting in 1952. Herbert was married three times. His first wife was actress Beryl Mercer, and his second was Elinor Kershaw Ince, widow of film mogul Thomas H. Ince. Both marriages ended in divorce. Third wife Agnes Bartholomew died, leaving Herbert a widower, in 1955.Taves, Brian; Thomas Ince...page. 276 He died in 1956 at age 74.

The term depicts a certain quality (of experience) that can be observed within oneself or within others. It does not depict an ideal, although it has been abused to do so, for example by the genius-cult during the era of romanticism.  Phenomenon, origin  A human being in love, no matter at whom or what his adoration and affection is pointed at--be it a beloved person, a god in some mystical sense or an idol--is not able to reduce the \\"item\\" of his love down to certain characteristics, he claims his \\"obscure object of desire\\" to be unique and incomparable. The attribution of characteristics from the banal everyday world would, in the eye of the one being seriously in love, mean betrayal (sacrilege) to the very own love itself. Up until now, no one has managed to describe and analyze this more strikingly than Roland Barthes in his famous and acclaimed collection of essays A Lover's Discourse: Fragments, published in 1977. But if you look at it more closely, this is an everyday phenomenon each and every mere mortal is encountering: parents can describe, praise or curse the relation between them and their children--but they realize at the same time that the depth and the profoundness of their feelings for their offspring are atopical, or ineffable. Natural religions, like mysticism, therefore talk about \\"Tao\\", about the \\"original\\" and the \\"pristine\\"; in the field of ontological philosophy and theology it is called \\"richness of being\\". The rather sensual, mundane and secular poetry speaks of cornucopia (also see: cornucopian), or, more prosaically of \\"inspiration\\". In the field of science, especially in psychological sciences, this phenomenon is being researched under the leading definition of creativity or as \\"Flow\\".  Occurrence  Most adults are familiar with atopy, having experienced the view on the world through \\"rose-tinted glasses\\" in phases of limerence. Art lovers know it as genius and as something auratic, readers as \\"Thou shalt not make for thyself an idol\\" in Max Frisch's \\"Stiller\\", which refers to the notion of God from the \\"Ten Commandments\\", or \\"Geschichten von Herrn Keuner\\" by Bertold Brecht.

American Heritage School offers a full array of academic, fine arts, and athletics opportunities for its students. Activities include ballroom dance, choir, drama, orchestra, experiential learning, student government, robotics, chess club, basketball, volleyball, soccer, track and field, tennis and cross country. History After Brigham Young High School closed its doors in 1968, several parents with children at that school and other area schools banded together to create American Heritage School, which opened its doors in 1970 with an enrollment of 85 students. Though the school is oriented toward The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, it is not legally affiliated with Brigham Young University or The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In 2002, the school moved from its Pleasant Grove, Utah location to a new , $20 million K‚Äì8 campus across from the Mount Timpanogos Utah Temple in American Fork. The entire campus was funded through private donations. In 2009, the school completed a $5 million building expansion to provide for capacity to offer high school grades as well as to accommodate growth in elementary and middle school grades. American Heritage School then launched their accredited, worldwide Home and Distance Education program called Latter-day Learning in the Fall of 2010 (now known as American Heritage Worldwide), which serves families in all 50 states and approximately 70 countries around the world. In the fall of 2018, American Heritage completed another campus expansion that added a basketball arena, classrooms, football/soccer stadium, track, baseball field, and tennis courts encompassed within an additional , bringing the campus to . As is the school's practice, the 2018 expansion was completely funded with donations from private donors, with no funds coming from tuition or public sources.  School traditions  One of the central traditions of American Heritage School is music. The school has an official song, ‚ÄúChildren of Liberty,‚Äù written by one of its original teachers. The song is sung at assemblies, parent meetings, and student devotional performances. The song also forms the goals and philosophy of American Heritage School. It reminds students to ‚Äúlearn from the past,‚Äù seek ‚Äútruth, honor, and charity,‚Äù and ‚Äúlet your ray glow. In addition to its nearly 1,000 on-campus students, American Heritage also enrolls approximately 600 students in award-winning after-school orchestra (Lyceum Philharmonic) that has been featured on PBS and choir programs (Heritage Youth Choirs) that are open to the community.

He has recently produced music for artists such as Ghostface Killah and Puff Daddy. K-Def earned critical praise early in his career for his work with Marley Marl on the album Here Come the Lords by the hip hop group Lords of the Underground.[ allmusic ((( K-Def > Overview )))] Among the songs from that album that benefited from K-Def's production work include the hits \\"Funky Child\\" and \\"Chief Rocka\\". Biography K-Def was also member of the duo Real Live, which released one album The Turnaround: A Long Awaited Drama on Big Beat/Atlantic Records in 1996. \\"Real Live Shit (Remix)\\" featured Cappadonna, Ghostface Killah, Killa Sin and Lord Tariq. In April 2018, Rhino Entertainment issued a digital download of the album. K-Def is mostly known for his blues-soul sampling style. While the majority of his early-mid 1990s productions were produced using the Akai MPC sampler/sequencer, around 1997 he started incorporating computers into his work flow and now exclusively uses a software based setup. In 2004 K-Def produced \\"Its Over\\" on the Ghostface Killah release The Pretty Toney Album. He then contributed tracks to another Ghostface project, Theodore Unit, and Ol' Dirty Bastard's The Osirus Mixtape. He was a contributor to Diddy's 2006 release Press Play, and, in 2007, he produced a track on UGK‚Äôs album Underground Kingz. In 2006, K-Def released an instrumental album called Willie Boo Boo The Fool. The album was originally only available on CD and vinyl, but it was digitally re-released in 2008.

Coco is also alternatively known as \\"embolada\\" (another slang word, meaning \\"entangling\\", referring to the fast, slurred, machine-gun style of singing). Coco is often performed with a repetitive musical beat and call and response singing reminiscent of Capoeira music. The music is commonly performed at traditional parties in the Northeast, such as weekend street parties and Carnival. The characteristic sound of coco arises from four instruments commonly used in its performance: the ganz√°, surdo, pandeiro, and triangle. Performers also often wear wooden clogs, the stomping of which adds a fifth percussive element. The name \\"Coco\\" (Portuguese for \\"coconut\\") is a common Northeastern Brazilian slang for head, referring to the fact that song lyrics are often improvised.  Origins  The origins of coco are as obscure as most Brazilian folk music, but some theories do exist. One theory is that the predecessor to the music was originally brought to Brazil by slaves from Angola, who then created coco by merging their music with local indigenous rhythms.Grupo de cultura popular p√©-de-chinelo - Jongo, Coco, Samba-de-roda - Coco Another theory is that coco was created by Brazilian slaves who broke coconuts with rocks for their masters.

The method is experimental, and it is not as widely used in archaeology as other chronometric methods such as radiocarbon dating. The methodology was introduced by Archaeology Consulting Team from Essex Junction in 1992.Frink, Douglas S. (1992) The Chemical Variability of Carbonized Organic Matter Through Time. Archaeology of Eastern North America 20: 67-79.Frink, Douglas S. (1994) The Oxidizable Carbon Ratio (OCR): A Proposed Solution to Some of the Problems Encountered with Radiocarbon Data. North American Archaeologist 15(1): 17-29 Frink, Douglas S. (1995) Application of the Oxidizable Carbon Ratio (OCR) Dating Procedure and its Implications for Pedogenic Research. In Pedological Perspectives in Archaeological Research. SSA Special Publication 44. Soil Science Society of America: Madison, WI.  Process  This dating method works by measuring the ratio of oxidizable carbon to organic carbon. If the sample is freshly burned there will be no oxidizable carbon because it would have all been removed by the combustion process. Over time this will change and the amount of organic carbon will decrease to be replaced by oxidizable carbon. By measuring the ratio of oxidized carbon to organic carbon (the OCR) and applying it to the following equation the age of the sample can be determined with a very low standard error.Douglas S. Frink. \\"Application of the Oxidizable Carbon Ratio (OCR) Dating Procedure and its Implications for Pedogenic Research\\".

The Oxidizable Carbon Ratio method was the subject of a Point‚ÄìCounterPoint feature of the Society for American Archaeology Bulletin in 1999.D. J. Killick, A. J. T. Jull, and G. S Burr \\"A Failure to Discriminate: Querying Oxidizable Carbon Ratio (OCR) Dating\\" and \\"The Scientific Basis of Oxidizable Carbon Ratio (OCR) Dating\\" Accessed December 8th, 2007 In that article, Killick, Jull, and Burr suggest that the OCR method has (1) never been described in a peer-reviewed journal article, (2) that no \\"scientifically acceptable\\" demonstration of the accuracy and precision of OCR dating has been published, and (3) that the equation underlying the OCR method is questionable because of site-specific environmental factors. Frink's rejoinder to these comments points out that (1) the OCR method has indeed been described in a peer-reviewed journal article, (2) that the accuracy and precision of the method have been reported in multiple venues and that the concept of \\"scientifically acceptable\\" is context- and person-specific (and therefore a red herring), and that (3) the equation underlying the OCR method takes into account the seven factors of soil formation, and that these factors are routinely used in soil science applications without question. In the end, Frink concludes that the OCR method‚Äîlike any scientific advance‚Äîwarrants further study, and he points out that even the now venerable \\"scientifically acceptable\\" method of radiocarbon dating was much maligned when it was first introduced. Frink and others have published multiple studies demonstrating that OCR dates can correlate well with radiocarbon dates (see list of published references provided below). Fullen's study of the Sarah Peralta site in Louisiana Stephen R. Fullen (1998). Temporal Trends in Tchula Period Pottery in Louisiana. Pages 63-65. Accessed December 27, 2007. found that the OCR method served as an effective means of inferring time at the site in the absence of radiometrically dateable charcoal. He concludes that whereas debate remains concerning the OCR procedure, \\"the well-corroborated dates that the LSU Museum of Natural Science has had returned on material processed with OCR and conventional radiocarbon dating...the dates returned on material from Zone 3 will be considered accurate until such time that OCR dating is proven invalid.\\" (ibid. p. 65) The OCR method has been used in a large number of archaeological and geomorphological studies, and an incomplete list of published references is provided below.

They were brothers, sons of Remus,Accordingly, Numitor, king of Alba Longa, would have been his great-grandfather. Their maternal grandfather would have been either Mars or Hercules, depending on which version of the tale is referenced. and thus Romulus was their uncle. Sienese coat of arms Lupa in Palazzo Pubblico, Siena Traditions developed in Siena, which can not be documented prior to the 16th century hold that after Romulus murdered their father during the Foundation of Rome, Senius (who gave his name to the city) and his brother Aschius were forced to flee Rome on horseback, riding respectively on a black horse and a white one, giving rise to the colors on the Balzana, the coat of arms of Siena.Urban Legends: Civic Identity and the Classical Past in Northern Italy, 1250 -1350; by Carrie E. Benes, Pennsylvania University Press, 2011. page 89-90. Some tellings of the legend hold that the brothers were protected by the Gods with a white cloud during the day and a dark cloud at night. They also claim the brothers stole the statue of the Capitoline Wolf from the Temple of Apollo in Rome.Art in Renaissance Italy, by John T. Paoletti, Gary M. Radke, Laurence Publishing Company, 71 Great Russell Street, London (2006) page 99. However, since the brothers were descendants of Remus, Siena did have a claim to be descendants of one of the siblings nurtured by the she-wolf (lupa), which serves as a symbol of Rome. The Porta Camollia, in the Walls of Siena, is putatively named after an emissary or soldier sent to lure the brothers back to Rome, but who elected to stay instead. One role of the legend is to grant the Sienese a noble and ancient ancestry; Rome itself had sought such a pedigree with the story of the Aeneid of Virgil. Many cities in the Italian peninsula seeking pre-eminence, such as Venice and Florence, also looked for a foundation story to link their city to greatness. It is possible that the black and white colors and history were meant to try to maintain a common bond even among the fractious Sienese, especially when torn by Guelf and Ghibelline civil strife and factionalism.

She created the 5Rhythms approach to movement in the late 1970s; there are now hundreds of 5Rhythms teachers worldwide who use her approach in their work. Roth worked at the Kripalu Center for Yoga & Health and at the Omega Institute for Holistic Studies. She founded an experimental theatre company in New York, wrote three books, created over twenty albums of trance dance music with her band The Mirrors, and directed or has been the subject of ten videos. Early life Born in San Francisco, Roth was originally inspired to dance, aged seven, by seeing a ballerina through the window of a dance school, deciding that was her vocation. She found a book that showed the ballet positions and started to practice in her bedroom, eventually coming to have ballet lessons. She attended Roman Catholic schools and listened to the music of the local \\"fundamentalist church\\". Roth described being inspired by the dance of Spanish gypsy La Chunga and by seeing the Nigerian National Ballet. She trained in traditional dance methods, suffering from anorexia during her teenage years. Roth paid for college education by teaching movement in rehabilitation centres. Following college she lived and worked in Europe for three years, during the mid 1960s. During this time she visited the concentration camps memorials in Germany that she had studied during college. She injured her knee in a skiing accident in Germany and later again in an African dance class. At 26, she was told that she needed surgery and wouldn't dance again and resigned herself to the prognosis. She entered a depression and later retreated to Big Sur in California, joining a group at the Esalen Institute. She became a masseuse there. She found that her body healed itself through dance, despite what the doctors had said. Gestalt psychiatrist Fritz Perls asked her to teach dance at the Esalen Institute and she set out to find a structure for dance as a transformative process. Out of her work at Esalen she designed the 'Wave' of the 5Rhythms approach, Flowing, Staccato, Chaos, Lyrical, Stillness.\\"Dance ecstasy: the art and science of dancing into Nirvana\\". Spirituality & Health Magazine January 1, 2012. La Cerra, Peggy Writing Roth's book, Sweat Your Prayers, begins with an autobiographical prologue, \\"God, Sex, & My Body\\", in which she writes of the contradictions in her personality that led her to dance. She comments, \\"I loved to work out my body but I hated the mirrors\\".Roth, Gabrielle. 1997. pg. xix. She notes that she was taught by Catholic nuns \\"with eyes trained to scan for sin\\"Roth, Gabrielle. 1997. pg. xvi. and that her first dance teacher was \\"an old woman with frizzy dyed red hair, a funny accent, and a long thin stick\\" who would beat her whenever she made a mistake, initiating in Roth a severe inferiority complex. In college, she became pregnant. She found her lover insensitive to the news and had an abortion three days later.Roth, Gabrielle. 1997. pg. xviii. Roth writes that she felt the importance of privacy to her kind of dance while teaching at Esalen in a room \\"lined with picture windows\\". Passers by would stare in during sessions. Roth comments, \\"this was tragic, as the majority of my students were paralytically self- conscious when it came to moving their bodies.\\"Roth, Gabrielle. 1997. pg. xxi. She noticed that her students had difficulty breathing. Her book Sweat Your Prayers ends with her vision of spreading dance across the world, the power of movement \\"leading us back into the garden [of Eden], back to the earth, whole and healed, spirit and flesh reunited\\".Roth, Gabrielle. 1997. pg. 217. Career The Culture Project set up home in the Manhattan Ensemble Theatre Roth was a faculty member at The Kripalu Center for Yoga & Health (Stockbridge, Massachusetts) and has taught at the Omega Institute for Holistic Studies (Rhinebeck, New York). She trained for three years with Oscar Ichazo, founder of the Arica School and set up her own experimental theatre company in New York City. The Moving Center teaches her work through her school in New York; it has certified over 400 5Rhythms teachers worldwide. She taught experimental theatre in New York based on her ecstatic dance approach, 5Rhythms. Roth was music director of the theatre company The Mirrors and has been a member of the Actors Studio. Roth directed theatre productions of Savage Love, by Sam Shepard and Joseph Chaikin, at The Culture Project (Mercer Street, New York City).Margaret Wagner Roth wrote three books: Sweat Your Prayers: Movement as Spiritual Practice, Maps to Ecstasy: Teachings of an Urban Shaman, and Connections: The 5 Threads of Intuitive Wisdom.

The movement has spread worldwide with 245 registered teachers.For example, Nadine Fiume, Adam Barley, Gay Murphy, and Margaret Wagner teach the 5 Rhythms. The 5Rhythms have been the subject of at least one Ph.D thesis, and some academic publications.Cook, S., Ledger, K., Scott, N.

Charlotte Macleod, writing in the London Evening Standard, describes dancing Roth's 5Rhythms as a kind of antidote to life in a large city, and how she was attracted to a dance class by a video of Thom Yorke. The class leaves her \\"mentally and physically refreshed, and oddly connected to the other dancers.\\" The dance was \\"a kind of moving meditation\\" for her. Christine Ottery, writing in The Guardian, states that \\"ecstatic dancing has an image problem\\" and \\"encompasses everything from large global movements such as 5 Rhythms and Biodanza to local drum'n'dance meet-ups\\". She suggests that readers may \\"find 5 Rhythms a good place to start\\", and does so herself: \\"Nervously, I stretch and warm my muscles. As the rhythms take off, I shake off my shyness.\\" She dances in different ways, alone or with partners. \\"My body is expressing itself - it's utter abandonment and a complete high.\\" In 2007, Roth founded the non-profit 5Rhythms Reach Out which offered classes in 5Rhythms to various groups, including those suffering from Alzheimer's disease, other dementias, and cancer. 5Rhythms later also became part of the Open Floor movement practice designed by Andrea Juhan.

OPRs are grouped into two groups: OPRI and OPRII ‚Äì the second group is the focus of this article, as the function of the first group is unknown, but is the subject of current research. The OPR enzyme utilizes the cofactor flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and catalyzes the following reaction in the jasmonic acid synthesis pathway: Reaction catalyzed by 12-oxophytodienoate reductase in the jasmonic acid synthesis pathway. This reaction occurs in peroxisomes in plants. Several isozymes have been discovered, with varying substrate stereospecificity: three in Lycopersicon esculentum, 13 in Oryza sativa, and five in Arabidopsis thaliana. The OPR3 isozyme is most extensively studied because it can reduce all 4 stereoisomers of the substrate, OPDA and because it has shown to be the most significant enzyme in the jasmonic acid synthesis pathway. Structure 12-oxophytodienoate reductase structure resembles OYE enzymes and has been elucidated by x-ray crystal structures. The cDNA encodes 372 amino acids for this enzyme. It exhibits a barrel fold of eight parallel beta-strands surrounded by eight alpha-helices to create a barrel shape. Turns at the N-terminus loops of the beta-strands have been shown to contain three to four amino acid residues and the C-terminus loops range between three and 47 amino acid residues. The C-terminus loops largely make up the active site and the larger range of the amount of residues is due to the diversity in the different isozyme active sites. OPR3, the most extensively studied isoform of 12-oxophytodienoate reductase, has a wider binding pocket than OPR1, which is enantioselective for only one OPDA substrate enantiomer. The residues Tyr78 and Tyr246 that are at the mouth of the active site are responsible for the higher enantioselectivity of OPR1. OPR1 and OPR3 have identical substrate binding residues, but the difference in the width of the mouth of the active site determines the OPR1 specificity. 12-oxophytodienoate reductase isomers OPR3 (blue) and OPR1 (green) with FMN cofactor (pink). 12-oxophytodienoate reductase has also been shown to practice self-inhibition by dimerization. This is the only flavoprotein known to dimerize for inhibition and this dimerization is thought to be regulated by phosphorylation. The dimerization occurs by the mutual binding of two loops into the two active sites. These loops are highly evolutionarily conserved, indicating the dimerization is purposeful and significant in regulation. 12-oxophytodienoate reductase (OPR3) dimerized to itself. This dimer provides self-inhibition of the enzyme. Mechanism The reduction mechanism employed has been shown to be a ping- pong, bi-bi mechanism. The FMN cofactor is first reduced by NADPH, the substrate is then bound, and finally the substrate is reduced by a hydride transfer from NADPH to the substrate‚Äôs beta carbon. The Km of OPR3 in Zea mays was found to be 190 micromolar for its substrate OPDA. Biological Function The reaction catalyzed by 12-oxophytodienoate reductase is in the jasmonic acid biosynthesis pathway. Jasmonic acid is known for its importance as a gene regulator for development and defense. OPR3 is shown to be induced by touch, wind, UV light, application of detergent, wounding, and brassinosteroids. In wound response, its activity has been shown to partially depend on jasmonic acid perception. It is also shown to have greater enzyme efficiency than OPR1 and OPR2 in Arabidopsis thaliana, showing it is the significant enzyme in the jasmonic acid biosynthesis pathway. Relevance to Agriculture This enzyme is of interest in plant biology research because the disrupted OPR3 gene has been shown to cause male sterility in Arabidopsis thaliana. This is a point of interest in understanding the factors surrounding viable pollen development, a focus of research in the agriculture industry. Relevance to Phytoremediation OPR has shown to also function in the reduction of explosive 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT). Because TNT is a known toxic, environmental pollutant that is difficult to degrade, the use of phytoremediation to clean up sites contaminated with TNT is of significant interest. OPR1 degraded TNT faster and with greater amount of degraded products than other isozymes. This enzyme could therefore be used in phytoremediation. Phylogenetics A phylogenetic analysis studying the structural evolution and functional divergence of the various OPR paralogues found seven conserved sub-families and suggested expansion of the OPR families occurred in land plants. A total of 74 OPR genes in 11 species from six major plant lineages were found. Surprisingly, introns were found to differ in length and number, but conserved in position, indicating successive intron loss. The study also indicated that the substrate binding loop and the alpha- helices, but not the beta-sheets, were critical for functional divergence after sub-families were established and are therefore important in the OPR proteins.

First-class cricket in the West Indies had begun in February 1865 and the federation began playing Test cricket in 1928, but it was not until the 1965-66 West Indian cricket season that a formal domestic competition was founded, this being the Shell Shield which has subsequently evolved into the Carib Beer Cup. Post-war cricket to 1970 West Indies cricket received a tremendous boost when its team defeated England in the 1950 Test series. The preceding few years had seen the emergence of truly great players like Frank Worrell, Everton Weekes and Clyde Walcott, and Gary Sobers followed during the 1950s. In 1965, Shell Oil sponsored its Shell Shield and the West Indies at last had a true domestic championship.

The Game of Love and Chance was first performed 23 January 1730 by the Com√©die Italienne. In this play, a young woman is visited by her betrothed, whom she does not know. To get a better idea of the type of person he is, she trades places with her servant and disguises herself. However, unbeknownst to her, her fianc√© has the same idea and trades places with his valet. The \\"game\\" pits the two false servants against the two false masters, and in the end, the couples fall in love with their appropriate counterpart. Like many of Marivaux's other comedies, The Game of Love and Chance makes use of stock characters from the Commedia dell'arte. In this play, Arlequin is featured. Lisette, who appears in other Marivaux plays, also takes on a stock personality as the feisty servant. Plot summary Silvia is engaged to marry Dorante, a man she has never met. She is afraid to marry him without knowing what type of man he is, and he is planning to visit her very soon to formalize the engagement. In order to observe Dorante's true personality during his visit, she asks her father if she can change clothes with her servant, Lisette, so that she can watch him without his knowing her identity. Monsieur Orgon immediately agrees, having coincidentally received a letter from Dorante's father explaining how Dorante planned to disguise himself as his servant in order to achieve the same goal as Silvia. Monsieur Orgon sees this as an opportunity to play the game of love and chance, allowing the two to fall in love in spite of themselves. Dorante arrives at Monsieur Orgon's house disguised as a servant named Bourguignon, while Arlequin comes dressed as Dorante. However, Silvia and Dorante's refined behavior is evident, in spite of their servant's attire; and Arlequin and Lisette are unable to recognize the difference between true manners and the gross exaggerations they exact while playing their roles as master. Dorante and Silvia fall in love, but as neither knows the other's true status, they find themselves in a social dilemma, each believing to be a noble in love with a servant. Finally, Dorante relents and reveals his identity to Silvia. Relieved, Silvia nonetheless decides to continue to play the game, hoping that Dorante will go so far as to renounce his fortune in order to marry her (thinking she is a servant). The play ends with the union of the two couples: Silvia and Dorante, and Lisette and Arlequin.

Artefill was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a medical device in October 2006. A prior version of the product called Artecoll has been marketed in Canada and Europe since the 1990s. Medical use Artecoll is a gel suspension of 20% polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) 30- to 42-micron microspheres, 3.5% collagen derived from cows, and 0.3% lidocaine.. is a gel suspension of 20% polymethylmethacrylate homogeneous 30- to 42-¬µm microspheres in 3.5% bovine collagen solution mixed with 0.3% lidocaine that may have durability over 5 years.\\" The PMMA microspheres in Artecoll are not absorbed by the body and therefore provide a permanent scaffold into which the person's own soft tissue can grow; the PMMA microspheres can only be removed by cutting them out. Artecoll is a permanent injectable wrinkle filler used by dermatologists and plastic surgeons to fill smile lines. The initial correction lasts about 6 months, until the bovine collagen degrades, but as the recipient's tissue grows in, filling may last for about five years and there have been reports of ten years' duration. Side effects Side effects may include lumpiness at the injection site, persistent swelling or redness, increased sensitivity, and rash or itching more than 48 hours after injection. The lumpiness (nodules), and granulomas, can be difficult for doctors to treat. If the recipient has allergies to bovine collagen or lidocaine, severe allergies, a susceptibility to form keloid or hypertrophic scars, or fails a small skin test, Artefill should not be used. Because the device ultimately works by causing tissue to grow around the microsphere scaffold, there is a risk of overgrowth if too much Artefill is administered. History Like many companies working on injectable fillers, the company developing Artecoll went through several formulations before achieving one that had consistently high enough quality to pass regulatory review. The product was invented by German plastic surgeon Gottfried Lemperle and the first version was called Arteplast and clinical trials started in 1989; an unacceptable rate of complications led to a new formulation, Artecoll, for which the Dutch company Rofil Medical received European marketing approval in 1994 and for which Canderm Pharma received Canadian approval in 1996. Artes Medical Inc. was formed in the US in 1999 by Lemperle and his two sons to bring the technology to the U.S. and secure FDA approval.

The grave of Robert Cadell, Greyfriars Kirkyard Robert Cadell (16 December 1788 ‚Äì 20 January 1849) was a bookseller and publisher closely associated with Sir Walter Scott. Life He was born at Cockenzie, East Lothian, Scotland, the fifth son of John Cadell, a Laird of Cockenzie, and Marie Buchan, his wife. Cadell's career began as a clerk at Archibald Constable & Co., Sir Walter Scott's publisher, where he later (1809) became a partner in the business. The connection to Constable was also personal: Cadell married his daughter Elizabeth in October 1817. She died less than nine months later. Cadell married again (to Anne Fletcher Mylne) in 1821, adding to the friction which had developed between Constable and Cadell since the death of Elizabeth. The two men were very different characters: Cadell was cautious and lived plainly, while Constable's lifestyle was lavish and he took risks in business. When Constable's London agents Hurst Robinson went bankrupt and Archibald Constable & Co. itself fell into receivership in January 1826 through the effects of Scott's own bankruptcy, the partnership between Cadell and Constable dissolved. Scott chose to remain with Cadell, respecting Cadell's prudence in business affairs. Scott and Cadell purchased the copyright to Scott's novels and produced a new edition of the Waverley novels including new material penned by Scott. The work to create this ‚Äòauthor's edition‚Äô commenced in 1827 and was highly successful, in part perhaps because of the illustrations executed for it by J. M. W. Turner. Cadell took care of Scott in the writer's last years, profiting handsomely from arrangements made with Scott's family after his death such that they were absolved from debt in return for Cadell's exclusive right to republish Scott's novels and biographical material. On Scott's death, Cadell paid ¬£30,000 for Scott's share of the copyright on Scott's work, thereafter owning it outright.Monuments and monumental inscriptions in Scotland: The Grampian Society, 1871 Cadell's wealth enabled him to acquire considerable land and personal property, including Ratho House, in Midlothian. He died at the family home in Cockenzie on 20 January 1860 and is buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard in central Edinburgh.Monuments and monumental inscriptions in Scotland: The Grampian Society, 1871 The grave stands at the head of one of the western lines in the western extension. Family He first married Elizabeth Constable, daughter of his employer Archibald Constable. She died in 1818. He was then married to Anne Fletcher Mylne (1796‚Äì1867). They had a son John in 1826 who only lived for 6 weeks. Their daughter Emily (1821‚Äì1832) also died young.

The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybenzoate:NAD+ oxidoreductase. This enzyme is also called 2,3-diDHB dehydrogenase. This enzyme participates in biosynthesis of siderophore group nonribosomal.  Structure  Monomer structure of 2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybenzoate dehydrogenase. 2,3-diDHB dehydrogenase is a tetramer protein with dimension 65x69x43 √Ö. It has a crystallographic 222 symmetry, which exhibited for other members of short- chain oxireductase (SCOR) family of enzymes. The length of each monomer is 248 residues and the weight of the protein is 24647 Da. Each monomer consists of 7 beta-pleated sheets and 6 alpha helices. Although the structure of the binding protein is not clearly defined, it was proposed that the binding pocket is made out of Leu83, Met85, Arg138, Gly140, Met141, Ser176, Met181, Gln182 and Leu185. It was also speculated that Arg138 is a likely subunit that interacts with the carboxyl group of 2,3-diDHB. Since there was a strong indication of oxidation at C3 position, Ser176 and Gln182 interact with the C2-hydroxyl group in order for the stereo-selective reaction to occur.  Reaction mechanism  Reaction scheme for 2,3-diDHB dehydrogenase. In times of limited iron number in the environment, the EntA reaction is irreversible physiologically. The exact mechanism for the reaction is unknown; however, the proposed reaction scheme for the reaction is as following:  Rate of reaction  The rate of the conversion reaction is determined by several factors. The regiochemical position of the carboxyl group and the 3-hydroxyl group plays one role in the reaction, in which the rate of reaction of 1,3-cis-substituted substrate gives about 40-fold higher kcat/Km value than the 1,3-trans- substituted substrate.  Roles in bacteria  =E. coli= 2,3-diDHB dehydrogenase catalyzes the NAD+-dependent oxidation of 2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybenzoate to produce an aromatic compound 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,3-DHB or simply DHB). In times of iron deficiency, iron uptake is controlled by three genes: ent, fep, and fes for synthesis, export, and uptake of ferric Enterobactin and its hydrolytic cleavage to release Fe3+ into the cell. This production of this compound is controlled by eight genes: entA-entF, entH, and entS. In E. coli, all of these genes are controlled by the Fur repressor, such that the genes are turned on when the concentration of iron in the environment is low. From these six genes, EntA, EntB, and EntC are responsible for the synthesis of DHB from chorismic acid and the gene EntA encodes the information of 2,3-diDHB dehydrogenase. Without , , and , the bacteria show almost an absolute requirement of DHB in order to survive. =A. tumefaciens= Production of siderophores also exhibited in some plant-infecting bacteria, such as Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The enzyme is controlled by gene cluster agb and the production of 2,3-diDHB dehydrogenase is controlled by the gene agbA. The enzyme AgbA is homologous to the EntA enzyme in E. coli, the same enzyme that produces 2,3-diDHB dehydrogenase.

Contrary to normal routing problems, which usually involve mapping a route between nodes, arc routing focuses more heavily on the route itself. The goal of many arc routing problems is to produce a route with the minimum amount of dead mileage, while also fully encompassing the edges required. Examples of arc routing applications include garbage collection, road gritting, mail delivery, network maintenance, and snowploughing. Problem types Arc routing problems (ARPs) differ in their goal and heuristics. However, all of them are known to be NP-hard. =Undirected rural postman problem= This problem is named after the postman and his challenge to deliver mail in any order he may choose, but minimizing his costs such as time or travel distance. It is also sometimes called the undirected chinese postman problem. The undirected rural postman problem (URPP) aims to minimize the total cost of a route that maps the entire network, or in more specific cases, a route that maps every edge that requires a service. If the whole network must be mapped, the route that maps the entire network is called a covering tour. In the case where only certain edges need to be mapped, the problem aims to solve the route that optimizes the demands, crossing over into non-required routes a minimal number of times. =Undirected capacitated arc routing problem= The undirected capacitated arc routing problem consists of demands placed on the edges, and each edge must meet the demand. An example is garbage collection, where each route might require both a garbage collection and a recyclable collection. Problems in real life applications might arise if there are timing issues, such as the case in which certain routes cannot be serviced due to timing or scheduling conflicts, or constraints, such as a limited period of time. The heuristics described in this article ignore any such problems that arise due to application constraints. History The URPP was first introduced in 1974 and was proven to be an NP-hard problem by Lenstra and Kan. The UCARP can be derived from the URPP, and thus is NP-hard as well. In 1981, another pair of computer scientists, Golden and Wong, managed to prove that even deriving a .5 approximation to the URPP was NP-hard. In 2000, Dror published a book describing different arc routing problems. Heuristics and algorithms Most algorithms require a pre-processing of the graph, which simplifies the initial graph by removing all edges that are not in the shortest path between 2 required edges. Another simplification that the pre- processing adds is that it transforms the shortest path between 2 required edges into a single, non-required edge, regardless of the number of edges in the path, provided that there were no required edges in the path. Once the pre-processing is done, the problem can be generalized into a convex hull problem, with the edges being the points of the hull. The convex hull problem can be solved through linear programming or through convex hull algorithms, but the process of finding the convex hull is an exponential problem. Methods of solving the URPP after the pre-processing is done consist of the cutting plane algorithm and the branch & cut methodology. http://www.gerad.ca/~alainh/Trends.pdf Notes External links * Arc Routing Problems Search page at Lancaster University * Trends in Arc Routing References Category:Routing algorithms Category:Travelling salesman problem ","title":"Arc routing"},{"id":"14040367","text":"In enzymology, a 2,4-dichlorobenzoyl-CoA reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA + NADP+ \\\\+ HCl \\\\rightleftharpoons 2,4-dichlorobenzoyl-CoA + NADPH + H+ The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA, NADP+, and HCl, whereas its 3 products are 2,4-dichlorobenzoyl-CoA, NADPH, and H+.

Langlois attended the √âcole Nationale des Chartes and earned a doctorate in history in 1887. He taught at the University of Douai before moving to the Sorbonne. He was director of the National Archives of France from 1913 to 1929. Langlois was a leader in use of the historical method, which taught a scientific form of studying history. His \\"Manual of Historical Bibliography\\" was a fundamental manual on how bibliographic methods, which went along with his studies of the historical method. His 1897 work Introduction aux √©tudes historiques, written with Charles Seignobos, is considered one of the first comprehensive manuals discussing the use of scientific techniques in historical research.Seeing History  Langlois et Seignobos The \\"Introduction to the Study of History\\" takes a very detailed view at finding a way to make history as accurate of a study as the sciences. The basis of their method is the all history comes from facts retrieved from first hand documents. These facts are then viewed by the historian from many different perspectives, allowing for an unbiased approach at history. By using methods, such as external and internal criticism, the historian is able to see both the reader and authors perspective on a piece of history. In order to get a completely accurate history, these facts must be sorted into categories into groups to allow for easy research. To both of these men, the goal of history was to make it a learnable subject for anyone so that it may be passed down.The Project Gutenberg  The Introduction to the Study of History To emphasize the importance of primary sources, Seignobos and Langlois in their handbook coined the famous maxime \\"L'histoire se fait avec des documents\\". His collaborator on \\"Introduction to the Study of History\\", Charles Seignobos was also a lecturer in Sorbonne in 1881. Born in Lamastre, France, Seignobos came from a Protestant family and advocated systematic and methodical approach to the study of history. His books are widely used in schools throughout France. His work \\"The Evolution of the French People\\" was in an important work that traced the history of the French people, rather than its leaders. Not an entire history of France, this book focused on the conditions of life and institutions that made up life in France. It was also another example of his use of the historical method, as it attempts to explain certain conditions, rather than concentrating solely on individual characters.Catherine Phillips, \\"The evolution of the french people\\", \\"The Journal of Modern History\\", vol. 5, no. 2, Jun. 1933.

In 1973, the corporation relocated to Young America, Minnesota, and took on the name of the town. In June 2015, the company renamed itself, YA.  Locations  YA is headquartered in Minneapolis. Additionally it has a Contact Center in Chatham-Kent, Canada. In April 2008, YA announced the scheduled closure of the call center in Thunder Bay, ON, transferring all call handling services to the Chatham-Kent center. In June 2015, YA moved out of their Norwood Young America, MN and Edina, MN offices to the Lumber Exchange building in downtown Minneapolis.  Criticism  On November 7, 2005, officials in Massachusetts filed suit against Young America demanding that they submit an audit for $43 million in uncashed rebate checks. Young America answered, saying that they keep the money in return for charging lower fees to their clients. They stated that it is easier for Young America to keep the money and charge lower fees, rather than sending the money back to the clients and in return having it returned to them as part of the fees. In response to questions from Business Week, the CEO stated \\"Young America receives the same fees whether a submission is valid or invalid.\\" Massachusetts officials characterized the check retention as a conflict of interest nonetheless. A similar suit was filed in Iowa in 2006, with officials again demanding an audit for money the corporation is supposedly withholding from the uncashed rebate checks.Iowa Sues To Reclaim Rebate Money Strict guidelines for rebate submissions are intended in part to combat fraudulent submissions. As of 2005, the corporation supposedly had over 10,000 addresses that they monitor for bogus submissions. As of February 12, 2010, the lawsuit against Young America Corporation was dropped, as the retailers in question were held liable under Iowa state law.

Function  The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, which also contains TNFRSF1B. This protein is one of the major receptors for the tumor necrosis factor-alpha. This receptor can activate the transcription factor NF-Œ∫B, mediate apoptosis, and function as a regulator of inflammation. Antiapoptotic protein BCL2-associated athanogene 4 (BAG4/SODD) and adaptor proteins TRADD and TRAF2 have been shown to interact with this receptor, and thus play regulatory roles in the signal transduction mediated by the receptor.  Clinical significance  Germline mutations of the extracellular domains of this receptor were found to be associated with the human genetic disorder called tumor necrosis factor associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) or periodic fever syndrome. Impaired receptor clearance is thought to be a mechanism of the disease. Mutations in the TNFRSF1A gene are associated with elevated risk of multiple sclerosis. Serum levels of TNFRSF1A are elevated in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and high levels are associated with more severe psychotic symptoms. High serum levels are also associated with cognitive impairment and dementia.  Interactions  TNFRSF1A has been shown to interact with: * BAG4, * CASP10, * FADD, * IKK2, * JAK1, * JAK2, * PIP4K2B, * PSMD2, * RIPK1, * SUMO1, * TRADD * TRAF2, * TRPC4AP, * TNF, and * UBE2I.

Originally the service only allowed 10 voicemail messages in the main inbox at a time, and it gave the notice \\"Please leave a message for this Privatephone.com subscriber after the tone\\"; however, this was later changed to just \\"Please leave a message after the tone\\". On February 19, 2008, PrivatePhone ended its service. Features * During spring through summer 2007, the 10 minutes per call, 10 calls per month limit on the call-back feature was not working and allowed subscribers to make unlimited calls for an unlimited amount of time. However this limit was fixed after the summer of 2007. * Users could block callers that block their caller ID using the call log; call would appear as \\"Blocked Caller ID\\" followed by the date they were blocked. * Around November 2007, whenever a PrivatePhone user used the caller return or Gotta Go Call feature, the full name that was entered when registering the account showed up on the Caller ID Name of certain telephone providers (mostly VOIP Phone providers such as Time Warner's Digital Phone Service). Previously it either showed \\"Out of Area\\", \\"Name Unavailable\\" or \\"*State* Call\\" (replacing *State* with the state the phone number originated from) as the Caller ID Name. This new addition proved that the data was directly from PrivatePhone, because using a service such as Jajah to connect a PrivatePhone number to a landline phone number would display the Caller ID \\"Out of Area\\", \\"Name Unavailable\\" or \\"*State* Call\\" as before. = Gotta Go Call = The \\"Gotta Go Call\\" feature was one of Netzero's unique features that was used to schedule a call to your phone with an automated message that could be used to give one an excuse to leave an uncomfortable social situation. When users scheduled a \\"Gotta Go Call\\", they received a call from the number 1-800-991-9984. = Changes to features since launch = * Changed the voicemail message limit from 10 to 10,000 messages (500 per day) * Added call- back feature (Only 10 minutes per call and 10 calls per month) * Added \\"Gotta Go Call\\" * Changed notice after greeting from \\"Please leave a message for this Privatephone.com subscriber after the tone.\\" to \\"Please leave a message after the tone\\".  Limitations Like any other free service, there were limits on what one could do with PrivatePhone, including: * Messages could only be 2 minutes or shorter * The call-back feature was only 10 minutes per call and 10 calls per month * Users could not pick a Caller ID Name * Users could not use call forwarding * Users could not change their phone number * The greeting could only be 45 seconds or less * Users had to keep their account active by either calling their number periodically or logging into their web mail on the NetZero web site. * Users could pick any state in the US for a phone number except Alaska and Hawaii. * The \\"Gotta Go Call\\" feature stopped working when the call-back feature went out. The feature would call but would not have the \\"Hey! What's up? I was just wondering, do you want to come over?\\" message; instead it would say nothing.  Advertising and promotion  In late 2006, PrivatePhone began making promotional videos showing scenarios of people who needed PrivatePhone and posted them on their web site to show people why they should sign up. In early 2007, Netzero began advertising Netzero Voice and PrivatePhone at Best Buy by making special PrivatePhone CDs which included the videos featured on the web site and a phone number (1-866-755-7055) where people could sign up by telephone if they called with a mobile phone (so that people could receive their account information by text message). =PrivatePhone promotional videos= These are three promotional videos that were made for PrivatePhone which include different scenarios in which the necessity of PrivatePhone is shown, then a professor comes on and gives a short explanation on how the service is free (no contracts to sign, no credit card required and nothing extra to buy) and all incoming calls go right to voicemail that you can check online or on the phone and how PrivatePhone could have helped the person in the scenario. Each video was produced and animated by 23D Films and were directed by Ben Ceccarelli. Jenny This video shows a scenario with a woman who posted her resume online and her resume has her cell phone number and while working for her job she answered calls from three prospective employers right in front of the one she's working for. The professor explains that PrivatePhone can help you stay on top of job prospects without jeopardizing the one you have. Jane and Dick Dick and Jane meet each other in a bar and Jane thinks Dick is attractive and they have a great conversation together. Jane gives Dick her cell phone number and hope to hear from Dick again, and she does again, and again, and again, and again. The professor explains that you can use PrivatePhone to connect with people without use your home or cell phone numbers. Bob Bob likes to shop online and gave out his home number while shopping. It was promptly handed to telemarketers. Bob got himself a one-time deal, but Bob continues to pay a mealtime cost. The professor explains that you can use PrivatePhone to give your number out when you shop and all future calls from retailers go straight to voicemail that one can check quickly over the phone. Discontinuation PrivatePhone originally announced that on December 31, 2007, they would be ending their service, but in January they extended the closure date to February 19, 2008. Though users were not able to keep the service, PrivatePhone had allowed existing users to move their PrivatePhone numbers to Packet8 for a fee. At that time, new signups were no longer accepted, and PrivatePhone sent a message to all of its users on January 16, 2008 informing them about its discontinuation. Despite the service ending on February 19, 2008, NetZero still gave existing users the opportunity to keep their number.

Allowing the Tigers to play their home games at the new venue was a requirement for the funding the new facility received from the State of Tennessee. After the move, Hale fell into a state of disrepair. History The facility was named for William J. Hale, who served as TSU's first president.

Between Beekman Street and Spruce Street, in front of New York Downtown Hospital, William Street is a pedestrian-only street.  History  View of the northeast corner of William and Wall streets. The house to the far right became City Bank of New York's first home at 38 Wall Street, later re-numbered as ‚Ññ52. (Painting by Archibald Robertson, c. 1798) It is one of the oldest streets in Manhattan and can be seen in the 1660 Castello Plan of New Amsterdam. It was originally called King Street, but was later renamed William after Willem Beekman who arrived in New Amsterdam in 1647 as a fellow passenger of Peter Stuyvesant. Beekman got his start as a Dutch West India Company clerk and later served nine terms as mayor of the young port city. The buildings on South William Street 13-23 were reconstructed in the Dutch revival style by architect C. P. H. Gilbert and later Edward L. Tilton in the early 1900s, evoking New Amsterdam with the use of red brick as building material and the features of stepped gables. The area was declared a historic district in 1996 by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission.

The property is nationally significant as the childhood home of Thorstein B. Veblen (1857-1929), an economist, social scientist, and critic of American culture probably best known for The Theory of the Leisure Class, published in 1899. and Description and history The Veblen farmstead stands east of Nerstrand in far eastern Rice County, off Goodhue Avenue north of Minnesota State Highway 246. Now reduced to , the property includes a house, chicken coop, granary, and barn with attached milking shed. The house, granary, and barn, were all built by Thomas Veblen, in the 1870s and 1880s. The house is a two-story frame structure, with a side gable roof, two chimneys, and clapboard siding. A single-story porch extends across the front, supported by square posts, with a balcony above. The granary is a small two-story clapboarded frame building, measuring about . The barn is two stories, and has a gabled roof. Thorstein Veblen, born in Wisconsin in 1857, lived on this farm (homesteaded by his parents) as a youth and returned often as an adult, due in part to his inability to land a job, despite college degrees. The product of an austere agrarian upbringing, Veblen has often been called one of America's most creative and original thinkers. He coined the term \\"conspicuous consumption.\\" The property's simple vernacular styling illustrates early influences on Veblen's life as the son of immigrants, growing up in a tightly knit Norwegian-American community. His book, Theory of the Leisure Class is distinguished by economic, social, and literary scholars. The Veblens sold the property in 1893 and it continued to be an active farm until 1970, when the buildings fell into disrepair. The house has now been meticulously restored and the Preservation Alliance of Minnesota holds a preservation easement on the property.

C.37&A-1960; A punch bowl is a bowl, often large and wide, in which the drink punch is served.The Language of Drink Graham and Sue Edwards 1988, Alan Sutton Publishing Origins The word punch is a loanword from Hindi. The original drink was named paantsch, which is Hindi for \\"five\\", and the drink was made from five different ingredients: spirit, sugar, lemon, water or tea and spices. The drink was brought back from India to England by the sailors and employees of the British East India Company in the early seventeenth century, and from there it was introduced into other European countries. Punch bowls Baccarat manufactory (France) towards 1830 Punch quickly became a popular drink. It was served in punch bowls, usually ceramic or silver, which were often elaborately decorated. Punch bowls sometimes had lids or were supported on a stand; other accessories such as a serving ladle and cups in which to serve the drink sometimes accompanied the punch bowl. Punch bowls were often painted with inscriptions or were used for testimonial purposes: the first successful whaling voyage from Liverpool was commemorated by a punch bowl presented by the owners of the ship to its captain. The ubiquity of the punch bowl as a household item is illustrated in this 1832 quote: > The punch-bowl was an indespensible vessel in every house above the humblest > class. And there were many kindly recollections connected with it, it being > very frequently given as a present. No young married couple ever thought of > buying a punch-bowl; it was always presented to them by a near-relative. A glass punch bowl with serving ladle. Occasionally less likely vessels were used as punch bowls: > On the 15th October 1694 Admiral Edward Russell, then commanding the > Mediterranean fleet, gave a grand entertainment at Alicante. The tables were > laid under the shade of orange-trees, in four garden-walks meeting in a > common centre, at a marble fountain, which last, for the occasion, was > converted into a Titanic punch-bowl.

Particular punch bowls The Liscum Bowl set on display, 2nd Infantry Division Museum, Korea *Jesus College, Oxford owns a large silver-gilt punch bowl, presented by Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn in 1732. The bowl, which weighs more than and holds , was used at a dinner held in the Radcliffe Camera in 1814, to celebrate what was supposed to be the final defeat of Napoleon. Those present at the dinner included the Tsar of Russia, the King of Prussia, Bl√ºcher, Metternich, the Prince Regent, the Duke of York and the Duke of Wellington. There is a college tradition that the bowl will be presented to anyone who can meet two challenges. The first is to put arms around the bowl at its widest point; the second is to drain the bowl of strong punch. The bowl measures at its widest point, and so the first challenge has only been accomplished rarely; the second challenge has not been met. *The Stanley Cup is frequently described as a punch bowl. *The Sydney punchbowls are made of Chinese porcelain and depict rare scenes of early Sydney. * The Liscum Bowl set is made from of sterling silver gifted to the United States Army from China during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900. It is the most prized possession of the 9th Infantry Regiment and worth upwards of $2.5 million. Other uses At times, punch bowls were used as baptismal fonts in dissenting families. The American poet Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote the poem On Lending a Punch-bowl about an old silver punch bowl. In English usage, large, bowl-shaped landscape features (often the head of combes or valleys) were occasionally given the name punch bowl, such as the Devil's Punch Bowl in Surrey or Punchbowl Crater (\\"The Punchbowl\\") on the island of Oahu in Hawaii.

The famous kart came to be known worldwide, with videos spawning all over the web. The Gixxer Kart has a very impressive power-to- weight ratio. Weighing in at , with an average driver the kart has to push only 4 pounds per horsepower. By comparison, it has a better power-to-weight ratio than a Mclaren F1. After the birth of the shifter kart in 2002, many people decided to build their own motorcycle powered karts. Anything from a Honda CBR to a Yamaha R1 engine is used. Motorcycle powered karts, such as the Gixxer Kart, should only be driven on a closed circuit race track by professional drivers. With no protection such as seatbelt or Safety cage, it can be extremely dangerous. With an acceleration of 0‚Äì100 km/h in under 3 seconds, and a top speed depending on gearing, usually 200 km/h (120 mph), the kart is extremely quick and requires adequate stopping power. The Top Speed is limited by the tires. The Donor kart used for the original conversion had front disc brakes, however, karts with only one rear disc have been used by other builders. Karts are usually stretched to fit the large 4-cylinder power plant, and solid mounts are usually welded in. Because the tires on a race kart are usually a small diameter, much of the power supplied by the motorcycle engine does not go to the ground, therefore it is unlikely to bend the chassis or break engine mounts if the kart is built strong. Karts are usually made of Cromoly tubing, therefore it is extremely important that Cromoly tubing be used to extend the chassis and proper welding is a must. Built by Achim Korden Germany 2002/10.

The OSP is not a licence, but rather a covenant not to sue. It promises protection but does not grant any rights. The OSP is limited to implementations to the extent that they conform to those specifications. This allows for conformance to be partial. So if an implementation follows the specification for some aspects, and deviates in other aspects, then the Covenant Not to Sue applies only to the implementation's aspects which follow the specification. Relations with free software / open source projects The protections granted by the OSP are independent to the licence of implementations. There is disagreement as to whether the conditions of the OSP can be fulfilled by free software / open source projects, and whether they thus gain any protection from the OSP. An article in Cover Pages quotes Lawrence Rosen, an attorney and lecturer at Stanford Law School, as saying, > \\"I'm pleased that this OSP is compatible with free and open-source > licenses.\\" GNU/Linux vendor Red Hat's stance, as communicated by lawyer Mark Webbink in 2006, is: > \\"Red Hat believes that the text of the OSP gives sufficient flexibility to > implement the listed specifications in software licensed under free and > open-source licenses. We commend Microsoft‚Äôs efforts to reach out to > representatives from the open source community and solicit their feedback on > this text, and Microsoft's willingness to make modifications in response to > our comments.\\" Standards lawyer Andy Updegrove said in 2006 the Open Specification Promise was > \\"what I consider to be a highly desirable tool for facilitating the > implementation of open standards, in particular where those standards are of > interest to the open source community.\\" However, the Software Freedom Law Center, a law firm for free software and open source software, has warned of problems with the OSP for use in free software / open source software projects. In a published analysis of the promise it states that > \\"...it permits implementation under free software licenses so long as the > resulting code isn't used freely.\\" Their analysis warned of a possible inconsistency with GPL. This applies specifically to the patent promise scope being limited to conforming implementations of covered specifications only. Effectively when an implementer owns a patent and builds that patent technology in GPL3 licensed code, the implementer grants those first party patent rights downline to all re-users of that code. See section 11 for patents. When the code is reused, the OSP only applies as long as the reuse of that code is limited to implementing the covered specifications. Other patent promises with similar limitations include IBM's Interoperability Specifications Pledge (ISP) and Sun Microsystems' OpenDocument Patent Statement. This means, for example, that use of the required Sun patented StarOffice-related technology for OpenDocument should be protected by the Sun Covenant, but reuse of the code with the patented technology for non-OpenDocument implementations is no longer protected by the related Sun covenant. For this reason the SFLC has stated: > \\"The OSP cannot be relied upon by GPL developers for their implementations > not because its provisions conflict with GPL, but because it does not > provide the freedom that the GPL requires.\\" The SFLC specifically point out: * new versions of listed specifications could be issued at any time by Microsoft, and be excluded from the OSP. * any code resulting from an implementation of one of the covered specifications could not safely be used outside the very limited field of use defined by Microsoft in the OSP. The Microsoft OSP itself mentions the GPL in two of its FAQs. In one it says, > \\"we can‚Äôt give anyone a legal opinion about how our language relates to the > GPL or other OSS licenses\\". In another, it specifically only mentions the \\"developers, distributors, and users of Covered Implementations\\", so excluding downstream developers, distributors, and users of code later derived from these \\"Covered Implementations\\" and it specifically does not mention which version of the GPL is addressed, leading some commentators to conclude that the current GPLv3 may be excluded. > Q: I am a developer/distributor/user of software that is licensed under the > GPL, does the Open Specification Promise apply to me? > A: Absolutely, yes.

He held claims to both the World Middleweight Title as well as the World Heavyweight Title. He was the second man in history to hold the World's Light Heavyweight title, defeating the first Light Heavyweight Champion, Jack Root, by KO after 12 rounds. Legacy George Gardner's name is often misspelled \\"George Gardiner\\", which was an alias although some believe it was the correct spelling. He signed his name \\"George Gardner\\", though several newspapers of his era spelled his name \\"George Gardiner\\". However, his brother, Jimmy Gardner, signed his name \\"Jimmy Gardiner\\" when handing out autographs. George Gardner is unfortunately most remembered as the 26-year-old champion who lost his title to the 41-year-old Bob Fitzsimmons after a questionable 20 round decision on points. The decision made Fitzsimmons a legend, as it made him the first triple title division champion in boxing history. Background Gardner was born on March 17, 1877 at County Clare, Ireland on St. Patrick's Day. He was believed to have been the son of an Irish prizefighter and came from poverty. George and his brothers, Billy and Jimmy Gardner, were each recognized as accomplished boxers in their era. Professional career Gardner began his career in 1897 when he was 20 years old. He was almost six feet tall and weighed between 150‚Äì175 pounds during his career. He won several fights in the New England area, being noted in newspapers as the \\"Middleweight Champion of New England\\". Middleweight champion of the World Gardner was the top middleweight contender in 1901 and claimed the World's Middleweight Title that year. He defeated Frank Craig, the Colored Middleweight Champion at London, England, and newspapers declared that Gardner \\"secured the World Middleweight Title\\". Afterwards, Gardner challenged Tommy Ryan for the title, but Ryan declined although Gardner was the number one contender for the title. Gardner first claimed the world middleweight title on August 30, 1901 at the Mechanic's Pavilion in San Francisco after knocking out Kid Carter in a fight billed as the \\"Middleweight Championship of the World\\". He then defeated Barbados Joe Walcott, the Welterweight Champion of the World, in a 20 round rematch in 1902. On August 18, 1902, Gardiner TKO'd the undefeated Jack Root in 17 rounds at Salt Lake, City, in a close fight billed as both the light heavyweight and middleweight championship of the world. Both fighters weighed in at 165 pounds. On October 31, 1902, Gardner fought 20 rounds with Jack Johnson, the first African American to hold the World's Heavyweight Title. Gardner weighed in at 155 while Johnson at held a 30 pound weight advantage at 185. Johnson won on points by knocking Gardner down twice in the 8th and 14th rounds. Light heavyweight champion of the World Gardner was a contender for the newly created World's Light Heavyweight Title in 1903, weighing about 170 pounds. On April 6, 1903, Gardner fought Peter Maher, the Irish Heavyweight Champion, considered to be the most dangerous hitter of his era. Gardner knocked out Maher in round one and then defeated Marvin Hart by TKO after 12 rounds. On July 4, 1903, at Ontario, Canada, at the International Athletic Club, after 12 rounds of fighting, George Gardner knocked out Jack Root for the Light - Heavyweight Championship of the World. He was the first Irish-American to hold the title and the first undisputed champion to hold the title. Most records state that Root was the first champion of the division, but others, including George Gardner, had claimed the title before. The Root - Gardner fight was the first Light-Heavyweight Title fight caught on film. Newspapers reported that Gardner knocked Root down seven times. George Gardner defended his title later that year on November 25, 1903 at San Francisco, California, against Bob Fitzsimmons, who had killed two men in the ring and was the former Middleweight and Heavyweight Champion. After a questionable 20 round decision on points, Fitzsimmons knocked the young champion down twice and gained a slight decision. After losing the title, George Gardner challenged Fitzsimmons to a rematch, but was denied a second chance at the title. Gardner was still a highly regarded contender for the Light Heavyweight Title, and was rated above Fitzsimmons. Nonetheless, Gardner set his sights on the World's Heavyweight Title. It was held by Marvin Hart, whom Gardner had defeated and drawn with before. Gardner challenged Marvin Hart for the Heavyweight Championship of the World, but again he was denied a title shot. Afterwards, his career faded with losses and draws against Jim Flynn, Al Kaufman, Terry Mustain, and Tony Ross. Gardner retired at age 32 in 1908 with a record of 44 wins, 32 by way of knockout, 12 losses, 7 draws, and 3 no contests. Gardner continued to box, but considered himself a \\"washed-up prize fighter\\". He was reputed to have fought in over 300 battles. Onenewspaper source noted that Gardner \\"had drawn from their seats in applause more fight fans than any other light-heavyweight\\". Later life Gardner opened a saloon in Chicago, and married Margaret Smith of South Bend, Indiana. He fathered a son in 1905, who also became a professional boxer in the Light Heavyweight division under the name, \\"Morgan Gardiner\\". Gardner's brother, Jimmy Gardner, claimed the World's Welterweight Title in 1908, making the Gardner brothers the first Irish American siblings in world history to hold world titles. George Gardner was pictured in the summer of 1930 on the front of \\"Self Defense Quarterly\\". Gardner was once ranked the #1 fighter in the world and he is considered one of the top fighters of all time, as well as one of the top light-heavyweights of all time. Gardner died at age 77 on July 10, 1954 in Chicago, Illinois. Four ex-champions were pallbearers at his funeral.

Biography Abernethy was born in Aberdeen to George Abernethy and Isabella Johnston. In 1823, the family moved to South Wales, where his father managed the Dowlais Ironworks, and in 1826 moved to Southwark in London, because his father obtained a job as a foundry manager. While there, he watched the construction of London Bridge. In 1827, he was sent with his brothers to Cotherstone Boarding School in the North Riding of Yorkshire, but was removed by his uncle, Revd. John Abernethy, two years later, when he discovered the awful conditions at the school. His uncle took him to London and then to Haddington, East Lothian where he spent two years at the Grammar School. He then went to work under his father, who was working on the construction of the Eastern Dock, which was part of the London Docks complex. A lock of the Aire and Calder Navigation His next move with his father was in 1832 to Herne Bay, where a timber pier was being constructed. However, he sailed to Sweden in 1833, to lay out new roads for a manganese mine near J√∂nk√∂ping which a friend had bought. He spent much of his spare time sketching the architecture and scenery of the area, until he was recalled to England in 1835 by his father, to assist on the Start Point lighthouse project in Devon. This appears to be the last time he worked with his father, as he moved to Goole in 1836, to work with George Leather on the construction of the steamship dock and lock which connected the Aire and Calder Navigation to the Humber. Despite nearly drowning when a cofferdam collapsed, he devoted most of the rest of his career to marine engineering. He worked on improvements to the Aire and Calder between Wakefield and Methley until 1838, and then became the resident engineer for the North Midland Railway, working under George Stephenson. However, he resigned after 18 months, to become the engineer for the Aberdeen Harbour Trust. =Marine engineering= James Abernethy Aberdeen had a tidal harbour at the time Abernethy arrived, and he spent a year dredging and building embankments to improve the access channel. In the following year, a competition was held for the design of an enclosed dock, and his design was selected. An Act of Parliament was obtained to implement the design, but Abernethy first had to convince an independent assessor in London of its soundness. The meeting was inconclusive, but the chairman of the Harbour Trustees was satisfied, and tenders were sought for construction. The lowest tenderer was given the contract, but could not complete it, and Abernethy took over after a year, using direct labour to finish the work. When it was built, the entrance lock was the largest in Britain, measuring , with a navigable depth of at high water. The Preliminary Enquiries Act was passed to ensure that major new schemes were competently assessed before being implemented, and Abernethy worked as one of its Surveying Officers for eight years until 1852. During this time he held public enquiries into schemes for improvements to the River Clyde, the River Tyne and the River Ribble, and for the construction of docks at Belfast, Birkenhead, Glasgow, Liverpool and Newcastle upon Tyne. In addition to obtaining skills in the conduct of such meetings, he met with the leading engineers of the time, and learned the best practices for marine engineering. He acted as a consultant to the Swansea Harbour Trustees from 1847, and became their Engineer-in-chief in 1849, but continued to live in Aberdeen until 1851, when he moved to Birkenhead, where he held the same post as well. He produced plans for Birkenhead Docks, as he was not convinced that the rival plans, produced by James Rendel, were practicable. Both plans were assessed by Admiral Sir Francis Beaufort and Robert Stephenson, who found in favour of Rendel. Following a takeover by Liverpool Corporation in 1855, Rendel's plans were implemented, but the sluices failed soon after the docks were completed in 1864. A new Act of Parliament obtained in 1866 authorised the rebuilding of the docks to Abernethy's plans. Throughout this period he was active with other schemes as well, including a shipyard for Messrs. Laird on the River Mersey. He produced plans for improvements to the Irish Bann Navigation in 1851, and for the Dean Forest, Monmouth, Usk and Pontypool Railway in the following two years. =Consulting engineer= He set up an office in London in 1853, and acted as consulting engineer for a large number of schemes, while still maintaining his regular oversight of the docks at Cardiff, Fraserburgh, Newport and Swansea. He expanded his work to include overseas projects in 1862, although a number of his recommendations were not implemented, and the scheme that was eventually built at Alexandria harbour was rather less satisfactory than his own design. Major harbour schemes included those at Silloth, Portpatrick, Falmouth, Port Natal in South Africa, Watchet, Boston and the Alexandra Dock at Kingston upon Hull. He also worked on the Swansea and Neath Railway between 1862 and 1863, the Turin and Savona Railway in Italy, which was long and included a tunnel, and the Hayling Island Railway. Between 1862 and 1867, he was responsible for the Grand Canal Cavour, a irrigation canal, which entailed him visiting Italy every four months. He used the opportunity this presented to visit Venice several times. In 1883, he reported on the three rival schemes for the Manchester Ship Canal, finding in favour of the one by Sir Edward Leader Williams. He acted as consulting engineer, visiting the site every month between 1885 and 1893, while Williams was Engineer-in-chief. His last major scheme overseas was the reclamation of Lake Aboukir in Egypt, between 1888 and 1889, although his regular dock work in Britain continued until his death, and work on the Bute Dock at Cardiff was still in progress when he died. It was completed later that year. Public offices He became a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1844, and was its president between December 1880 and December 1881. Although he only presented a single paper to it, he contributed to the discussions on a wide range of subjects, He was also made a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and sat on two Royal Commissions. The first considered Metropolitan Sewage Discharge, and was held in 1882, while the second was held in 1889, and looked at Irish Public Works.

The platform was designed by British engineering firm SLP Engineering Limited. The platform also produces the wells Kab 103 and Kab 121. This platform was the site of the accident which eventually led to the death of 22 workers. Pemex would contract two independent studies and one by itself and in an exercise of transparency, post the reports on its website.Seguimiento plataforma Usumacinta On October 31, 2008, PEMEX released the result of the independent studies of the accident.PEMEX da a conocer los resultados de la investigaci√≥n interna sobre el accidente en la plataforma Usumacinta, en el Golfo de M√©xico Usumacinta Platform and Kab 101(under the derrick) the day after the accident. Usumacinta accident timeline October 21, 2007: The Jackup rig Usumacinta is moved to the location of Kab 101 to prepare for work on the well Kab 103. October 23, 2007, 0700: The arrival of Cold Front No. 4 with winds exceeding causes all personnel on the rig to cease operations. 08:00 ‚Äì 11:00: The Usumacinta begins moving with the seas, because its ballast and anchor points have not been properly set. 11:30: The Usumacinta's auxiliary cover below its cantilever collides with the wellhead Kab 121, which begins leaking oil and gas. 11:40 ‚Äì 13:55: The crew of the Usumacinta attempts to close the sub- surface storm valves for both Kab 101 and the leaking Kab 121, to prevent further danger to the people on board the platform. This is only temporarily successful at stopping the leak from Kab 121. 15:30: The storm valves on Kab 121 fail and hydrogen sulfide is detected, prompting the order to evacuate the platform. 15:45: All 73 people from the platform were accounted for in the two lifeboats, and were wearing life jackets. Lifeboat #1 Around 16:13 the lifeboat began to fill with water. This eventually led to the lifeboat crew becoming panicked and attempted to leave the lifeboat, in an attempt to board the M/V Morrison Tide. The lifeboat eventually capsized around 17:28, and a collision between the two lifeboats left most of Lifeboat #1's occupants drifting in the water. Two crew members from the Morrison Tide were lost in rescue operations; one died from injuries and another was lost at sea. Some survivors were also rescued by the M/V Isla Del Torro. The lifeboat eventually drifted ashore east of Nuevo Campechito with nobody on board. Lifeboat #2 This lifeboat started out with poor visibility due to the oil from the leaking well Kab 121. The hatches were opened so the helmsman could see, and to allow for ventilation due to several people complaining of dizziness inside. At 17:42 the lifeboat was struck by a huge wave, and overturned. 33 to 35 people were trapped and had to fight to escape the boat. The next day Lifeboat #2 reached the shore west of Nuevo Progreso upside down, with 12 survivors on top, and one survivor and four bodies inside.Relaci√≥n de personal de la plataforma Usumacinta Usumacinta and Kab 101 being sprayed by Caballo de Mar Well control and aftermath An early estimate of the oil leak from Kab 121 was of light crude. In December 2007 Pemex estimated that of leaked oil were recovered with another 5000 completely lost. On November 13, during attempts to control the leaks resulting from the accident, the well Kab 121 ignited and was brought under control the same day. On the 20th of November, Kab 121 ignited again, this time the fire destroyed the remains of the Derrick and was controlled on December 3. Scrappers On August 4, 2008, another fire was extinguished on the Usumacinta. This fire is suspected to have been caused by scrappers attempting to steal from the abandoned rig. This blaze was extinguished by the ships ‚ÄúIsla Guadalupe‚Äù, ‚ÄúIsla Cozumel‚Äù, ‚ÄúPionero‚Äù, ‚ÄúConquistador‚Äù, and \\"Deep Endeavour\\".

It is formed by the damming of the West Branch Penobscot River, by dams built in 1835, 1903, and 1916. Mark Shanahan, \\"Searching for Thoreau\\", Portland Press Herald, 1997 It is approximately long and 1‚Äì4 miles wide, with a surface area of and a maximum depth of . It is the third-largest body of fresh water in Maine. The lake was named \\"goose place\\" by combining the call of the Canada goose schunk with auke (the Abenaki word for place) to form Chesuncook. Henry David Thoreau visited Chesuncook (village) and lake in 1853 and wrote about its beginnings in his book \\"The Maine Woods\\" Chesuncook Part 4; 'Ansell Smith's the oldest and principal clearing about this lake,...' Thoreau observed no geese on the lake during his visit.Thoreau, Henry David The Maine Woods Apollo edition (1966) Thomas Y. Crowell Company pp.162,414-416&423 The original lake was enlarged by construction of Ripogenus Dam in 1916 to cover Ripogenus Lake, Caribou Lake, and Moose Pond. The enlarged lake became less suitable for Lake trout because of fluctuating reservoir levels for generating hydroelectricity. The lake is on the Northern Forest Canoe Trail. In fiction In H.P. Lovecraft's horror short story The Thing on the Doorstep, the ill-fated Edward Derby found himself lost in the town of Chesuncook, \\"close to the wildest, deepest, and least explored forest belt in Maine.\\" Chesuncook Lake features in First Lensman by EE \\"Doc\\" Smith as a clandestine handover point for a shipment of illegal drugs. Chesuncook Village  Chesuncook Village is a small settlement located on the northwestern shore of Chesuncook Lake with a year-round population of approximately 10 people on this otherwise uninhabited lake. It is in an unorganized township in the heart of the east coast's largest unsettled logging forest and is considered to be the last wilderness area on the eastern seaboard of the United States. It is approximately 60 miles from the nearest towns of Greenville and Millinocket, Maine. It is completely off grid with no infrastructure. The only public land within the village is maintained by the state as a pasture and public boat launch/beach area. There is a non denominational meeting house which is used by seasonal churches, as a meeting place, and for foul weather refuge by those traveling through the area. =History= Chesuncook \\"Village\\" was settled in 1849 by Ansel A. Smith as a logging outfit. The historic Chesuncook Lake House Inn, built in 1864 is still in operation 150 years later by its current owners the Surprenant family.Chesuncook Lake House Inn-open as of 2017 Set on the shoreline of Chesuncook Lake and facing Mount Katahdin in the distance, the Lake House and its acreage are one of the few remaining North Woods \\"logging hotels\\" which at one time were built at intervals of every 14 miles (this was the average distance a man could walk in one day) through the logging regions in order to house and feed the logging industry as well as visiting travelers and sportsmen such as Henry David Thoreau. The rest of the village which is actually a 1920s subdivision that never really took off, supports a scattering of privately owned seasonal camps and a few permanent year-round residents. In 2003 Chesuncook Village celebrated the 150 year anniversary of the original publication of Henry David Thoreau's book \\"The Maine Woods\\".

They are signed to I Scream Records. They were the US representatives of the RALLY MTV reality TV series which aired on MTV Tres as well as MTV Latin America and MTV Brazil. History The band was formed by Lopez and Mackinnon in early 2005 as a hobby after spending years away from the music scene (Mackinnon played in The Vandals and Slapshot. Lopez was the singer of Friction Wheel). Their shared love of bands such as H√ºsker D√º, Black Flag and The Clash brought them together in an attempt to recapture the excitement and artistic integrity they felt was lacking in the music industry. By mid-2005 a self-titled EP was recorded and released by California label Long Beach Records. Soon after they recruited bass player/singer Jorge Gonzalez (Jorges, Volumen Cero, The Brand) and later, guitar player David Santos. In May 2006 they recorded Material Subversivo, their first full-length album with noted producer Darian Rundall (Pennywise, Yellowcard, Suicidal Tendencies) . Through touring, self-promotion and perseverance the band attracted local and national attention which led to highly coveted opening slots with Rancid and Flogging Molly. As a result, labels came calling and the band signed with I Scream Records in early 2007 which led to the release of ‚ÄúMaterial Subversivo‚Äù in May 2007.

The M80 Zolja is still produced in Serbia and in North Macedonia.http://www.yugoimport.com/en/proizvodi/m80-rbr-64-mm-light-anti- armour-rocket-launcher Description Constructed from fibre-reinforced plastics, the M80 Zolja is designed to be used by an individual against armoured fighting vehicles or fortifications. The M80 Zolja is a single-use recoilless weapon which is characterized by its simple operation and lightweight characteristics. The launcher and the container are incorporated into a single unit. The M80 Zolja is similar to the American M72 LAW in both appearance and performance. Launcher The M80 Zolja launcher is telescoping which is intended for easier transportation. The launchers consists of a forward and rear tube made of fibre-reinforced plastic, a firing mechanism, front and rear aiming sights, a carry handle, front and rear caps to keep debris out and a sling. Aimsight of 64mm M80 \\"Zolja\\" RPG launcher Aiming the M80 \\"Zolja\\" Rocket The 64mm anti-tank missile is located in the rear of the launcher. The missile consists of an explosive warhead, stabilizer wings and a solid fuel rocket. The M80's warhead has the potential to penetrate 300 mm of solid steel at a 90-degree angle. The warhead may be fitted with an impact and piezoelectric blasting mechanism. A self-destruct mechanism is also integrated into the rocket which ensures that the rockets self-destruct if the target is not hit within 4 to 6 seconds of flight. The rocket propellant is only fired while in the tube, which propels the rocket to a speed of 190 m/s. This speed ensures that the rocket reaches its 240 m range at a 2.5 meter target. Operation The launcher is held in both hands. The operator opens the covers on both ends of the launcher, grasping the forward tube piece firmly with his left hand the operator pulls the back tube outwards with a sharp, hard pull. If the launcher has been successfully cocked, the back piece will not slide in. The operator assumes a correct firing position, keeping in mind the backblast zone of the launcher, takes aim through the flip up sights and squeezes the trigger to fire the rocket. Afterwards the empty tube is disposed of. Use The M80 was widely used in the Yugoslav Wars and Insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia. Many units ended up in civilian hands and have been used in a number of violent incidents.http://www.javno.com/hr- svijet/mladi-srbin-zoljom-pokusao-ubiti-zeninu-obitelj_204817 http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/u-doboju-pomahnitali-nasilnik-zoljom- gadjao-suprugu-i-njene-roditelje/410193.aspx The weapon has also been used by organized crime; one such incident was a November 1999 assassination attempt in downtown Zagreb, when the projectile ricocheted off the target's armored car and killed an innocent bystander.http://www.aimpress.ch/dyn/pubs/archive/data/200103/10323-005-pubs- zag.htm Members of the Zemun Clan at one time considered using the M80 to attack the former Serbian Prime Minister Zoran ƒêinƒëiƒá's motorcade.http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/grcka-predala-srbiji-optuzenog- za-atentat-na-djindjica/247539.aspx http://sr.wikisource.org/sr- el/%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%9A%D0%B5_%D0%97%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%88%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%9B%D0%B0 Bosnian Serb mercenaries in Zaire used some M80s against Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo in 1997 during the first Congo War.

Rosenbloom won in a technical knockout 1:16 into the fourth round. Many reporters believed the young Godwin was two injured from his previous fight with Joe Knight to meet the reigning champion. Their suspicions were confirmed when he entered the ring with white tape near both eyes. Rosenbloom immediately took to hammering Godwin's injured eyes, though they bled badly. Godwin hit the mat from a left to the chin for a count of three, and then rose only to soon be knocked down for a four count.

Early life Andreas Latzko attended grammar school and high school in Budapest. After high school, he served in the Imperial and Royal Austria-Hungarian army as a one- year volunteer and was a reserve officer of the Ersatzheer. He then went to Berlin, where he first studied chemistry and then philosophy at the University of Berlin. Career beginnings Latzko wrote his first literary works in Hungarian. His first in German, a one-act play, was published in Berlin. He also worked as a journalist, traveling to Egypt, India, Ceylon and Java. World War I and its aftermath In August 1914, at the beginning of World War I, he returned to Egypt and served as an officer in the Imperial and Royal Wehrmacht of Austria-Hungary. With the beginning of the war between Italy and Austria-Hungary, he was sent to the front on the Isonzo River. He fell ill with malaria, but he was not sent away from the front until he suffered a severe shock from a heavy Italian artillery attack near Gorizia. After eight months in the hospital, he moved at the end of 1916 to the Swiss resort town of Davos for further recuperation and rehabilitation. While there he wrote six chapters of his book Men in War, which deals with the Great War at the River Isonzo front. In 1917, the book was published anonymously in Zurich by Rascher-Verlag. Karl Kraus wrote in his magazine Die Fackel, \\"This book is a scream and a relevant document about the Great War and humanity. Some people know the day is not so far off when the officials of Austria will be proud to be involved into the war by that book.\\" The book was a great success and translated into 19 languages. However, every country involved in the war banned it, and the army supreme command demoted Latzko. In 1918 the book was printed again in an edition of 33,000 copies. It was widely praised, with one critic describing the novel's theme of \\"disillusionment and an almost morbid sympathy with mental and physical suffering\\" as well as \\"a prevailing nihilistic tone\\". The New York Times said it was \\"a bitter attack upon the by- products of the Teutonic military idea.\\"Current Opinion. June 1918, Page 424. Vol LXIV, No. 6. While in Switzerland, Latzko met Romain Rolland and Stefan Zweig. Latzko wrote and published two more novels in 1918: The Judgement of Peace, about the lives of German soldiers on the Western Front, and The Wild Man. That same year, he wrote the text Women in War for the International Women‚Äôs Conference in Bern. Life in Germany With the end of the war in 1918, Latzko moved to Munich and followed the Bavarian republic of Gustav Landauer. He was expelled from Bavaria and moved to Salzburg, where he met Georg Friedrich Nicolai during the latter's visit to Stefan Zweig.

It has 400 years of history since the Ming Dynasty as a famous commercial street. The avenue starts at Bell Tower which is the core of the city and ends at West Gate (Chinese:Ë•øÈó® or Ximen in Chinese phonetic) which passes through the city wall. Origin The status that West Avenue has attributes greatly to a temple that cohered to the street. The name of the temple is called City God Temple. City God Temple hosts the most important god that protects the city, so this temple has had most influence on ordinary people. It became an important meeting place for religion, commercial and public affairs even 400 years ago. West Avenue benefits from this temple ever since its birth. Development After the founding of People‚Äôs Republic of China in 1949, West Avenue had kept its dominance status for almost 30 years. The City God Temple was actually occupied by small merchants and focal handcraft artists, and then a market was shaped spontaneously just in front of the temple. People from other parts of the city and even remote countries and villages came to this market. Then commercial spread out in West Avenue. It had the first department store ‚ÄúJianhua Department Store‚Äù of this city, and many traditional famous-brand stores. Decline But when a free market policy was carried out in 1980s, commercial feature of West Avenue was challenge by other districts and streets. Actually there are 4 major avenues indicating 4 directions in central Xi‚Äôan city. West Avenue leads to the industrial quarter of the city, South to the education and technology, North has provincial offices as perimeter, East connects to another important street in the city. When the-once-state-owed factories in the west were frustrated in a more open market in the 1980s and 1990s, the economy of that area was also fluctuated. So West Avenue with its stores was far behind others. Its road was narrow, houses were old. Revitalization In 2006, with the reconstruction of ‚ÄúTablet Gate‚Äù of City God Temple, the widening and reconstruction project of West Avenue came to an end. Giant shopping malls with ancient Chinese style replace the shabby, tiny stores. City officials have a grand ambitious to revitalize this street that can attract more tourists, attribute to the city‚Äôs financial and provide more jobs. However, the nature pattern of the city that accumulated in hundreds of years is wiped out in this area. Exaggerated ancient-style buildings decorate this street now. Maybe that can inspire citizens and commercials, but you can also find a more friendly and amiable environment just in the back streets that connects to West Avenue.

The station was planned from 1939 by Poplar Borough Council but construction only started in 1947 after the Second World War. It was decommissioned in 1984, and the site was redeveloped. History The station was built in stages between 1947 and 1956 on the site of the former East India Export Dock, itself originally the Brunswick Dock of the Blackwall Yard shipyard. The site was controversial due to both potential air pollution in a densely populated part of London, and to the implications of further concentrating generating capacity in an area that had been a strategic target in The Blitz. The building was a monumental brick structure with fluted concrete chimneys, similar to Gilbert Scott's design for Battersea Power Station. Its main building contractor was Peter Lind & Company with Redpath Brown & Company supplying the steelwork, Tileman and Company building the reinforced concrete chimneys and Marples, Ridgeway and Partners being the main civil engineering contractors. Metropolitan-Vickers supplied the six turbo-alternators and Clarke, Chapman & Company and John Brown & Company supplied the 11 boilers. A new concrete wharf with three Stothert & Pitt luffing cranes was built to land coal brought by colliers. The first phase of the station was supposed to be commissioned in 1948 but in fact did not start supplying electricity until 1952. The station was officially opened by British Electricity Authority (BEA) chairman Walter Citrine, 1st Baron Citrine in 1954 but was not completed until 1956. In 1957 the alternators were uprated to produce a total of 118 MW. The final configuration of the station was 4 x 55 MW generators and 2 x 60 MW hydrogen cooled generators. Eleven boilers were installed. The boilers were manufactured by Clarke, Chapman & Co. and by John Brown & Co. The maximum steam capacity of the boilers was 3,520,000 lb/hr (443 kg/s). Steam pressure and temperature at the turbine stop valves was 900 psi (62 bar) and 482¬∞C.CEGB Statistical Yearbook (various dates). CEGB, London. In 1958 Brunswick Wharf was used in an experiment ‚Äì Operation Chimney Plume ‚Äì by the CEGB to determine whether power station flue-gas plumes penetrated fog layers. On 4 December 1958 an aircraft flew above the low lying fog (750‚Äì800 feet) over London. Chemical were added to the power station boilers to colour the flue-gas plumes. It was found that the hot flue-gas plumes rose through and clear of the fog layer. Whereas the 'washed' and therefore cooler plumes from Battersea power station and Bankside power station were subsumed within the fog layer. The station was originally coal-fired, but the BEA's successor, the Central Electricity Generating Board, had it converted to oil in 1970‚Äì71. The conversion to oil included the first solid state furnace controls in the UK, installed by Associated British Combustion, of Portchester UK. Associated British Combustion was subsequently in financial trouble and was acquired by Combustion Engineering of USA.David Talbot onsite systems engineer for the project = Electricity output = Electricity output from Brunswick Wharf power station over the period 1954-1984 was as follows.CEGB Annual Report and Accounts, various years Brunswick Wharf annual electricity output GWh.{ \\"version\\": 2, \\"width\\": 850, \\"height\\": 250, \\"data\\": [ { \\"name\\": \\"table\\", \\"values\\": [ { \\"x\\": 1964, \\"y\\": 1759 }, { \\"x\\": 1965, \\"y\\": 1475 }, { \\"x\\": 1966, \\"y\\": 1126 }, { \\"x\\": 1967, \\"y\\": 1139 }, { \\"x\\": 1968, \\"y\\": 1239 }, { \\"x\\": 1969, \\"y\\": 1307 }, { \\"x\\": 1970, \\"y\\": 961 }, { \\"x\\": 1971, \\"y\\": 1321 }, { \\"x\\": 1972, \\"y\\": 1701 }, { \\"x\\": 1973, \\"y\\": 1448 }, { \\"x\\": 1974, \\"y\\": 1264 }, { \\"x\\": 1975, \\"y\\": 1069 }, { \\"x\\": 1976, \\"y\\": 382 }, { \\"x\\": 1977, \\"y\\": 361 }, { \\"x\\": 1978, \\"y\\": 506 }, { \\"x\\": 1979, \\"y\\": 494 }, { \\"x\\": 1980, \\"y\\": 408 }, { \\"x\\": 1981, \\"y\\": 343 }, { \\"x\\": 1982, \\"y\\": 209 }, { \\"x\\": 1983, \\"y\\": 172 }, { \\"x\\": 1984, \\"y\\": 14 }, { \\"x\\": 1961, \\"y\\": 1456 }, { \\"x\\": 1954, \\"y\\": 732 }, { \\"x\\": 1955, \\"y\\": 1195 }, { \\"x\\": 1956, \\"y\\": 1660 }, { \\"x\\": 1957, \\"y\\": 1746 }, { \\"x\\": 1958, \\"y\\": 1602 }, { \\"x\\": 1962, \\"y\\": 1572 }, { \\"x\\": 1963, \\"y\\": 1444 } ] } ], \\"scales\\": [ { \\"name\\": \\"x\\", \\"type\\": \\"ordinal\\", \\"range\\": \\"width\\", \\"zero\\": false, \\"domain\\": { \\"data\\": \\"table\\", \\"field\\": \\"x\\" } }, { \\"name\\": \\"y\\", \\"type\\": \\"linear\\", \\"range\\": \\"height\\", \\"nice\\": true, \\"domain\\": { \\"data\\": \\"table\\", \\"field\\": \\"y\\" } } ], \\"axes\\": [ { \\"type\\": \\"x\\", \\"scale\\": \\"x\\" }, { \\"type\\": \\"y\\", \\"scale\\": \\"y\\" } ], \\"marks\\": [ { \\"type\\": \\"rect\\", \\"from\\": { \\"data\\": \\"table\\" }, \\"properties\\": { \\"enter\\": { \\"x\\": { \\"scale\\": \\"x\\", \\"field\\": \\"x\\" }, \\"y\\": { \\"scale\\": \\"y\\", \\"field\\": \\"y\\" }, \\"y2\\": { \\"scale\\": \\"y\\", \\"value\\": 0 }, \\"fill\\": { \\"value\\": \\"steelblue\\" }, \\"width\\": { \\"scale\\": \\"x\\", \\"band\\": \\"true\\", \\"offset\\": -1 } } } } ] } = Closure = The CEGB planned to enlarge the station, but the 1973 oil crisis increased the price of oil, and the CEGB found it had surplus generating capacity.

The second son of Thomas FitzGerald, 2nd Earl of Kildare by his spouse Joan (d.1359), daughter of Richard de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster, he succeeded his brother Richard, 3rd Earl, who died aged 12 in 1329. Maurice, Earl of Kildare, suppressed the insurrection in 1339 of the O'Dempsies in Leinster; and in November 1346, with Lord Justice Bermingham, forced the O'Mores to submit and give hostages for their future good behaviour. In 1346 he was himself imprisoned due to suspicion about his loyalty to the Crown, but was soon released and restored to favour. On 26 January 1347 he was summoned by Writ signed at Eltham Palace to serve King Edward III at the siege of Calais where he proceeded in May with thirty men- at-arms and was subsequently made leader of the army, and knighted.\\"Fitzgerald, Maurice, 4th Earl of Kildare\\", Dictionary of National Biography, (Leslie Stephen ed.), Macmillan & Co., London, 1889 With various irregulars and foot-soldiers assigned to defend County Kildare against rebel Irish, the earl was appointed, on 14 September 1358, supervisor of the four commissioners for raising and collecting their pay from that county. On 30 March 1360 he was constituted Lord Justice of Ireland with an annual salary of ¬£500 sterling. He was made Custos of the realm again on 22 March 1371, and a third time on 16 February 1375, until the return of Sir William Windsor. In 1364 he headed a delegation of Irish nobles and officials to complain directly to King Edward III about the misgovernment of Ireland, and the corruption of certain officials, notably Thomas de Burley, the Lord Chancellor of Ireland. In 1378 he petitioned King Richard II that he had, at his request, accompanied the Lord Justice, James Butler, 2nd Earl of Ormond \\"in a certain amount of great hosting\\" of the O'Morchoes of Slewmargy (Sliabh Mairge), with numerous horsemen in his retinue, whereof six of his men were lost as well as four coats of mail and other armour. He asked for recompense, of which the King granted ¬£10 sterling from the Exchequer of Ireland on 21 May 1378. On 22 January 1377 he was summoned to the Parliament held at Castledermot; and on 11 September 1381 to that held at Trim; and on 29 April 1382 to that held at Dublin. He was, with Sir Philip Courtenay, the Lord Justice, active in imposing law and order in Leinster and Meath and elsewhere, and in resisting rebels all at his own expense. His reward came partly in the form of a grant, dated 20 April 1386, of the estate of Sir William de London in the counties of Kildare and Meath during the minority of his son and heir, John de London. On 5 August 1389 he was enfeoffed in the manors of Lucan, County Dublin, Kildrought (now Celbridge), and Kilmacredock, County Kildare, held from the Crown in capite for him and his heirs forever. On 29 May 1390 a Writ was issued to him to remove O'Connor, son of Dough O'Dempsie, the King's Irish enemy currently detained in Kildare Castle, to Dublin Castle for safer custody. He died at an advanced age in 1390, and was interred in the Church of the Holy Trinity, now Christchurch Cathedral, Dublin.

It is very clear that her father was Bartholomew Burghersh the elder. The reason we can be so certain is that her brother Henry's Inquisition Post Mortem was recorded in 1349. It records that he was the son of Bartholomew de Burghersh and that his heir was his brother Bartholomew, son of Bartholomew de Burghersh, aged 26 years and more.

Various letter suffixes were added to indicate model variation to suit local regulations, such the FS1-E for England, FS1P/DX NL and others. FS1-E UK model The FS1-E was the UK model. Machines registered in the UK from 1 August 1977 were restricted to a maximum of . =Design= Originally the FS1-E was built as a five-speed transmission light motorcycle. It was originally called the FS1. Due to the regulations in Europe, the FS1-E was downtuned with a four-speed transmission. The Yamaha FS1-E has a , single cylinder, two-stroke, air-cooled, rotary disc-valved engine with a four-speed gearbox. The FS1-E was the FS1 with the suffix E, which stood for England (differing from the models sold in other countries as the FS1-E had more cycle parts in common with other UK-imported Yamaha models). Yamaha introduced various improvements such as a front disc brake (FS1-E DX model) over the years, and later an autolube model with a two-stroke oil tank and oil pump, with no need to manually mix two-stroke oil into the fuel tank. About 200,000 were produced for the UK market. An award winning short film was produced in 2006 and is available entitled 'Fizzy Days' encompassing the bikes and the era. =Pedals= The FS1-E had the ability to be powered by pushbike type pedals since this was a legal requirement for registration as a moped in the United Kingdom and some other European countries at the time. The special pedal cranks allowed both pedals to be rotated forward so that the pedals would form motorcycle-style footrests in normal operation. To engage the pedals, the left-hand pedal crank could be rotated 180 degrees backwards and locked, and a drive gear engaged allowing the user to pedal. A short chain connected the pedal drive to the main engine- chain drive system. Pedalling was hard work for the rider: there was no freewheel and the pedal gearing was very low. The engine could be started with pedal drive engaged, causing the pedals to rotate under engine power when the bike was in gear. In practice, the cam and shaft arrangement to engage the pedals frequently seized (in normal operation, a rider would very rarely engage pedal-drive as it was less tiring to push than to pedal). The pedals were designed by Henk Dullens, a former employee of \\"Het Motorpaleis\\" in The Netherlands. The system was designed for a Yamaha F5, which was basically the ancestor for the FS1-E. =Specification= Engine: Two-stroke single cylinder rotary disc valve induction, four gears, running on a 20:1 mix of petrol and two-stroke oil. Frame: pressed steel tubular backbone type. Electrics : Magneto ignition with integral 6V AC for the main running lights (including high and low beam on a switch). The indicators, brake lights, neutral light and horn ran separately on 6 v DC from a three-cell lead acid battery that received a trickle charge from the magneto. On most models the three position ignition switch (on a key providing off, run and lights) was mounted on the L/H side panel, however the switch was moved to the conventional position between the handlebars on the FS1-E DX (front disc brake equipped model) and later FS1-E models. The right hand side panel contains a basic toolkit in a plastic case, pliers, 3 spanners, double ended screwdriver, plug spanner. The competition The second most popular moped of this era came from Honda, the SS50. They had a similar speed, and thanks to their 4-stroke design were cleaner, more economical and potentially longer lived though without quite the same acceleration. All suffered the same legislative fate in August 1977, when speed restrictions were introduced. For a short time after this date some smaller manufacturers (particularly Italian) brought in machines that could easily be derestricted without the use of any additional parts or any machining.

Its route constitutes both part of the Yellowhead Highway and Highway 11, signed as both along the entire length. It was first conceived in 1913 by the city commissioner and completed exactly 100 years later in 2013. History Construction of a ring road in Saskatoon was first proposed in 1913 by city commissioner Christopher J. Yorath. He conceived the first comprehensive town plan, which included inner and outer \\"encircling boulevards\\". Parts of the present-day roadway follow the course Yorath laid out, though some route proposals were rejected, such as one for the southern leg that would have taken the roadway over an island south of present-day Saskatoon that, years later, was named in honour of Yorath. It wasn't until the 1950s as the city expanded outward that the present roadway corridor was established. Construction funding, originally estimated at $10 million, was allotted and construction began in 1961. Rather than the complete route being built at once, Circle Drive was built in sections, as required by traffic conditions and allowed by available funding. As a result, it would take 52 years for the project to be completed. The first sections to be built were a northwest segment between Warman Road and 11th Street West, which initially included only a single interchange at Idylwyld Drive (formerly known as Avenue A); some of the route made use of a previously existing arterial commercial road, 42nd Street (as a result, the stretch of Circle Drive between Avenue C and Millar Avenue is often referred to as 42nd Street), and most of Dundonald Avenue, a street that followed the western edge of the city, was removed to make way for the freeway. The southeast segment, from Lorne Avenue to College Drive, was constructed concurrently with the Idylwyld Freeway, a connector from Circle Drive into the downtown core. Not including the Idylwyld Freeway, only two interchanges were initially built on the southeast leg: a limited-access one at 14th Street, and a large cloverleaf interchange at the junction of the realigned highways 16 and 11. In lieu of an interchange at 8th Street, a large traffic circle or roundabout was constructed. =1983 extension and north bridge= Circle Drive approaching the Circle Drive North Bridge For close to 15 years, the two sections of Circle Drive sat apart. The next portion of the roadway completed was the northeast quadrant, from College Drive to Warman Road, connecting the two extant sections. This included the construction of the Circle Drive Bridge (aka the North Bridge) across the South Saskatchewan River and was completed in 1983 after several years of construction. The original project involved interchanges at Warman Road and 108th Street; over the next 20 years additional interchanges were constructed at Attridge Drive/Preston Avenue North and College Drive. Also during the 1980s, the northwest leg of Circle Drive added an interchange at 33rd Street, while the 8th Street traffic circle in the southeast was removed after years of complaints and accidents, and in the late 1990s an interchange was constructed as a replacement. Also in 1996 an interchange was added at Taylor Street's junction with Circle Drive. A few years after its completion, the northeast extension was designated the through route for the Yellowhead Highway, replacing the previous route through downtown along Idylwyld Drive. In 2002, a major interchange was added where Circle Drive intersected several major roads: 22nd Street West, Fairlight Drive and Confederation Drive, replacing a complex series of traffic lights. Also, partially in preparation for the extension of the freeway (as well as residential and commercial development), an interchange at Clarence Avenue South was added in the late 2000s. =2013 extension and south bridge= The last remaining southwest section of Circle Drive, between 11th Street West and Lorne Avenue, including the Gordie Howe Bridge (originally called the Circle Drive South Bridge), opened to traffic on July 31, 2013, after several years of construction and a delay of nearly a year. Approximately 7 km in length, it connects the C.N. Industrial area to the Holiday Park neighbourhood, travelling through property annexed from the Saskatoon Golf and Country Club. It includes a new bridge, located just north and parallel to the Grand Trunk Bridge. The bridge has six traffic lanes and a pedestrian walkway suspended underneath, similar to the north bridge. National and provincial funding each amounted to $172 million and the City of Saskatoon committed $70.5 million towards the project. The total cost of the project is estimated at $272.5 million. The City of Saskatoon hired a private contractor to build the bridge. Three companies submitted proposals: PCL Construction, Peter Kiewet Sons and Graham Construction/Flatiron. The Graham/Flatiron bid was selected on March 29, 2010. Construction of the bridge and associated roadways was expected to be complete by September 30, 2012. However, record rainfall, high water tables and an early snowfall made that deadline unfeasible, and the roadway ultimately did not open until July 31, 2013. Environment Canada and Fisheries and Ocean oversaw environmental impacts on the river. The project included four new interchanges: at 11th Street West (which utilizes some of the land area given up by the Maple Leaf Foods building demolition in 2010), and at Secondary Highway 762 (Valley Road) on the west side of the river, and interchanges at Highway 219 (Lorne Avenue) and the Idylwyld Freeway. In the later stages of construction, construction began on an interchange along the older southeast section of Circle Drive at its intersection with Preston Avenue South; this was completed several months after the southwest extension and technically marked the completion of the Circle Drive project. The Holiday Park golf course needed to re-landscape two holes on the golf course, as holes 6 and 7 were affected. The southwest and southern periphery of Diefenbaker Park was also impacted as that portion of the park was taken over by the freeway. Some roadways in Montgomery Place and Holiday Park Industrial were also realigned and the at-grade intersection at Circle and Clancy Drive was also revised. Another impact of the project is a new rail switching yard near 11th Street and Dundonald Avenue. In 2010, the City of Saskatoon signed a non-binding agreement in principle with the Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway to move railcar switching out of the downtown Central Industrial neighbourhood. Additional road revisions were required as part of the project: 11th Street West, westbound from the new interchange with Circle, was replaced with the 11th Street West Bypass (the original road was converted into a cul- de-sac). Several streets within the South West Industrial and C.N. Industrial subdivisions were also realigned or shortened. The portion of Dundonald Avenue between Mountbatten Street and Valley Road was designated for closure; this required the construction of a new access road off Valley Road connecting to the city landfill while Valley Road itself was realigned to connect directly with Circle Drive (previously it had linked with Dundonald Avenue). Development of the Circle Drive/Valley Ridge interchange also required the permanent closure of the Fletcher Road access point into South West Industrial via Dundonald, leading to city planners adding a new roadway, Dawes Avenue to provide an extra access to 11th Street and, in turn, Circle Drive. The first portion of the southwest extension to open was 11th Street to Valley Road, which was open by late spring of 2013. =Future development= Although the circle is now \\"closed\\", the City of Saskatoon is investigating future improvements to older parts of the freeway, including revisions to the aged Idylwyld Drive North/Circle Drive interchange and finding ways to deal with traffic congestion along the non-freeway \\"42nd Street\\" (Warman Road to Avenue C) section of the road. As of October 2013 the City's Projected Growth Concept Plan map shows a proposed interchange at Airport Drive. There remain two further seagull intersections along the western freeway portion of Circle Drive at Laurier Drive and Clancy Drive that the city is looking to redevelop in the future in order to create \\"freeflow\\" conditions along the non-42nd Street portion of the road. In February 2018, the City of Saskatoon announced preliminary plans to replace the aging cloverleaf interchange where Circle Drive intersects Highway 11 and 16 in the southeast corner of the city. With an estimated cost of $280 million, work on the upgrade is not expected to begin until the late 2020s or early 2030s. Interchanges Clarence Avenue/Circle Drive interchange As of 2004, the Circle Drive Bridge portion of the road was carrying up to 50,000 vehicles per day, more than twice the volume from when it opened. Due to the greatly increased traffic the bridge was significantly expanded in 2007. Over the years, a number of at-grade intersections were converted to grade-separated interchanges to improve traffic flow. They include: * Idylwyld Drive North (formerly known as Avenue A) ‚Äì 1960s * 33rd Street ‚Äì November 10, 1980 (expanded in summer 1992) * Warman Road ‚Äì July 1, 1983 (coinciding with the opening of Circle Drive Bridge) * Taylor Street ‚Äì September 16, 1996 * 8th Street ‚Äì October 31, 1999 ‚Äì initially constructed as a large traffic circle in the late 1960s, this traffic control device proved unpopular and was replaced with a split intersection in the mid-1980s, and ultimately an interchange in 1999. * Attridge Drive/Preston Avenue North ‚Äì October 1, 2001 * 22nd Street/Confederation Drive/Fairlight Drive ‚Äì October 28, 2002 * College Drive ‚Äì October 4, 2006 * Clarence Avenue ‚Äì November 20, 2007 * Preston Avenue ‚Äì Completed in autumn of 2013 There are also purpose-built half-diamond interchanges at 14th Street East and 108th Street, and a cloverleaf interchange at highways 11 and 16. Between Millar Avenue and Avenue C North, Circle Drive downgrades from a freeway to an arterial road, with regular signalized intersections and driveway-accessed businesses. Additional at-grade intersections are located at Circle Place (no signals, eastbound access only), Airport Drive (signals; northeastbound traffic free-flow), Laurier Drive (signals; northbound traffic free-flow), and Clancy Drive (signals, northbound traffic free-flow). A short spur of Circle Drive between the Idylwyld Freeway and Lorne Avenue formerly included a T-intersection at Lorne and at-grade intersections at Jasper Avenue and Melville Street, but these were removed as part of the southwest construction (see below). As noted above, the junction of 8th Street and Circle Drive was originally, in the late 1960s, constructed as a large roundabout dubbed the \\"Traffic Circle\\". The first such construction of its kind in Saskatchewan, motorists found it difficult to navigate, leading to local media airing advisories on how to use it. The site of many accidents over the years, and dubbed the most accident-prone location in the city, the circle was ultimately dismantled in the 1980s and replaced with a split at- grade intersection in anticipation for a standard diamond interchange that was constructed in the 1990s.

Michael Morris, (born 4 April 1951) is an Irish racehorse trainer and former amateur and professional jockey. As a trainer, he has won the Grand National and the Cheltenham Gold Cup, and has won the Irish Grand National twice. In 2016, he won both the Grand National and Irish Grand National double. Early life Morris is the third son of Michael Morris, 3rd Baron Killanin, who was president of the International Olympic Committee from 1972 to 1980 and Chairman of Galway Racecourse from 1970 to 1985. His mother, Sheila, was the daughter of Canon Douglas Dunlop, Rector of Oughterard and the granddaughter of Henry Dunlop who was involved in the construction of Lansdowne Road in 1872. During World War II his mother was a cryptographer at Bletchley Park. According to Morris, \\"she was in Hut 6, but she wouldn't ever talk about it. Neither of them would talk about the war. She was bound by the Official Secrets Act, but whatever she did, she got an MBE for it.\\" Morris's twin brother John \\"Johnny\\" became a photographer and married Thelma Mansfield. Their elder brother, George Redmond \\"Red\\", followed in the footsteps of their father, Lord Killanin, by becoming a film producer. They also have one sister, Monica Deborah. At aged fifteen his formal education ended following his diagnosis with dyslexia. Morris then began working at racing stables. Family Morris was married to Susanna Felicity Clark. They had two sons, James \\"Jamie\\" born in 1983 and Christopher \\"Tiffer\\" born in 1985. Tiffer died in June 2015, aged 30, of carbon monoxide poisoning while traveling in Argentina. Jockey Initially, Morris came to prominence as an amateur jockey. In 1974 he rode Mr Midland to victory at Cheltenham giving Edward O'Grady his first Festival winner. In 1975 he turned professional. He rode Skymas in his successive victories in 1976 and 1977 the Queen Mother Champion Chase at Cheltenham. He rode Billycan to victory in the 1977 Irish Grand National, a race he was subsequently to win twice as a trainer. His career as a rider was over after a fall in South Carolina's Colonial Cup. Trainer Morris is based in Fethard Co Tipperary. In 1981, he took out a licence and began his National Hunt training career. Morris's first major breakthrough came when Buck House won the 1983 Supreme Novice Hurdle, giving him his first winner at Cheltenham. The 1990s started brightly for the Mouse Morris yard when Trapper John ridden by jockey Charlie Swan won the Stayers' Hurdle at the 1990 Cheltenham Festival. The following year Cahervillahow was beaten by a short head in the Irish Grand National and merely three weeks later in the Whitbread Gold Cup he was controversially judged to have interfered with runner-up Docklands Express in the closing stages. As a result, Docklands Express was awarded the race. He finished second in the 1993 Grand National which was voided after a false start. Morris trained His Song who was one of the best novice hurdlers of the period. His Song finished second behind the J. P. McManus owned Istabraq in the 1998 AIG Irish Champion Hurdle on his fourth race outing before again finishing second in the Supreme Novice Hurdle at Leopardstown. One of Morris's most important wins as a trainer came in 2006 when he sent out the seven-year-old gelding War Of Attrition to win the 2006 Cheltenham Gold Cup, beating another Irish challenger Hedgehunter on Saint Patrick's Day. In 2008, he trained Hear The Echo to victory in the Irish Grand National. In 2011, he trained the winner of the Grade 1 Neptune Investment Management Novices' Hurdle at Cheltenham, First Lieutenant, ridden by Davy Russell. In 2016, he won the Irish Grand National again this time with Rogue Angel. Also in 2016, he won the Grand National for the first time with Rule The World.

The station features an urban adult contemporary format and is owned by Cumulus Media. WNBM's transmitter is located on the campus of Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, with its antenna atop the Montefiore II dormitory tower. Station history =WFAS-FM= WNBM's broadcast frequency of 103.9 MHz was originally occupied by WFAS-FM, which first signed on the air September 1, 1947. Licensed to White Plains, New York, the station's targeted listening area was Westchester County and the lower Hudson Valley region. WFAS-FM initially simulcast sister station WFAS (1230 AM) before adopting a separate full-service format; it later evolved into an easy listening station, and then an adult contemporary outlet by the mid-1980s. Its primary competitor through much of its history was another regional FM station, WHUD. =Move to New York City, switch to Urban AC= Montefiore II Dormitory tower with the antenna for WNBM radio station. In order to increase their reach of the New York metropolitan market, as well as increasing the value of the station, in 2012 Cumulus applied to the Federal Communications Commission for a construction permit to move the station's transmitter tower location to the Bronx and subsequently change the station's community of license to Bronxville, all in order to better target New York City itself. The permit was approved in mid-2013. Rumors on radio industry insider websites speculated that the station would change its programming format, and flip to either urban contemporary (to compete against Emmis Communications' WQHT and WBLS, and Clear Channel's WWPR-FM) or modern rock (which would fill the format hole in the market after WRXP flipped to a simulcast of WFAN (AM) in November 2012). On June 30, 2014, WFAS-FM's existing on-air staff departed. Five days later, at Midnight on July 4, WFAS-FM signed off its transmitter (located at 365 Secor Road in Hartsdale), after a set of \\"goodbye\\"-themed songs, which ended with \\"Graduation (Friends Forever)\\" by Vitamin C. Later that day at 9:00 a.m., the new Bronx transmitter signed on, and 103.9 FM began stunting with a ticking clock, and at 1:03 p.m., the station officially flipped to Urban adult contemporary as \\"Radio 103.9\\" under the new callsign WNBM. The WFAS-FM callsign and its programming continued to exist via online streaming and as the HD2 sub-channel of sister FM station WPLJ (replacing the True Oldies Channel after Cumulus announced the end of that network, which came a few days earlier). Additionally, on August 29, 2014 at 2:00 p.m., \\"WFAS\\" returned to the analog airwaves, broadcasting on W232AL (a low-power translator station licensed to Pomona, New York) at 94.3 MHz. WNBM's primary competition is WBLS, New York City's heritage Urban Adult Contemporary outlet. The station serves as the New York affiliate of D.L. Hughley's syndicated afternoon program, which is distributed by Urban One-owned Reach Media. WNBM also carried the Tom Joyner Morning Show from the station's launch until Tom Joyner's retirement at the end of 2019. Throughout 2019, Cumulus began to withdraw from the New York market in earnest to pay down debts from its 2018 bankruptcy, selling WPLJ to the Educational Media Foundation, WNSH to Entercom, and WABC to John Catsimatidis's Red Apple Media; after the WABC sale announcement, Cumulus stated that WNBM would be divested as well. WNBM's AM sister station, WFAS (AM), runs automated as a CBS Sports Radio affiliate, freeing WFAN from carrying programming from its network. On November 8, 2019, WNBM, in anticipation of a future sale, ceased live programming and became fully automated, terminating its remaining airstaff in the process. In all time periods outside of the Hughley program, the station carries Westwood One's Adult Urban Contemporary-formatted The Touch radio service, delivered via satellite. With the 2019‚Äì20 coronavirus pandemic effectively ensuring a sale will not occur in the near future, the station added the Westwood One- distributed, Atlanta-based Rick & Sasha program to mornings in late April 2020.

It was one of the first organizations created for such a purpose. OIA applies integrated biosystems to recycle dangerously polluted wastewater into organic fertilizer, safe agricultural and aquaculture products, biofuel, habitat, and clean water. The process enhances flood control, soil renewal and reduction. OIA has constructed more than 70 water reclamation and community agricultural and development projects in Brazil, Nicaragua, Dominican Republic, and Spain, serving more than 15,000 persons and processing waste from various agricultural operations. OIA projects are among the first and most comprehensive applications of the Intelligent Products System, which evolved into the Cradle to Cradle system. Early projects were instrumental in forming and implementing the systems, now used worldwide. These are some of the first practical uses of Intelligent Product and Cradle to Cradle principles in developing economies. OIA projects resulted from successful green technology transfer from China, Germany and the U.S. to South America at a time when many sustainability technology transfers were failing. More than 25 technologies were transferred to Brazil to build the projects, with most of those technologies operating today and expanding rapidly. History Founded in Brazil in 1993, OIA was the collaborative brainchild of anti-poverty activist Waldemar Boff, renowned chemist Prof. Michael Braungart, community entrepreneur Valmir Fachini, biological engineer Katja Hansen, and environmental manager Douglas Mulhall. OIA developed out of collaboration between the Hamburger Umweltinstitut in Germany and the Brazilian social self-help organization SEOP. It benefitted from the conceptual work of Michael Braungart, GAIA Foundation President Jose Lutzemberger, and the engineering concepts of Prof G.L.Chan of Mauritius, whose Integrated Farming System is a major component. A precursor to OIA's projects was constructed in Silva Jardim RJ Brazil as a demonstration for the 1992 Rio Earth Summit and was featured on U.S. National Public Radio as one of the only functioning examples of a sustainable technology within driving distance of that pivotal conference. The work of OIA is supported by various municipalities, foundations, and companies. Integrated Biosystem Highlights Most conventional wastewater treatment plants try to clean water mechanically and chemically then release it into waterways. Such systems are expensive, produce limited economic benefits, and can themselves pollute. By contrast, integrated biosystems treat water by recycling it for agricultural use, producing numerous economic, health and environmental benefits. Nutrients in wastewater are recycled by algae, crops and livestock via processes such as photosynthesis, mineralization, and uptake. Water is treated by combined natural processes such as soil and root filtration, sedimentation and biochemical reactions including photosynthesis, anaerobic and aerobic digestion. In this system, clean water is a by-product along with organic crops, fertilized soil, and reclaimed wildlife habitat. Economic benefits come from soil restoration, fertilizer recovery, crops and livestock. Products can be produced safely and profitably with low input costs. Costs are minimized by using wastewater for fertilizer, integrating crops for pest protection, maintaining biodiversity, treating water via natural processes, and reducing environmental liability. The technology is especially suitable for poor soil, and regions where flood control or water conservation are required. Locally available resources are used so costs for imported fertilizer and equipment are minimized. Components are scalable, ranging from single households to large farms and communities. Due to high levels of year-round ambient sunlight, more productive applications occur in a belt defined by 30 degrees latitude north and south of the equator.

E-Verify was originally established in 1996 as the Basic Pilot Program to prevent undocumented workers and other people who have violated immigration laws from obtaining employment illegally in the United States. In August 2007, DHS started by requiring all federal contractors and vendors to use E-Verify. The Internet-based program is free and maintained by the United States government. Use of E-Verify at the state level varies; some states have mandated use of E-Verify or similar programs, while others have discouraged the program. E-Verify compares information from an employee's Employment Eligibility Verification Form I-9 to data from U.S. government records. If the information matches, that employee is eligible to work in the United States. If there is a mismatch, E-Verify alerts the employer and the employee is allowed to work while he or she resolves the problem; they must contact the appropriate agency to resolve the mismatch within eight federal government work days from the referral date. The program is operated by the DHS in partnership with the Social Security Administration. According to the DHS website, more than 600,000 employers used E-Verify as of 2016. Research shows that E-Verify harms the labor market outcomes of illegal immigrants and improves the labor market outcomes of Mexican legal immigrants and U.S.-born Hispanics, but has no impact on labor market outcomes for non-Hispanic white Americans. A 2016 study suggests that E-Verify reduces the number of illegal immigrants in states that have mandated use of E-Verify for all employers, and further notes that the program may deter illegal immigration to the US in general. History The program was originally established in 1997 as the Basic Pilot Program along with two other programs created to prevent undocumented immigrants from getting jobs. The others were discontinued. In the two years since Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) finalized the regulations for electronically storing and/or generating I-9 records there has also been a steady increase in the number of administrative I-9 audits ‚Äì where employers are asked to deliver their I-9 records to ICE within 72 hours for inspection. The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Verification Division reported that over 16,000 E-Verify compliance letters were issued in Fiscal Year 2010. Another 13,000 letters and over 26,000 emails were sent to employers in Fiscal Year 2011. Additionally, another 23,000 e-mails were sent in the first half of Fiscal Year 2012, alone. Operations All employers, by law, must complete Form I-9. E-Verify is closely linked to Form I-9, but participation in E-Verify is voluntary for most employers. After an employee is hired to work for pay, the employee and employer complete Form I-9. After an employee begins work for pay, the employer enters the information from Form I-9 into E-Verify. E-Verify then compares that information against millions of government records and returns a result. On 31 August 2007, the program began to include facial image data to help enhance searches. The 14 million images kept by federal immigration authorities are being used in the program, and the government is in talks with some states to cross reference with state drivers license records. During the United States federal government shutdown of 2013, E-Verify was anticipated to \\"be inaccessible for the duration of the shutdown.\\" Also, \\"the 'three-day rule' for processing employment eligibility queries in E-Verify is indefinitely suspended pending a resolution of 2013 funding impasse.\\" Impact A 2015 study found that E-Verify reduced the average earnings of undocumented immigrants, improved labor market outcomes for male Mexican immigrants and U.S.-born Hispanic men, and had no impact on U.S.-born non-Hispanic whites. A 2016 study found that E-Verify \\"reduces the number of less-educated prime-age immigrants from Mexico and Central America‚Äîimmigrants who are likely to be unauthorized‚Äîliving in a state. We find evidence that some new migrants are diverted to other states, but also suggestive evidence that some already- present migrants leave the country entirely.\\" A 2019 analysis by the Cato Institute found that while E-Verify used to be effective at spotting illegal immigrants, it was no longer so. The analysis estimated that the system only spotted the hiring of 16.1 percent of illegal immigrant workers in the fiscal year of 2018. Mandated use =Federal government= As of September 2007, most of the federal government did not use the system when hiring employees, but an Office of Management and Budget directive mandates that all federal government agencies sign up to use E-Verify by 1 October 2007. Social Security Administration failed to perform required verifications of the Social Security numbers of 19 percent of its own new hires during an 18-month period, according to a January 2010 report from the agency's inspector general. =Federal contractors= As of 8 September 2009, employers with federal contracts or subcontracts that contain the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) E-Verify clause are required to use E-Verify to determine the employment eligibility of 1) Employees performing direct, substantial work under those federal contracts and 2) New hires organization-wide, regardless of whether they are working on a federal contract. A federal contractor or subcontractor who has a contract with the FAR E-Verify clause also has the option to verify the company's entire workforce. =OPT extension for students= In April 2008, U.S. government extended the duration of post-completion work authorization (the \\"Optional Practical Training\\" (OPT)) from 12 months to an additional 24 months, for a total of 36 months of work authorization between the various OPT authorizations granted by USCIS, for certain qualifying students with completed U.S. degrees in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). In all circumstances, students are only eligible for this extension if their employer participates in the E-Verify program. If an employer does not participate in E-Verify, students working for those employers are only given 12 months of OPT, and can not get the 24-month extension even if they would otherwise qualify for the extension. State laws There are a number of state laws requiring or limiting the use of E-Verify for employers. According to a 2012 survey by the Center for Immigration Studies, 16 states require use of E-Verify in some form. The survey found that six states have laws requiring all or nearly all businesses to use E-Verify to determine employment eligibility: Arizona, Mississippi, South Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, and North Carolina. Five states require use of E-Verify by public employers and all or most public contractors: Indiana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Virginia, and Missouri. Three states require only public contractors to use E-Verify: Louisiana, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania. Idaho only requires public employers to use E-Verify, while Florida only requires it for agencies under direction of the governor. Colorado and Utah encourage use of E-Verify, but allow for alternative means of employment verification. An E-Verify-only mandate in Utah is contingent on the state's effort to create a state-level guestworker program. The survey also found that some states have moved in the opposite direction, limiting or discouraging use of E-Verify: California, Rhode Island, and Illinois.Jon Feere, \\"An Overview of E-Verify Policies at the State Level,\\" July 2012, Center for Immigration Studies. Available at: http://cis.org/e-verify-at-the-state-level In 2011, the Supreme Court of the U.S. rejected a suit arguing that Arizona's state law, which can cause employers found failing to use E-Verify to lose their state business licenses, was pre-empted by federal law. The ruling effectively confirmed that states may mandate the use of E-Verify.Kephart, Janice. (26 May 2011) Arizona Catches a Break from the Supreme Court  Center for Immigration Studies. Cis.org. Retrieved on 18 October 2011. =Alabama= The state of Alabama passed a law mandating employers to use E-Verify on new hires. The \\"Beason- Hammon Alabama Taxpayer and Citizen Protection Act\\" (H.B. 56) was signed into law on 9 June 2011. The act makes it illegal for any business entity, employer, or public employer to \\"knowingly employ, hire for employment, or continue to employ\\" an undocumented immigrant to perform work within the state. Effective 1 April 2012, every employer in Alabama must enroll in E-Verify and use the program to check employment authorization. The act creates an incentive for using E-Verify as businesses and subcontractors that enroll in E-Verify are immune from liability for employing an undocumented immigrant. The act requires the Alabama Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to establish and maintain an E-Verify employer service for any employer in the state with 25 or fewer employees that wants assistance. The Alabama DHS will enroll a participating business in E-Verify on its behalf at no cost.Jon Feere, \\"An Overview of E-Verify Policies on the State Level,\\" Center for Immigration Studies, July 2012. Available at: http://cis.org/e-verify-at-the- state-level This law is applied to businesses both inside and outside Alabama that do business with the state. =Arizona= The state of Arizona requires employers to participate in E-Verify: the Legal Arizona Workers Act has survived a number of constitutional challenges, up to and including the US Supreme Court and is currently in effect. The Legal Arizona Workers Act requires all Arizona employers to use E-Verify with all newly hired employees, effective 1 January 2008. As of December 2008, 5.6 percent of Arizona businesses had signed up with E-Verify. As amended, the law prohibits employers from intentionally and/or knowingly hiring illegal immigrants (or a person who employs or contracts with an illegal immigrant) and requires all employers to use E-Verify during the employment process and keep a record of the verification for the duration of the employee's employment or at least three years, whichever is longer.Arizona Revised Statutes Additional legislation prohibits the state government from entering into a contract with any contractor or subcontractor that fails to use E-Verify.Format Document According to USCIS, there are 39,191 employers in Arizona using E-Verify at 84,703 hiring sites.Jon Feere, \\"An Overview of E-Verify Policies at the State Level,\\" Center for Immigration Studies, July 2012.

However, Costa Mesa is the only city that has adapted the same state law as Arizona's SB-1070, allowing the City to arrest those without proper identification of resident status under suspicion of being unlawfully present in the United States. = Colorado = Colorado's E-Verify law became effective on 7 August 2006, and was amended on 13 May 2008, (H.B. 06-1343, amended by H.B. 07-1073 and S.B. 08-193). The amendment created the \\"Department Program\\" and is offered as an alternative to E-Verify, meaning that E-Verify is not mandated in Colorado. Public contractors must participate in either E-Verify or the Department Program. The state's Department of Labor and Employment is tasked with investigating complaints and can conduct on-site inspections and random audits of state agencies. It has the authority to request and review citizenship documentation of persons performing work on public contracts. Under the \\"Department Program\\" public contractors must consent to random audits to assess compliance with the law.http://www.colorado.gov/cs/Satellite?blobcol=urldata&blobheader;=application%2Fpdf&blobkey;=id&blobtable;=MungoBlobs&blobwhere;=1251695475820&ssbinary;=true ; =Florida= On January 4, 2011, Governor Rick Scott signed an executive order requiring agencies under his direction to use E-Verify. It was superseded on 27 May 2011, with a similar E-Verify order that brought the policy more in line with standard E-Verify practices by requiring verification of new employees rather than both new and existing employees.http://www.flgov.com/wp- content/uploads/orders/2011/11-116-suspend.pdf Specifically, all agencies under the direction of the governor have been directed to verify the employment eligibility of all new employees through E-Verify. Agencies not under the direction of the governor are \\"encouraged\\" to follow the same guidelines. All agencies under the direction of the governor must expressly require contractors to use E-Verify for all new employees hired by the contractor during the contract term as a condition of all contracts for the provision of goods and services to the state in excess of nominal value. Additionally, subcontractors performing work pursuant to the contract must use E-Verify. Agencies not under the direction of the governor are encouraged to follow these guidelines as well. Florida was the second state to join the E-Verify RIDE program, which allows employers to view State ID and driver's license photos during the verification process. On June 30, 2020, Governor Ron DeSantis signed a bill requiring government employers and private companies that contract with the government to use E-Verify. =Georgia= Georgia requires both public and private employers to use E-Verify during the hiring process. In 2006 the state passed the \\"Georgia Security and Immigration Compliance Act\\" (S.B. 529), which applied to public employers, contractors, and subcontractors and was followed by a number of amendments. In 2011, the state passed the \\"Illegal Immigration Reform and Enforcement Act of 2011\\" (H.B. 87), which extends required use of E-Verify to private employers. As of 1 July 2007, all public employers in Georgia were required to use E-Verify for all new employees. With additional amendments, the law now requires all public employees to permanently post the employer's federally issued user identification number and date of authorization on the employer's website. If the public employer does not have a website, then the local government is directed to submit the relevant information to the Carl Vinson Institute of Government of the University of Georgia to be posted by the institute on the website created for local government audit and budget reporting. An official at the state's Department of Labor told the Center for Immigration Studies that funding has not been made available for the auditing process rendering the law largely ineffective.Jon Feere, \\"An Overview of E-Verify Policies at the State Level,\\" Center for Immigration Studies, July 2012. Available at: http://cis.org/e-verify-at-the-state-level; See also, http://www.myfoxatlanta.com/dpp/news/iteam/I-Team-Illegal-Workers-20120213-pm- pk =Idaho= On 29 May 2009, Gov. Butch Otter signed Executive Order 2009‚Äì10, mandating, among other things, that state agencies verify that new employees are eligible for employment under federal and state law. While the order does not specifically reference E-Verify, subsequent internal guidelines resulted in all state agencies using E-Verify to meet the order's requirements. The order came into effect on 1 July 2009. Public contractors and subcontractors are required to declare to the contracting state agency that they have \\"substantiated that all employees providing services or involved in any way on projects funded directly by or assisted in whole or part by state funds or federal stimulus dollars\\" are legally authorized to work in the United States. According to an official at the state's Department of Human Resources, public contractors are encouraged, but not required to use E-Verify to meet this requirement. On 14 July 2013, Idaho joined the E-verify RIDE program, which allows employers to view State ID and driver's license photos during the verification process. =Illinois= Section 12(a) of the Illinois Right to Privacy in the Workplace Act prohibited Illinois employers from using E-verify to verify the work authorization of their employees. The United States Department of Homeland Security sued to prevent the law from taking effect as scheduled on 1 January 2008. On 12 March 2009, agreeing with the federal government, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois ruled that Illinois' law is invalid under the Supremacy Clause to the U.S. Constitution because it conflicts with the federal Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA). The case was United States v. Illinois, (No. 07-3261, C.D. Ill., 2009). As a rule, E-Verify is not required in Illinois. In fact, Illinois is the only state that has tried to block the use of E-Verify by private employers. Concerned about inaccuracies in the E-Verify data kept by the federal government as well as ongoing privacy implications for workers, Illinois enacted a law in 2007 that would have prohibited private employers from using E-Verify until the federal government made specific improvements to the system. However, DHS challenged the Illinois law in federal court and eventually won. Thus, the provision of the Illinois law prohibiting employers from using E-Verify was struck down, but the rest of the statute survived. An amended version of the law was enacted in August 2009, and it is that version which went into effect on 1 January 2010. Under the new law, which amends the Illinois Right to Privacy in the Workplace Act, Illinois employers are required to sign a sworn attestation either upon initial enrollment in E-Verify, or by 31 January 2010 if they are already enrolled in the program. The attestation form affirms that the employer has received the requisite E-Verify training materials from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\\"DHS\\"), and that all employees with access to the company's E-Verify account have completed mandatory online E-Verify tutorials. It further states that the employer has posted the required legal notices regarding its enrollment in E-Verify and certain non-discrimination procedures. The employer must retain the signed original attestation and proof of its employees' E-Verify training. =Indiana= On 1 July 2011, Indiana enacted S.B. 590. Among other things, the law requires state agencies and political subdivisions to use E-Verify to determine work authorization status of all employees hired after 30 June 2011. The requirement to use E-Verify also applies to public contractors. The law does not contain any enforcement provisions or any auditing process to determine employer compliance. =Louisiana= On 15 August 2011, two pieces of E-Verify legislation were approved in Louisiana. The first bill, H.B. 342, requires all state and local contractors who seek to do business with Louisiana to use E-Verify. The second bill, H.B. 646, encourages all private businesses to verify the legal status of their new hires by providing employers a safe harbor against sanctions if they use E-Verify or another method for determining worker eligibility. =Minnesota= On 7 January 2008, then-Governor Tim Pawlenty signed Executive Order 08-01, requiring use of E-Verify for the state's executive branch employees and for some public contracts. Gov. Mark Dayton allowed the order to lapse in April 2011. A new E-Verify provision requires use of E-Verify only for some public contracts. It requires state contracts for services in excess of $50,000 to require certification from vendors and subcontractors that they have implemented or are in the process of implementing the E-Verify program for all newly hired employees who will perform work under the contract. It exempts contracts entered into by the State Board of Investment. =Mississippi= The Mississippi Employment Protection Act requires all Mississippi employers to use E-Verify with new hires. Mississippi employers with 250 or more employees must comply with the law as of 1 July 2008. The law goes into effect for employers with 100 to 249 employees as of 1 July 2009. Employers with 30 to 99 employees must comply by 1 July 2010. The law is effective for employers with fewer than 30 employees on 1 July 2011. As of June 2011, a total of 4,336 employers representing more than 9,000 worksites in Mississippi were using E-Verify. Enforcement of the law, and its effectiveness, remains a significant problem. An official at the Mississippi Attorney General's office explained to the Center for Immigration Studies that his office is tasked with investigating complaints that the public may file about potential violations of the law. However, when asked how often such complaints are filed, he responded, \\"Rarely.\\" This is consistent with information from a two-day immigration hearing held at the state capital in 2010. Then, a different spokesperson for the Attorney General's office explained that the office had received no formal complaints. A state representative told the Center for Immigration Studies that because the state law grants authority over E-Verify regulation to multiple state agencies, no agency has taken the lead and enforcement has been nominal. As of August 2012 Mississippi was the first state to use USCIS's RIDE program as part of its E-Verify efforts (Florida and Idaho have also since joined). On 13 June 2011, in an effort to improve E-Verify's accuracy in Mississippi, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) launched the \\"Records and Information from DMVs for E-Verify\\" (RIDE) program in the state. The RIDE program compares driver's licenses or other government-issued ID cards against data held by the state's motor vehicle agency. =Missouri= On 7 July 2008, Missouri's E-Verify bill (H.R. 1549) was signed into law.http://www.house.mo.gov/billtracking/bills081/billpdf/truly/HB1549T.PDF It became effective on 1 January 2009. The law prohibits businesses from knowingly employing, hiring, or continuing to employ an illegal immigrant to perform work within the state of Missouri. The E-Verify portion of the law does not apply to all businesses, but those businesses that do use E-Verify are provided an affirmative defense that the business has not violated the provisions of the law that prohibit the employment of illegal immigrant. All public employers are required to \\"actively participate\\" in E-Verify. =Nebraska= On 8 April 2009, Nebraska's L.B. 403 was signed into law.http://nebraskalegislature.gov/FloorDocs/101/PDF/Slip/LB403.pdf The law requires use of E-Verify by state agencies (and political subdivisions) and by public contractors starting 1 October 2009. Every contract between a public employer and public contractor must contain a provision requiring the public contractor to use E-Verify for new employees physically performing services within Nebraska. The requirement does not apply to public contracts made prior to the operative date of this act. According to state surveys, use of E-Verify appears to be low. =North Carolina= The North Carolina governor signed H.B. 36 into law on 23 June 2011. All counties and municipalities were required to begin using E-Verify by 1 October 2011. The law also requires private businesses to use E-Verify for new employees, but exempts any \\"seasonal temporary employee who is employed for 90 or fewer days during a 12-consecutive-month period\\". Employers with 500 or more employees must be using E-Verify by 1 October 2012; employers with 100 to 499 employees must be using E-Verify by 1 January 2013; and employers with 25 to 99 employees must be using E-Verify by 1 July 2013.http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2011/Bills/House/PDF/H36v8.pdf The law does not include a random audit process for determining employer compliance. =Oklahoma= The \\"Oklahoma Taxpayer and Citizen Protection Act of 2007\\" (H.B. 1804) was signed into law on 9 May 2007.http://ssl.csg.org/dockets/29cycle/29A/2009adocketbills/1929A04ok.pdf Among other things, the law requires public contractors and subcontractors to use E-Verify (or a third-party program with an equal or higher degree of reliability, should one appear). After 1 July 2008, public employers were prohibited from entering into contracts for the physical performance of services within Oklahoma unless the contractor (and any subcontractor) uses E-Verify to verify the work authorization of all new employees. If an independent contractor, contracting for the physical performance of services in Oklahoma, fails to provide to the contracting entity documentation to verify the independent contractor's employment authorization, the contracting entity is required to withhold state income tax at the top marginal income tax rate as provided under state law. =Pennsylvania= On 5 July 2012, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett signed \\"Public Works Employment Verification Act\\" (S.B. 637). It requires some public works contractors and subcontractors to use E-Verify to determine employment eligibility of all new hires. In order to ensure compliance, employers are subject to complaint-based and random audits. The act takes effect 1 January 2013. Under the act, \\"public work\\" means \\"construction, reconstruction, demolition, alteration, and/or repair work other than maintenance work, done under contract and paid for in whole or in part out of the funds of a public body\\" where the estimated cost of the total project is in excess of $25,000 but does not include work performed under a \\"rehabilitation or manpower training program.\\"http://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=PDF&sessYr;=2011&sessInd;=0&billBody;=S&billTyp;=B&billNbr;=0637&pn;=2347 The legislation was approved by both houses of the state legislature and aims to ensure that all construction jobs funded by taxpayers employ only documented workers by checking employees' information against government records. =Rhode Island= In March 2008, Governor Carcieri issued an executive order requiring executive agencies to use E-Verify; and for all persons and businesses, including grantees, contractors and their subcontractors and vendors to use E-Verify.http://www.riaclu.org/documents/Carcieri_Executive_Order_immigration.pdf; On 5 January 2011, less than 24 hours after his swearing-in, Gov.

Huffingtonpost.com. Retrieved on 18 October 2011. The law requires all employers to use E-Verify. The original version of the law gave employers the option of confirming the eligibility of new employees through either E-Verify or by checking the validity of driver's licenses and other identification cards. The 2011 amendment made E-Verify the exclusive method for confirming employment eligibility. South Carolina is said to have one of the nation's most effective E-Verify laws in that the state uses an audit process to ensure businesses are in compliance with the law. South Carolina conducted approximately 6,000 audits of businesses under the 2008 version of the law. During the first year ‚Äì 1 July 2009, through 30 June 2010, when the law applied to businesses with 100 or more employees (a total of 2,300 employers) ‚Äî South Carolina conducted approximately 1,900 audits. The second year, when the law applied to every employer, the state conducted audits of approximately 4,200 businesses. Every public employer must register and participate in \\"federal work authorization program to verify the employment authorization of all new employees.\\" See SC Code Section 8-14-20(A). Public employer must also require public contractors and subcontractors to agree to use e-verify or \\"to employ only workers who\\" possess or qualify to obtain a SC drivers license or identification card. See SC Code Section 8-14-20(B). The latter requirement applies as follows: \\"(1) on and after 1 January 2009, with respect to contractors, subcontractors, or sub- subcontractors of five hundred or more employees; (2) on and after 1 July 2009, with respect to contractors, subcontractors, or sub-subcontractors of one hundred or more employees but less than five hundred employees; and (3) on and after 1 January 2010, with respect to all other contractors, subcontractors, or sub-subcontractors.\\" See SC Code Section 8-14-20(D). SC Code Section 41-8-20 requires that \\"(A) All private employers in South Carolina shall be imputed a South Carolina employment license, which permits a private employer to employ a person in this State.

(B) All private employers who are required by federal law to complete and maintain federal employment eligibility verification forms or documents must register and participate in the E-Verify federal work authorization program, or its successor, to verify the work authorization of every new employee within three business days after employing a new employee. A private employer who does not comply with the requirements of this subsection violates the private employer's licenses. (C) The South Carolina Department of Employment and Workforce shall provide private employers with technical advice and electronic access to the E-Verify federal work authorization program's website for the sole purpose of registering and participating in the program. (D) Private employers shall employ provisionally a new employee until the new employee's work authorization has been verified pursuant to this section. A private employer shall submit a new employee's name and information for verification even if the new employee's employment is terminated less than three business days after becoming employed. If a new employee's work authorization is not verified by the federal work authorization program, a private employer must not employ, continue to employ, or reemploy the new employee. (E) To assist private employers in understanding the requirements of this chapter, the director shall send written notice of the requirements of this section to all South Carolina employers, and shall publish the information contained in the notice on its website. Nothing in this section shall create a legal requirement that any private employer receive actual notice of the requirements of this chapter through written notice from the director, nor create any legal defense for failure to receive notice. (F) If a private employer is a contractor, the private employer shall maintain the contact phone numbers of all subcontractors and sub- subcontractors performing services for the private employer. The private employer shall provide the contact phone numbers or a contact phone number, as applicable, to the director pursuant to an audit or investigation within seventy-two hours of the director's request.

As an alternative to E-Verify, businesses can use any other federal program the state deems equivalent to E-Verify, including \\"the Social Security Number Verification Service or similar online verification process implemented by the United States Social Security Administration.\\" (Note: However, the E-Verify is considered to be more reliable than the mere verification through a Social Security Administration database that the social security number, name of employee, and date of birth all match.) The law exempts employers of aliens on H-2A (temporary agricultural) and H-2B (temporary, non-agricultural) visas. An official at the Social Security Administration told the Center for Immigration Studies that the program is not sufficient for determining immigration status. =Virginia= On 11 April 2010, Virginia's H.B. 737 was signed into law.Bill Tracking ‚Äì 2010 session > Legislation In early 2011, Gov.

Prior to that, the station used the call sign WCOH when it was located in Yonkers (Westchester Broadcasting Corporation) and WBRS in Brooklyn (North American Broadcasting Corporation). WFAS had to share time on the 1210 kHz frequency with WBRB; Long Branch, New Jersey, WGBB; Freeport, New York and WGNY; Newburgh, New York. That was not an unusual arrangement in the early days of broadcasting when fewer frequencies were made available by the government. In 1941, in accordance with the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA), the station moved to 1240 kHz and increased power to 250 watts, still sharing the frequency with two other stations.

The diocese consists of the department of Loire-Atlantique. It has existed since the 4th century. It is now suffragan of the Archdiocese of Rennes, Dol, and Saint-Malo, having previously been suffragan to the Archdiocese of Tours. Its see is Nantes Cathedral in the city of Nantes.  History  According to late traditions, Saint Clarus (Saint Clair), first Bishop of Nantes, was a disciple of Saint Peter. De la Borderie, however, has shown that the ritual of the Church of Nantes, drawn up by Helius the precentor in 1263, ignores the apostolic mission of Saint Clarus, and also that Saint Peter's nail in Nantes Cathedral was not brought there by Saint Clarus, but at a time subsequent to the invasions of the Northmen in the 10th century. He showed further that Saint Felix, writing with six other bishops in 567 to Saint Radegund, attributed to Saint Martin of Vertou the chief role in the conversion of the Nantais to Christianity, and that the traditions concerning the mission of Saint Clarus are later than 1400. The earliest list of the bishops of Nantes (made, according to Louis Duchesne, at the beginning of the 10th century) does not favour the thesis of a bishop of Nantes prior to Constantine I. The author of the Passion of the Nantes martyrs, Saints Donatian and Rogatian, places their death in the reign of Constantius Chlorus, and seems to believe that Rogatian could not be baptized, because the bishop was absent. Duchesne believes that the two saints suffered at an earlier date, and disputes the inference of the ancient writer concerning the absence of the bishop. He believes that the first bishop of Nantes, whose date is certain, is Desiderius (453), correspondent of Sulpicius Severus and St. Paulinus of Nola. Several bishops, it is true, occupied the see before him, among others Saint Clarus and Saint Similianus, but their dates are uncertain. Duchesne considers as legendary the Saint Aemilianus supposed to have been Bishop of Nantes in Charlemagne's reign and to have fought the Saracens in Burgundy. Among the noteworthy bishops are: Saint Felix (550-83), whose municipal improvements at Nantes were praised in the poems of Venantius Fortunatus, and who often mediated between the people of Brittany and the Frankish kings; Saint Pacharius (end of 7th century); Saint Gohard (Gohardus), martyred by the Northmen in 843, with the monks of the monastery of Aindre; Actardus (843‚Äì871), during whose time the Breton prince Nominoe, in his conflict with the metropolitan see of Tours, created a see at Gu√©rande, in favour of an ecclesiastic of Vannes, in the heart of the Diocese of Nantes; the preacher Cospeau (1621‚Äì36). The diocese venerates: the monk Saint Herv√© (6th century); the hermits Saint Friard and Saint Secondel of Besn√© (6th century); Saint Victor, hermit at Cambon (6th or 7th century); the English hermit Saint Viaud (7th or 8th century); the Greek Saint Beno√Æt, Abbot of Masserac in Charlemagne's time; Saint Martin of Vertou (d. 601), apostle of the Herbauges district and founder of the Benedictine Vertou Abbey; Saint Hermeland, sent by Lambert, Abbot of Fontenelle, at the end of the 7th century to found on an island in the Loire the great monastery of Aindre (now Indret); the celebrated missionary Saint Amand, Bishop of Maastricht (7th century), a native of the district of Herbauges. Blessed Fran√ßoise d'Amboise (1427‚Äì85), who became Duchess of Brittany in 1450, had a great share in the canonization of Saint Vincent Ferrer, rebuilt the choir of the collegiate church of Notre-Dame, and founded at Nantes the monastery of the Poor Clares. Widowed in 1457, she resisted the intrigues of Louis XI, who urged her to contract a second marriage, and in 1468 became a Carmelite nun at Vannes. In 1477, at the request of Sixtus IV, she restored the Benedictine monastery of Cou√´ts, near Nantes. The philosopher Abelard was a native of the diocese. The Abbey of La Meilleraye, founded in 1132, was the beginning of an establishment of Trappist Fathers, who played a part in the agricultural development of the country. The crusades were preached at Nantes by Blessed Robert of Arbrissel, founder of Fontevrault. Charles of Blois won Nantes from his rival Jean de Montfort in 1341. On 8 August 1499, Louis XII married Anne of Brittany at Nantes. Chateaubriant, a town of the diocese, was a Calvinist centre in the 16th century. The Edict of Nantes (1595), which granted Protestants religious freedom and certain political prerogatives. In 1665, by order of Louis XIV, Cardinal de Retz was imprisoned in the castle of Nantes, from which he contrived to escape. A college was created at Nantes in 1680 for the education of Irish ecclesiastics. Certain regions of the diocese were, during the Revolution, the scene of the War of La Vend√©e, waged in defence of religious freedom and to restore royalty. At Savenay in December, 1793, succumbed the remains of the Vendean army, already defeated in the battle of Cholet. The atrocities committed at Nantes by the Terrorist Carrier are well-known. Four councils were held at Nantes, in 600, 1127, 1264, and 1431. The mausoleum of Francis II, Duke of Brittany, executed in 1507 by Michel Colomb, is one of the finest monuments of the Renaissance. The chief places of pilgrimage of the diocese are: Notre-Dame de Bon Garant at Orvault, a very old pilgrimage, repeatedly made by Francis II, Duke of Brittany; Notre-Dame de Bon Secours at Nantes, a pilgrimage centre which dates back to the 14th century ; Notre-Dame de Toutes Aides. Notre-Dame de Mis√©ricorde became a place of pilgrimage in 1026 in memory of the miracle by which the country is said to have been freed from a dragon; the present seat of the pilgrimage is the Church of St. Similien at Nantes. The Ursulines, founded by Saint Angela Merici, were established at Nantes in 1640. Among the congregations for women originating in the diocese are: the Sisters of Christian Instruction, a teaching order founded in 1820 at Beignon (Diocese of Vannes) by Abb√© Deshayes, of which the mother-house was transferred to St-Gildas des Bois in 1828; Sisters of the Immaculate Conception, a teaching and nursing order, founded in 1853 (mother- house at La Haye Mah√©as); Franciscan Sisters, founded in 1871 (mother-house at St-Philbert de Grandlieu); Oblate Franciscan Sisters of the Heart of Jesus, founded in 1875 by Sophie Victorine de Gazeau (mother-house at Nantes).

Early life Campbell was born at South Stoneham to Scottish parents and was educated at King Edward VI Grammar School, Southampton, where he was captain of both the football and cricket elevens. While at school he played for England at the amateur level in an international against Netherlands, the only known occasion that a schoolboy has represented his country at that level. Career Before embarking on his career as a footballer, Campbell played professional cricket. =Cricketer= Campbell was a right-handed batsman. He made his first-class debut for Hampshire in the 1908 County Championship against Northamptonshire.Alastair Campbell at Cricinfo In the 1908 season, Campbell played in two championship matches, the second being against Gloucestershire. Campbell made five further first-class appearances for Hampshire in the 1909 County Championship, with his final first-class appearance coming against Northamptonshire.Alastair Campbell at CricketArchive. =Footballer= Southampton He was soon spotted by Southampton Football Club and joined them in 1908, making his professional debut in a Southern League match at Millwall on 27 February 1909, as a replacement for Bert Trueman. He \\"quickly emerged as one of the club's brightest-ever prospects\\". In September 1909 he (together with several other amateur internationals) was persuaded to join Samuel Hill-Wood's team at Glossop North End. Wartime football He remained at Glossop until January 1914, before returning to The Dell. He had failed to break back into the first team before the outbreak of World War I interrupted his career. During the war he guested for West Ham United as well as turning out regularly for Southampton. Although he was offered terms to join West Ham at the end of the war, he decided to stay in Southampton where he had been offered a directorship with a firm of fruit importers. Return to Southampton After regular football had restarted in 1919, he lost his place to George Bradburn, before regaining it in March for the remainder of the season, becoming team captain. At 6 ft 2 in he was a distinctive figure on the pitch with his \\"telescopic legs\\". According to Holley & Chalk's \\"Alphabet of the Saints\\" he was \\"undoubtedly one of the club's best-ever centre-halves\\" and led the team to many fine performances. Under manager Jimmy McIntyre Saints were admitted into Division 3 of the Football League in 1920, and just missed out on promotion in their first season, but a year later McIntyre had successfully guided Southampton into Division Two as champions of Football League Division 3 (South). Poole Town Campbell remained with the Saints until the end of the 1925‚Äì26 season, when, now aged 36, he joined Poole Town. Poole had just turned professional and joined the Southern League, Eastern Division. Although only placed 14th out of 17 sides in 1926‚Äì27, the season was distinguished by an excellent FA Cup run, in which Poole beat Third Division (South) side Newport County 1‚Äì0 and met Everton in the 3rd Round proper, where they were beaten 3‚Äì1 by a Dixie Dean hat-trick at Goodison Park in front of a 65,000 crowd. Management career In April 1927 Campbell was appointed manager at Chesterfield, remaining only until December. In his 25 games in charge, Chesterfield picked up nine victories with eleven defeats. After leaving Chesterfield he quit football entirely. During World War II he served as an officer in the Royal Artillery, but died of pneumonia in Cosham's Queen Alexandra Hospital in June 1943.

Types alternative therapies used for veterinary treatments may include, but are not limited to, acupuncture, herbal medicine, homeopathy, ethnomedicine and chiropractic. Definition The terms alternative veterinary medicine, complementary veterinary medicine, complementary alternative veterinary medicine, holistic veterinary medicine, and integrative veterinary medicine may be used as synonyms. The task force for complementary and alternative veterinary medicine for the American Veterinary Medical Association says that: The American Veterinary Medical Association also refers to it as a ‚Äúheterogeneous group of preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic philosophies and practices‚Äù. Description Interest in alternative veterinary medicine amongst pet owners has increased in recent decades, although there is not yet a governing body to mandate what aspects of alternative medicine are taught in veterinary medicine schools. One barrier to the advancement of alternative veterinary medicine is simply the lack of research and evidence backing up many modalities of treatment. However, many veterinary practices are encouraging staff to be familiar with alternative veterinary medicine because if a primary veterinarian can‚Äôt provide information, pet owners may turn towards unprofessional methods of healing or listen to advice from those who are unqualified. The American Veterinary Medical Association includes various modalities under this the title of alternative veterinary medicine. Some forms of alternative veterinary medicine include photon therapy (laser), acupuncture, homeopathy, veterinary manipulative therapy, phytotherapy, integrative nutrition, acupuncture, botanical medicine, chiropractic, homeopathy, massage therapy, and nutraceuticals. Oftentimes different modalities of alternative veterinary medicine will be used in conjunction with one another for the best results, such as integrative nutritional being used with physical rehabilitation. A veterinarian interested in alternative treatments may be a member of the American Holistic Veterinary Medical Association (AHVMA).American Holistic Veterinary Medical Association The modalities comprising alternative veterinary medicine vary in their evidence for effectiveness. According to the AHVMA, holistic medicine is humane.AHVMA - Home Use of blood tests, X-rays, and similar objective diagnostic techniques are minimized.403 Forbidden Nearly every form of medicine and therapy used in alternative medicine for humans is also used in holistic veterinary medicine.AHVMA - What is Holistic Medicine? Integrative nutrition combines both aspects of alternative veterinary medicine as well as traditional western veterinary medicine. As with other aspects of alternative veterinary medicine, it has become an increasingly popular topic within veterinary clinics amongst pet owners and their veterinarians. This approach typically analyzes the benefits and drawbacks to popular diets such as grain free, raw, vegetarian, vegan, or home-prepared diets. Integrative nutrition is more and more common within the agriculture industry as well because of the increased amount of production and growth that can come with altering the diet of cattle, chicken, hogs, or other livestock. Some information is already known, such as cats suffering if denied meat. However, dogs don‚Äôt experience the same lack of essential proteins when they eat vegetarian diets. As with other aspects of alternative veterinary medicine, more research needs to be done to definitively say what diets are best, although it is likely that different diets are best for different pets, depending on species, activity level, pre-existing health conditions, and financial stability and time commitment of owners. Physical rehabilitation and sports medicine is typically treated as an umbrella term referring to underwater treadmill therapy, photobiomodulation or laser therapy, hyperbaric oxygen, therapeutic ultrasound, shockwave therapy, and personalized exercise plans. This form of alternative veterinary medicine has permeated traditional western veterinary medicine with great success, likely because of its similarity to treatments that humans receive. Many types of physical rehabilitation and sports medicine treatments have been studied in humans and in animals enough to have some sort of evidence to support its usage. Underwater treadmill therapy has various reports of efficacy, but it can be used for both rehabilitation and conditioning. Photobiomodulation hasn‚Äôt yet been proved to be a legitimate treatment plan but there are tentative connections to benefits. This therapy refers to when stimulation occurs via light and reportedly increases energy and antioxidant production. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy functions in a similar way to photobiomodulation therapy and lacks legitimacy as well. Therapeutic ultrasound provides deep tissue thermal stimulation to increase range of motion and tendon strength and is often used to help heal deep injuries. Shockwave therapy uses acoustic sound waves to alter tissue mechanics and inflammation. Lastly, personalized exercise plans often are proven to be very effective, although some exercises have not been researched extensively. This treatment is used for pets who are recovering from injury, surgery, or for other reasons need to build strength or increase range of motion.

Portrayed by Ayden Callaghan, he made his first screen appearance on 1 November 2007, departing on 31 July 2008. He was introduced as a member of the newly-introduced De Souza family: the son of Donald De Souza (Michael Jayston), the stepson of Nicola Blackstock (Nicola Wheeler) and the brother of Anna De Souza (Emma Davies). During his tenure, the character's storylines included his personal issues with depression and alcoholism. Furthermore, it was established that Miles and his father did not have a close relationship, despite his father's millionaire status. Storylines When Nicola Blackstock (Nicola Wheeler) returned to Emmerdale, she told people that her husband had died. However, journalist Jasmine Thomas (Jenna Coleman) discovered that her veteran millionaire husband Donald De Souza (Michael Jayston) was alive and on life support. Furthermore, she discovered that Donald's son Miles was an alcoholic and would only benefit from his father's will if he stopped drinking. Nicola was trying to seek out Miles and catch him drinking, before cutting off Donald's life support, in a bid to have a good inheritance. Jasmine became determined to find Miles first and get him on the wagon. She tracked him down in a hostel, but he was still drinking and was caught in the act by Nicola and David Metcalfe (Matthew Wolfenden). Despite Nicola's belief that she could let Donald die and be free to inherit the business, Jasmine took Miles to see his father, while offering him a place to stay. Miles remained with Jasmine for a while, but became caught up in the feud between Jasmine and Nicola. After Nicola managed to get Miles back onto the bottle, Jasmine retaliated by printing the story about Nicola's husband, disgracing her. After his name was mentioned in the article, Miles felt used and hurt and decided to leave the village. Miles returned when his father unexpectedly woke up in the hospital, ruining Nicola's plan. Although Donald recognised Miles, he pretended not to recognise Nicola and Miles played along. He and his father managed to repair their relationship and Miles got his life back on track, moving in with his father to protect him from Nicola, successfully avoiding alcohol and involving himself in the business, proving in time to be an asset. He also made up with Jasmine, who apologised for hurting him and brought her to visit Donald. However, he did not trust Nicola and repeatedly kept trying to persuade his father to leave her. Donald refused, as he liked Nicola's feisty side but, when Miles discovered that Nicola was sleeping with David, Donald took immediate action and tried to keep the two apart. Miles himself also had something of a confrontational relationship with David, whom he disliked for hurting Jasmine so badly. Relations with Nicola came to a head when, frightened for his father's safety when Nicola took him up to the moors, Miles rang the police to arrest her. But Donald had finally given up on his young wife and Miles was relieved when he kicked her out. He was wary when he gained a new work-colleague in Carl King (Tom Lister), but found amusement in Carl and his brother Matthew (Matt Healy)'s feud. Miles began to develop feelings for Jasmine, so he and Debbie Dingle (Charley Webb) pretended they were a couple in an effort to make her jealous. They were successful, as Jasmine was clearly hurt when she saw them together, but an honest Miles soon had a change of heart when he saw Jasmine's reaction and came clean. Jasmine confessed her own attraction to him and the two finally got together. Miles became increasingly jealous of Jasmine's friendship with Jake Doland (James Baxter) and even went as far as to warn him off. Jasmine resented his tactics, as well as his pressuring her to go on holiday with him to France. Adding to the burden was Donald suggesting to her that without her, Miles would fall off the wagon. On the day of the trip, Jasmine decided to stay in the village. Miles told her she was only interested in him out of pity. He begged her for another chance and said he'd take a drink if she rejected him. When she did, he took a drink. Jasmine snatched the bottle out of his hand, but told him she was done with their relationship. A brokenhearted Miles left for France alone, with it being left up to viewers whether or not he lapsed back into drink. He briefly returned to the village for his father's birthday party. He swore he had stayed sober, and he tried to patch things up with Jasmine. She wasn't interested and, to make matters worse, Miles saw her kissing Jake. His sister Anna (Emma Davies), who had arrived that day, saw him taking a drink; he claimed he was just celebrating for the occasion. She took his glass away and told him she was there for him. He was not seen again after that and Anna failed to find him in order to tell him of their father's death. Development In April 2008, it was confirmed that the character had been written out of the programme.\\"'Emmerdale' cast head for the door\\", Digital Spy. URL last accessed 2008-04-08.

Commanded by Commodore Edwin Ward Moore, she led a flotilla in the capture of Villahermosa in 1840. After a period of inaction in port, Austin participated in the Naval Battle of Campeche in 1843. Austin was transferred to the United States Navy when Texas joined the United States in 1845, but was run aground and broken up in 1848. Background of the Texas Navy The Texas Navy was officially formed in January 1836, with the purchase of four schooners: Invincible, Brutus, Independence, and Liberty. These ships, under the command of Commodore Charles Hawkins, helped Texas win independence by preventing a Mexican blockade of the Texas coast, seizing Mexican ships carrying reinforcements and supplies to its army, and sending their cargoes to the Texas volunteer army. Nevertheless, Mexico refused to recognize Texas as an independent country. By the middle of 1837, all of the ships had been lost at sea, run aground, captured, or sold. With no ships to impede a possible invasion by Mexico, Texas was vulnerable to attack. In 1838, President Mirabeau B. Lamar responded to this threat by forming a second Texas Navy. Unlike Sam Houston, Lamar was an ardent supporter of the Texas Navy and saw the urgent need for its continuation. The second Texas Navy was placed under the command of Commodore Edwin Ward Moore, an Alexandria Academy graduate recruited from the United States Navy. One of the ships of this second navy was the Austin, which served as the flagship of the navy. History of the Austin Pennant of the Austin The Austin, named after Stephen F. Austin, was originally slated to be named the Texas. Built in the Baltimore shipyard of William and George Gardner in 1839, Austin was referred to as a sloop-of-war and had a full ship rig. Stephen F. Austin, the namesake of the flagship of the Second Texas Navy Austin was 125 feet in length and 31 feet across the beam, with a displacement of 600 tons and a draft of 12¬Ω feet. She carried a crew of twenty-three officers and warrant officers and 151 sailors and marines and was armed with sixteen medium twenty-four-pound cannons, two eighteen- pound medium cannons, and two eighteen-pound long cannons. Career Upon arrival in Galveston, the Austins crew underwent months of training before the ship was dispatched in June 1840 to the Yucat√°n Peninsula, where a rebellion had broken out by the short-lived Republic of Yucat√°n against the central government in Mexico City. Commodore Moore was ordered to confer with the rebel leaders, but not to commence hostilities against Mexico until a delegation of Texas diplomats had completed a mission to secure recognition of Texas' independence. Thus Austin spent her time cruising around the gulf coast of Mexico and Yucat√°n gathering intelligence and investigating ports and suitable anchorages. When a large storm blew up near Lobos Island on 14 October 1840, Austin came upon a Mexican ship in distress. Austin recovered all of the crew of the stricken ship Fama, delivering them to Tampico to great local acclaim. This did not deter a Mexican shore battery from opening fire a few days later on the flagship as she was close to the Mexican shore looking to replenish her water stores. Concluding that hostilities had recommenced, Commodore Moore hastened to rejoin his flotilla near Campeche. =Tabasco attack= Upon reaching the Cayos Arcas, where the rest of his flotilla had remained, Moore found that the San Jacinto had run aground on a sand bar and the rest of the ships were not to be seen. Austin set out to find the rest of the ships, Zavala and San Bernard, touching at the port of Campeche on 8 November and Sisal on 10 November. The flagship finally caught up with the rest of the ships at Frontera on 14 November. In order to salvage the San Jacinto and provide fuel for the lone steamship, Zavala, Moore hatched a plan to gain money. The Zavala towed the other two ships 60 miles up the San Juan Bautista River to the capital of the Mexican state of Tabasco, Villahermosa. There the small flotilla pointed their guns at the city and then sent troops into the seemingly deserted capital. Commodore Moore encountered a man bearing a white flag on a tree branch, and when he ascertained that this was the Mayor, the Texas commodore demanded $25,000 or he would level the town. The Mayor asked if silver would be acceptable, and upon receiving an affirmative reply, delivered the ransom. The commodore set sail with the silver and used the money to repair and outfit his ships. Returning to the wreck of the San Jacinto, Austin picked up the sick sailors and returned to Galveston, crossing the bar on 1 February 1841. During Austin's absence, Texas had achieved a hard-won recognition from the United Kingdom. Moore wanted to repair and recruit quickly in New Orleans and then continue to press Mexico by sea. But President Lamar decided instead to pull back and allow Britain to try to negotiate a settlement between Texas and Mexico. Moore was ordered to put most of his ships \\"in ordinary\\" in Galveston. Austins crew were placed in reduced commission with most seamen discharged, and the ship only serving on harbor patrol. She remained there through most of 1841 before returning to full commission early in December 1841. =Second cruise= Austin once again sailed for Yucat√°n on 13 December 1841, the day President Sam Houston was inaugurated for a second non-consecutive term. Houston's opposition to the navy may have played a role in the decision to sail that day. During this cruise, Yucat√°n rebels paid $8,000 a month toward the maintenance of the Texas Navy. Map of the Bay of Campeche, scene of most of the exploits of the Austin After a re-provisioning stop in New Orleans, Austin arrived at Sisal on 6 January 1842 where she met up with San Bernard and the San Antonio. From there the flotilla, under the command of Commodore Moore, again cruised the Mexican coast in search of prizes. After a stop at the port of Campeche, they continued on to Veracruz where they took up station as close to shore as conditions permitted. On 6 February, Austin and San Bernard sighted, pursued, and captured the 180-ton Mexican brig Progreso which was sent to Galveston with a small prize crew. Throughout the month of February, bad weather plagued the two Texas ships and they captured no more ships. On 17 February, Austin hoisted the United States flag and sailed into Veracruz harbor to get a first- hand look at the Mexican situation. In Veracruz, Moore saw with alarm an old commercial steamer undergoing naval conversion and a new schooner readying as well. Austin released her captives in Progreso's boats, exited the harbor, and set sail for Cayo Arcos and rendezvous with the San Antonio. Eventually, the three Texan ships reunited and stopped in Carmen for water and repairs, where they remained until 28 March 1842. Upon departure, the flotilla under command of Austin made for Veracruz and instituted a blockade of the port. While conducting the blockade, Austin captured the Mexican ships Dolorita and Dos Amigos, sending prize crews with them to Galveston. After sending Dos Amigos to Galveston accompanied by San Bernard, Austin headed for Sisal, arriving on 18 April. The following day, San Bernard arrived off Sisal with orders for Commodore Moore to return to Texas to confer with President Houston. The Texas squadron departed the Yucat√°n coast on 26 April and set a direct course for Galveston, arriving at the beginning of May 1842. =A period of inactivity= In Galveston, Austin was at anchor while Commodore Moore met with President Houston and Secretary of War and Marine George Washington Hockley to make plans for the Texan fleet. Moore discovered that Houston would not release $20,000 in discretionary money recently appropriated by the Texas Congress for the navy, and thus the sailors and officers would not be paid for the second consecutive year; many sailors deserted. Despite Houston's lack of support for the navy, he did not hesitate to use it when it suited his needs. He ordered a blockade of Mexico in July 1842 and released just over $18,000 for the repair and provisioning of the ships. However, the repairs took so long to complete that the blockade never materialized. Then, in September 1842, General Adrian Woll led a large force of Mexican regulars in an invasion of Texas, capturing San Antonio in what has become known as the Woll Invasion. In response to public outrage at the capture of San Antonio, Houston ordered the Austin and the brig Wharton to sail to Mexico and engage a Mexican fleet that contained new and larger ships, the Moctezuma and the Guadalupe, and to support another rebellion in the Yucat√°n in order to force Mexico to the bargaining table. The flotilla would not leave New Orleans until 15 April 1843. =Naval Battle of Campeche= The Mexican fleet now possessed the steamers Guadalupe and Montezuma. Guadalupe was a British-manned Laird-built iron hulled paddle frigate of 768 tons equipped with two 68-pound pivot guns that fired exploding shells. Moore hoped to encounter the Guadalupe separate from her escort Montezuma. Austin and Wharton made for the Yucat√°n coast and encountered the Mexican squadron on 30 April 1843 between Lerma and Campeche. Montezuma and Guadalupe, along with four smaller vessels, comprised the Mexican fleet. The Texans were augmented by two Yucatecan ships and five small gunboats, but were clearly the smaller fleet. Seeing the Mexican fleet, Moore, on board the flagship Austin, exclaimed: \\"Damn them, give it to them!\\" There was a two-hour running battle in which the Austin was struck once in the fighting and lost some of her mizzen rigging. The commander of the Montezuma and twenty of his crew were killed. After a few hours, the Mexican sailing ships departed and only the two steamers remained. The Mexican blockade of the port of Campeche was lifted, however, and the Texan ships put into the port for repairs. Moore was determined to upgrade his guns in Campeche; Austin received two long-range 18-pounders from the Yucatecans ashore and Wharton took on board a single, long-range 12-pounder. The Texas fleet waited for an opening to leave port and engage the Mexican ships again. Eventually the winds and the Mexican fleet, desiring a confrontation with the smaller Texan squadron, lured the Austin and Wharton out of port on 16 May 1843. With the wind pushing them forward, the two Texan ships engaged the larger Mexican adversaries despite heavy damage to the Austin and three dead. The Mexicans fared worse, losing 183 sailors, and were forced to leave the scene. This battle would represent the only time that steam-driven warships would be defeated by sail powered ships. The scene was memorialized on the engraving on the cylinder of the famed Colt Navy Revolver. =After Campeche= Austin under Moore returned victorious to Campeche only to discover that in March, President Houston had declared the ships and their men pirates. Moore wanted to return to Galveston and answer the charges, but hostile Mexican fleets delayed the Austin until 29 June 1843. Austin and Wharton arrived in Galveston on 14 July 1843 to a tumultuous welcome. The sailors of Austin were never court-martialed, but Moore and Lieutenant C.B. Snow were relieved of their commissions, and subsequently all but three officers of the Texas Navy resigned. With no officers or seamen, Austin remained in port in Galveston. USS Austin After Texas was formally annexed into the United States in 1845, Austin was commissioned into the U.S. Navy on 11 May 1846 under the name USS Austin, the first ship of that name. She was in poor condition when towed to the Pensacola Navy Yard, where she was used as a receiving ship until, two years later in 1848, USS Austin was run aground and broken up. According to the commandant of the Pensacola Navy Yard, she was \\"unworthy of repairs.\\" References Further reading Lone Star Navy by Jonathan W.

He was responsible for editing more than half of the volumes of their series of translations, the Library of the Fathers.  Life  He was born in 1811, the son of a clergyman, John Marriott, who was a friend of Sir Walter Scott. He was educated at home, as his health did not permit him to endure the rigours of a public school. He went up to Balliol College, Oxford in 1829, and gained a first in classics and a second in mathematics. He was annoyed at his failure to get a double first, but his physical strength did not permit him to do the study necessary. In 1833, he obtained a fellowship at Oriel College, and became associated with John Henry Newman. In 1839, he became principal of the Chichester Theological College, preparing young men for the Church of England ministry, but was obliged to resign after two years in poor health. In 1841, he was elected sub-dean at Oriel College. His return to Oxford coincided with Newman's move to the Roman Catholic Church. This provoked a backlash in the university against the Oxford Movement, which was already under suspicion of popery. In the absence of any real leader Marriott attempted to fill the gap and steady the group, although it was generally acknowledged that he was a follower rather than a leader by temperament. He became entangled in a vast correspondence with those thrown into confusion by Newman's defection, and did his best to encourage and support the waverers. Marriott was a nervous man, and very generous of both time and money. The consequence was that he was often distracted from tasks that he alone could do in order to do drudge-work. His early literary promise was undermined by this tendency to grasp at any nearby task, whether it was his to do or not, and he published little of his own. In 1842, he took over the editing of the Library of the Fathers, and continued to run the project until his death. He was invariably found compiling indexes and other menial tasks connected with this, often with a headache, to the disgust of his friends. In 1850, he became Vicar of the University Church of St Mary the Virgin, where Newman had once preached. He proved to be a popular and successful vicar, although this led to yet further demands on his time. During the cholera outbreak of 1854, he visited the sick industriously. In 1855, he was paralysed by a stroke. He was taken to his brother's house at Bradfield in Berkshire, where he lived for three more years, unable to do anything. He died in 1858. His lasting legacy is the volumes of the Library of the Fathers, which are often the only English translations that have ever been made of most of the works in question. The majority have been reprinted in the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers series, without the copious notes to which Marriott and his colleagues devoted so much time.

Dickens Hill is a fictional prison in the BBC soap opera EastEnders. The prison is part of a storyline that first aired between 1988 and 1989. The storyline centres on the popular character Den Watts and was filmed on location at Dartmoor Prison in Devon. The episodes were shot in a block of intensive filming, over five weeks, but they were worked into regular episodes of EastEnders later in the year, from September 1988 to February 1989. This was done in order to keep the character Den Watts on-screen after Den's actor, Leslie Grantham, had left the show. Although not part of the original storyline, the prison also briefly appears in 2017 when Max Branning (Jake Wood) visits his former cellmate, Luke Browning (Adam Astill). The prison also appears in a separate storyline in 2018 when Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) is on remand for the shooting of Stuart Highway (Ricky Champ). Storyline development Two of the most successful and popular characters in the history of EastEnders have been pub landlords Den and Angie Watts, played by Leslie Grantham and Anita Dobson. They are original characters who both appear in the very first episode of EastEnders in February 1985, and were largely responsible for attracting the highest episode BARB rating for a UK soap opera, when 30.15 million viewers tuned in on Christmas Day 1986 to witness Den hand Angie divorce papers as a Christmas present. However, by the beginning of 1988, actress Anita Dobson decided that she wanted to leave the serial. After over three years on-screen, the character departed in May 1988. Actor Leslie Grantham, who played Den, came to the decision around the same time that he too wanted to move on. He has commented, ‚ÄúI told them in November 1987 that I wanted to leave and Den had to die. It had to be final for both my sake and for the sake of the rest of the cast. After all, everything you seemed to read in the papers about EastEnders concerned 'Dirty Den'.‚Äù However, the executive producer of EastEnders, Julia Smith, didn't want the programme to suffer the ‚Äúdouble blow‚Äù of losing both Den and Angie at the same time. The solution to the problem was one of the soap's \\"most complex and creative exercises\\" that required \\"intricate planning\\". The producers and writers came up with an idea to enable Den to stay as an on-screen presence into 1989, while keeping Grantham working on EastEnders only until the autumn of 1988. The story, which was conceptualised by scriptwriters Tony Holland and Bill Lyons, saw Den Watts imprisoned. The programme makers‚Äô intention was to record the prison footage in a block of intensive filming, which would then be included in episodes of EastEnders for the rest of the year. Grantham has since said, \\"I agreed to a storyline about the jail sentence that would lead up to the end slowly, and allow new major stories to be developed. I‚Äôd always known that I didn‚Äôt want to play Den for twenty-five years. I didn‚Äôt want Den to end up another Ken Barlow, thanks very much.‚Äù The programme makers did not want to turn Den into a criminal, however, so they decided that he had to be put in prison for a crime that could be justified to the viewing public ‚Äî otherwise there would be no sympathy for him. The answer lay in a storyline that was running with another character ‚Äî the rape of Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth) by James Willmott-Brown (William Boyde), which happens in July 1988. After simultaneously getting in too deep with a criminal organisation (The Firm), Den torches Willmott-Brown's wine bar, The Dagmar, as revenge for Willmott-Brown's rape of Kathy, wife of his friend Pete (Peter Dean), and is then forced to take the blame for the deed by ‚ÄúThe Firm‚Äù. Den is taken away to a ‚Äúsafe house‚Äù in Manchester to avoid police arrest, but when it becomes clear that ‚ÄúThe Firm‚Äù are planning to kill him, Den goes \\"on the run\\". He is eventually forced to turn himself in to the police in order to escape ‚ÄúThe Firm‚Äôs‚Äù heavies. Den is put on remand at Dickens Hill prison in September 1988. For the next five months he is seen ‚Äî in the company of a small group of new characters also confined in the prison ‚Äî on a regular basis in EastEnders. Also in prison at the time is regular EastEnders character Nick Cotton (played by John Altman). This material was shot in less than a month at Dartmoor Prison, Devon. When these segments were written and recorded, they were done so entirely in isolation, and in advance ‚Äî the production team had no real idea of other material that would have to fit around it. The regular goings on in Albert Square had to fit convincingly around the pre-recorded Dickens Hill material; this ‚Äúproved to be a major headache‚Äù for the programme makers. The Dickens Hill storyline has been referred to as a ‚Äúsoap-within-a-soap\\", and it ‚Äúdominated‚Äù the majority of episodes that aired between the second half of 1988, and early 1989. Grantham has commented, ‚ÄúBanging Den up in Dartmoor ‚Äì though we called it Dickens Hill ‚Äì kept him alive for an extra year. It was the offer that the BBC made me, a brilliant idea, and I‚Äôm very grateful for it. I didn‚Äôt want to go in a way that harmed the show. This way I was able to record scenes for ninety episodes in five weeks. That must be a record. In the rest of the year I had time off...‚Äù A new batch of characters was needed for the prison storyline. Den is joined by various inmates, each with their own back-story as to why they are in prison, including some who are connected to Den and his ongoing troubles with ‚ÄúThe Firm‚Äù. Among the prisoners is \\"Barnsey\\" (played by actor John Hallam), who is Den's cellmate and strongest ally. Others include Queenie (John Labanowski), Vic (Michael Brogan), Trevor Kellow (Peter Doran), Squeaky (Phil Smeeton) and Elliot Brownlow (David James). In addition, a couple of more ‚Äúfamiliar faces‚Äù joine Den in prison, including Johnny Harris (Michael O‚ÄôHagan), who had been seen various time before the airing of this storyline, and original character Nick Cotton. Nick had been a semi-regular character since the first episode of EastEnders, a renowned villain who Den has a tempestuous history with. Nick's presence provides Den with a link back to Albert Square. It was while Nick is in prison that he admits to Den that he had killed Reg Cox, a character Den had found battered and dying in the first episode of the programme almost four years earlier. Nick had been prime suspect for the attack on Reg, but he was cleared of murder due to a lack of evidence and merely sentenced to probation for burgling Reg's home. The mystery of Reg Cox's murder is finally solved when Nick confesses to it in prison, ‚Äúthinking that Dirty Den would be impressed‚Äù. As well as the inmates, prison officers also become regulars for the duration of the storyline, such as officers Crane (Raymond Trickett), McLeish (Neil Daglish) and Stone (Jeremy Young). Outside the prison, members of the Firm were also heavily involved in Den's exit storyline, including Joanne Francis (Pamela Salem), the manager of Strokes; Gregory Mantel (Pavel Douglas); and Brad Williams (Jonathan Stratt), who had appeared intermittently since 1986, but is seen on a regular basis during this storyline. Investigating police officers included DS West (Leonard Gregory) and D.I.Bob Ashley (Robin Lermittee), who join Walford CID determined to close down the firm. Occasionally, regular characters from the Albert Square are seen to visit Den in prison, this includes Den's daughter Sharon (Letitia Dean), his friends Pete Beale, Pat Wicks (Pam St. Clement) and Joanne Francis, and even one of his worst enemies - Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard).\\"Xmas 88 - Den in prison\\", BBC. URL last accessed on 2006-09-26. The Dickens Hill storyline continues for the first two months of 1989, eventually climaxing in February. One by one the storylines of the specially brought in characters are concluded, until the date of Den's trial approaches. Den eventually bows out on 23 February 1989 in one of the programme's most famous episodes, which attracted over 20 million viewers on its first airing. After being abducted by the firm in an ambush on the way to his trial, Den escapes from their custody. He plans to flee the country after a rendezvous by a canal (in Alperton) with Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully), the mother of his illegitimate child, Vicki. This proves to be his downfall, as Michelle was followed by The Firm, and the episode ends with Den being shot by a man (who is carrying a gun concealed in a bunch of daffodils) and then falling into the canal. The scene where Den actually hit the water had to be taped at the BBC's Ealing Film Studios using a water tank, because the waters of the Grand Union Canal were deemed unsafe. When the episode was finished, however, Jonathan Powell, controller of BBC1, requested that the final shot be removed to allow for the possibility of Den returning at a later date. In protest, Tony Holland and Julia Smith had their names taken off the episode's credits. Den's exit ended up being the creators' final contribution to the show. Grantham has since commented, ‚ÄúI was annoyed when I saw the death scene, and so was Julia Smith who‚Äôd directed it personally. Because I‚Äôd made it clear there would be no going back, I filmed Den collapsing from the bullet and tumbling into the canal. But all the viewers had was the sound of a shot and a splash; it was a deliberate tease. Julia was furious.‚Äù Three weeks after Den is shot, police find spots of blood on the towpath along the section of canal where Den had been shot, but a search of the canal fails to uncover his body, although the police remain convinced that Den is dead and inform his daughter Sharon that this is a likely scenario. A year later, Sharon finds a distinctive ring that had belonged to him for sale on a market stall in Albert Square. She speaks to a young boy who had given it to the market trader, and the boy says he'd fished it out of the canal. The police search the canal again and found a body, which is identified as Den's. However, there had been much speculation as to whether Den really had been killed ‚Äî particularly after the first search of the canal had failed to uncover a body. Eagle-eyed viewers would also have noticed that he was not wearing the ring retrieved from the canal before he was shot. The scene had been set for Den to eventually return to EastEnders, and as early as 1991 the show's producers offered Leslie Grantham the chance to return, but he rejected their offer. The return of Den was on the show's agenda for almost every year afterwards, but for the next decade Grantham was unwilling to return to the series ‚Äî particularly at the time when none of Den's family were in it ‚Äî and felt that a comeback at that stage would have merely been a ratings-booster. However, Grantham accepted an offer to return to the series in 2003 after 14 years away, only to be killed off again in February 2005.\\"Sixteen million watch Den's return\\", BBC. URL last accessed on 2006-09-26. It is eventually revealed that the body found in the canal in 1990 was that of Mr Vinnicombe, who had been killed by Jack Dalton (Hywel Bennett), a character who did not appear until 2003, after the latter had found out that Den survived the shooting. Prisoners =Den Watts= After James Willmott-Brown (William Boyde) rapes Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth), Den Watts seeks retribution from his contacts with the criminal organisation known as The Firm. They refuse to get involved, but Den manipulates The Firm's errand boy, Brad Williams (Jonathan Stratt), and he and Den set fire to Willmott-Brown's wine bar, The Dagmar. It burns to the ground, but the Firm are not impressed with Den's disobedience. In order to prevent a police investigation, The Firm decide that Den has to take the blame for the arson. Den is offered ¬£20,000 for every year he will spend in prison, but Den decides that the better option is to let the police think he is guilty and then go ‚Äúon the run‚Äù. The Firm agree and Den is taken to a safe house in Manchester, where he is looked after by a woman named Christine, who Den is quick to seduce. However, when it becomes clear that The Firm are intending to kill Den to ensure his silence, he escapes. He visits a friend, Chalkie Whiting (Terry Molloy), who also lives in Manchester, but The Firm follow him and Den is forced to turn himself in to the police to escape them. Den is remanded at Dickens Hill prison in September 1988. In Dickens Hill, Den is introduced to numerous prisoners; his cellmate Barnsey (John Hallam) becomes his closest ally. The police are desperate for Den to provide them information on The Firm, so they can close down their illegal operations. Den remains true to his word and refuses to ‚Äúgrass‚Äù; however the police are managing to get incriminating information on The Firm from somewhere. Assuming that Den is responsible, The Firm arrange for their contacts inside Dickens Hill to teach Den a lesson. The ‚Äúnumber 1‚Äù of the cell block, Johnny Harris (Michael O'Hagan), orders his accomplice, Queenie (John Labanowski), to give Den a beating. Den is eventually cornered by the thugs and left bruised and battered with an injured arm. The Firm eventually discover that Den is innocent after all, and after Johnny Harris's departure, Den is instated as number 1 of the prison wing. With The Firm under pressure from a police investigation, and various key players in the operation being arrested, they once again decide that Den is a liability. Den has taken out an \\"insurance policy\\" with his solicitor ‚Äî papers the prove The Firm's guilt in various crimes‚Äî but this is eventually found by The Firm and destroyed, and they are then free to eliminate Den without repercussions. While Den is being accompanied by the police on the way to his trial in February 1989, The Firm apprehend the vehicle and abduct Den. Although Den manages to escape captivity with the help of Brad Williams, it is only a brief reprieve. Before fleeing the country Den arranges for a rendezvous at a canal with Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully), the mother of his daughter. Michelle tries to persuade Den to hand himself in to the police, promising that she and their daughter Vicki will be waiting for him when he gets out; however, Michelle has unwittingly been followed by The Firm. On the orders of Mr Mantel (Pavel Douglas), Den is shot by a man concealing a gun in a bunch of daffodils. A splash indicates that he had fallen into the canal, and he is presumed dead for over 14 years. =Nick Cotton= Nick is put on remand at Dickens Hill for drug dealing. He is given a cell with Barnsey (John Hallam), who openly dislikes him. He also makes an enemy out of Queenie (John Labanowski), due to a multitude of homophobic slurs. It is while he is in Dickens Hill that Nick confesses to an unimpressed Den that he is guilty of killing Reg Cox four years previously, who had been battered to death in the first episode of EastEnders in February 1985. He was cleared of murder but found guilty of burglary, having stolen items from Reg's home, and received a probation order. Den and all the other prisoners frequently find Nick's presence an irritant. After being beaten by Barnsey, Nick applies for a cell swap, but he immediately regrets it when he is moved in with the even more abusive Queenie, who beats Nick several times, and then uses him as his skivvy; although Nick finds someone else to bully, the emotionally unstable Trevor Kellow (Peter Doran), who ends up committing suicide. Nick is denied bail, and is told by the magistrate that his trial is to be held in June 1989. His mother, Dot Cotton (June Brown), visits him occasionally, bringing him a regular supply of cigarettes. Following his trial, Nick is released and ordered to serve 240 hours of Community Service. =Johnny Harris= Johnny Harris (initially credited as Man, later Harris), played by Michael O'Hagan, is a criminal associate of Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), who shows up in Albert Square occasionally to liaise with Den about various scams they are involved with. He first appears in June 1987 to tell Den to implicate another suspect in order to exonerate the son of the Firm's boss, who has been arrested for drug dealing and that Den has no choice but to comply, which he does. Johnny is next seen in February 1988 when he cons Den's nemesis, Darren Roberts (Gary McDonald), by selling him fake pornographic videos. In June 1988, Johnny reveals to Den that his latest scam has been uncovered by the police and it is likely that he will serve time in prison. Johnny is sent to Dickens Hill prison on remand, where he meets up with Den in September 1988, after he is imprisoned for the arson of the Dagmar winebar. Johnny had been promoted to \\"number 1\\" of the prison wing (head prisoner), meaning he is in charge of issuing supplies to the other inmates and given a cell on his own. Johnny is also on the payroll of The Firm, and he is instructed to keep a close eye on Den in order to stop him stepping out of line. When The Firm suspect Den of being a \\"grass\\", they instruct Johnny to organise a beating for him as a reminder to keep quiet. Johnny does so with the help of his ally Queenie (John Labanowski). Although Johnny orders Den's beating, he takes no pleasure in seeing his former friend hurt. When The Firm decide that Den is not the \\"grass\\" after all, Johnny tries to make peace with him. Before Johnny leaves Dickens Hill to attend his trial, he arranges for Den to take over his position of \\"number 1\\". Johnny also informs Den that he suspects Queenie of being the police informant, which Den later proves. Two years after Den's supposed death at the hands of the Firm, Johnny appears in Walford after being asked by Den's adoptive daughter, Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean) to provide information on her fianc√©e Grant (Ross Kemp) and his brother Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). He informs Sharon of the criminal activities that the brothers and their late father Eric have been involved in and tells her they are bad news. She goes on to marry Grant anyway, and eventually marries Phil many years later after her marriage to Grant ends in divorce and her second husband Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman) is murdered. =Barnsey Barnes= \\"Barnsey\\" Barnes, played by John Hallam, is the initial cellmate of Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) at Dickens Hill prison. He is serving time on remand for GBH and he and Den soon become friends. When Den is branded a \\"grass\\", all the prisoners turn against him except Barnesy, who serves as his protector while others, such as Queenie (John Labanowski), attempt to attack him. In order to get to Den the other prisoners need to get rid of Barnsey, so they report him to the prison guards for a crime he did not commit. Barnsey is sent to solitary confinement for the night and the following day, Den is given a severe beating. When Den is promoted to the \\"number 1\\" of the prison wing (head prisoner), he is given a cell on his own. Barnsey's new cellmate turns out to be Nick Cotton (John Altman), who he instantly dislikes. After Barnsey attacks his new cellmate, Nick applies for a cell move, though he instantly regrets it, as he is moved in with Queenie. Barnsey stands trial in January 1989, and leaves Dickens Hill to await his fate. Den is deeply sorry to see him go. Den is shot in February 1989 and presumed dead. A body is wrongly identified as Den's the following year, and Barnes attends the funeral in May 1990 and encounters Nick, who is also in attendance. =Queenie Price= Michael \\"Queenie\\" Price, played by John Labanowski is a prisoner, who is serving a sentence in Dickens Hill prison along with Den Watts (Leslie Grantham). He goes by the name of Queenie because he is an effeminate homosexual. The other prisoners refer to him as \\"she\\" rather than \\"he\\", despite the fact that he is a large, butch looking man, with a moustache. Although Queenie acts in a camp manner, he is actually tough and the other prisoners know not to mess with him. Nick Cotton (John Altman) often gets on his wrong side due to his homophobic slurs, and he is eventually given a beating because of this. It is revealed that Queenie is on The Firm's payroll along with another prisoner, Johnny Harris (Michael O'Hagan). When The Firm believe that Den is trying to frame them, Queenie and Harris seek Den out, intending to give him a severe beating. Den eludes this for a while, but Queenie and his gang eventually corner him, leaving him bruised and battered with a fractured arm. After The Firm discover Den is not the informant, he begins to suspect that it is Queenie. Den concocts a plan to catch him out. He gives him the false name of a drug dealer and as he predicts, it isn't long before the police are questioning Den about him, confirming that Queenie is the \\"grass\\". Den stuns Queenie with his discovery, but instead of turning him in to The Firm he uses him to provide information on them. =Trevor Kellow= Trevor Kellow, played by Peter Doran, is an inmate at Dickens Hill prison. Originally from the north of England, Trevor has been imprisoned on remand for the mugging of an old lady. It is the second time he has been imprisoned for this offence, though he claims to be innocent this time. Because the other prisoners, Barnsey (John Hallam) in particular, feel that Trevor's crime is despicable, they immediately take against him. They begin to bully him mercilessly. Trevor looks to Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) for support, and although he seems sympathetic, he can do little to stop the bullying. He manages to prevent a few attacks, but the abuse of Trevor still continues behind his back. In 1989 Trevor's friend contacts him with new evidence that proves he is not guilty of the mugging. However, the following month his friend disappears with the evidence, meaning he has no chance of avoiding a prison sentence. His solicitor instructs him to plead guilty to the crime to ensure a shorter sentence, but Trevor feels he cannot cope with imprisonment for a crime he didn't commit. His mental health swiftly deteriorates and he becomes depressed, morose and severely paranoid. Shortly after, Trevor is found dead in his cell, having hanged himself on the morning of his trial. Den is disturbed to discover that Trevor died in vain, as his solicitor had uncovered evidence to exonerate him. =Victor Hampton= Victor \\"Vic\\" Hampton, played by Michael Brogan, is an inmate at Dickens Hill prison. He is imprisoned on remand for the theft of antique furniture. Vic is married to a woman named Gillie (Clare James), but the marriage has come under strain due to Vic's continuous infidelities. Gillie visits and expresses her concerns about Vic's promiscuity. She asks him to get tested for any STDs that he may have picked up. When the prison officers find out about Vic's concerns he is quarantined in isolation, as they fear he could spread diseases to the other prisoners. Vic is tested and is told by the prison chaplain that he is HIV positive. He becomes severely depressed and berates himself for giving the virus to his wife. He talks of the humiliation he feels, having the entire prison know about his condition, being segregated from the other prisoners and treated like a leper. He talks about the dreams he had for the future, which will now have to be forgotten. Gillie is supportive and Vic is relieved to discover that she has actually tested negative. She promises to stay with him no matter what. Victor is the first character in EastEnders to be diagnosed as HIV positive, paving the way for the controversial virus to feature in a storyline surrounding a much higher profile character - Mark Fowler (Todd Carty) - a couple of years later. Others =Ms. Martin= Ms. Martin, played by Karen Archer, is The Firm's solicitor who is employed to defend Den Watts' (Leslie Grantham) who is incarcerated in Dicken's Hill on remand for Arson. =Gillie Hampton= Gillie Hampton, played by Clare James, is the messy-haired wife of prisoner Victor (Michael Brogan), who is in prison on remand for theft. The couple have a young son. Gillie comes to Dickens Hill prison to visit Vic. Their marriage has come under strain due to Vic's adulteries. Gillie had been visited by one of Vic's partners and she begins to fear that Vic has unwittingly passed on an STD to her. She had blood tests to put her mind at rest and pleads with Vic to do the same. Vic eventually does and it turned out he is HIV positive. He is deeply sorry that he has passed the disease on to his innocent wife, but to his relief she informs him that she has tested negative. She is supportive and promises to stay with him no matter what.

In recreational mathematics, an almost integer (or near- integer) is any number that is not an integer but is very close to one. Almost integers are considered interesting when they arise in some context in which they are unexpected.  Almost integers relating to the golden ratio and Fibonacci numbers Well-known examples of almost integers are high powers of the golden ratio \\\\phi=\\\\frac{1+\\\\sqrt5}{2}\\\\approx 1.618, for example: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\phi^{17} & =\\\\frac{3571+1597\\\\sqrt5}{2}\\\\approx 3571.00028 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] \\\\phi^{18} & =2889+1292\\\\sqrt5 \\\\approx 5777.999827 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] \\\\phi^{19} & =\\\\frac{9349+4181\\\\sqrt5}{2}\\\\approx 9349.000107 \\\\end{align} The fact that these powers approach integers is non-coincidental, because the golden ratio is a Pisot‚ÄìVijayaraghavan number. The ratios of Fibonacci or Lucas numbers can also make countless almost integers, for instance: * \\\\operatorname{Fib}(360)/\\\\operatorname{Fib}(216) \\\\approx 1242282009792667284144565908481.999999999999999999999999999999195 * \\\\operatorname{Lucas}(361)/\\\\operatorname{Lucas}(216) \\\\approx 2010054515457065378082322433761.000000000000000000000000000000497 The above examples can be generalized by the following sequences, which generate near- integers approaching Lucas numbers with increasing precision: * a(n) = \\\\operatorname{Fib}(45\\\\times2^n)/\\\\operatorname{Fib}(27\\\\times2^n) \\\\approx \\\\operatorname{Lucas}(18\\\\times2^n) * a(n) = \\\\operatorname{Lucas}(45\\\\times2^n+1)/\\\\operatorname{Lucas}(27\\\\times2^n) \\\\approx \\\\operatorname{Lucas}(18\\\\times2^n+1) As n increases, the number of consecutive nines or zeros beginning at the tenth place of a(n) approaches infinity.  Almost integers relating to e and  Other occurrences of non-coincidental near-integers involve the three largest Heegner numbers: * e^{\\\\pi\\\\sqrt{43}}\\\\approx 884736743.999777466 * e^{\\\\pi\\\\sqrt{67}}\\\\approx 147197952743.999998662454 * e^{\\\\pi\\\\sqrt{163}}\\\\approx 262537412640768743.99999999999925007 where the non-coincidence can be better appreciated when expressed in the common simple form:http://groups.google.com.ph/group/sci.math.research/browse_thread/thread/3d24137c9a860893?hl=en# :e^{\\\\pi\\\\sqrt{43}}=12^3(9^2-1)^3+744-(2.225\\\\ldots)\\\\times 10^{-4} :e^{\\\\pi\\\\sqrt{67}}=12^3(21^2-1)^3+744-(1.337\\\\ldots)\\\\times 10^{-6} :e^{\\\\pi\\\\sqrt{163}}=12^3(231^2-1)^3+744-(7.499\\\\ldots)\\\\times 10^{-13} where :21=3\\\\times7, \\\\quad 231=3\\\\times7\\\\times11, \\\\quad 744=24\\\\times 31 and the reason for the squares being due to certain Eisenstein series. The constant e^{\\\\pi\\\\sqrt{163}} is sometimes referred to as Ramanujan's constant. Almost integers that involve the mathematical constants and e have often puzzled mathematicians.

It extends in the west from the site of the old East Gate of Shanghai on Zhonghua Road, part of the ring road surrounding the Old City of Shanghai, to South Zhongshan Road and the Huangpu River in the east, an arterial road and part of the quasi-ring road Zhongshan Road. Administratively, it is in Huangpu District. History Dongmen Road is a street with a long history. ‚ÄúDongmen‚Äù means ‚Äúeast gate‚Äù. In the end of the Ming Dynasty, around 1700, when Shanghai became a small city for the first time, this street came to exist. The wall of the old city was built as a circle, totally on the west side of the Huangpu River. There are six gates to the outside‚Äîone north gate, one west gate, two south gates and two east gates. Among them, the east gate located on the west end of the Dongmen Street was the most important one in the old city. Furthermore, at that time, river transportation was served as the most regular way to make purchase with other cities. The biggest dock in Shanghai, called Shiliupu, is near this east gate. So, the Dongmen Road which connected the East Gate and the Shiliupu dock is surely to be the main street of old Shanghai, with shops alongside, goods in and out, and traffic across frequently. The wall and all the gates including the East Gate were destroyed around 1920 to make the traffic in and out more conveniently. And nowadays, The Shiliupu dock is no longer for transportation use but only for trip of the Huangu River instead. Dongmen Street, as a result, becomes a normal street of 20 meter wide, carrying four drives side by side. Shops are not as many as before. However, Dongmen Road is not far from Yuyuan Garden, an elaborate traditional garden in the Jiangnan style, and one of the tourist sites of Shanghai. As a result, the north side of the street now serves as a parking center where many tourist buses park. Recently Recently, the government has realized the special means of the historic street, and they are trying to build a huge shopping mall with active surface to make the prosperity of the blocks alongside reappear after hundreds of years. Actually, now, a residential community has been already built on the south side with commercial on the first and second floor.

Along with Lincoln Park and Washington Park, it makes up the three downtown parks in Newark that were laid out in the colonial era. It is a nearly triangular park located between Park Place, Rector Street and Broad Street. The New Jersey Historical Society, Military Park Building, the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, the Robert Treat Center and the newly built One Theatre Square and 50 Rector St buildings are located across Park Place from the park. A $3.25 million renovation led by Dan Biederman was announced in February 2012. The reconstruction was expected to be completed in late 2013, but due to harsh weather was postponed until spring 2014. A casual restaurant, Burg, does business in the park. The park reopened in June 2014.  History  The park was originally laid out by Robert Treat at the founding of Newark as a training ground for soldiers. It saw periodic military use throughout its history; it served as a training ground during the French and Indian War, a campground for the American army in the American Revolution and the War of 1812. At the end of the American Revolution it was designated as a public park. There was a period of time in the mid-20th century where the park fell into disrepair. The grounds were considered unsafe and therefore unsuitable for the general population's usage. Military Park fell into a state of disrepair until conservation efforts began in 2003 and ground was broken in 2013. The new park grounds boasts a more open and inviting atmosphere for passersby as well as a revitalized location in downtown Newark.  Features  Bust of President Kennedy Merry-go-round in park In the southwestern part of the park is the large Wars of America monument, created by Gutzon Borglum, the sculptor of Mount Rushmore. The sculpture itself forms the base of a large concrete sword built into the ground. The sword from the ground resembles a large dry fountain and from the air its shape is easily distinguished. The sword is about eighty yards long from the end of the statue to its tip; the blade is over ten feet across at its base. A bust of John F. Kennedy by Jacques Lipchitz was erected in 1965. The park also has an old drinking fountain with the phrase \\"My cup runneth over\\" carved around its base, and statues of Frederick Frelinghuysen and Philip Kearny. There is also an old fashioned carousel that was recently installed.Philip Kearny statue in Military Park A three-level underground parking garage is located beneath the park. The Military Park Newark Light Rail station lies under the southwest end of the park at Raymond Boulevard and Park Place. Located in the middle of the park is the casual restaurant and outdoor bar the Burg, which opened in the fall of 2015. The menu includes burgers, shakes, and salads. Doane Park Doane Park is a tenth-acre triangular piece of land north of Military Park, where Broad Street and Park Place veer off and is separated from Military Park by Rector Street. A statue of Monsignor George Hobart Doane, for whom the park is named, was unveiled in 1908. Doane was a rector at St. Patrick's Pro- Cathedral and did much for the city including his work with the Essex County Park Commission.Doane Park, accessed on November 2, 2007.

Facilities and aircraft Decatur County Industrial Air Park Airport covers an area of at an elevation of 141 feet (43 m) above mean sea level. It has two asphalt paved runways: 9/27 is 5,502 by 150 feet (1,677 x 46 m); 14/32 is 5,003 by 100 feet (1,525 x 30 m). For the 12-month period ending April 7, 2015, the airport had 15,000 aircraft operations, an average of 42 per day: 98% general aviation and 2% military. At that time there were 44 aircraft based at this airport: 95% single-engine and 4% multi-engine. History Following entry of the United States into World War II, the Chief of the Army Air Corps directed the Air Corps Flying Training Command Southeast Training Center to immediately take action to select air base sites needed to increase its pilot training rate to meet anticipated wartime demands. A level area near Bainbridge, seven miles (11 km) northwest of the City adjacent to the Seaboard Air Line Railroad was selected by the Air Corps, and the City of Bainbridge and Decatur County purchased for $66,800 and then leased the property to the Army for $1 per annum for a basic flight training base authorizing 89.9 million for its construction. The contractor broke ground on 3 April 1942, for Bainbridge Army Airfield. The immediate construction involved runways and airplane hangars, with concrete runways, several taxiways and a large parking apron and a control tower. Several large hangars were also constructed. Initial construction reached completion on 25 August. During World War II, the airfield conducted flight training of new pilots by Army Air Forces Flying Training Command. It was closed on 24 December 1944. With the airfield's closure, the Army Air Force gifted the base to the City and County. There was little need, however, for the airfield, and in the immediate postwar years, farmers leased the open areas of the airfield for cultivation and the cantonment area was used for various purposes. As a result of the Korean War which began in 1950 and the expansion of the United States Air Force, Bainbridge Air Base* was reopened to train additional pilots. The base was inactivated and returned to civilian control on 31 March 1961. Today, Bainbridge is used for various purposes in addition to a small amount of aviation activity. On the former base are several manufacturing plants. For a time, the Southern Airways built student housing was used by a mental health facility. Some of the remaining Southern Airways buildings are occupied by the Georgia Department of Corrections as a prison. The golf course built in the 1950s is still in use, and the World War II hangars are still in use. Through the years a lot of material has been gathered about the Southern Airways School and Bainbridge Air Base. The information is located at the Decatur County Museum. References * Shettle, M. L.

(28 October 1599 ‚Äì 30 April 1672) was an Ursuline nun of the French order. As part of a group of nuns sent to New France to establish the Ursuline Order, Marie was crucial in the spread of Catholicism in New France. Moreover, she has been credited with founding the first girls‚Äô school in the New World. Due to her work, the Catholic Church declared her a saint, and the Anglican Church of Canada celebrates her with a feast day. Early life Marie of the Incarnation was born Marie Guyart in Tours, France. Her father was a silk merchant.\\"Marie of the Incarnation\\", Ursuline Sisters of Mount Saint Joseph She was the fourth of Florent Guyart and Jeanne Michelet's eight children and from an early age she was drawn to religious liturgy and the sacraments. When Marie was seven years old, she experienced her first mystical encounter with Jesus Christ. In her book Relation of 1654, she recounted: \\"With my eyes toward heaven, I saw our Lord Jesus Christ in human form come forth and move through the air to me. As Jesus in his wondrous majesty was approaching me, I felt my heart enveloped by his love and I began to extend my arms to embrace him. Then he put his arms about me, kissed me lovingly, and said, 'Do you wish to belong to me?' I answered, 'Yes!' And having received my consent, he ascended back into Heaven.\\" From that point onward, Marie felt \\"inclined towards goodness.\\" Intent on belonging to Christ, Marie, aged fourteen, proposed to her parents that she enter religious life with the Benedictines of Beaumont Abbey but her parents disregarded her desire. Instead, she was married to Claude Martin, a master silk worker in 1617. By her own account, she enjoyed a happy ‚Äì although brief ‚Äì marriage and within two years she had a son, also named Claude. Her husband died only months after the birth of their son, leaving Marie a widow at the age of nineteen. With her husband's death, Marie inherited his failing business which she then lost. Forced to move into her parents‚Äô home, Marie secluded herself to pursue a deepening of her commitment to spiritual growth. After a year with her parents, Guyart was invited to move in with her sister and brother-in-law, Paul Buisson, who owned a successful transportation business. She accepted, and helped in managing their house and kitchen. Though nothing could distract Marie from the pursuit of a spiritual life. \\"I was constantly occupied by my intense concentration on God,\\" she wrote in Relation of 1633. Over time, her inclination toward religious life only grew and eventually led her to enter the Ursuline convent on 25 January 1631. = Religious beginnings = Free to pursue her religious inclinations after her husband's death, Marie took a vow of chastity, obedience and poverty. On 24 March 1620, she received a religious vision that set her on a new path of devotional intensity. In 1627 Marie read Vida, the autobiography of the Spanish mystic Teresa of √Åvila. Marie found many spiritual connections with Teresa, and was heavily influenced by her work. After reading Vida, Marie long aspired to the same goal of her Spanish role model of travelling to the New World and becoming a martyr there. Fueled by Jesuit propaganda and her own visions, Marie became more and more encouraged to travel to New France. So much so, she experienced a vision that would inspire her voyage to the New World and in Relation of 1654 she wrote, \\"I saw at some distance to my left a little church of white marble...the Blessed Virgin was seated. She was holding the Child Jesus on her lap. This place was elevated, and below it lay a majestic and vast country, full of mountains, of valleys, of thick mists which permeated everything except the church...The Blessed Virgin, Mother of God, looked down on this country, as pitiable as it was amazing...it seamed to me that she spoke about this country and about myself and that she had in mind some plan which involved me.\\" With the assistance of her spiritual director, Marie identified the country to be Canada and further incentivized her departure to New France. Despite never achieving martyrdom, Marie would spend many years in the New World aspiring towards it, working diligently in the meantime. After her death, the two names would often be connected, and Marie would occasionally be referred to as the Teresa of Canada. In 1631, after working with a spiritual director for many years, Guyart decided to enter the Ursuline monastery in Tours to try her religious vocation, at which time she received the religious name by which she is now known. Joining the monastery required her to leave her young son, and he expressed much difficulty with the separation. Claude tried to storm the monastery with a band of school friends, and could repeatedly be found crying at the gates, trying to enter. She left him in the care of the Buisson family, but the emotional pain of the separation would remain with them both. Later, when her son had become a Benedictine monk, they corresponded candidly about their spiritual and emotional trials. New France = Pre-departure = Prior to her departure, Marie de l'Incarnation had been leading a cloistered life as a member of the Ursuline Order. After having professed her vows in 1633,Jaenen, Cornelius J., \\"Marie de l'Incarnation\\", The Canadian Encyclopedia she changed her name to Marie de L‚ÄôIncarnation; that Christmas, she was confronted with a powerful vision, which functioned as the catalyst for her mission to New France. In this mystical dream, Marie saw herself walking hand in hand with a fellow laywoman against the backdrop of a foreign landscape, on the roof of a small church in this distant, foggy landscape sat the Virgin Mary and Jesus; she interpreted this as the mother and son discussing her religious calling to the new land. She recounted the vision to her priest at the Order, who informed her that the nation she described was Canada, and suggested that she read The Jesuit Relations; from this Marie concluded that her vocation was to help establish the Catholic Faith in the New World. Personal and financial obstacles delayed her departure by four years. Over this time, she maintained a continuous correspondence with Jesuits in Quebec who were supportive of a female religious presence, which might facilitate the Christianization of Huron women; Marie's Mother Superior in Tours, and her pre-Ursuline religious director Dom Raymond de Saint Bernard were largely unsupportive, the latter suggesting that it was too lofty for a lowly laywoman.; Marie was met with similar resistance from her family. Her brother, Claude Guyart attempted to persuade her into abandoning her mission by accusing her of parental neglect, and by revoking an inheritance designated for her son; these measures did not deter her. Marie's initial financial concerns for the funding of the journey, and the establishment of a convent in New France were resolved when she was introduced to Madeleine de la Peltrie on 19 February 1639. Marie recognized that this religiously devoted widow, the daughter of a fiscal officer, was the laywoman from her vision four years earlier. De la Peltrie's contribution to the endeavour was met with strong opposition from her aristocratic family; to garner their support, de la Peltrie arranged a sham marriage with Christian Jean de Breni√®re. Madeleine's new marital status gave her the legal authority to sign over the bulk of her estate to the Ursuline Order, thereby fully funding the mission. Following this, the Ursuline went to Paris, and signed legal contracts with the Company of One Hundred Associates, and the Jesuit Fathers, who were responsible for the colony's political and spiritual life, respectively. The official royal charter sanctioning the establishment of the foundation was signed by Louis XII shortly thereafter. On 4 May 1639, Marie de l‚ÄôIncarnation and Madeleine de la Peltrie, set sail from Dieppe for Quebec on board the Saint Joseph. They were accompanied by a fellow aristocratic Ursuline Marie de Sanoni√®res, the young commoner Charlotte Barr√©, three nurses, and two Jesuit Fathers. = Arrival = In August 1639 the group landed in Quebec City and established a convent in the lower town. When they began their first work at the foot of the mountain, Quebec was but a name. Hardly six houses stood on the site chosen by Champlain thirty-one years previously.Sister Mary of Jesus. \\"Ursulines\\", L‚ÄôEncyclop√©die de l‚Äôhistoire du Qu√©bec, 1948 She and her companions at first occupied a little house in the lower town (Basse-Ville).Fournet, Pierre Auguste. \\"Ven. Marie de l'Incarnation\\", The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 2 April 2016 In 1642 the Ursulines moved to a permanent stone building in the upper town. The group managed to found the first school in what would become Canada, as well as the Ursuline Monastery of Quebec, which has been designated one of the National Historic Sites of Canada.  Early interactions with the native populations  Marie de l‚ÄôIncarnation's early interactions with Native populations were largely shaped by the constraints created by differing lifestyles, illnesses, and alliances. Indigenous divisions of manual and domestic labour by gender and age diverged significantly from European conceptions of masculine and feminine spheres of work. This made it difficult for Marie and the other Ursulines to educate young girls with methods developed in Europe. With European colonization came an influx of illnesses. Smallpox outbreaks from the 1630s to the 1650s ravaged Native populations, leading them to believe that Jesuits and Ursulines were imparting disease through their religious practices, and paraphernalia. Fears that baptisms, holy icons and crosses were the source of all epidemics greatly limited the groups' interactions, and strained Marie's relationship with Natives in her first decades in New France. The most volatile relationship Marie and the Ursulines faced revolved around the conflict pitting the French, Huron and other indigenous allies against the Iroquois. Iroquois hostility towards the Jesuit-allied Hurons shaped Marie's negative view of the Five Nations. Iroquois military victories in the 1650s, and their dominance by the start of the next decade, brought Marie and the Ursulines close to despair. Their distress was heightened by a fire that destroyed their convent in 1650; simultaneous political troubles in France caused European Ursulines to pressure their Canadian sisters to return home, adding to Marie and the Ursulines' stresses, and fears. Such feelings of helplessness were quelled, however, when the convent was reconstructed with seemingly miraculous speed; a blessing attributed to the Virgin Mary. Universalizing Impulses A strong, universalizing impulse underscored Marie de l‚ÄôIncarnation's interactions, and activities in New France. Her perceptions of similarities between European Christians, and the potential converts in the New World were the upshots of a cloistered convent life, and largely non-existent experiences with other cultures; such seclusion allowed for an over-simplification of her ambition to spread God's word transnationally. According to Natalie Zemon Davis, the integrative approach towards Native interactions that developed from this mindset was dissimilar to the Jesuit's methods of establishing relationships in New France. Jesuits, adopted Native roles in the presence of First Nations peoples, but were quick to shed these association when outside the confines of their settlements; this double life made any fully integrative experience, or universal mindset impossible. Marie noticed that Native girls were in possession of commendable traits such as submissiveness, and conscientiousness, which would facilitate their adoption of Christian practices, and their commitment to a Christian marriage; the two pillars of a thorough, universalizing conversion.  Education  In the 17th century, a key pillar of education was religious education. Marie followed a strict orthodox teaching method she learnt during her time with the Ursulines in Tours. The system was based on basics of faith, French and Latin literature and civility. The basics of faith included catechism, prayers and hymns. The main objective of the Ursuline school was to educate young French girls and Natives to become good Christians. The young French girls paid one hundred and twenty livres to cover both their education and pension fees. At the time, the young Native girls did not have to pay for their education. The Ursuline's encouraged the young Montagnais, Hurons and Algonquins to use the seminary as a resource. These girls were taught French mannerisms and were taught how to dress based on French culture. After their education, the young aboriginal students were encouraged to go back to their homes and share their teachings. By educating young girls from different tribes, francization was transmitted from daughter to mother. In her writings, Marie emphasized the fact that the Aboriginal students were treated the same way as the French students at the school. They allowed the girls to sing hymns in both French and their native languages. Many of the nuns created mother-like bonds with the First Nation students. However, there were some problems with the education system during the 17th century. Some students did not stay at the school long enough to receive a complete education. The Ursuline nuns did not have the authority to keep them if the girls want to leave. Another problem was limited economic resources. The school could only accept a limited number of students because of a lack of funds. Death Marie died of a liver illness on 30 April 1672. In the necrology report sent to the Ursulines of France, it was written: \\"The numerous and specific virtues and excellent qualities which shone through this dear deceased, make us firmly believe that she enjoys a high status in God's glory.\\" Works In addition to her religious duties, Marie composed multiple works that reflected her experiences and observations during her time in the New World and the spiritual calling that led her there. In relation to her work with the indigenous population, Marie learned Montagnais, Algonquin, Huron, and Iroquois, writing dictionaries and catechisms in each (none of which have survived to today), as well as in her native French. Marie also wrote two autobiographies, though her second Relation was destroyed in a fire at the convent while still in manuscript. Her most significant writings, however, were the 8,000-20,000 letters she wrote to various acquaintances, the majority of which went to her son Claude. Despite being personal correspondence, some of her letters were circulated throughout France and appeared in The Jesuit Relation in love while she was still alive. Many of the remainder were then published by her son after her death. These letters constitute one of the sources for the history of the French colony from 1639 to 1671. Her collection of works discuss political, commercial, religious and interpersonal aspects of the colony and are helpful in the reconstruction and understanding of New France in the seventeenth century.Marie de l'Incarnation's coffin Canonization Marie was declared venerable in 1874. She was then beatified by Pope John Paul II on 22 June 1980. She was canonized by Pope Francis on 2 April 2014. The Pontiff waived the requirement of two miracles for Marie and she was granted equipollent canonization alongside Fran√ßois de Laval, the first Bishop of Quebec.\\"Mary of the Incarnation\\", Ursulines de l'Union Canadienne Legacy Marie of the Incarnation is a celebrated founder of the Ursuline Order in colonial New France. Her work with the Amerindians has been recognized by the Anglican Church of Canada and they celebrate her life with a feast day on 30 April. A number of Catholic schools have been named after her. At Laval University, in Qu√©bec City, there is the Centre d'√âtudes Marie de l'Incarnation, that is a multi-disciplinary program pertaining to theology and religious practice.253x253px Marie is recognized for her contribution to Canada with a statue that sits in front of the Qu√©bec parliament.

It can also be found as the series Vampire Dusk.  London, 1850  Twelve-year-old Jack Harkett is a street urchin living on the London docks. So when a merchant ship sails into port at twilight, he recognizes it for what it is: an opportunity. But Jack had never seen a ship quite like this one. Aside from a flock of enormous black bats that flies from its hull, there's only one living soul on board - a young stowaway named Benedict Cole. Jack and the wealthy, educated Ben have little in common. But once Jack hears Ben's hair-raising story of an ill-fated expedition to Mexico - and the strange sickness that has followed him back - the two boys find themselves on the same side of a deadly struggle. With no one to turn to and nothing to rely on but their wits, they face a plague the likes of which London has never seen before....  Paris, 1850  Jack wants to believe it was only a dream, that the vampires are gone, that they have been banished by an ancient ritual that sent their leader to the depths of hell. But he is not so sure. That voice still echoes in his mind - the voice of a vampire god promising to return. Jack's friends, Ben and Emily, say it is just his imagination, and he desperately wants to believe them. While Victorian London may be safe, a strange sickness is raging in Paris. A familiar illness that leaves its victims drained of blood. It seems the vampires have moved on with their lives, and the fight must follow them....  Mexico, 1850  Camazotz has managed to secure nearly all the pieces of a powerful amulet that will give him untold strength.

The cocktail is usually consumed during summer months. The drink may be shaken in order to create a foamy surface. It is considered an IBA Official Cocktail. The drink follows the classic cocktail principle of balancing strong (alcohol) with weak (fruit juice) and sweet and sour. A Bay Breeze, or a Hawaiian Sea Breeze, is similar to a Sea Breeze except for the substitution of pineapple juice for grapefruit juice. It is also closely related to the Cape Codder (which lacks the grapefruit juice) and the Salty Dog (which lacks the cranberry juice and is made with a salted rim). History The cocktail was born in the late 1920s, but the recipe was different from the one used today, as gin and grenadine were used in the original Sea Breeze. This was near the end of the Prohibition era. In the 1930s, a Sea Breeze had gin, apricot brandy, grenadine, and lemon juice. Later, a Sea Breeze recipe would contain vodka, dry vermouth, Galliano, and blue Cura√ßao. The cranberry grower's cooperative in the 1930s evolved into Ocean Spray which marketed cranberry juice in the 1950s. Cranberry juice was used as a mixer with alcohol, first with gin and later with vodka. The Harpoon, later called the Cape Codder, was born, and its descendants such as the Greyhound, the Salty Dog, the Bay Breeze, and the Sea Breeze were later created. Starting in the 1960s, the breeze drinks were sporadically in the top ten most popular mixed drinks. According to some, the Sea Breeze, along with the Cape Codder and Bay Breeze, did not become very popular until the 1970s. This was because in 1959, the U.S. Department of Health stated that cranberry crops were tainted with toxic herbicides, collapsing the cranberry industry.

This section's length is approximately 3 miles (4.8 kilometres), but to drive by car from start to finish is only 1.3 miles (2 kilometres) because of river and road geography. This section is graded at 2, with three rapids rated at grade 3. In very high water, some of the grade 2 sections will become continuous and push towards grade 3. Whitewater rapids =List of rapids= Most of the rapids have been named by watersports enthusiasts,http://www.ukriversguidebook.co.uk/swengland/dart.htm UK Rivers Guidebook entry for Dart Loop and are officially referred to in guidebooks, such as English White Water: The British Canoe Union Guidebook.* Ferrero, Franco (2003). English White Water: The British Canoe Union Guidebook. Pesda Press. .https://books.google.com/books?id=SGt7MpOWhikC&lpg;=PP1&dq;=English%20White%20Water%3A&pg;=PA57 English White Water online at Google Books In order of each rapid, they are: Newbridge rapid The first rapid is Newbridge itself, a small wave formed before the bridge which can be played on at low-medium levels, washes out at high levels. Top Wave About 50 metres from Newbridge is a river-wide wave, which gets better with more water flowing over it. Top Wave is very popular with playboaters with eddy service on both sides and a bank side walk back to the car park. Many grade I to II rapids follow. The river splits, with a gauge on the island, where after the River Webburn joins the Dart. Here, a seam between the two river currents forms allowing squirtboaters to practise their sport. Washing Machine A one meter grade III drop, with a stopper and wave train beneath it. The lead in pushes you right. Manoeuvre to river left. In high to very high levels the stopper is quite formidable for novices hence the name \\"Washing Machine\\". Low to medium levels require little effort to pass through. More rapids follow, along with seal- launch rock, a tall sloping rock which can be slid down. Lover's Leap This involves a 100 meter grade III rapid which requires rock evasion and a final wave train which pushes one into the leap itself; a large undercut cliff-face. In anything but high flows the leap is easily avoided but has the potential to pin inexperienced paddlers. Several wide and continuous rapids follow Lover's Leap. However just before the next grade III rapid, a small but sticky stopper appears without warning. This needs to be taken mid-river or one could end up being back-looped, and going over Triple-drop in an awkward position. Triple-drop / Triple-falls The most difficult grade III rapid on this section of the Dart. Inspection and portage are available on both sides of the river. * First drop is a half metre ledge. A pour-over type hole in low levels. * Second drop is a big wave/stopper into a pool. * Thirds drop is harder where the centre line should be taken followed by a move to the left or right. This avoids the centre which turns into a sticky stopper at most levels. Each drop has small eddies on both sides of the river. The pool after the third drop is flat allowing boats and people to be rescued at the river bank. More grade I/II rapids follow before you reach the Spindryer. Spindryer At high levels this rapid can be harder, especially if taken on river right, leaving you in the fast-rotating eddy the rapid is named after. If caught, a fast break-in is needed and possibly a surf across the wave that forms next to it. River left is the ideal place to aim for. More small rapids follow. Haystack rapids The last notable rapid on the river before Holne Bridge, which works best in medium to high levels. Reasonably large but predictable breaking waves carry you 50‚Äì80 metres down to Holne Bridge. Holne Bridge: and lower take outs There is no longer a take out facility at Holne Bridge. Continue down and take out river left above the weir (where there is not really any lay-by facility on the road: temporary stopping might be tolerated) or continue to the next bridge downstream. This carries the road at the entrance to the Country Park. Get out on river right above the bridge. Temporary parking at egress point is possible, but (October 2013) is restricted. The main car park is several hundred metres up the hill. This bridge is frequently called \\"Waterworks Bridge\\". This is very confusing since below Buckfastleigh there is a large waterworks on river right, a bridge, and a good egress point immediately below the bridge on river left. This is very close to the main road on which traffic moves very fast. Stopping in short lane (room for two cars) between the road and river is possible, but parking there is not advisable. The Riverdart Country Park charges (pay and display) during the paddling season ¬£5 per car or ¬£10 per minibus for the day. Parking is free after 4 pm for visitors wanting to use the bar and restaurant. Day visitors also have use of the toilet facilities and communal hot showers on Saturdays and Sundays. The Old Sawmill is open at weekends and offers a Sunday Carvery lunch from noon to 3 pm. A feasible, though fairly long, alternative is to continue down the river to Buckfastleigh where in the winter there is ample parking. This section, the Lower Dart or just \\"Lower\\" is grade 2 with some flat sections. Holne weir In medium to high levels this is a highly retentive stopper and should be treated with caution. Two chutes allow access through, and should not be missed. The lead-in is flat, and is easy to achieve. Portage on the bank is also possible. Another small rapid follows, with the Anvil; a rententive playspot.

Tennyson Inlet is an arm of Pelorus Sound. The bay is immediately north of Tuna Bay which is accessed by the same road. Attractions Penzance's beach is of gravel, which is unusual for this area of the Marlborough Sounds. This gives the beach a good reputation for safe and pleasant swimming. The bay contains a boat ramp, a large wharf, and a swimming island. These facilities coupled with ease of access gives the bay a great reputation for boating activities and fishing. There are walking tracks which link many of the adjacent bays together, such as Duncan Bay and Elaine Bay. Penzance is surrounded with native forest, much of it is untouched. The native forest contains large southern beech trees, Nothofagus species; along with conifers, as well as perching plants and epiphytes. In early summer, large numbers of the New Zealand ground orchid Pterostylis banksii are present along the walking tracks. The Maori name for the orchard is tutukiwi, or beak of a kiwi.

Elbeg was the younger brother of Jorightu Khan and ruled for seven years. His reigning title Nig√ºles√ºgchi Khagan means \\"Merciful Emperor\\" in Mongolian language. Border skirmishes with Ming China and the Oirat rebellion plagued his reign. Reign During his reign, the Oirats began to openly challenge the Borjigin family and the Ming repulsed Mongolian invasions. According to Tsagaan Sechen, Elbeg was charged with responsibility for all things wrong. To prevent hostilities from the Taifu's family, he gave his daughter Samur Gunj in marriage to the Taifu's son. Ugetchi Khashikha who was ruler of the Oirads at the time, resisted the Khagan's decision to appoint a new ruler over his tribes. He persuaded Batula that the violent khan who had killed his own kin could was not fit to be Emperor. Batula wanted to avenge the death of his father as well. In 1399, Elbeg Nig√ºles√ºgchi Khagan was defeated by the Four Oirats and was killed by their leaders, Ugetchi Khashikha and Batula, as a result. Several months after his death, his crown was succeeded by his eldest son G√ºn Tem√ºr Khan.

He was a son of Elbeg Nig√ºles√ºgchi Khan and younger brother of G√ºn Tem√ºr Khan. He was one of the Borjigin princes, such as Tokhtamysh and Tem√ºr Qutlugh, backed by Timur to seize the throne.  Early life  Tsagaan Sechen tells that Bunyashiri (Buyanshir) was born in 1379.Sir Henry Hoyle Howorth-History of the Mongols: The Mongols proper and the Kalmuks, p. 343. Twenty years after his birth, his father, Elbeg, was murdered by the Oirats led by Bahamu and Guilichi. In 1402, his older brother, G√ºn Tem√ºr Khan was killed by √ñr√ºg Tem√ºr Khan Guilichi in the struggle for the crown. =Conversion to Islam= Due to internal struggles of the Mongols, the infant prince, Bunyashiri, fled to Beshbalik where Timur's governor stationed. Timur ordered his governor to receive him kindly. Bunyashiri converted to Islam while he stayed at the court of Timur in Samarkand, thus making √ñljei Tem√ºr Khan one of the very notable converts to Islam from the house of Kublai Khan.C. P. Atwood-Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire, see: Northern Yuan Dynasty =Abolishing the name Yuan by Guilichi= However, √ñr√ºg Tem√ºr Khan Guilichi's victory was short-lived when he made several grave miscalculations. The first was when he replaced the Mongol Khan with a Tatar Khan, alienating many other Mongol clans that were not Tatar. The second one was that √ñr√ºg Tem√ºr Khan Guilichi abolished the name \\"Great Yuan\\" (the official name of the former Yuan dynasty), because he needed to show friendly and subordinating gestures towards Ming China so that he could consolidate his power and conquer other Mongol clans. This move was totally unacceptable to most if not all Mongols who wanted to recover their former glory and retake China proper by defeating the Ming Empire, which originally began as rebellions against the Mongol Yuan. Rise of Bunyashiri Taking the opportunity, Bunyashiri declared himself the new Khan with the title of √ñljei Tem√ºr (”®–ª–∑–∏–π —Ç”©–º”©—Ä) at Beshbalik in 1403 and most Mongol clans soon rallied on his side. Arughtai of the Asud acknowledged his suzerainty and was made chingsang (grand chancellor) to him. Oljei Tem√ºr Khan Bunyashiri's direct linkage of Genghis Khan line only further strengthened his position: though √ñr√ºg Tem√ºr Khan declared himself as Khan, his claim was not recognized by most Mongol clans. The Ming court stepped up its divide and rule tactics on Northern Yuan Mongols by dispatching a eunuch, Wan An, to help Bunyashiri.Shih-Shan Henry Tsai-Perpetual Happiness: The Ming Emperor Yongle, p. 166. √ñr√ºg Tem√ºr Khan Guilichi was soon defeated and although Guilichi's son continued to carry on the struggle for the position of the khan all the way till his death in 1425, they were never be able to pose any serious threat to Bunyashiri's force, whose main enemy was the Ming Empire. In 1409, the Ming court bestowed upon the Oirat leaders the title of wang (Áéã; vassal king or prince), exacerbating the Mongol-Oirat conflict. √ñljei Tem√ºr Khan attacked the Four Oirats and failed to subjugate his stubborn subjects. After hearing of a new Borjigin ruler consolidating his power over the Mongols, the Yongle Emperor of the Ming Empire demanded √ñljei Tem√ºr Khan to submit. The Mongol court decided to decline it and detained the Ming envoy. Arughtai executed another Ming envoy in 1409.Ed. Frederick W. Mote, Denis Twitchett, John King Fairbank-The Cambridge history of China: The Ming dynasty, 1368‚Äì1644, Part 1, p. 226. A punitive expedition of the Ming Empire led by Qiu Fu (‰∏òÁ¶è) was crushed and the general and several other commanders lost their lives at the hand of Arughtai on September 23, 1409.Shih-Shan Henry Tsai-Perpetual Happiness: The Ming Emperor Yongle, p. 167.  War against Ming China  In response to the defeat of the Ming forces led by Qiu Fu, the enraged Yongle Emperor gathered a half-a-million-strong force to launch a decisive campaign against √ñljei Tem√ºr Khan Bunyashiri. Before the battle, √ñljei Tem√ºr Khan and Arughtai could not agree on a plan of action and simply moved in different directions.Denis Crispin Twitchett, John King Fairbank-The Cambridge history of China, Volume 2; Volume 8, p. 229. Arughtai decided to withdraw to the east of Mongolia while √ñljei Tem√ºr Khan Bunyashiri headed west and set up his ordo (palace) on the banks of the Onon River. He was suddenly forced to accept a battle in which the Ming army won a resounding victory by nearly completely wiping out his entire army on 15 June 1410. √ñljei Tem√ºr Khan Bunyashiri was barely able to escape with his life with only seven horsemen and his son while all the rest were lost. He was trying to reach the Chagatai Khanate where he grew up. Capitalizing on the Khan's mistake, the Oirat leader, Mahamud, killed him in 1412 and installed his own puppet khan, Delbeg (or Dalbag), on the throne in 1413.Edward L. Dreyer-Early Ming China: a political history, 1355‚Äì1435, p. 178. The death of √ñljei Tem√ºr Khan Bunyashiri marked the temporary decline of the Borjigin line, and different Mongol clans fought each other for dominance.

Built in 1850-52 to a design by noted South Carolina architect Edward C. Jones, it is a notable example of rammed earth construction with relatively high style Gothic Revival styling. It was designated a National Historic Landmark for its architecture in 1973. In 2013, the Church of the Holy Cross disaffiliated with the Episcopal Church and realigned with the Anglican denomination. Description and history The church stands on the east side of North Kings Highway, west of the city of Sumter. Its walls, constructed of yellow rammed earth, stand tall, and are covered in stucco, with buttressing at the corners and long sides of its cruciform plan. A tower stands attached to one end, and the steeply-pitched roof is finished in tile. Window and door openings are in the shape of Gothic arches. The church interior is painted gray in a manner resembling stone. The church was built in 1850-52 on land donated earlier by American Revolutionary War General Thomas Sumter. It was designed by Edward C. Jones, one of South Carolina's leading architects; a prolific designer, only a relatively small number of his works now survive. and Across the road from the church is Borough House Plantation, the home of Dr. William Wallace Anderson, chairman of the committee that built the church. In 1820, Dr. Anderson had built his own house of rammed earth on the plantation. With its additional rammed earth outbuildings, the plantation complex is also a National Historic Landmark, and both form part of the Stateburg Historic District. The Church of the Holy Cross is still an active Anglican parish in the Anglican Church in North America's Diocese of South Carolina. The church still has its original Erben pipe organ installed in 1851. An 18-month, $2.3 million restoration to repair extensive termite damage was completed late January 2010 under the then-rector the Rev. Fr. Thomas W. Allen.Restoration pictures, March through August 2009Restoration pictures, August 2009 through February 2010 In 2013, the church disaffiliated itself from the Protestant Episcopal Church and realigned with the Anglican denomination.

It was notable for its longevity and for some of its illustrious alumni. History The earliest schools in Walden dated from 1423 under the control of the neighbouring monastery.Player, John Sketches of Saffron Walden, and its Vicinity. Youngman, 1845 The Grammar School was founded by Dame Joan Bradbury in 1522. Lady Joan was the wife of London's Lord Mayor Thomas Bradbury (d.1510); her brother, John Leche, was the Rector of Saffron Walden. The grammar school by its constitution was for the benefit of the town and three villages in its vicinity. Joan and her brother, along with the local abbot and monastery, arranged its endowment with local guilds. They erected a school house and school room and Dame Joan \\"granted a rent charge for the support of a priest and to teach the children grammar after the order and use of Winchester and Eton.\\" In some histories, the school is deemed the successor of the 1423 establishment and thus has been described as having been refounded by Edward VI. The school bore the Tudor royal armsA. C. Edwards, History of Essex, Chichester: Phillimore, 1994; p. 80 Buildings The original building, designed for 60 pupils, flanked the churchyard wall. It was replaced in 1655 by new premises in Castle Street. After over two hundred years in these buildings, which in part still stand today, the school moved to new buildings in 1881 in Ashdon Road which remained the home of the school until the Second World War. During World War II the 8th Air Force's 65th fighter wing (which was assigned the additional duty of Air Sea Rescue) had its fighter control center in the building because of its proximity to Debden airfield.

History As J Mullahey of Pan American Airways set about organizing the first Pacific area travel conference with the aim of promoting tourism to the largely undiscovered region of Asia Pacific.Chuck Y Gee, Matt Lurie, \\"The Story of the Pacific Asia Travel\\" The purpose of the meeting, Lorrin P. Thurstin noted, was to ‚Äúdiscuss cooperation among Pacific countries that would result in a greater exchange of visitors to their mutual advantage, and to develop methods of presenting the Pacific area to the world‚Äôs travelers and the travel trade by reducing restrictions on Pacific travel, filling in accommodation gaps, and presenting the Pacific story in advertising and publicity‚Äù. In March 1951, invitations were sent out for the conference, which was to be held in the first week of June, from the office of Hawaii's territorial governor, Ingram Stainback. Unfortunately many of the replies came in too late and the conference was postponed. It was then in October 1951 that Thurstin, who was in Paris attending a European travel conference, issued his now-famous cable to Mullahey: \\"Proceed to send invitations to governments and carriers to attend Pacific Area Travel conference for purpose of establishing permanent Pacific Travel Association and determine most convenient date for majority during first three months 1952.\\" The inaugural conference eventually took place from January 10‚Äì15, 1952 at the Maluhia Auditorium of Fort DeRussy in Waikiki, Hawaii. There were 91 delegates in attendance at the conference, including representatives of government and business. Aside from Thurston and Mullahey, those taking a key role at this event were: Robert Allen, chairman of registration and housing; Melvin A. Conant, chairman of conference organisation; Harry Dove, chairman of counselor liaison; John Pugh, co- chairman of entertainment; John Jay Murphy, co-chairman of program and protocol; William O. Cogswell, Sam N. Mercer and Steward E. Fern of the Hawaii Visitors Bureau, and Milton O. Holst of Holst & Cummings, Lrd. On Tuesday, January 15, 1952, Lorrin Thurston announced that 25 active and 12 allied members had signed the constitution and bylaws of what was now known as the Pacific Interim Travel Association (PITA). PITA was legally incorporated in the state of Hawaii two months later. The new association's constitution declared its purpose was ‚ÄúTo encourage and assist in the development of the travel industries throughout the Pacific area‚Äù. While marketing activities were its primary goal, the delegates of the first conference also envisioned the association as one that could work with both government and private business in developing travel. One of PATA's main accomplishments in its first year was to publicise itself to the international travel community. The association's first executive director Sam Mercer noted that the first conference ‚Äúfocused the attention of the entire travel world on an awakening of tourism in the Pacific‚Äù. News articles and press releases were sent to, and subsequently published in, numerous publications ‚Äì including both specialist travel press and general audience newspapers. A particularly effective vehicle for PITA's self-promotion was its quarterly newspaper, PITA News Bulletin, which by the end of its first year was being sent to over 500 addresses throughout the world. In its first year, PITA also worked with governments to ease entry and exit requirements for foreigners, seeing success in Japan, the US and the Philippines. By the second conference in March 1953 (held in Hawaii like the first) PITA had increased its membership from 33 active and allied members to 49. It was also at this conference that it was decided to change the association's name to the ‚ÄòPacific Area Travel Association‚Äô ‚Äì or PATA. =1950s= In 1953 PATA's headquarters were moved from Hawaii to San Francisco, with Sam Mercer serving as the first executive director. Considered as the state of ‚Äúmoney and influence‚Äù, San Francisco was home to an influential group of individuals who served on the PATA board and committees during the 1950s and 1960s. Throughout the first decade, PATA membership grew steadily, attracting a wide range of members including governments, carriers, hotel members, travel agents, cruise lines and the media. Other members eventually included tour operators, educational institutions, vehicle operators, restaurants and catering services, advertising agencies, public relations firms, publications, banks and architectural and research firms. By the end of the 1950s, PATA had 325 members, while there had also been a steady rise in the annual conference attendance. In 1955, a Research and Survey Committee was established and PATA delegates gave their approval to spend US$8,000 on the organisation's first advertising programme. In 1957 the first issue of Pacific Travel News (PTN) was published, providing PATA with a news vehicle to promote itself and its destinations. =1960s= In 1958, PATA's Board of Directors requested that the US International Cooperation Administration provide US$150,000 for a comprehensive study of the Pacific countries. The results of the survey, which became known as the 'Checchi Report', were presented at the 1962 Annual Conference. It presented to PATA members and NTOs the status of tourism in the Pacific region, both area-wide and individually by country. It contained information regarding the anticipated impact of tourist expenditure, the effects of tourism on jobs and wages, methods of financing tourism development and projections for US visitor arrivals to the Pacific region. The report quickly became a blueprint for many NTO and travel planners, as it methodically presented the economic benefits ‚Äì both direct and indirect ‚Äì derived from tourism. 1961 saw the establishment of the first PATA Chapters in New Zealand and Hong Kong. The development of the chapter system was an effort to involve professionals in the travel and tourism industry who could not participate in PATA's activities or attend annual conference and workshops, and to expand PATA's presence in previously untapped markets. The 1960s also witnessed PATA's first move towards promoting education and training, helping to set up the School of TIM (Tourism Industry Management) at the University of Hawaii ‚Äì the first such institution to be established in the region. =1970s= At the 23rd Annual Conference, held in Jakarta in 1974, it was decided that there should be a change of emphasis in PATA's function to enable more support for the developmental aspects of tourism within the Pacific area, particularly in industry, education and training. Members stipulated that a new, permanent body be formed, with the name 'Development Authority'. This advisory body would be composed of experts from diverse backgrounds and specialisations, whose purpose would be to carry out the association's intentions towards heritage conservation, education and training, and environmental enhancement. At its second meeting in August 1974, the newly formed Development Authority accepted its first assignment. It followed a request from Lieutenant General Chalermchai Charuvastr, Director General of the Tourist Organisation of Thailand (TOT), to PATA executive director Marvin Plake to help increase tourism in Thailand. The TOT Director General proposed Chiang Mai as an ideal location for the development of tourism and so PATA sent a travel trade mission ‚Äì or 'task force' as they later became known ‚Äì to the northern city. The task force completed its mission in February 1975. Its report \\"Chiang Mai: A Program or Expanding the Airport\\" contained a two-stage list of recommendations and addressed the areas of sight-seeing attractions, marketing, air service, air cargo, airport development, community relations and statistical record-keeping. The years following the task force saw visitor arrivals to Chiang Mai increase, however there was still a relatively poor showing in foreign arrivals. PATA dispatched a second task force team to the city in 1977 where, amongst other issues, they considered the economics of international air service there. Their report \\"Chiang Mai, The Introduction of International Air Service\\", contained both short and long-term recommendations which were submitted to TOT. The Thai government later implemented a development plan for Chiang Mai largely based on PATA's blueprint. The 1970s also saw the first ever PATA Travel Mart in Manila (1978). The highly successful and popular event was the brainchild of then-PATA Staff Vice President Gerald Picolla, who saw the potential of such marts to generate huge volumes of business for participating member organisations at a fraction of the cost of doing business on the road. =1980s= In 1984 the PATA Board of Directors approved the creation of the PATA Foundation, creating a new role for the association as a benefactor of culture and heritage policy by administering project funding. Under the leadership of its first chair, George Howling, the foundation began securing funds for education, research and heritage conservation. The foundation sought assistance from PATA Chapters in carrying out is work, including the production of professional papers on handicraft preservation, area-wide inventories of heritage assets, and conservation programs for endangered wildlife. At first larger projects were targeted, but the focus then turned to small projects as it enabled the foundation to distribute its assistance more efficiently and effectively. For example, in 1988, the foundation funded the inventory and architectural record-keeping of historic buildings for a historic district preservation project in Pokhara, Nepal. 1986 saw PATA change its name from Pacific Area Travel Association to Pacific Asia Travel Association to reflect the ever-increasing importance of Asia in commerce and world affairs. The first World Chapters Congress in 1989 attracted 250 delegates from 58 chapters with ‚ÄòTeamwork Toward Success‚Äô as the theme. =1990s= With tourism to PATA member countries booming, concerns began to grow about environmental, cultural and heritage preservation. At the 1991 Annual Conference in Bali, PATA's 40th, there was a call from over 1,500 delegates from more than 50 countries to promote ecologically responsible travel and tourism under the conference theme 'Enrich the Environment'. This occasion marked the beginning of PATA's role as an 'authoritative' voice for sustainable tourism in the Pacific Asia region and in January 1992, the PATA Board of Directors approved the PATA 'Code for Environmentally Responsible Tourism' and it was officially adopted at the Annual Conference in Hong Kong later that same year. 1992: PATA publication: Endemic Tourism: A profitable industry in a sustainable environment. ‚ÄòThe tourism industry must be profitable and environmentally sustainable if it is to provide long-term benefits, but this will not be achieved without a new and different approach to industry planning and development.‚Äô 1992: After intense discussions and negotiations, the China National Tourism Administration (CNTA) joined PATA as a government member 1993: PATA/WTO Human Resources for Tourism Conference : 4‚Äì6 October 1993, Bali, Indonesia 1994: Lahore, Pakistan: PATA Adventure Travel and Ecotourism Conference. Photo from Lahore, 1994 Further environmental efforts came in 1994, when PATA's Green Leaf program was launched, with the aim of encouraging members to incorporate CERT (Code for Environmentally Responsible Tourism) into their operations. It became a centerpiece of PATA's initiatives in the area of sustainable tourism, but was later integrated into the WTTC-run Green Globe programme in 2000. 1996: Pokara, Nepal: PATA Adventure Travel and Ecotourism Conference. Following the Gulf War, PATA created the Accelerated Marketing Program (AMP), designed to support member destinations affected by conflict. The end of the decade ‚Äì 1998 ‚Äì saw PATA relocated its head office from San Francisco to Bangkok to be in the heart of its membership region. =2000s= 2000: PATA Task Force North Sulawesi: Noakes, Steve.

In 2003 PATA launches Project Phoenix, a global consumer communications campaign to re-invigorate travel and tourism in Pacific Asia. It came in response to the battering the travel industry and economies in the region had taken due to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the US, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Bali bombs and SARS. This year also saw PATA adopt the ‚ÄòAllied Partner‚Äô concept, inviting local, regional and national tourist bodies outside PATA's geographic region to gain access to Asia Pacific's outbound markets. 2004 saw PATA change its Mission Statement to include tourism ‚Äòto, from and within‚Äô Asia Pacific, thereby recognizing the importance of the region as a growing outbound market. Following the December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, PATA launches a relief fund. Driven by the leadership of the Sustainable Tourism Committee, the 2006 PATA AGM accepted a new Mission Statement for PATA, which for the first time, embodies the concepts of 'responsible development' and 'sustainable growth' of tourism in the region. It now reads: 'The Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA) is a membership association acting as a catalyst for the responsible development of the Asia Pacific travel and tourism industry. In partnership with PATA's private and public sector members, we enhance the sustainable growth, value and quality of travel and tourism to, from and within the region‚Äô. With the support of CNTA, the PATA Beijing Office is set up in 2007 ‚Äì the first travel related international organisation officially registered in China. In 2008 PATA provides crisis communication training to Chengdu's tourism industry just one month after the Sichuan earthquake, while the PATA Foundation grants a post-crisis Fund for Sichuan. In 2010 PATA launched the Travel Intelligence Graphic Architecture (TIGA) initiative to enable better decision making by tourism professionals. On 17 September 2010, it was announced that current CEO Greg Duffell would leave PATA by February 2011 after just 18 months in the role In July 2012, PATA re-established its Hong Kong Chapter. Present In 2011 PATA celebrate its 60th anniversary with a series of activities and events focused around the theme 'Building Tourism. Past.Present.Progressive'. On September 6‚Äì9, PATA Travel Mart 2011 held at Pragati Maidan, New Delhi, India. In 2012, at the Annual General Meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, PATA launched PATAmPOWER, which was an enhancement of the Travel Intelligence Graphic Architecture (TIGA) initiative redeveloped in HTML5, to enable use by mobile devices. The objective of PATAmPOWER is to be your one stop for data about the Asia Pacific visitor economy, improving productivity, providing faster insights and enabling smarter decisions. In 2013, PATA appoints a Corporate Social Responsibility specialist who facilitates signing of MOU with the Global Sustainable Tourism Council, the international body fostering increased knowledge and understanding of sustainable tourism practices by destinations and tourism enterprises. In 2013 PATA helped to align industry advocacy with other travel and tourism industry bodies, formally launching the Global Travel Association Coalition (GTAC). PATA is a founding member of this global group which also includes Airports Council International (ACI), Cruise Line International Association (CLIA), International Air Transport Association (IATA), International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), World Economic Forum (WEF), World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) and the World Travel & Tourism Council. In the same year PATA also launched an interactive training programme PATAcademy-HCD, incorporating intensive classroom interactions led by leading travel industry practitioners with practical activities, group assignments, networking events and field visits in and around Bangkok. On November 1, 2014, PATA appointed Mario Hardy as its Chief Executive Officer (CEO), succeeding Martin Craigs. Mr Hardy had previously been Chief Operations Officer (COO) of PATA since January 15, 2014. On November 7, 2014 PATA and Myriad Marketing launched PATA Conversations, a B2B digital publication focusing upon travel and tourism to, from and within the Asia Pacific region. On December 2014 PATA launched the monthly Connected Visitor Economy Bulletin, making it free to both members and non-members. The Connected Visitor Economy Bulletin is produced on a monthly basis and covers trends and developments across the Asia Pacific region. It aims to monitor the far-reaching impact of travel and tourism across national economies, in order to encourage better and more comprehensive policy responses from governments in support of the sector. On February 17, 2015, the Tourism Industry Association New Zealand (TIA) and PATA sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that focuses on four main areas of co-operation: the sharing of information and insight, support for collective policy and advocacy positions, industry connectivity, and collaboration on mutual events. On March 4, 2015, PATA launched its new microsite, sustain.pata.org. The site, a new online tool for information on sustainable and socially responsible travel and tourism issues, is supported in part by the German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development BMZ, implemented by Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, and by EarthCheck. On May 4, 2015, in response to the earthquake that killed and injured thousands of people and devastated much of Kathmandu's tourism infrastructure nine days earlier, the PATA Foundation established a Nepal Earthquake Tourism Recovery Fund to assist the PATA Nepal Chapter in its tourism industry recovery efforts. On May 27, 2015, PATA, in partnership with TripAdvisor, launched the PATA CEO Challenge to help promote uniqueness and diversity of heritage, culture, customs and natural beauty of the world's many diverse destinations. It aims to promote and enhance the number of visitors to emerging destinations and enhances tourism development in the most sustainable manner. On June 21, 2015 PATA presented Nepal with the PATA Nepal Tourism Rapid Recovery Task Force Report to help the country recover from the devastating earthquake that killed and injured thousands of people and devastated much of Kathmandu's tourism infrastructure. On June 10, 2015 PATA announced the inaugural PATA Global Insights Conference 2015, to be hosted in Auckland, New Zealand on October 16, 2015 at the SKYCITY Grand Hotel. The conference explored the key influences that will drive and shape future thinking in terms of tourism destination development, design, access and marketing. On June 24, 2015 PATA and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) created a new partnership, in the form of a memorandum of understanding (MoU), recognising the positive impacts that their collaboration can have in the areas of conservation and sustainable development. The specific objectives of the MoU include collaboration in capacity building, knowledge sharing, and networking, both online and in person. PATA members may now increase their knowledge of wider sustainability issues, particularly in relation to Mangroves for the Future (MFF) and coastal tourism, as well as IUCN case studies showcasing positive examples of sustainable tourism on PATA's sustainability website, sustain.pata.org. On November 19, 2015 PATA forged an organisational partnership with the International Gay and Lesbian Travel Association (IGLTA). The agreement strengthens the bond and shared interests between the two associations.

The Taylor Spatial Frame (TSF) is an external fixator used by podiatric and orthopaedic surgeons to treat complex fractures and bone deformities. The medical device shares a number of components and features of the Ilizarov apparatus. The Taylor Spatial Frame is a hexapod device based on a Stewart platform, and was invented by orthopaedic surgeon Charles Taylor. The device consists of two or more aluminum or carbon fibre rings connected by six struts. Each strut can be independently lengthened or shortened to achieve the desired result, e.g. compression at the fracture site, lengthening, etc. Connected to a bone by tensioned wires or half pins, the attached bone can be manipulated in three dimensions and 9 degrees of freedom. Angular, translational, rotational, and length deformities can all be corrected simultaneously with the TSF. The TSF is used in both adults and children. It is used for the treatment of acute fractures, mal-unions, non-unions and congenital deformities. It can be used on both the upper and lower limbs. Specialised foot rings (which are not seen in the picture) are also available for the treatment of complex foot deformities.  Post Operative procedure  = Correcting deformities = Once the fixator is attached to the bone, the deformity is characterised by studying the postoperative x-rays, or CT scans. The angular, translational, rotational, and length deformity values are then entered into specialised software, along with mounting parameters and hardware parameters such as the ring size and initial strut lengths. The software then produces a \\"prescription\\" of strut changes that the patient follows. The struts are adjusted daily by the patient until the correct alignment is achieved. Correction of the bone deformity can typically take 3‚Äì4 weeks. For simpler fractures where no deformity is present the struts may still be adjusted post-surgery to achieve better bone alignment, but the correction takes less time. For individuals performing strut adjustment. a hand mirror may be useful to aid in reading the strut settings. Once the deformity has been corrected, the frame is then left on the limb until the bone fully heals. This often takes 3‚Äì6 months, depending on the nature and degree of deformity. = Dynamisation = When the bone has sufficiently healed, the frame can be dynamised. This is a process of gradually reducing the supportive role of the frame by reducing the length stability. This causes force that was previously transmitted around the fracture site and through the struts to be transmitted through the bone. = Removal of frame = After a period of dynamisation, the frame can be removed. This is a relatively simple procedure often performed under gas and air analgesic. The rings are removed by cutting the olive wires using wire cutters. The wires are then removed by first sterilising them and then pulling them through the leg using pliers. The threaded half pins are simply unscrewed.  Use for fractures  External fixation via TSFs tends to be less invasive than internal fixation and therefore has lower risks of infection associated with it. This is particularly relevant for open fractures. For open comminuted fractures of the tibial plateau the use of circular frames (like TSF) has markedly reduced infection rates. The time taken for bones to heal (time to union) varies depending on a number of factors. Open fractures take longer to heal, and infection will delay union. For tibial fractures union is generally achieved after between 3 and 6 months, though time to union can be rather subjective, and the dynamistion process combined with irregular appointments may interfere with these measures. Infection Infection of the pin sites (points where wires enter the skin) of the TSF is a common complication (estimates are that it affects 20% percent of patients). In extreme cases this can result in osteomylitis which is difficult to treat. However, pin site infections are normally successfully treated with a combination of oral antibiotics, intravenous antibiotics, or removal of the affected pin. Pin sites are classified as percutaneous wounds Best practice for maintenance of pin sites is unclear and requires more study. Common practice involves the regular cleaning of the pin sites with chlorhexidine gluconate solution (advice varies from every day to every week), regular showering, and dressing of sites that exude liquid with non-woven gauze soaked in chlorhexidine gluconate. This dressing can be held in place with bungs or makeshift clips or by twisting around the wire. Advice varies as to whether scab tissue or any \\"crust\\" surrounding a pin site should be maintained. With some literature arguing that this acts as a barrier to entry, while other literature argues this may increase the risk of infection. Cost of treatment The taylor spatial frame is a general tool for fixating and moving bone fragments in a gradual way. This means that costs can vary dramatically. The cost of a frame itself was around 2,500 pounds sterling in 2006 though this cost will vary depending on the number of components in the frame. Cases involving treatment of nonunion of fracture are complicated and time-consuming with costs of around 30,000 pounds sterling in 2006 and treatment can take between 1 and 2 years. Of these costs about 23,000 pound sterling reflect follow-up outpatient treatment and cost for hospital stays, which can vary dramatically between patients.

Early years Inman was born at Tod Hole in Garsdale, the younger son of Richard Inman and Jane Hutchinson. He was educated at Sedbergh Grammar School and St John's College, Cambridge, graduating as first Smith's prizeman and Senior Wrangler for 1800. Among his close college friends was Henry Martyn. After graduating with first class honours in 1800, Inman intended to undertake missionary work in the Middle East, in Syria, but due to a declaration of war could travel no further than Malta, where he continued to study Arabic. Astronomer for Matthew Flinders, 1803‚Äì04 Returning to England, the Board of Longitude appointed him as replacement astronomer (the original astronomer, suffering from severe seasickness, was discharged en route to Australia) on the expedition of under Matthew Flinders charting Australian waters in 1803‚Äì1804. Arriving at Sydney too late to join in Flinders' circumnavigation of Australia, he assisted in concluding the expedition. At this time he became a firm friend of Flinders' nephew, John Franklin, then midshipman. He also befriended the Investigator's artist, William Westall, for whom he later wrote letters of introduction. While on board the East Indiaman Warley for his return to Britain, he participated in the Battle of Pulo Auro. Here he temporarily commanded a party of lascar pikemen.Harry W. Dickins. 2007. Educating the Royal Navy: 18th and 19th Century Education for Officers. (London: Routledge), p.47. Professor, Royal Naval College He was ordained into the Anglican ministry in 1805 when he gained his MA. Three years later he received an appointment as Professor of Nautical Mathematics at the Royal Naval College. In 1821 he published Navigation and Nautical Astronomy for Seamen; these nautical mathematical tables, known as Inman's Nautical Tables, remained in use for many years. In the third edition (1835) he introduced a new table of haversines (the term was his coinage. 2nd ed. 1989. (Fourth edition: .)) to simplify the calculation of distances between two points on the surface of the earth using spherical trigonometry. (For details of the calculation, see Haversine formula.) At his suggestion, in 1810 the Admiralty established a School of Naval Architecture; the Admiralty also appointed Inman its first Principal. In 1812 he conducted experiments with Flinders which led to the invention of the Flinders Bar, used for marine compass correction. At the same time as teaching in the school and publishing mathematical texts for the use of his pupils, he translated a French text on the architecture of shipbuilding, and continued his own studies, gaining his doctorate in Divinity in 1820. In recognition of his work in nautical astronomy he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society. He also directed the design and construction of no less than ten British warships, of which he was proud to state that none ever had the slightest mishap due to an error of design or form. He retired in 1839, but continued living in Portsmouth until his death twenty years later, on 7 February 1859, aged 83. Family and Legacy His wife Mary, daughter of Richard Williams, vicar of All Saints' Church, Oakham, Rutland, was a direct descendant of Hannah Ayscough, the mother of Sir Isaac Newton. James and Mary Inman had seven children. Their eldest son was James Williams Inman (1809‚Äì1895), Cambridge BA 1833, MA 1836, headmaster of The King's School, Grantham. Their youngest son Henry Inman (1816‚Äì1895), was founder and first commander of the South Australia Police.Max Slee Inman : first commander of the South Australia Police, Seaview Press (Adelaide 2010) . In Franklin's first North American expedition he named Inman Harbour 'after my friend the Professor at the Royal Naval College'. During Franklin's second arctic voyage in 1826 his surveyor named the Inman River, northwest of Coppermine River, Canada, after Inman. In December 1829 a headland of perpendicular cliffs at Tierra del Fuego was named Cape Inman, 'in compliment to the Professor', during the voyages of HMS Adventure and HMS Beagle.

Biography Eurytus was a disciple of Philolaus, and Diogenes La√´rtiusDiogenes La√´rtius iii. 6, viii. 46 mentions him among the teachers of Plato, though this statement is very doubtful. It is uncertain whether Eurytus was the author of any work, unless we suppose that the fragment in Stobaeus,Stobaeus, Phys. Ecl. i. which is there ascribed to one Eurytus, belongs to this Eurytus. Through a dubious commentary to Aristotle's Metaphysics a caricatural image of Eurytus has gained wide currency. A mediaeval writer confused with Alexander of Aphrodisias presented Eurytos as a kind of mosaic-setter who delineated various shapes with some definite number of pebbles.Reviel Netz,The problem of Pythagorean mathematics in A History of Pythagoreanism, ed C. Huffman, Cambridge UP, 2014: \\" Pseudo-Alexander, writing not earlier than late antiquity and probably in Byzantium, tried to imagine Eurytus‚Äô procedure; he ended up with Eurytus the mosaicist...(p.175)\\" Reviel Netz forcefully commented that \\"pseudo-Alexander‚Äôs picture of Eurytus the mosaicist is a non-starter for it is evidently idiotic\\"and he noted that \\"while Theophrastus and Aristotle both consider Eurytus‚Äô results patently false, nothing suggests they consider his procedure silly\\". Taking in account specific mathematical usage he suggested an emended translation of the original passage from Aristotle's work (Metaphysics 1092b9-13): According to the historian's from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Philolaus and Eurytus are identified by Aristoxenus as teachers of the last generation of Pythagoreans (D.

PML protein is a tumor suppressor protein required for the assembly of a number of nuclear structures, called PML-nuclear bodies, which form amongst the chromatin of the cell nucleus. These nuclear bodies are present in mammalian nuclei, at about 1 to 30 per cell nucleus. PML-NBs are known to have a number of regulatory cellular functions, including involvement in programmed cell death, genome stability, antiviral effects and controlling cell division. PML mutation or loss, and the subsequent dysregulation of these processes, has been implicated in a variety of cancers.  History  PML was poorly understood until described in the findings of Grignani et al in their 1996 study of patients with acute promylocytic leukemia (APL). It was found that the karyotype of 90% of APL patients included a reciprocal translocation, resulting in the fusion of the Retinoic Acid Receptor (RARalpha) gene of chromosome 17 and the PML gene of chromosome 15, which had not previously been characterized. The resultant PML/RARalpha oncofusion gene was shown to disturb normal PML and RARalpha function, thus inhibiting the terminal differentiation of blood precursor cells and allowing the maintenance of a reserve of undifferentiated cells for cancerous progression. This implication of the PML gene in a pathological context led to a greater focus on the gene in future years.  Structure  The PML gene is roughly 53 kilobase pairs in length and is located on the q arm of chromosome 15. It consists of 10 exons that are subject to shuffling through alternative splicing, yielding more than 15 known PML protein isoforms. While the isoforms vary at their c-terminal domain, they all contain a TRIpartite motif encoded by the first three exons of the gene. The TRIpartite motif consists of a zinc RING finger, two zinc binding domains, termed the B1 and B2 boxes, and an RBCC dimerization domain composed of two alpha helical coiled coil domains. The PML gene is under control at the transcriptional, translational and post translational control. The promoter region of the gene contains targets of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STATs), interferon regulatory factors, and p53 protein, indicating the intricacy of its involvement in cellular functions. In addition to regulation through alternative splicing, the protein product is subject to post-translational modifications such as acetylation and phosphorylation. The c-terminus contains serine residues that are phosphorylated by casein kinases, and there are several tyrosine and threonine residues which can also be phosphorylation targets. PML phosphorylation triggers further modification through the attachment of SUMO proteins to the RING domain by UBC9 SUMO- conjugating enzyme, which occurs in a cell cycle dependent way. PML contains a SUMO-binding domain necessary for its interaction with other SUMOylated proteins such as itself and many others. Both ubiquitination and SUMOylation of PML protein can trigger its degradation in the proteasome, thus providing a means of modulating PML protein lability within the cell. PML is translated in the cytoplasm of the cell, but its N-terminus contains a nuclear localization signal which causes its import to the nucleus. Within the nucleus, sumoylated PML proteins multimerize with one another through interactions at the RBCC domain.This forms a ring-like structure that binds to the nuclear matrix, forming a PML-Nuclear body (PML-NB). The edge of the ring-like protein mutimer features protein threads that extend out from the ring and make contact with chromatin fibers. This maintains the position of the PML-NBs within the nucleus, as well as the stability of the protein. When the chromatin is stressed, such as during apoptosis, the PML-NB becomes unstable and the PML bodies are redistributed into microstructures. These microstructures contain PML protein but not the many interacting proteins normally associated with PML-NBs. PML-NBs are not randomly distributed throughout the nucleus, but are found within the nucleus and are commonly associated with other nuclear bodies such as splicing speckles and nucleoi, as well as regions that are rich in genes and are actively being transcribed . Particularly, PML-NB have been shown to associate with genes such as the MHC I cluster of genes, as well as the p53 gene. The exact significance of this association is unclear, however evidence suggests that PML-NBs may influence transcription at these specific gene sites.  Function  The PML-NBs have a wide array of functions, and a large role in cell regulation. They exert their wide range of actions through interactions with varying proteins localized to the PML-NBs. It is thought that the specific biochemical function performed by PML-NBs may be serving as an E3 ligase for the sumoylation of other proteins. The true function, however, remains unclear, and several possible models have been proposed for PML-NB function, including nuclear storage of proteins, serving as a dock where other proteins accumulate to be post-translationally modified, direct involvement with transcription, and chromatin regulation. PML-NBs also play a role in transcriptional regulation. PML-NBs have been shown to increase the transcription of some genes, while repressing the transcription of other genes. It has been suggested that the mechanism by which PML-NBs do this is via a chromatin-remodelling processes, although this is uncertain. Due to this apparent contradiction, it is possible that PML-NBs may be heterogeneous structures that have different functions based on their location within the nucleus, the proteins they interact with in a specific area of the nucleus, or the specific PML protein isoforms of which they are composed. In addition to this regulation of transcription, observations of PML-NBs have strongly suggested that the protein complex plays a role in mediating DNA-damage responses. For example, the number and size of PML-NBs increases as the activities of DNA damage sensors ATM and ATR increase. The nuclear bodies localize to the site of DNA damage, where proteins associated with the repair of DNA and halting of the cell cycle then co-localize. The functional purpose of the interaction between PML-NBs and DNA repair mechanisms remains unclear, but it seems unlikely that they have a role in repairing the DNA directly, due to the co-localization of DNA repair proteins and PML-NBs some time after the DNA has been damaged. Rather, it is thought that PML-NBs may regulate responses to DNA damage by acting as a storage site for proteins involved in DNA repair, regulating the repair directly, or mediating between DNA repair and checkpoint responses. However, it is clear that PML-NBs play a role in mediating checkpoint responses, particularly in causing apoptosis. PML plays an important role in both p53 dependent and p53 independent apoptotic pathways. PML activates p53 by recruiting the protein to a PML-NBs site and promoting its activation, while inhibiting regulators of the protein such as MDM2 or HAUSP. In pathways that do not use p53 in inducing apoptosis, PML have been shown to interact with CHK2 and induce it to autophosphorylate to become active. In addition to those two apoptotic pathways, Fas-induced apoptosis relies on the PML-NBs to release FLICE-Associated huge protein, which then localizes to the mitochondria to promote the activation of Caspase-8. Beyond apoptosis, other studies have implicated PML-NBs in cellular senescence, particularly its induction. It has been shown to be involved with the formation of certain chromatin features of cells experiencing senescence, such as senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHFs), which are believed to suppress the expression of growth-promoting factors and genes. The formation of these features is the result of histone chaperones, HIRA and ASF1, whose chromatin remodeling activities here are mediated by the PML-NBs. HIRA localizes to PML-NBs before any other interaction occurs with the DNA. = Role in Cancer = Loss of function mutations of the PML protein, particularly resulting from the fusion of the PML gene with RARŒ± gene in Acute promyelocytic leukemias, is implicated in several tumor suppressing apoptotic pathways, particularly those that rely on p53 as noted above. Thus, the loss of PML function confers a cellular survival and proliferation advantage, impedes cellular senescence through loss of SAHFs, and puts a block on cellular differentiation. Both humans and mice have been found to demonstrate an increased propensity for tumor formation upon loss of PML function. PML disruption occurs in a wide variety of cancer types, and results in more metastatic tumors, and correspondingly poorer prognoses. It is thought that, beyond the importance it plays in apoptotic roles, PML inactivation may cause cells to favor tumor progression by allowing the cell to accumulate additional genetic damage. Many proteins involved in genomic stability maintenance rely on the PML-NBs for targeting, and PML loss thus leads to a decrease in repair efficiency within the cell. = Cell Cycle Role = PML-NB distribution and concentration changes as the cell moves through the cell cycle. In G0 phase, few sumoylated PML-NBs are present, but their numbers increase as the cell progresses through G1 to S to G2 stages. During the chromatin condensation occurring during mitosis, the desumoylation of PML causes the dissociation of many associated factors, and the PML proteins self aggregate to form a few, large, aggregates termed mitotic accumulations of PML proteins (MAPPs). In addition to changes in numbers, PML-NBs also associate with different proteins over the lifetime of the cycle, and undergo significant biochemical changes in composition. During the S phase of the cell cycle, PML-NB complexes break apart as their chromatin scaffold changes during replication. The physical breaking of the PML-NBs into smaller fragments promotes the creation of more PML-NBs that exist in G2, however, the expression levels of the PML protein hasn't increased. It is thought that this may serve to preserve the orientation of the chromatids with which the PML-NBs are associated, or monitor the integrity of replication forks. = Antiviral functions = Transcription of PML is increased by the presence of interferon Œ±/Œ≤ and Œ≥. It is thought that the increased numbers of PML-NBs that result from this increase in expression of the PML protein may result in the sequestering of viral proteins in the PML-NBs. Thus, the virus is unable to make use of them. The proteins held by PML-NBs are then sumoylated, inactivating the virions permanently.

It is better known for the small part of its lyric that took on a life of its own: \\"How Dry I Am\\".  Origins  The origins of the song and its components are somewhat obscure, as are the factors that differentiate \\"The Near Future\\" from \\"How Dry I Am.\\" = Melody = The origin of the melody predates Berlin's song. The distinctive four-note motif was used by Ludwig van Beethoven in his Sonata, Op. 10 No. 3, published in 1798. The motive is also used in Oh Happy Day, the earliest known printing of which is in The Wesleyan Sacred Harp from Boston in 1855 (although the words to Oh Happy Day can be traced even further back to 1755). This melody is in turn attributed to English composer Edward F. Rimbault. The notes' positions in the major scale are 5 < 1 < 2 < 3 as numbered diatonically and 8 < 1 < 3 < 5 as numbered chromatically (e.g., G < C < D < E in C major, C < F < G < A in F major, and D < G < A < B in G major). The transition of the melody from a hymn to a song associated with drinking caused some confusion. In one example from 1931, courthouse chimes playing \\"Oh Happy Day\\" were thought by \\"respectable Minnesotans\\" to be playing \\"How Dry I Am.\\" = Lyrics = The term \\"Dry\\" in the lyrics means abstinence from alcohol. While the lyrics are often associated with Prohibition in America, the lyrics were written before 1920. An early precursor to the lyrics was published in an 1874 edition of Gem of the West and Soldiers' Friend, a journal of curious miscellany. The passage describes a \\"sleeping car adventure\\" in which \\"one lady exclaimed in a slow and solemn voice, 'Oh, how dry I am\\" several times until someone brings her some water, after which \\"came the same solemn tones, 'Oh, how dry I was,\\" much to the annoyance of the rest of the passengers on the train. The phrase \\"how dry I am\\" had become structured into song and referred specifically to drinking alcohol by at least 1898, as one journal describes a college drinking song that goes: > How dry I am, How dry I am! > God only knows How dry I am. When the State of Kansas passed a Prohibition law in 1917, which was signed by the governor on \\"the 23rd\\" [of February or March] the legislature greeted the event by singing \\"How Dry I Am.\\" The Society of Friends, \\"Friends' Intelligencer\\", Volume 74, page 139, Third Month 3, 1917.

A 1919 book entitled Out and about: A Note-book of London in War-time describes a group of Americans drinking in London and singing \\"some excellent numbers of American marching-songs,\\" including one described as \\"the anthem of the 'dry' States\\" whose lyrics were: > Nobody knows how dry I am, How dry I am, How dry I am. > You don't know how dry I am, How dry I am, How dry I am. > Nobody knows how dry I am, And nobody cares a damn. The 1921 musical comedy Up In The Clouds included a similar song entitled \\"How Dry I Am\\" with music by Tom A. Johnstone and words by Will B. Johnstone.  Musical influence  \\"How Dry I Am\\" (also widely heard in the variant form, \\"How Dry Am I\\") has come to represent a four-pitch sequence widely used to begin both popular and classical works. Other songs influenced by the melody include Will B. Johnstone and Benny Bell.Judaica Sound Archives ‚Äì The Hilarious Musical Comedy of Benny Bell, Volume 7 There is an old Greek song called Bufetzis (ŒúœÄŒøœÖœÜŒµœÑŒ∂ŒÆœÇ) written by Yiorgos Batis made with the music of \\"How Dry I Am\\". Composer, television producer, and humorist Allan Sherman included in his concert album Peter and the Commissar a quodlibet titled \\"Variations On 'How Dry I Am'\\" and quoting works ranging from \\"Home on the Range\\" to \\"The Flying Trapeze\\" to the final section of the William Tell overture and the Russian military theme from Tchaikovsky's The Year 1812.  Use in popular culture  This portion of the song... > How dry I am, how dry I am > It's plain to see just why I am > No alcohol in my highball > And that is why so dry I am ...became known for its ironic use as a drinking song in all manner of popular media, especially Warner Bros. cartoons in which that behavior became a stock substitute for the explicit mention of alcohol and/or drunkenness. That use necessitated removal of the phrases that overtly mentioned drinking, leading to the song's frequently being condensed to these two lines: > How dry I am, how dry I am > Nobody knows how dry I am... Hooow dryyy I aaaaaam! A Westinghouse clothes dryer from 1953 played the song when clothes were dry.\\"New 1953 Westinghouse Clothes Dryer\\" (advertisement), Life (17 November 1952), 62. Played in the opening montage of the 1932 film Three on a Match. The song is referenced in Richard Matheson's 1954 novel I Am Legend. The song is used in the plot of The Twilight Zone episode \\"Mr. Denton on Doomsday\\", and is sung by Dan Duryea. The song was referenced in a lyric by Method Man in a Wu-Tang Clan ad for St. Ides malt liquor. The Salvation Army, to celebrate sobriety, uses the song (without lyrics) in both band and piano arrangements, in street concerts and meetings. This may be one reason for the raucous band arrangement of Bob Dylan's \\"Rainy Day Women#12 & 35\\" (a.k.a. \\"Everybody Must Get Stoned\\") from his album \\"Blonde on Blonde.\\" Apparently the producer and Dylan agreed at 4:30 in the morning that they wanted the sound of a Salvation Army band.Katherine L.

After investing in tooling to stamp body panels for the 1954 P25 series Plymouth locally, and with Chrysler headquarters in Detroit unwilling to assist in the costs of retooling for the new US models, Chrysler Australia made the decision to develop their own range, using as much of the existing tooling as possible, whilst also realising that the new car had to appear as different as possible. The doors and basic structure of the P25 sedan was retained, and with input from Australian and American Chrysler designers, the 1955 US Plymouth front sheetmetal was adapted to the P25 body and the rear quarter panels redesigned. They also added a wraparound rear windscreen, which caused development problems with Pilkington Glass, the Australian suppliers, who struggled to get the correct curved shape.\\"Great Ideas in Motion, A History of Chrysler in Australia 1946-1981 by Gavin Farmer\\" AP1 Chrysler AP1 Royal Chrysler AP1 Royal The first version of the Chrysler Royal, the AP1, was introduced in May 1957.

Plans to market the updated version under these three names were dropped late in the development program and the new model would be sold only as the Chrysler RoyalThe Australian Chrysler Royal, Plainsman, and Wayfarer Retrieved from www.allpar.com on 27 March 2010 thus revising a name used by Chrysler in the US market from 1937 to 1950. The design chosen for the final model was that proposed for the Plymouth variant, thus the AP (Australian Plymouth) designation was adopted, and changed to stand for Australian Production. The Royal differed from the P25 in using front and rear mudguards similar to those on the 1956 US Plymouth and a rear window which was larger than that of the P25. The AP1 was produced as a Royal four-door sedan, a Plainsman four-door station wagon, and a Wayfarer two-door coup√© utility, and was offered with two versions of Chrysler's valve- in-block straight-6 engine: a with manual transmission and a with the Powerflite 2-speed automatic. Chrysler's polyspherical-head V8 was introduced as an option during the AP1 model run. V8 powered Royals were popular with the South Australia Police, where they were employed as Highway Patrol cars. AP2 Chrysler AP2 Royal Chrysler AP2 Royal A revised Royal, the AP2 was introduced in late 1958. This series featured a new grille and unusual rear styling with additional \\"saddle fins\\" grafted on to the exiting tailfins. The AP2 was available as a Royal four-door sedan, a Plainsman four-door station wagon, and a Wayfarer two-door coup√© utility. The Plainsman station wagon was dropped from the range during the AP2 series. The choice of six cylinder and V8 engines continued, with the V8 identified by a V shaped emblem in the grille and a small V8 badge on the rear quarter. AP3 Chrysler AP3 Royal Chrysler AP3 Royal The final version of the Royal was the AP3 which was introduced during 1960. The new series was easily distinguished from its predecessors by its vertically stacked quad headlamps and triple tail lights similar to those of the 1959 US Desoto models. A new pressing for the roof panel was also used. Chrysler's 3-speed Torqueflite automatic transmission replaced the 2-speed PowerFlite automatic of the AP2. Production ceased in 1964.

The Victorian Civil Ambulance Service in Melbourne is one such service that employed vast numbers of Royals as did many country areas in Victoria.Chrysler Royal Retrieved from www.colacambulance.com on 28 January 2012 Royal ambulances were also used throughout New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania. Various coachbuilders were contracted to transform Royals into ambulances, using different specifications depending on District requirements. Some vehicles used hand formed steel bodywork over timber frames, others used newly developed fibreglass technology. In 1957 Commonwealth Engineering (ComEng) began development of the first fibreglass ambulance body in Australia, in conjunction with the Central District Ambulance in Sydney. The first vehicle was completed in June 1958, after Central District agreed to replace its entire fleet with fibreglass bodied Royals constructed by ComEng.\\"A History of Commonwealth Engineering 1955-1966\\" by John Dunn The use of fibreglass bodywork provided a vehicle that was believed to be tougher, quicker to build, and easier to repair and resulted in a weight saving of around 560 pounds (254 kilograms). As well as using the available chassis/cowl configuration, ambulances were also converted from sedans, Wayfarer coupe utilities, and at least one was converted from a Plainsman station wagon. The Royal chassis was also popular with undertakers as a basis for hearse conversion. See also * Chrysler Royal, for the US automobile of the same name.

This enzyme catalyzes the formation of isopenicillin N from Œ¥-(L-Œ±-aminoadipoyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine (LLD-ACV). :N-[(5S)-5-amino-5-carboxypentanoyl]-L-cysteinyl-D-valine + O2 \\\\rightleftharpoons isopenicillin N + 2 H2O This reaction is a key step in the biosynthesis of penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The active sites of most isopenicillin N synthases contain an iron ion. This enzyme is also called isopenicillin N synthetase. Mechanism PDB 1BK0 A Fe(II) metal ion in the active site of the enzyme is coordinated by at least two histidine residues, an aspartate residue, a glutamine residue, and two water molecules in the absence of a bound substrate. Just two histidine residues and one aspartic acid residue are entirely conserved. Therefore, it is highly significant that these two histidine residues, His214 and His270, and one aspartic acid residue, Asp216, are precisely the ones essential for activity. When ACV binds the active site, Gln330 and one water molecule are replaced by the ACV thiolate. File:IPNS active site1.gif The linear tripeptide Œ¥-(L-Œ±- aminoadipoyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine (LLD-ACV) must first be assembled from its component amino acids by N-(5-amino-5-carboxypentanoyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine synthase (ACV synthase). This allows for the binding of the substrate ACV to the deprotonated thiol group of the cysteine residue. This ligation of the thiolate to the iron center anchors the ACV within the active site. The ligation of ACV results in a decrease in the FeII/FeIII redox potential, which facilitates the reduction of dioxygen to superoxide. Formation of a highly covalent RS-FeIII bond lowers the activation barrier to dioxygen binding, thereby initiating the reaction cycle. An intramolecular hydrogen atom transfer from C-3 of the cysteine residue (BDE= 93 kcal/mol) to the distal superoxo oxygen takes place, thereby converting the FeIII back to the FeII oxidation state. A thioaldehyde and a hydroperoxy ligand (OOH) are produced in this process. The hydroperoxy ligand deprotonates the amide which then closes the Œ≤-lactam ring by a nucleophilic attack at the thioaldehyde carbon. This causes the hydrogen atom at the C-3 of the valine residue to come closer to the iron(IV) oxo ligand which is highly electrophilic. A second hydrogen transfer occurs, most likely producing an isopropyl radical which closes the thiazolidine ring by attacking the thiolate sulfur atom. File:IPNS mechanism.gif Role in Antibiotic Formation Pathway of penicillin and cephalosporin biosynthesis, illustrating the role of isopenicillin N synthase in the formation of beta-lactam antibiotics Following the IPNS pathway, further enzymes are responsible for the epimerization of isopenicillin N to penicillin N, the derivitazation to other penicillins, and the ring expansion that eventually leads to the various cephalosporins. This shows how IPNS occupies an early and key role in the biosynthetic pathway of all of the penicillins and cephalosporins, which are different types of Œ≤-lactam antibiotics. This class of antibiotics is the most widely used. They act by inhibiting the synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer of bacterial cell walls, which is especially important in Gram-positive organisms. There are several types of penicillins that can be used to treat different kinds of bacterial infections. They will not work for infections caused by viruses, such as colds or the flu.

It is part of the Tees Barrage and is located in the Stockton-on-Tees district, accessible by road only from Thornaby-on-Tees and best accessed by the A66. The course was built in 1995 at a cost of ¬£2m. The course is now open once more under the new name TBIWWC (Tees Barrage International White Water Centre).  Facilities  The course is owned by the Canal & River Trust but administered by Tees Active from the on-site watersports centre. The white water facility offers kayaking, whitewater slalom, playboating and white water rafting plus surfing on the 'surf wave'. The centre's facilities include log cabins, a placid practice pool; watersports centre, shop and cafe; car parking, camping, picnicking and caravanning areas; bandstand and landscaped amphitheatre, The Talpore pub, a restaurant and hotel. The course itself is a 'U' shaped loop, 250 m long, 7 m wide with a 3.7 m drop and a flow of 14 cumecs (m3/s). The immediate environs of the white water course include the Teesdale Way cycle path (National Cycle Network), the River Tees, the Tees Barrage and the placid grade A two star waters of the river Tees; the David Lloyd Leisure racquet centre, a superstore and Portrack Marsh Nature Reserve.  Operation  The state of the course can depend on the level of the tide in the River Tees. The course can operate by flow diversion for two or three hours either side of low tide but can operate at any time when the pumps are used. The course can operate all year round and in hours of darkness when it is flood-lit, and spot-lit on the two footbridges. = Photo gallery (2008) = Image:Tees_Whitewater_Centre-1024.jpg Tees Barrage White Water Course Centre and practice/warm up pool Image:tees_white_water-1.jpg Happy Eater pool Image:tees_white_water-2.jpg Rapids in front of the bandstand Image:tees_white_water-3.jpg Cruncher pool Image:tees_white_water-5.jpg Valentines pool Image:tees_white_water-6.jpg Pedestrian bridge and final rapids Image:tees_white_water-8.jpg Lower settling pool Image:tees_white_water-4.jpg One of the many public interpretation and information boards around the course.  Redevelopment  In 2010 and 2011, a ¬£4.6m redevelopment of the course was undertaken. The changes include the addition of a new shorter, steeper course and a canoe lift with disabled paddlers in mind. Four large 12 m long 3 m diameter Archimedes' screws were installed to pump water from the bottom pool to the top pool guaranteeing water levels for paddlers at all states of the tide. There are plans to generate electricity from the head of river water above the barrage by putting the Archimedes' screws into reverse when not pumping water around the course, making the course more energy efficient. These improvements made the site a world class training facility which is proposed as a training camp location for the 2012 Olympic games. Work started in March 2010 and was completed in October 2011. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, accompanied by His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh, visited Stockton on 18 July 2012 to officially reopen the International White Water Course as part of their Diamond Jubilee tour of the United Kingdom. Popular culture The TBIWWC was used in a segment of the film 1917. In the scene, the actor George MacKay jumps into a river in France and is flung over rapids and a waterfall. These scenes were filmed at the TWBIWCC.  Note  The Tees Barrage International White Water Course is not to be confused with The River Tees Watersports Centre, Dugdale Street, Stockton-on-Tees 1 km further upriver on the same side near the Princess of Wales Bridge or indeed the Castlegate Quay Water Sports Centre a little further up-river near Teesquay Millennium Bridge.

In an article written some weeks before the July 2007 General Elections, he described AK Party supporters as \\"men who scratch their belly\\" (). After Abdullah G√ºl's victory in the presidential elections of 2007, Co≈ükun stated, \\"he will not be my President\\", upon which the Prime Minister Erdoƒüan retorted by saying \\"he should abdicate his citizenship and leave the country if he doesn't consider [Gul] as his President\\". This led to an outcry among supporters of secularism in the country that people who didn't share AK Party's ideology would no longer be welcome in the country. In 2007, after Emin √á√∂la≈üan left H√ºrriyet, for a while he considered leaving as well. In the meantime, rival newspaper and staunchly secularist Cumhuriyet offered him a position as one of their columnists. The absence of Co≈ükun's columns for a period of two weeks in August 2007 was attributed by some to an imminent switch.

He was born at Cavalese, in what was then Austrian Tyrol. After having studied medicine at Padua he decided to become a painter and architect. He worked under Pietro Liberi in Venice, then in Rome, and finally settled at Trieste. Alberti died at Cavalese. Biography Born in Tesero, according to other sources in Cavalese, on the 3rd of October 1640, he was destined to an ecclesiastical career as was typical of large families of that time. He soon demonstrated artistic skills that he cultivated as an autodidact in the local area, signing, in 1661, an altarpiece destined for a chapel near Montagnaga di Pin√®. From 1664 to 1667 he took courses in medicine and law at the University of Padua, that he soon dropped in order to devote himself entirely to art. Trained on the works of late sixteenth-century Venetian painters, Alberti had the opportunity to enrich his artistic education by assimilating the colored heritage of Titian. It helped him to find his own stylistic maturity. He started gradually deviating from the extreme Venetian traditions towards the manner of Marco Liberi. He was in contact with him during his stay in Venice (1668‚Äì73), which followed the one dedicated to his studies at the University of Padua (1664‚Äì67), but for the color he followed rather the naturalists, such as Bassetti and Mola. Back in Trento, he created a series of works including The San Vigilio altarpiece (signed and dated 1673) and The Blessed Simonino altarpiece (1677), commissioned by Prince Alberti Poia and currently on display at the Buonconsiglio Castel. From that moment onwards, the Prince Bishop became Giuseppe Alberti's main patron, for both artistic and architectural works. Alberti had an opportunity to visit Rome, where he could study the most important monuments of the time. As Prince Bishop commissioned to design the Chapel of the Crucifix in the Cathedral of Trento, in 1682 the artist abandoned Rome and returned home. In 1688 he started working on the frescoes The Triumph of the Faith and Minerva who Chased the Vices to Hell in the two rooms on the first floor of the new Giunta Albertiana, built to connect the Palazzo Magno to Castelvecchio. Both allegorical paintings, in which Alberti seeks spectacular effects described as ‚Äúlooking from beneath‚Äù, follow the similar cycles frescoed by him in Palazzo Leoni Montanari in Vicenza. 1689, the year of the death of Prince Bishop Alberti, marked the beginning of the artistic crisis of Giuseppe Alberti who, deprived of the support of his patron, retired to Cavalese, in the Val di Fiemme. In the 90s he performed numerous paintings. Though, in these works it became difficult to distinguish part executed by his hand from the contributions of his apprentices. In this last stage of his artistic activity, Alberti is undoubtedly credited for having laid the foundations for the birth of the so-called \\"scuola fiemmesa\\" (the Fiemme Valley school of art). Giuseppe Alberti died in Cavalese on the 3rd of February 1716.

Cooley is currently the CEO of Fervent Strategy, a social impact consulting firm based in New York City. Cooley has also written and directed PSA's for social justice organizations as well as award-winning narrative and documentary films. Background In the 1990s, Cooley directed television PSA's for prominent social impact organizations such as the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, The Creative Coalition and the Partnership for a Drug Free America. Through this work, he began researching how large-scale social messaging efforts could successfully shift cultural norms and launch grassroots movements. This led to his founding of The Gun Violence Project, a collaboration with The Creative Coalition, and then co-founding The Center to Prevent Youth Violence (originally called PAX) which would become the largest non-lobbying group focused on the gun violence issue in America. Cooley was also a member of the founding committee of the Million Mom March in 2000, which drew 750,000 people to the Washington Mall (and another 200,000 people to satellite marches across the country), one of the largest marches ever organized on the Mall. In 2012, Cooley graduated from the Harvard Kennedy School with a master's degree focused on social justice strategy, program design and operations, and innovation strategy. This work led to the 2013 launch of Democracy.com, an online platform for civic engagement that \\"empowers every citizen to take action on the issues and elections they care about in under 60 seconds\\". Cooley is now the Founder and CEO of Fervent Strategy, a social impact consulting firm in New York, NY. Social Impact =Gun Violence Project, PAX, Center to Prevent Youth Violence= In 1995, Cooley founded The Gun Violence Project, a non-profit organization with the mission to reposition the gun violence issue as an urgent matter of public health rather than the seemingly intractable political wedge issue it had become.Gregg Lee Carter, Guns in American Society: An Encyclopedia of History, Politics, Culture, and the Law, Volume 1, pp.465-6, ABC-CLIO, 2002, , . In 1996, The Gun Violence Project, in collaboration with The Creative Coalition, created its first campaign (voice-over by Alec Baldwin), which focused on the dangers of kids taking their parents' guns to school. In 1997 The Gun Violence Project became PAX . By 2000, PAX had become the largest non-lobbying organization working on gun violence prevention as a result of the success and rapid expansion of its ASKEvaluation of the ASK Campaign in Two Midwestern Cities  ISRN Public Health and SPEAK UP campaigns. As a result of this success, PAX was invited to become a founding member of the organizing committee for the Million Mom March on the Washington Mall in 2000, and the ASK Campaign was the lead anti-gun violence program promoted by the march due to its family focused message directed at parents.Million Mom March Still active, the ASK (Asking Saves Kids) Campaign leverages partnerships with over 400 national and grassroots organizations that promote the ASK message, driven by the fact that almost 40% of homes with children have a gun, and almost half those guns are either unlocked or loaded. The message to parents is \\"ASK your neighbors about guns before you send your kids over to play. It's not about politics, it's about common sense parenting.\\". The SPEAK UP program created a national hotline for young people to anonymously report weapon related threats in their schools and neighborhoods, and has received over 40,000 calls since inception. Cooley directed commercials for the ASK and SPEAK UP campaigns, with voice-over by Julianne Moore, Alec Baldwin and Susan Sarandon. These campaigns pioneered a new approach to the gun violence issue, designed to have immediate impact on the frequency of gun deaths and injuries while also shifting the national dialogue around guns to a prevention-driven, public health and safety orientation. This innovative, non-partisan approach to gun violence prevention represented a stark contrast to the politics-based framing which had dominated the issue for many years without significant success.Gregg Lee Carter, Gun control in the United States: a reference handbook, pp. 248-9; ABC-CLIO, 2006, , . In 2011, PAX officially changed its name to The Center to Prevent Youth Violence to better reflect the youth and family focus of its prevention driven campaigns. Cooley resigned as co-CEO of The Center to Prevent Youth Violence in 2004 but remained on the organization's Board of Trustees until its merger with the Brady Center in 2012. By 2018, the ASK and SPEAK UP campaigns had been active for over 18 years, and remain the leading public health and safety campaigns dedicated to gun violence prevention in the US, with over 19 million Americans signing the ASK Pledge (www.askingsaveskids.org) and over 31 million parents reporting that they ask their neighbors about guns where their kids play from a pre-campaign baseline of 3 million parents. =2017 Harvard/GAO Report names ASK Campaign as only verifiably effective gun violence prevention program in US= In October 2017, the Harvard School of Public Health and the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report on the effectiveness of 16 firearm storage awareness programs, ultimately finding the \\"ASK\\" program to be the only gun safety program that has been independently evaluated and found to be effective. The report, entitled \\"Personal Firearms: Programs that Promote Safe Storage and Research on their Effectiveness,\\" was prepared over a two-year period in response to a request by the Congressional HELP (Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions) Committee. The report evaluated 16 programs, both regional and national, that are aimed at spreading awareness of the importance of safe storage of firearms. The ASK campaign was found to be the only verifiably effective program out of the 16 programs. Jim Accomando, president of The National PTA, said \\"Child and school safety starts at home. When families store their guns responsibly, they're much less likely to end up in schools and tragedies are less likely to occur. National PTA is proud to support the ASK campaign to help prevent gun-related incidents and keep children safe.\\" =Democracy.com & Fervent Strategy= In 2012, Cooley founded Democracy.com while attending the Harvard Kennedy School's MPA master's degree program.

Boxing career =Early career= Batawang began his professional career in 1990, winning against Lolong Quiban by a first-round technical knockout. Batawang suffered multiple losses early in his career, and in 1995, he temporarily retired from the sport after losing a ten-round decision to future WBC Light Flyweight World Champion, Yo-Sam Choi (7-0) of South Korea. After five years away from the sport, Batawang made his ring return in 2000, fighting against unheralded Randy Narbay, whom he defeated by knockout (KO) in six rounds. He later went on to win the Philippines Boxing Federation (PBF) Light Flyweight title one year later, defeating Flash Villacura who held the title at the time. Two bouts later, Batawang lost a 12-round decision to future IBF Minimumweight World Champion, Muhammad Rachman of Indonesia. After losing to Rachman, Batawang defended his PBF Light Flyweight title a total of five times before winning the Philippines Games & Amusement Board (GAB) version of the title, after a failed bid against Wyndel Janiola. A year later, he vied for the OPBF Light Flyweight title, then held by Shingo Yamaguchi of Japan. Batawang lost the fight by split decision (SD), by scores of 117-113, 116-113 for Yamaguchi, and a scorecard of 115-113 for Batawang. Following this bout, Batawang managed to defeat Sithembile Kibiti of South Africa, winning the fight by KO in seven rounds, and also winning the then vacant WBA Pan African Light Flyweight title. =First World Title shot= After winning eight of his next nine fights, Batawang vied for his first world title against the then IBF Light Flyweight World Champion, Ulises Sol√≠s of Mexico. On December 15, 2007, in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico, Batawang failed in his bid for the IBF crown, losing to Sol√≠s by technical knockout (TKO) in the ninth round of the bout. The champion dismantled Batawang since the start of the fight, until the referee finally stopped the fight. \\"Batawang would later say after the fight that he was hit by Solis with a hard left over his right rib cage in the 5th round that practically immobilized him in the remainder of the contest\\". =Is there anything left?= Batawang won his next three fights after suffering the huge setback against Sol√≠s, also winning the then vacant WBO Oriental Light Flyweight title in the process after defeating Samransak Singmanassak of Thailand. In his first defense of the WBO Oriental title, he lost to fellow Filipino, Edren Dapudong by TKO in seven rounds. After losing to Dapudong, Batawang traveled to Linyi, China, fighting Jack Amisa of Indonesia. \\"The Ninja\\" used his stealth and wit to defeat the Indonesian by knockout in the fifth round of the bout, winning the then vacant WBO Asia Pacific Light Flyweight title. He fought Ulises Solis on March 27, 2010 for the IBF Light Flyweight Title Eliminator. The fight was held at the Plaza Pueblo Antiguo in Mexico. The winner of the rematch between Batawang and Solis, which was originally scheduled for March 6, will become the mandatory challenger for IBF light flyweight titlist Carlos Tamara, who defeated former champion Brian Viloria in January by TKO. In the first three rounds the bout was fairly even. However, in the next rounds, Solis‚Äô power and Batawang‚Äôs age began to tell: Batawang was floored in the 4th round and the Mexican fighter hammered him during the 5th round. The Filipino veteran boxer remained on his stool and was forced to retire at the beginning of the sixth round. With the win Solis improved to 30-2-2 with 21 knockouts while Batawang dropped to 45-15-3 with 17 knockouts.

The dark reddish-brown caps of the fruit bodies develop a characteristic saddle-shape in maturity, and the ends of both saddle lobes are drawn out to sharp tips that project above the level of the fruit body. The stipe is white or flushed pale brown, smooth on the outside, but hollow with some chambers inside. It is found in the Northern Hemisphere, usually in the late summer and autumn, growing on rotting wood or on hard packed ground. G. infula is considered inedible as it contains the toxic compound gyromitrin, which, when metabolized by the body, is converted into monomethylhydrazine, a component of some rocket fuels. The toxin may be removed by thorough cooking. Gyromitra fungi are included in the informal category \\"false morels\\". Taxonomy The fungus was first described in 1774 by German mycologist Jacob Christian Sch√§ffer as Helvella infula (the original genus spelling was Elvela). In 1849, Elias Magnus Fries established the genus Gyromitra, distinguishing it from Helvella based on a gyrose hymenium (marked with wavy lines or convolutions); the genus was based on the type species Gyromitra esculenta. Later, in 1886, French mycologist Lucien Qu√©let transferred the species to Gyromitra. The next few decades witnessed some lingering confusion as to the correct taxonomical placement of these fungi. In 1907, Jean Boudier moved both G. esculenta and H. infula into a newly created genus he called Physomitra; he retained the genus Gyromitra but \\"based it on an entirely different character so as to exclude from the genus the very species on which it was founded\\". In an attempt to reconcile the confusion surrounding the naming and identity of the two mushrooms, Fred J. Seaver proposed that both were synonymous, representing variable forms of the same species. His suggestion was not adopted by later mycologists, who identified various differences between the two species, including fruiting time as well as macroscopic and microscopic differences. The genus name is derived from the Greek words gyros/Œ≥œÖœÅŒøœÇ \\"round\\" and mitra/ŒºŒπœÑœÅŒ± \\"headband\\"; the specific epithet is from the Latin inf«îla, a heavy band of twisted wool worn by Roman officiants at sacrifices. It is known more commonly as the elfin saddle or the hooded false morel. Additionally, G. infula is a member of a group of fungi collectively known as \\"false morels\\", so named for their resemblance to the highly regarded edible true morels of the genus Morchella. This group includes other species of the genus Gyromitra, such as G. esculenta (brain mushroom), G. caroliniana (beefsteak mushroom) and G. gigas (snow morel). Description G. infula The cap of the fruit body (technically an apothecium) is up to high by wide and is reddish brown, and somewhat saddle-shaped with 2‚Äì4 lobes. It frequently develops blackish-brown spots on the surface. During the development of the mushroom, the periphery of the cap grows into the stipe below, to form a hollow, roughly bell-shaped structure with the fertile spore- bearing surface (the hymenium) on the outside; as the surface growth of the hymenium continues to expand even after joining to the stipe, the hymenium can no longer follow and it arches up into folds and pads. The stipe, typically between high and thick, can be various colors from reddish brown to whitish or even bluish, but is typically lighter colored than the cap. The stipe is minutely tomentose ‚Äì covered with a layer of very fine hairs. The context is thin (1‚Äì2 mm) and brittle. G. infula does not have any appreciable odor or taste. =Microscopic characteristics= Ascospores are ellipsoidal in shape, hyaline, smooth, thin-walled, with dimensions of 17‚Äì22 by 7‚Äì9 ¬µm. They are also biguttulate, containing two large oil droplets at either end. The spore- producing cells, the asci, are roughly cylindrical, eight-spored, operculate (opening by an apical lid to discharge the spores) and have dimensions of 200‚Äì350 by 12‚Äì17 ¬µm. The diameter of the club-shaped paraphyses is 7‚Äì10 ¬µm at the apex. =Edibility= This fungus is inedible, as it contains the toxic compound gyromitrin, which when digested is metabolized into monomethylhydrazine. Although much of the gyromitrin may be removed by parboiling with generous volumes of water, consumption is not advisable due to possible long-term health effects‚Äîthere is evidence that even small doses of gyromitrin may have a cumulative carcinogenic effect. =Similar species= Gyromitra esculenta has a wrinkled surface (similar to brainlike convolutions), not wavy or bumpy like G. infula. Gyromitra ambigua is very similar in appearance, and although it is usually not possible to discern between the two species without examining microscopic characteristics, G. ambigua is said to have more pronounced purple tints in the stipe. G. ambigua has larger spores that are about 22‚Äì30 ¬µm long. The saddle-shaped cap of G. infula might also lead to confusion with some species of Helvella, but these latter fungi typically have grayer colors and thinner, fluted stipes. Habitat and distribution This fungus can be found growing singly to scattered in or near coniferous woodland in autumn, often on rotten wood. It is also commonly found on packed ground, such as beside country roads, or in campgrounds. Associated conifers include Picea glauca, Picea mariana, Picea sitchensis, Pinus contorta, Pinus banksiana, Pinus monticola, Abies balsamea, Abies grandis, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Tsuga heterophylla, Larix occidentalis, Thuja plicata, as well as the deciduous tree species Populus balsamifera, Populus tremuloides, Acer macrophyllum, Alnus species, and Betula papyrifera. Gyromitra infula is widely distributed throughout boreal, montane and coastal forests in North America. The North American range extends north to Canada and south to Mexico. It has also been reported from South America, Europe, and Asia.

It was released in 1989.History of ICB, accessed November 2, 2007 ICB is typically served on port 7326.  History  The first version of ICB was a program called \\"Forumnet\\" or \\"fn\\", written by University of Kentucky IT staffer Sean Carrick Casey. It was widely used at the University of Kentucky, Georgia Tech, UC Davis, MIT, University of New Mexico, Stanford University, Mills College, UC Santa Cruz, and UC Berkeley. Fn, based on a MUD software program by Casey, established the protocol and clients. Fn was used as a realtime communications channel after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake - Internet access from hard-hit Santa Cruz returned to service before reliable phone service did. In March 1991 the University of Kentucky changed policy and shut down the fn server. Within 2 months a new server had been created from the client software by another fn user, John Atwood Devries, and was put online now renamed ICB. This new server code, unrelated to the original server except by the common client software source, was then used as the basis of many ICB servers to follow. From 1995 to 2000 the server code was heavily rewritten for stability and additional features by Jon Luini and Michel Hoche-Mong and remains available at the ICB.net web site. ICB is still in operation with a dedicated user base. A variety of clients exist for all major operating systems.  Features  ICB features many standard chat program functions, including channels, private messages, and nickname registration. Most of the common clients support TCL scripting of commands and functions. Some clients (principally icbm) support scripting in Perl instead.  Limitations  ICB has never supported multi-server shared groups, so the number of simultaneous users has always been somewhat limited in comparison to more popular chat programs. ICB does not support transferring files or multimedia via the chat program. However, the very restrictive protocol has a very small remote attack surface. The ICB protocol is not 8-bit clean.

History The band was formed by vocalist and guitarist Jamie Hilsden, bassist Jeremy Boyd and drummer Joel Hilsden. The band was later accompanied by second guitarist Bethany Ridings. In 2000, a year after forming, after Boyd and Ridings left the band, Jon Shkedi joined to play bass and Dave Shkedi joined to play guitar. Later, Joel left and was replaced briefly by Matthew R C Smith on drums before Yair Braun came on board. The band quickly gained popularity in the Israeli punk scene, and decided to try to play outside of the country. While touring between Israel and the United States, the band independently released two albums, which helped build the band a fanbase in Europe, North America and Japan. In 2005, record producer Ed Rose (The Get Up Kids, Motion City Soundtrack) produced the band's third full length, Open Surgery, their most popular album to date. After the release of the album the band went on an extensive tour and, in 2006, played more than 220 shows in North America and over 30 in Europe, including the Warped Tour. In 2007, the band released an EP titled Access Denied!, and also opened for NOFX in their Tel Aviv concert. The band also signed a two-album contract with B& Recordings, a subdivision of Doghouse Records, and a fourth, self-titled full-length was released on February 26, 2008. Since 2008, the band has kept a low profile, performing rarely around the Tel Aviv area with local Israeli punk rock acts, many times sharing stages and supporting Useless ID. In April 2011, Jon Shkedi flew with Israeli melodic hardcore band Kill the Drive to New York City, to record bass on their third studio album, as their bassist Nadav Rotem was unable to join the band. The record was recorded at Nada Recording Studio with producer Jon Naclerio. It was later announced that Shkedi will be officially joining the band as their permanent bassist. On June 11, 2012, it was announced on the band's Facebook page that the band has decided to record a new album. The album, their first in four years, will be recorded in September 2012, though the band started a campaign on the Indiegogo website to raise money for them to record the new album. Fans can contribute money on the website for the band to be able to pay all of the recording, production, mixing and mastering fees for the new album. On August 6, 2013, the band released a new song entitled \\"Limited to a Lifetime\\", as well as announcing their upcoming new album, A Light Goes On, set for release on September 12, 2013. The album is the band's first in five years.

For its initial 25 years or more it was marketed through Western Canada.Edmonton Journal, Sept. 19, 1940, p. 12 By 1959 it was marketed across Canada through Nabob Foods Limited, a division of Kelly, Douglas Co.

In June, 1981, Nabob Foods Ltd. sold the Squirrel brand to Canada Packers Inc., to focus on its coffee business.Globe and Mail, June 13, 1981, p. B3 In December, 1990, Canada Packers sold the peanut butter business to a subsidiary of CPC International Inc. of Englewood Cliffs, N.J. CPC decided it would continue making Squirrel peanut butter, along with Skippy peanut butter, at a Montreal plant, owned by Best Foods Canada Inc., a subsidiary of CPC's Toronto-based subsidiary, Canada Starch Inc.Globe and Mail, Dec. 18, 1990, p. B8 In 1997 CPC International split into Bestfoods Corp. and Corn Products International, Inc. Unilever PLC (ULVR) London took over Bestfoods Corp. in June, 2000, for $20.3-billion (U.S.), acquiring the Squirrel brand in Canada. It discontinued the Squirrel brand, marketing only the Skippy brand after its acquisition, despite Squirrel's longer history in Canada. Unilever temporarily renamed Skippy in Canada as \\"Skippy the Squirrel\\", featuring a redrawn squirrel on the label (Skippy had previously used a stylized peanut as its mascot). Eventually, Skippy the Squirrel reverted to its original name (Skippy) as it is seen today and features the redrawn squirrel. The inner freshness seal has a cartoon image of the original likeness of the squirrel. Characteristics Squirrel was known for containing one whole peanut which lay on the top of the peanut butter when the jar was first opened, hence the slogan \\"The One With The Peanut On Top!\\" The peanut on top was eliminated when rebranded as Skippy. The brand was also known for \\"peanut points,\\" which could be collected and redeemed for prizes. The mascot was a brown squirrel wearing a green sweater, smiling and holding a peanut. The slogan The One With the Peanut on Top was actually originally from York Peanut Butter and was transferred to Squirrel with Canada Packers purchase of the brand.
