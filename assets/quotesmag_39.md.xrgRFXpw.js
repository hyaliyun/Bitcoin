Contents  The fortress ruin of Vor Rukoth was once \\"a stronghold of the tiefling empire of Bael Turath\\" that \\"has fallen into ruin and become a haven for monsters\\". It is set in Nentir Vale but was also designed to fit into pre-existing homebrew campaign settings. Vor Rukoth contains \\"a fully detailed, ready-to-use fortress ruin, complete with secret locations, maps, adventure hooks, monster and NPC statistics, ready-to-play encounters, and a full-color, double-sided battle map\\". Shannon Appelcline, author of Designers & Dragons, wrote that \\"besides detailing the geography of the city, Vor Rukoth also introduces several NPC factions. The idea of factions dates back to the d20 Modern line (2002-2006) and was now being well-used in D&D; itself. Of course, Vor Rukoth also provides more information on tieflings and their ancient empire of Bael Turath. Both the emphasis on the Nentir Vale and on factions would continue right into the upcoming Essentials (2010) line\\". Publication history Vor Rukoth, by Greg Bilsland, is the second Adventure Site for the Dungeons & Dragons 4th edition setting Nentir Vale and was released on July 20, 2010. It was released as part of a Wizards of the Coast publishing experiment with shorter 32-page softcover saddle-stitched books. This was a short-lived experiment that ended in July 2010. On November 17, 2015, Vor Rukoth was re- released as a PDF. Originally, the Nentir Vale was designed to be a setting described in adventure books rather than in standalone sourcebooks. The release of Hammerfast (2010) and Vor Rukoth \\"marked a major change in that policy. Alongside Underdark (2010), also released in early 2010, they were the first books to provide supplemental details on the geography of the Nentir Vale region\\".  Reception  Appelcline commented that \\"Wizards said that book stores didn't like the saddle-stitched books because of the lack of printed spines — an irony for an industry built on books of that format, from the digest-sized OD&D; supplements to the numerous short adventures of the '70s and '80s\\". Neuroglyph Games, on EN World, wrote \\"if ever there were any Wizards of the Coast products that could be termed 'sleepers', in the movie- box-office sense of the word, then Vor Rukoth certainly qualifies to head that list. Unfairly brushed aside by the hype of other, more anticipated products being released before GenCon 2010, this gaming supplement is a rare dark jewel which deserves to be treasured and marveled at by 4E gamers of all types. As an adventure site, Vor Rukoth can be used again and again by Dungeon Masters to create adventures which range from simple delves to more complex intrigues. [...] When presented with a supplement which is this well-conceived, this cunningly written, and so modestly priced, never should a Dungeon Master refuse to add a book like Vor Rukoth to their bookshelves\\".

Reception  Appelcline wrote that \\"Newer players appreciated the unique setting, but older players (who had enjoyed Dark Sun in its AD&D; 2e days) were put off by numerous small details that were wrong. [...] Many players found the encounters in Marauders of the Dune Sea to be badly balanced, so that they could easily overpower players. This appears to be an unfortunate side-effect of Marauders of the Dune Sea being published right when 4e was redoing its math for monsters. Marauders of the Dune Sea freely mixes critters from before and after the math changed in Monster Manual 3 (2010), and the result is sometimes off-kilter\\".

In fact, they were so similar to each other that they included considerable duplication, particularly for sections covering: game overview (chapter 1), making characters (chapter 2), understanding powers (chapter 3), skills (chapter 6), feats (chapter 7), and gears and weapon (chapter 8). The only major expansions in these sections were rules on summoning in chapter 3 (which were needed to support the warlock) and feats for the new races and classes in chapter 7\\". Publication history Heroes of the Forgotten Kingdoms was the second players book in the Essentials line, after Heroes of the Fallen Lands (2010). It was published on November 16, 2010 as a trade paperback in digest size. Greg Tito, for Escapist Magazine, wrote that Mike Mearls \\"intended the Essentials line - essentially a repackaging of 4E rules into easier-to-digest books - to get back to the shared language that unites all D&D; players\\". Appelcline wrote that \\"September and October 2010 saw the publication of the first four books of the Essentials line: Dungeons & Dragons Starter Set (2010), Rules Compendium (2010), Dungeon Master's Kit (2010), and the first players book, Heroes of the Fallen Lands (2010). Now, in November 2010, the set of six rules-oriented releases for Essentials was drawing to a close. The DM-oriented Monster Vault (2010) and the second players book, Heroes of the Forgotten Kingdom (2010), were both published on November 16\\". On September 1, 2015, Heroes of the Forgotten Kingdom was re-released as a PDF.  Reception  On the Essentials line, M.J. Harnish, for Wired, commented that \\"for the past few years, starting with the very announcement of 4E and the Virtual Tabletop debacle, Wizards has been very poor at communicating honestly and openly with its fan base and has put out a string of very sub-par or poorly supported products, many of which saw errata almost immediately after their release. [...] Confusing titles and formats (for example, the adoption of the digest-size books for the Essentials line and then subsequent abandonment of that format) didn't help the matter\\". Critical-Hits compared Heroes of the Forgotten Kingdoms to Heroes of the Fallen Lands and highlighted that both books greatly overlap including that the first 72 pages of both books are nearly identical. They wrote that \\"as the primary offering of Essentials D&D; material for players, these books serve two very important and very different purposes. The first is that they present new and reworked builds for existing 4th Edition classes that change some of the fundamental ways the player interacts with the mechanics of the game. The second purpose they serve is in updating some of the key components of the game such as feats and the magic item system, both of which have been changed for the better in my opinion. If you’re a 4th Edition player and are looking for something new or different for your favorite class, I highly recommend looking through the book that contains that class and giving it a shot\\". Appelcline commented that \\"despite the extensive duplication of the core Essentials rules, the center 200 pages or so are new, covering the unique classes and races of the Forgotten Kingdoms. [...] One of the major controversies over Essentials was the fact it rolled back some of the changes in 4e, reverting some of the game's philosophies to their 3e roots. Though much of this had to do with how classes were constructed, it's interesting to see that Essentials was also returning character classes to tropes popularized in D&D; 3e. [...] The races of Heroes of the Forgotten Kingdom are many of the newer, and less usual offerings\\".

This was the first post-Essentials Dungeons & Dragons release and the supplement was designed to be compatible with both the Essentials line and the base game.  Contents  Heroes of Shadow is a 160-page supplement focusing on shadow themed classes, races and other options for players. Shannon Appelcline, author of Designers & Dragons, wrote: \\"Heroes of Shadow introduces a few classes who had been somewhat missing from D&D; 4e. The assassin went MIA starting in AD&D; second edition (1989-2000) [...]. It had returned in AD&D; 3e (2000) as a prestige class, but wasn't in the core for 4e, appearing only in Dragon #379 (September 2009). [...] The blackguard is an alternate paladin that's sort of evil. The idea of an anti-paladin dates back to an article called \\"Good Got You Down? Try This for Evil\\" in Dragon #39 (July 1980). [...] However, anti-paladins had never before gotten official notice, and PHBR12: The Complete Paladin's Handbook (1994) even said 'we discourage the use of anti-paladins'. Now, Heroes of Shadow finally offered an official option\\". The table of contents lists the follow sections: * Chapter 1: Into the Dark * Chapter 2: Shadow Class **Assassin **Paladin **Vampire **Warlock ** Other Classes * Chapter 3: Races of Shadow ** Revenant **Shade ** Vryloka **Dwarves **Eladrin **Elves **Halfings **Humans * Chapter 4: Shadow Options ** Paragon Paths ** Epic Destines ** Shadow Feat ** Equipment Appelcline also highlighted the three new races for 4th edition: \\"None of them were particularly notable in the annals of D&D;, but each had a bit of historical depth. The revenant had previously appeared in Dragon #376 (June 2009). The shade was a popular D&D; monster that dated back to Monster Manual II (1983). The vryloka was a breed of living vampires based on some of the same ideas as the vrykolaka from \\"Hearts of Darkness\\" in Dragon #126 (October 1990)\\". Publication history On the development of this book, Senior Creative Art Director Jon Schindehette said the \\"Heroes of Shadows game supplement focuses on the darker characters in the Dungeons & Dragons universe. Now I’m not talking about villains, but rather those characters that call themselves heroes and use the power of the Shadowfell: dark, disturbed and perhaps even a little morally ambiguous at times, but heroes nonetheless\\". Heroes of Shadow was written by Mike Mearls with Claudio Pozas and Robert J. Schwalb. It was published on April 19th, 2011 and was the first post- Essentials Dungeons & Dragons. Appelcline added that \\"the whole Essentials line trailed off entirely in 2011. The 'Class Compendium,' which was intended to bridge the core 4E rules with the Essentials variant, was canceled. After that, Essentials-like books — starting with Heroes of Shadows (2011) — were returned to the more expensive hardcover format.\\" Appelcline commented that with the fifth season of Encounters, Dark Legacy of Evard (2011, 13 weeks), \\"This Season told a ghost story that focusing on the Shadowfell and the related Heroes of Shadow (2011) release.\\" In May 2011, The Shadowfell: Gloomwrought and Beyond was released and continued to expand on the themes established in Heroes of Shadow. On April 28, 2015, Heroes of Shadow was re- released as a PDF.  Reception  Critical-Hits highlighted the fan confusion on if the book was part of the Essentials line or not: \\"If you were to ask me if the book Heroes of Shadow is an Essentials D&D; product, I would say no on the principle that it does not say Essentials on the cover and that I have a pretty clear definition of what the product line was and entailed. However, I don’t feel that WotC has done a sufficient job making the definitions clear, and so I would say that this book very heavily favors Essentials content. [...] I think that what this book tells us about the direction for 4E D&D; that WotC is taking is that new class design will be following the guidelines set forth in the Essentials products. New races, feats, items, and monsters all follow a new set of guidelines that came around mostly with Essentials, but I think the place we feel the difference the most, and the place where we really care, is in the design of classes\\". Appelcline emphasized that vampires as a class, and not as a race, was the most controversial element of Heroes of Shadow. Appelcline pointed out that \\"the designers made this unusual choice because it allowed them to 'create a character that both captures the aspects of the iconic vampire, and feels like a vampire every round'. It also permitted players to mix various races with the vampire class. There was also a strong history of vampire classes in the D&D; game, dating back to Dave Arneson's Blackmoor campaign\\".

The Emporium also contains an article on henchmen and hirelings that had previously appeared in Dragon #397 (March 2011).

It was exclusively released at local game stores and was not made available for purchase through online stores such as Amazon. The book was re-released as a PDF on November 10, 2015. Appelcline highlighted that this book nearly did not exist at all - the book \\"was first announced late in 2010 with a release date of April 19, 2011. Unfortunately, that put it right in the crosshairs of a series of cancellations that would eventually lead to the death of D&D; 4e (2011-2012). Mordenkainen's Magnificent Emporium was thus cancelled on January 12, 2011, as part of the same announcement that moved Heroes of Shadow (2011) back a month and killed \\"Class Compendium: Heroes of Sword and Spell\\" and \\"Hero Builder's Handbook\\" entirely. That was it for those other books [...], but Mordenkainen's Magnificent Emporium was lucky enough to make it back onto Wizards' production schedule.

The box set includes: * \\"Four 32-page books describing Gardmore Abbey and its inhabitants, along with quests and encounters\\", * two \\"double-sided battle maps depicting key adventure locations\\", * two \\"die-cut sheets of cardstock tokens and dungeon tiles\\", * and \\"the Deck of Many Things (22 cards) plus 2 exclusive Treasure Cards\\".

Publication history  Madness at Gardmore Abbey was published by Wizards of the Coast in September 2011. It was written by James Wyatt with Creighton Broadhurst and Steve Townshend. Shannon Appelcline, author of Designers & Dragons, wrote \\"lead designer James Wyatt used a description of the Gardbury Downs from the Dungeon Master's Kit (2010) as the basis of this adventure. It detailed the ruins of a monastery that had been brought down by a 'dark artifact'. Wyatt decided that the artifact was the infamous Deck of Many Things … and went from there. [...] [Wyatt] wrote the overall design of Madness at Gardmore Abbey while he handed off the encounters to his designers. [...] Creighton took on the Abbey's Inner Encounters (Book 3), and Townshend wrote the Abbey's Outer Encounters (Book 4)\\". It was re-released as a PDF on August 4, 2015.

The Deck of Many Things \\"premiered in Supplement I: Greyhawk (1975) and has returned in various Dungeon Master's Guides (1979, 1989, 2000, 2003) over the years, clearly revealing it as one of D&D;'s most popular magic items. A physical deck had been published once before, as an insert in Dragon #148 (August 1989). The deck had also previously appeared in D&D; 4e as a paragon-level artifact, in Dungeon #177 (April 2010). Now it was reappearing in a new form as a heroic- level artifact\\". Reception Madness at Gardmore Abbey won the 2012 Silver ENnie Award for \\"Best Adventure\\" and \\"Best Cartography\\". Appelcline wrote that \\"Madness at Gardmore Abbey may have been the best-loved adventure of the 4e era\\". He pointed to specific design elements of the adventure that innovated on the traditional 4th edition linear encounter-based and tactical format: \\"Madness at Gardmore Abbey kept to that format but rather impressively used it to create a sandbox adventure. [...] Madness pulls off this trick with the use of patrons who give out quests. In fact, two of the four adventure books focus on patrons, rivals, and the physical details of the Abbey, creating a sandbox full of options. The Encounters then fit into that sandbox, as the players choose the particular directions that they want to explore. However, the sandboxing of Madness goes deeper than a set of patron-quests. When Wyatt wrote out his order for the Encounters, he told his designers that he didn't want a 'combat slog', but instead a 'mix of combat, roleplaying, and skill challenges'. Thus, Madness is one of the most varied of all the 4e adventures, even within the constraints of individual encounters\\".

In 2010, the Los Angeles Times referred to Weidman as possibly \\"the most famous unknown artist.\\" Weidman was born in the Belvedere Gardens section of present-day East Los Angeles on June 28, 1921. He initially attended Garfield High School, but transferred to Manual Arts High School to focus on an art career. He received a scholarship to Otis Art Institute, but never attended because of the outbreak of World War II, which led to his enlistment in the United States Navy. He used the GI Bill to enroll at Jepson Art Institute following the war. He met his future wife, Dorothy, at Jepson, where she was a silkscreen instructor. The couple married in 1953. Weidman began his career with animator John Hubley. He then became a background artist and painter at United Productions of America, better known as UPA. He is credited with helping UPA develop the \\"distinctive modern style\\" which became a hallmark of the animation studio's productions. His television series and special credits with UPA animation included The Famous Adventures of Mr. Magoo, The Boing-Boing Show and Mister Magoo's Christmas Carol (1962). Aside from his work at UPA, Weidman also worked on television shorts for Crusader Rabbit, Popeye, and Fractured Fairy Tales. David Weidman briefly left animation after to focus on silkscreening after becoming frustrated with a group-centered animation process. Weidman developed a blotting process to create original works. In a 2013 interview with Greater Long Beach, he described how he utilized pictures of objects or blocks of color with \\"varying degrees of transparency.\\" His prints often mimic the backdrops he painted for 1960s era animated cartoons. He opened a small gallery and workshop located behind a liquor store on La Cienega Boulevard in Los Angeles. He gained a corporate clientele, who used his prints in hotels and other public buildings. However, he disliked having to tailor his work, telling Find Art in a 2014 interview, \\"When clients began dictating to me the color and the subject, they took me off my rails.\\" He created thousands of silkscreens, but few were purchased by collectors. Some works were priced as low as ten dollars. His printing shop gradually transformed into a custom framing business. Weidman returned to animation during the middle of the 1960s. He worked on Wacky Races and Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines for Hanna-Barbera. He also returned to UPA to work on Uncle Sam Magoo (1970), the last Mr. Magoo television special. While he continued to produce posters and ceramics for decades, Weidman stopped creating silkscreen prints around 1980 due to the work-intensive nature of the process. He did not begin creating new silkscreens again until his artwork was \\"discovered\\" or \\"rediscovered\\" circa 2008 when he was well into his 80s. Interest in Weidman's pieces were revived with the premiere of Mad Men, which first aired in 2007. Mad Men's set designer, Claudette Didul, is quoted in an article by David A. Keeps of the Los Angeles Times, \\"The style is very distinctive and indicative of that era and the popularity of Danish modern...They remind me of pictures I saw growing up and seemed in keeping with Peggy's sensibilities and reflect her younger and somewhat more cheerful outlook.\\" Weidman's work was used to colorfully decorate the set in Peggy Olson's office and other rooms in the fictional 1960s ad agency. The inclusion of Weidman's prints in Mad Men led to new opportunities. Urban Outfitters licensed a line of pillows emblazon with Weidman's mid-century art. In 2008, Steven Kurutz, a writer for the New York Times published a book on the artist and his work, \\"The Whimsical Works of David Weidman\\" through Gingko Press. A retrospective of his work opened on June 28, 2014, at the Weidman Gallery, now located on Melrose Avenue. Weidman attended the opening of exhibition, which ran until July 31, 2014. David Weidman died of congestive heart failure at his home in the Highland Park neighborhood of Los Angeles on August 6, 2014, at the age of 93. He had lived with his wife and family in the home since they built it in the 1950s. He was survived by his wife, Dorothy Weidman, whom he married in 1953, and three children, Lenna Weidman, Josh Weidman and Troy Weidman.

Publication history Halls of Undermountain was written by Matt Sernett with Shawn Merwin, and was the final published and distributed adventure for 4th edition Dungeons & Dragons. It was originally released in April 2012 as a 96-page hardcover book with two poster maps and then later released as a PDF. The massive poster of Undermountain included with the book was created by Mike Schley. Appelcline wrote \\"Halls of Undermountain was supposed to be a boxed release like its immediate predecessor, Madness at Gardmore Abbey (2011), . The original plan was to include a 32-page \\"Dungeon Components\\" book, a 64-page \\"Adventure\\" book, a variety of tokens and dungeon dressings, a half-dozen original miniatures, some cards, and a pair of double-sided maps. Though boxes are expensive, the designers were assured that the project could be brought in at a retail price of $40. Then the cost cutting began. First some of the original miniatures were replaced with \\"pick-ups\\" from old sets, then all of them were. Then the number of painting steps on the miniatures had to be reduced. Then the miniatures were cut entirely. Then the token sheets were reduced from three to two. Then the box and the rest of the token sheets were cut entirely. In the end, the two booklets were combined into one 96-page hardcover book and the maps were glued into the back. The price was reduced to $30 ... but one of the main complaints ended up being that it was still overpriced\\".

Contents  Ed Greenwood Presents Elminster's Forgotten Realms details the Forgotten Realms from the point of view of both Ed Greenwood and his creation, Elminster the Sage of Shadowdale. In the forward, Elminster writes: > To all who peruse this volume, these: Well met, as always, and welcome to > the latest tome from the pen of Ed of the Greenwood that purports to lay > bare secrets of the world I dwell in, the place best known to ye as “the > Forgotten Realms.” A world so vast and rich that its secrets could fill > libraries—to say nothing of the myriad passing details of everyday life, the > strivings of folk mighty and simple.

There are six chapters in this book: * Life in the Realms * Laws and Orders * Hearth and Home * Money Matters * Gods and Followers * The Art Shannon Appelcline commented that \\"even sections that seem like typical gaming fare aren't. Thus, the section on gods doesn't just talk about the deities that people worship, but also why the people of the Realms tolerate evil churches and how temples raise funds. The setting of Elminster's Forgotten Realms was somewhat surprising for fans. It's largely focused on life in the 1350s, before any of the changes brought on by the D&D; game. Sentences here and there touch upon events as late as the 1400s, but they're mostly asides and additions, not the core of the content\\".  Publication history  Ed Greenwood Presents Elminster's Forgotten Realms was written by Ed Greenwood and published as a hardcover book on October 16, 2012. The book was made aviavble as a PDF or softcover book through online sources such as DriveThruRPG and DMs Guild. Matt Morgan, for MTV News, reported that \\"back in January [2012] at the Dungeons & Dragons new products seminar, lead developer Mike Mearls gave fans of a preview of the D&D; supplement 'Elminster's Forgotten Realms.' Mearls told the crowd that Wizards of the Coast staff approached Greenwood to ask 'why don't you take all your campaign notes, all the information you've been putting together for your campaign and lets compile it into a book? Show us the realms as you've developed it in your campaign setting and lets get that to everybody.' It's not often that fans get such an inside look at the creation of one of their favorite settings, but 'Elminster's Forgotten Realms' completely pulls back the curtain on Greenwood's design. Hitting store shelves today at 192 pages, the hardcover 'Elminster's Forgotten Realms' will retail for $39.95, and manages to cram in an impressive amount of information\\". Appelcline wrote that \\"two months before the release of Elminster's Forgotten Realms, Menzoberranzan: City of Intrigue (2012), appeared as an edition-neutral sourcebook, marking the end of the D&D; 4e era (2008-2012). This was a trend that Wizards had also following during the transition between D&D; 3e and 4e (2007-2008); it was intended to keep supplements relevant even past the lifespan of a game edition. Now, Elminster's Forgotten Realms put the final nail in 4e's coffin: not only was it another edition-neutral book, but it was also the first book to do away with the D&D; 4e trade dress. Its cover and interior instead mixed elegant blacks with constrained parchments — a big change from the brighter colors and plainer whites used during the D&D; 4e era. [...] Elminster's Forgotten Realms was also the harbinger of another major change: a return to the Forgotten Realms\\". Reception Ed Greenwood Presents Elminster's Forgotten Realms won the 2013 Silver ENnie Award for \\"Best Art, Interior\\". Matt Morgan, for MTV News, wrote \\"the gritty details begin with a look at everyday life in the Realms, covering everything from the local lingo and racial viewpoints to arts and medicine. Being able to talk the talk and adopt the local customs is important for a setting populated with so many races. [...] As the book progresses, Greenwood takes many detours to expound on topics when information pertinent to a specific section of the Realms presents itself. Readers will be treated to many a sidebar that explains how life, government, families, money, religion, and magic all differ from Waterdeep to Cormyr and beyond. A common criticism of Dungeons & Dragons is that it's built for hack and slash fighting, but when a quality DM is armed with such detail as 15 pages on what a setting's denizens eat, you're going to get a true story that tells more than just combat tales. 'Elminter's Forgotten Realms' is one of the best Dungeons & Dragons books released in recent memory. This transcends the traditional splatbook, and is useful book for players in the Forgotten Realms setting and also a good read for anyone with an appreciation for fantasy world-building. [...] I can't say for certain how much of the information I learned about the Realms is brand new. [...] What I do know, though, is that \\"Elminster's Forgotten Realms\\" did a fantastic job of compiling encyclopedic information into a compelling package\\". The Geeks of Doom review highlighted that \\"never in a hundred years did I think I would ever see such an in depth look as Ed Greenwood Presents Elminster’s Forgotten Realms. It really is a masterpiece of Ed Greenwood‘s imagination. Taken from Greenwood’s original notes from the late sixties, the Forgotten Realms were adapted in the seventies for game play with the original Dungeons & Dragons and finalized in the eighties for release with the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game books. [...] And when I say it is full of information, I’m not kidding. This book includes everything from typical foods to economics to everyday entertainments. Covering specifics such as how to become a noble at court and individual alliances between kingdoms, it also speaks to the more mundane things like education, local judiciary systems, and clothing differences by area. There really is something here for everybody. Whether you are running a campaign in this setting or just want more reference material while reading the scores of novels set there, this is the most comprehensive compendium I have seen on the subject. [...] My favorite parts are the scribblings of Greenwood from his original notes, it’s amazing to see how far this world has come in the past four decades since he first imagined it.\\" Appelcline commented that \\"prior to the publication of Elminster's Forgotten Realms, TSR and Wizards had published four major Forgotten Realms references: the 1e Forgotten Realms Campaign Set (1987), the 2e Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting (1993), the 3e Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting (2001), and the 4e Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide (2008). They were each major overviews of the Realms … and totally unlike this new reference. If Elminster's Forgotten Realms has any predecessor, it's Ed Greenwood's own series of Volo Guides (1992-1996, 2000). Like those books, this one is all about the details of the Forgotten Realms: the small-picture Realmslore rather than the big descriptions. It's about how people live their lives, not where political boundaries are drawn. It's entirely fluff, but richly detailed fluff\\".

Oil on canvas, Claude Monet, 1880, Musée Marmottan Monet, Paris National Gallery of Art, Washington Michel Monet (17 March 1878 – 3 February 1966) was the second son of Claude Monet and Camille Doncieux Monet. Early life Born on 17 March 1878, 26 rue d'Édimbourg, in the 8th arrondissement of Paris, where the Monets had moved from Argenteuil, Michel Monet was the younger of Claude and Camille Monet's two sons. His mother's already failing health worsened after his birth and she died on 5 September 1879, probably of uterine cancer. Michel's elder brother, Jean, was born in 1867. Since 1877, year of Ernest Hoschedé's bankruptcy, Alice Hoschedé and her six children had been living with the Monets. The two families moved from Paris to Vétheuil in August 1878 and after Camille's death in 1879, Monet, Alice and the eight children continued living together. In 1881, they moved to Poissy and in April 1883 to Giverny. Alice managed the household and supervised the education of the Monet and Hoschedé children.

Marriage Michel Monet married Gabrielle Bonaventure in 1927. The couple had no children. Gabrielle died 2 February 1964. Claude Monet estate When Claude Monet died in 1926, as his sole heir, Michel inherited the entire estate. Michel never spent time in Giverny and Blanche Hoschedé Monet, his stepsister and sister-in-law, became the caretaker of the house and garden until her death in 1947. Louis Lebret, who had been Monet's head gardener, stayed on to help Blanche. After her death the garden was neglected. Death Michel Monet, a car enthusiast, died in a car crash in nearby Vernon on 3 February 1966, a few weeks before his 88th birthday. He had bequeathed the estate to the Académie des beaux-arts. From 1977 onwards, Gérald Van der Kemp, then curator at the Château de Versailles, played a key role in the restoration of Claude Monet's house and gardens, which had been left in a desolate state. In a bid to raise funds, he and his wife Florence appealed to American donors through the \\"Versailles Foundation-Giverny Inc.\\" In 1966, Michel Monet had left to the Musée Marmottan Monet his own collection of his father's work, thus creating the world's largest collection of Monet paintings.

Originally planned as a mobile-only version of Super Meat Boy, Super Meat Boy Forever was gradually developed into a full-fledged sequel featuring a new control scheme and randomly generated levels. Gameplay Super Meat Boy Forever expands on Super Meat Boy's challenging gameplay, as well as the main villain Dr. Fetus. Meat Boy and Bandage Girl's child Nugget has been kidnapped by Dr. Fetus and the couple must work together to rescue her. Both characters can kick and punch enemies and must avoid deadly obstacles to save Nugget. The control scheme uses two buttons. Levels are randomly generated based on the player's skill level by combining premade \\"chunks\\" created by the designers. Development Development for Super Meat Boy Forever was announced in 2014 as mobile-only sequel to the original Super Meat Boy. Team Meat founders Edmund McMillen and Tommy Refenes originally teased the project as a \\"live action stealth game\\" called A Voyeur for September, but this was later revealed to be an anagram for Super Meat Boy Forever. After a few years of little to no public updates, Edmund McMillen left Team Meat and began focusing on other intellectual property such as The Binding of Isaac and The End Is Nigh. Refenes said to not \\"hold your breath\\" expecting McMillen to come back after Super Meat Boy Forever is released. In 2017, Refenes restarted the project as full-fledged sequel and several new team members joined Team Meat to help with development. Among the new team members were Kyle Pulver (Offspring Fling, Snapshot), Paul ter Voorde and Temmie Chang who worked on the art for Undertale. Ridiculon, who composed the music for the PlayStation 4 version of Super Meat Boy, returned to compose the sequel's soundtrack. Refenes explains that even though the game is still coming to mobile, this version was developed primarily as a console game. The new version of the game was revealed at PAX Prime 2017 and was showcased by Nintendo during their Nindies Summer 2017 Showcase, and the PAX demo of the game was well received by the media. The game was scheduled for an April 2019 release, but was pushed back to a later date on consoles with a late 2020 release for Steam.

Prabhu and Fathima Prabhu, on 14 May 1972, at Bangalore, in the south Indian state of Karnataka, as a normal child like his two brothers, Jerry and George. The tragedy struck at the age of four, when a blotched lumbar puncture made him a quadriplegic for the rest of his life. However, he was brought up by his parents as a normal boy, sending him to institutions for normal children which helped the young Boniface to take up life as any competitive person would. Boniface Prabhu is the founder of a trust, Boniface Prabhu Wheelchair Tennis Academy, based in Bangalore, with the aim of promoting the physically and intellectually challenged people and providing them with opportunities to nurture their talents. The Academy provides free sports training to differently enabled people. He took to the cause of PWDs with ThumbsUp by driving 3,500 km from Kashmir to Kanyakumari.https://www.coca- colaindia.com/boniface-prabhu-padamshree-awardee-indias-first-paralympic- medal-winner-rallies-behind-prime-ministers-call-accessible-india/ Boniface is married to Christina and the couple has a daughter, Simone Diya. Sporting career Though Boniface's principal claim to fame is wheelchair tennis, he has excelled in other disciplines, too. He has represented India, at International events, in six disciplines, over 50 times. These include athletics, shot put, badminton, javelin throw, table tennis, shooting and discus throw, apart from wheelchair tennis. His foray into international sports was at the 1996 World Wheelchair Games, UK where he won gold medal in shot put and silver medal in discus throw. Two years later, he repeated the feat at the 1998 Paralympics World Championships, participating in javelin, shot put and discus throws. He is the first Indian to win a medal in the International Paralympic Games.  Tennis career  Boniface Prabhu was fascinated with tennis at an early age when he used to be a fan of Ivan Lendl and John Macenroe. During his participation of the World Wheelchair Athletic Meet of 1996 in the UK, he chanced upon a game of wheelchair tennis and developed an instant liking to it. On returning to India, he approached Karnataka State Lawn Tennis Association for permission to use their courts for practice which he was granted. He talked to a local tennis coach and impressed upon him to teach him the game. He was a fast learner and in two years time, he started participating in tournaments. * Winner - Sydney International Wheelchair Tennis Championship - 2007 * Winner - Singles - Florida open - 2004 * Winner - Doubles - Florida open - 2004 * Runner-up - Sydney International Wheelchair Open Tennis - 2003 * Quarter finalist - Australian Open International Wheelchair Tennis - 2003 * Winner - Japan Open Wheelchair Tennis Championship - 2001 * Winner - Sydney International Wheelchair Tennis Championship - 1999 * Runner up - Australian Open - 1999 * Semi finalist Singles - US Open - 1998 * Semi finalist Doubles - US Open - 1998 Boniface has reached a career best world ranking of 17 in singles and 19 in doubles.

By _2019_ , _2.7 billion characters_ of news media texts have been filtered so far, of which _680 million characters_ have been processed and analyzed and have yielded an expanding Pan-Chinese dictionary of _2.3 million words_ from the Pan-Chinese printed media. Through rigorous analysis based on computational linguistic methodology, LIVAC has at the same time accumulated a large amount of accurate and meaningful statistical data on the Chinese language and their speech communities in the Pan-Chinese region, and the results show considerable and important variations.Tsou, Benjamin.

Leiden; Boston: BRILL The \\"Windows\\" approach is the most representative feature of LIVAC and has enabled Pan-Chinese media texts to be quantitatively analyzed according to various attributes such as locations, time and subject domains.

Davenport studied at the undergraduate and graduate level at Michigan State Agricultural College. He taught at the school for two years, then briefly led an agricultural college in Brazil. When he returned to the U.S. he accepted he position as dean of the University of Illinois College of Agriculture. He is credited with greatly growing the institution in his 27 years and was named vice president of the university from 1920 to 1922. He retired and wrote a memoir on his farm until his death. Biography Eugene Davenport was born on June 20, 1856, on a farm in Barry County, Michigan near Woodland. He was the only child of George Martin and Esther (Sutton) Davenport. He attended both public and private schools. Davenport began teaching when he reached the age of eighteen. He attended the Michigan State Agricultural College, graduating in 1878. Davenport then returned to the family farm and taught at a nearby private school. He returned to college to obtain a Master of Science degree, graduating in 1884. Davenport again returned to the college in 1888 study under William James Beal. He was named a professor of agriculture and superintendent of the college farm in 1889. He only held the position for two years before leaving to preside over an agricultural school in Piracicaba, Brazil. However, Davenport left in April 1892 to study at the Rothamsted Experimental Station in Harpenden, England. At some point he returned to the family farm near Woodland. In the fall of 1894, Davenport agreed to become dean of the College of Agriculture at the University of Illinois. Arriving January 1, 1895, Davenport found that there were only nine students and that the school offered only a short course in the winter. Furthermore, the new president of the university, Andrew S. Draper, disliked the agricultural studies. Davenport was made professor of animal husbandry that March, Draper initially refused to allow Davenport to hire any fellow instructors. Davenport secured funds from outside sources to provide for faculty, and Draper finally relented to allow hiring in the summer of 1896 with Perry Greeley Holden and Wilber J. Fraser. Davenport helped secure funds for the College of Agriculture Building. It is now known as Davenport Hall. Davenport was appointed director of the Agricultural Experiment Station in 1896. He co-founded the Illinois Farmers' Institute, which he used to lobby the Illinois General Assembly for funds for the school. In 1899, the assembly approved a motion to appropriate money for the construction of an agricultural building. He published his first textbook, Principles of Breeding, in 1907. This was followed by Education for Efficiency in 1909, where he argued for teaching home economics and agriculture in public school. During World War I he was part of a committee advising the government on food policy. The connections that Davenport made during the war helped to provide more funds and influence for the college. In 1920, Davenport was named vice president of the university, a position he held until his retirement two years later. He then returned to the family farm near Woodland. He wrote a memoir, Timberland Times, which was published posthumously in 1950. He was also working on an autobiography, but was unable to finish it. Davenport married Emma Jane Coats on November 2, 1881. They had two daughters: Dorothy (died an infant) and Margaret. His surviving daughter died in 1930 and his wife followed in 1935. Politically, Davenport was a Republican and he staunchly supported prohibition of alcohol and tobacco. Davenport was the only member of the Michigan Convention to Ratify the 21st Amendment (repealing prohibition) to vote against it. He was raised in the Universalist church but later became a Congregationalist. Davenport died on his farm on March 31, 1941 following kidney disease. He was buried at Woodland Memorial Park. The College of Agriculture at the University of Illinois was renamed Davenport Hall in his honor.

After more than three months of heavy fighting, ISIS totally defeated the rebels and captured almost the whole province, except a part of the provincial capital, the military airport on its southern outskirts and a few of the surrounding towns, which remained under control of Syrian Arab Republic government troops, who were not involved in the inter- rebel fighting. Background Protests against the Syrian government and violence has been ongoing in the Syrian city of Deir ez-Zor since March 2011, as part of the wider Syrian civil war, but large-scale clashes started following a military operation in late July 2011 to secure the city of Deir ez-Zor. The rebels had gradually taken control of the province until almost complete domination in mid-2013. The offensive =ISIS attack on Abu Kamal= On 10 April 2014, ISIS launched a three-pronged assault on rebel positions in and near the border town of Abu Kamal. The ISIS reportedly took parts of the town, the silos near the town and Kabajeb. The bodies of 10 rebel fighters, allegedly executed by ISIS, were found at two different sites in Abu Kamal with more reports of the summary executions of rebels by the ISIS in the area according to the SOHR. A counter-attack against ISIS positions by al- Nusra Front and its allies was reported the same day, involving the brigades Liwa al-Qadisiyah and Liwa 'Umar al-Mukhtar. On 11 April, the number of dead on both sides was raised to 86, including the brother of the ISIS Emir in Abu Kamal and the judge of a Sharia committee. On 11 April, Jabhat al Nusra and Islamic battalions bolstered by reinforcements regained control of Abu Kamal after the ISIS was pushed out of occupied districts in less than a few hours after the takeover. ISIS pulled out to the T2 oil station on the outskirts of the city. Most of its checkpoints in the area were also removed. The SOHR confirmed the executions of seven rebel fighters belonging to the Islamic battalion during the seizure of the oil station the previous day. 26 ISIS fighters were killed in the second day of fighting with the rebel death toll rising to 60. Three Islamic fighters were also killed battling ISIS positions in the north along with one killed in Markadah. On 13 April, fighting in the Abu Kamal area subsided as ISIS retreated to the town of Haseen. Heavy clashes were reported with rebels as ISIS made territorial gains in the north, capturing several villages previously held by the rebels. On 16 April, rebels pulled away from northern Deir ez-Zor while ISIS was pushed out of a city in the south, leaving 13 ISIS fighters dead. The same day, ISIS assassinated al- Nusra Emir in Idlib province, Abu Muhammed al Ansari. =Rebel counter- attack= By 26 April, according to rebel source, some 1,500 rebels were engaged in an offensive in Raqqa province, trying to push towards the city of Raqqa. The same source claimed that the rebels took at least five villages. On 1 May, rebels reportedly captured the town of Al-Busayrah as well as the Al- Busayrah mound from the ISIS. The next day, ISIS fighters took the Abriha village from the rebels, but the rebels recaptured it two days later. More than 60,000 civilians have reportedly fled from towns and villages in Deir ez- Zor province due to the clashes between the rebels and ISIS. That day, the Al- Nusra Front announced that it will stop fighting ISIS as soon as the ISIS will stop its attacks on Muslims. On 5 May, 69 rebels and local gunmen were killed in clashes against ISIS in Deir ez-Zor, while at least 23 ISIS fighters were killed, as well as five civilians, including the governor of the province. The As-Sabkhah village was reportedly taken by the rebels. On 8 May, ISIS arrested hundreds of people in Deir ez-Zor under suspicion of having family members among the rebels and 20 of them were allegedly executed. Meanwhile, ISIS captured the villages of at-Tabiyah,Accused of cooperation with Syria rebels, 20 civilians executed by ISIL in Deir ez-Zor Al-Kasrah and Hammar Ali in the province. More than 20 rebels were killed in the clashes. Several ISIS fighters were also killed. On 10 May, ISIS took complete control of western Reef Deir Iz Zor. From 30 April until 10 May, 230 fighters and several civilians were killed in the clashes between the Al-Nusra Front and ISIS in the governorate of Deir ez-Zor according to the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights; 146 of the dead combatants were those who fought against ISIS. =ISIS captures western Deir ez-Zor= Situation in Deir ez-Zor Governorate, mid-May 2014 On 11 May, an opposition source stated that since the start of the conflict 2,000 rebel fighters had been killed fighting against ISIS and 2,850 were wounded. From 10 to 11 May, ISIS was said to have gained control of important parts of eastern Deir ez-Zor province and districts of Deir ez-Zor city from rival rebel forces, opposition sources reported. ISIS reportedly executed multiple FSA fighters at a checkpoint in Al-Hisan village in Deir ez- Zor province on 11 May. On 13 May, ISIS reportedly gained control of at least five villages in the northern countryside of Raqqa Governorate after battles with rebels; 14 rebel fighters were reported killed in the clashes. ISIS was said to have executed the military commander of the Liwa Thuwar al-Raqqa and his nephew near Ayn Issa in Raqqa Governorate.إعدام القائد العسكري للواء إسلامي في الرقة On 16 May, ISIS launched a suicide attack on a rebel brigade's headquarters in Ash-Shuhayl town east of Deir ez-Zor; 13–14 people, mostly rebel fighters, were reported killed in the attack. By late May, 3,000 ISIS fighters were involved in the offensive in Deir ez-Zor. On 21 May, ISIS was reported to have gained control of the village of Al-Shulah, located in a desert oasis about 30 km southwest of Deir ez-Zor (which was previously captured by the army on 5 July 2013). A few months later, SOHR announced that warplanes carried out a raid on the area of Al-Shulah, which led to the death of 16 civilians (including ten children), when a rocket landed on a bus that was traveling to Damascus. However, Syrian state television accused ISIS of committing a \\"massacre\\" in the same place, which caused the deaths of 13 people, mostly women and children. A few months later, SOHR announced that violent clashes took place in Al-Shulah area between regime forces and IS after regime forces called for reinforcements in an attempt to advance in the area. On 22 May, ISIS was reported to have gained control of the Al-Kharrat oil terminal; 26 Al-Nusra and rebel fighters were killed in the fighting. ISIS was said to have captured five oil stations in the Deir ez-Zor countryside since the beginning of opposition infighting. On 2 June, ISIS took full control of Al-Busayrah east of Deir ez-Zor, while at the same time Jabhat al- Nusra and allies counterattacked, reclaiming 12 villages directly northwest and three directly east of Deir ez-Zor. On 5 June, ISIS gained control of the entire western countryside of Deir ez-Zor after Jabhat Al-Nusra forces withdrew following an assault by Chechen and Afghan ISIS fighters. On 8 June, the FSA reportedly assassinated the ISIS emir of Homs. By 10 June, the offensive into Deir ez-Zor had expanded and ISIS had reportedly driven Al- Nusra and aligned militants from nearly all of the province north of the Euphrates. According to SOHR, the violence since 30 April led to the death of 241 ISIS fighters and 354 rebels. ISIS also captured four oilfields. =Rebel defections and ISIS capture of eastern Deir ez-Zor= Situation in Deir ez-Zor Governorate, mid-June 2014 By 17 June, ISIS forces imposed a siege on rebel- held areas of the provincial capital and three days later captured three towns near the military airport. Since the start of the offensive, the pace of defections from the opposition to ISIS had accelerated, most significantly in the town of Al-Muhasan and adjacent villages, where a mass defection by the rebel garrison granted ISIS uncontested control over a key route to the provincial capital. On 25 June, the local unit of Al-Nusra in Abu Kamal on the Iraqi border pledged loyalty to ISIS. On 30 June, ISIS allowed a relief convoy with aid to enter the provincial capital.[Syria Direct: ISIS AID ENTERS DEIR E-ZOR] On 1 July, ISIS, bolstered by reinforcements from Iraq, routed rebels from Abu Kamal after days of fighting with opposition forces led by Al-Nusra. ISIS began advancing towards Al-Nusra's stronghold, Ash-Shuhayl, also reported to be the hometown of its leader, Abu Mohammad al-Julani.Report: Jihadi group captures Syrian border town The Washington Post 1 July 2014 On 3 July, ISIS took control of the towns of Mayadin and Ash-Shuhayl in Deir ez-Zor province, after Al-Nusra fighters withdrew, and gained control of Syria's largest oil field, al-Omar in Deir ez-Zor province, after Al-Nusra forces fled the facility.

Leaf window, also known as epidermal window, is a specialized leaf structure consisting of a translucent area where sunlight can enter into the interior surfaces of the plant's modified leaf where photosynthesis can occur. This is also known as fenestration. The translucent structure may include epidermal tissue, and in some succulent plants it consists of several cell layers of parenchyma, which may also function as water-storage tissue. It can appear as a large continuous patch, a variegated or reticulated region, or as numerous small spots. This structural adaptation is found in certain succulent plants native to arid climates, which allow much of the plant to remain beneath the soil surface where it is protected from desiccation of extreme winds and heat while optimizing the absorption of light by increasing the photosynthetic surface area. Many of the known species containing leaf windows are native to South Africa and neighbouring countries. Functions The primary function of the translucent windows on the leaf epidermis is to increase the absorption of radiant energy, and thereby the rate of photosynthesis. Epidermal windows are commonly situated at the apex of leaves, allowing unobstructed sunlight to be captured and utilized even when the plant is buried below the surface of the soil. The absence of stomata in the translucent tissue of the window prevents water loss in the plant. This allows succulents to minimize the exposure of leaf surface area to the outside environment and reduce the risk of desiccation under intense heat. The actual green, photosynthesizing surface is hidden in the underground part of the plant, so that it collects only the diffused light that strikes the windows, which in turn focusses and channels it to the leaves' inside surface. Experiments in the Lithops species of succulents, have shown that the size of leaf windows correlates inversely with habitat solar irradiance. Epidermal windows of plants growing in regions of high irradiance and low-rainfall were smaller than of those plants which grew in cloudy, high- rainfall regions. It is presumed that the size variation evolved to allow individual plants to set their optimal uptake of sunlight based on its environment. Carnivorous plants can also make use of by growing traps (highly modified leaves) which use sunlight to lure and/or confuse insects and increase the effectiveness of the trap. Species The epidermal window of Lithops salicola has a mottled appearance, which acts as camouflage Genera of plants with numerous species having translucent epidermal windows include: *Bulbine spp. (B. haworthioides, B. mesembryanthemoides, etc.) *Conophytum spp. *Callisia spp. (C. navicularis, etc.) *Fenestraria spp. *Frithia spp. *Haworthia spp. *Haworthiopsis spp. (H. koelmaniorum, H. tessellata, etc.) *Lithops spp. *Pleiospilos spp. (Questionable) *Peperomia spp.: notably P. columella and P. nivalis *Sarracenia spp. Several other plant species have epidermal windows: *Cephalotus follicularis *Darlingtonia californica *Senecio rowleyanus Plants with leaf windows are sometimes known as window plants, though this is also the common name used to refer to Fenestraria rhopalophylla.

Clostridium difficile), also known as Peptoclostridium difficile, C. difficile, or C. diff (), is Gram-positive species of spore-forming bacteria. Clostridioides spp. are anaerobic, motile bacteria, ubiquitous in nature and especially prevalent in soil. Its vegetative cells are rod-shaped, pleomorphic, and occur in pairs or short chains. Under the microscope, they appear as long, irregular (often drumstick- or spindle-shaped) cells with a bulge at their terminal ends (forms subterminal spores). Under Gram staining, C. difficile cells are Gram-positive and show optimum growth on blood agar at human body temperatures in the absence of oxygen. C. difficile is catalase- and superoxide dismutase- negative, and produces two types of toxins: enterotoxin A and cytotoxin B, which disrupts cytoskeleton signal transductions in the host. Under stress conditions, the bacteria produce spores that are able to tolerate extreme conditions that the active bacteria cannot tolerate. C. difficile is an important emerging human pathogen; according to the CDC, in 2017 there were 223,900 cases in hospitalized patients and 12,800 deaths in the United States. Although C. difficile is commonly known as a hospital and antibiotic associated pathogen, at most one third of infections can be traced to transmission from an infected person in hospitals, and only a small number of antibiotics are directly associated with an elevated risk of developing a C. difficile infection (CDI), namely clindamycin, fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins. The majority of infections are acquired outside of hospitals, and most antibiotics have similar elevated risk of infection on par with many non-antibiotic risk factors, such as using stool softeners and receiving an enema. C. difficile can also become established in the human colon without causing disease. Although early estimates indicated that C. difficile was present in 2–5% of the adult population, more recent research indicates colonization is closely associated with a history of unrelated diarrheal illnesses, such as food poisoning or laxative abuse. Individuals with no history of gastrointestinal disturbances appear unlikely to become asymptomatic carriers. These carriers are thought to be a major reservoir of infection.  Taxonomy  The species was transferred from the genus Clostridium to Clostridioides in 2016, thus giving it the binomial Clostridioides difficile. This new name reflects the taxonomic differences between this species and members of the genus Clostridium, while maintaining the common name as C. diff. , the only other species in this new genus is Clostridioides mangenotii (formerly known as Clostridium mangenotii). A July 2013 paper from Environmental Microbiology proposed to rename the species Peptoclostridium difficile.  Human pathogen  Pathogenic C. difficile strains produce multiple toxins. The best-characterized are enterotoxin (C. difficile toxin A) and cytotoxin (C. difficile toxin B), both of which may produce diarrhea and inflammation in infected patients (C. difficile colitis), although their relative contributions have been debated. The diarrhea may range from a few days of intestinal fluid loss to life-threatening pseudomembranous colitis, which is associated with intense inflammation of the colon and formation of pseudomembranes on the intestinal mucosal surface. Toxins A and B are glucosyltransferases that target and inactivate the Rho family of GTPases. Toxin B (cytotoxin) induces actin depolymerization by a mechanism correlated with a decrease in the ADP-ribosylation of the low molecular mass GTP-binding Rho proteins. There is also a binary toxin (AB toxin), but its role in disease is not fully understood. Additional virulence factors include an adhesin factor that mediates the binding to human colonic cells and a hyaluronidase.[Medical Micriobiology, Fifth Edition, Patrick Murray, Elsevier Mosby, 2005, page 412] The bacterium also produces the chemical para-cresol, which inhibits the growth of other microbes in its vicinity and allows it to outcompete normal human gut flora. Antibiotic treatment of C. diff infections may be difficult, due both to antibiotic resistance and physiological factors of the bacterium (spore formation, protective effects of the pseudomembrane). The emergence of a new, highly toxic strain of C. difficile, resistant to fluoroquinolone antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, said to be causing geographically dispersed outbreaks in North America, was reported in 2005. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta warned of the emergence of an epidemic strain with increased virulence, antibiotic resistance, or both. Resistance to other antibiotics such as metronidazole, the first choice of antimicrobial drug when treating CDI, has been observed in up to 12% of clinical isolates, so as treatment with various antibiotics continues, more diverse and stronger resistances will continue to evolve in C. difficile populations, further complicating attempts at effective treatment. Transmission C. difficile is transmitted from person to person by the fecal-oral route, shed in faeces. Any surface, device, or material (e.g., toilets, bathing tubs, and electronic rectal thermometers) that becomes contaminated with faeces may serve as a reservoir for the C. difficile spores. C. difficile can live for long periods of time on surfaces. The organism forms heat-resistant spores that are not killed by alcohol-based hand cleansers or routine surface cleaning, thus, these spores survive in clinical environments for long periods. Because of this, the bacterium may be cultured from almost any surface. Once spores are ingested, their acid resistance allows them to pass through the stomach unscathed. They germinate and multiply into vegetative cells in the colon upon exposure to bile acids. Consequently, the World Health Organization advocates the use of soap in addition to alcohol solutions to limit the spread of the spores. Sporulation was shown to be significantly reduced after inactivation of C. diffiicile's DNA methyltransferase CamA, raising the prospect of developing a drug that may inhibit this bacterium in a specific manner. Susceptibility to colonization appears to be triggered by diarrheal illnesses, such as food poisoning or laxative abuse; people without a history of diarrheal illnesses who are exposed to C. difficile spores will not necessarily become carriers. Once people are colonized by C. difficile, they remain carriers for year-long time scales, but the day-to-day abundance of C. difficile fluctuates considerably - fluctuating from being below the limit of detection to high levels of shedding from one day to the next. GI disturbances in carriers appear to trigger periods of increased shedding which may be an important factor for transmission.  Host range  C. difficile infects pigs, calves, and humans, and inhabits a natural reservoir of soil, faeces of domestic animals and humans, sewage, the human intestinal tract, and retail meat. A 2015 CDC study estimated that C. diff afflicted almost half a million Americans and caused 29,000 deaths in 2011. The study estimated that 40% of cases began in nursing homes or community health-care settings, while 24% occurred in hospitals. C. difficile is common in the human digestive system. However, it is a poor competitor, and is often outcompeted for nutrients by other bacteria in the digestive system. As a result, C. difficile is kept to a manageable number. If the sudden introduction of antibiotic disrupts the microbiome, C. difficile may be able to grow as a result of many of its competitors being killed off. The incubation period is 5–10 days, with a range of 1 day to weeks following antibiotic treatment for antibiotic associated diarrhea. Additionally, carriage of C. difficile with high levels of toxins is common in young children, while disease is rare. The production of one or even both toxins is not always sufficient for producing symptoms.[Medical Microbiology, Fifth Edition, Patrick Murray, Elsevier Mosby, 2005, page 412]  Signs and symptoms  Symptoms of C. difficile infection include: diarrhea (at least three loose bowel movements a day), dehydration, abdominal pain that can be severe, loss of appetite, and nausea.  Treatment  Patients being treated with antibiotics when symptoms begin should stop taking them, if possible. This break in antibiotic therapy can sometimes lead to spontaneous resolution of symptoms. Patients who do not respond to the cessation of broad- spectrum antibiotics will need to be treated with antibiotics capable of killing C. difficile spores. Primary infections are typically treated with vancomycin, with a usual dosage of 125 mg every 6 hours. The vancomycin regimen has replaced the traditional use of metronidazole due to its greater efficacy, safety profile, and lower recurrence rates. In patients who cannot tolerate vancomycin, fidaxomicin is an acceptable option with similar efficacy and even lower recurrence rates than vancomycin. In cases of fulminant CDI, adjuvant therapy with parenteral metronizadole plus oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin is suggested. About 20% of patients who successfully complete therapy of primary infection with metronidazole or vancomycin will experience a relapse. A fraction of those patients will experience continuous reoccurrences of the infection. The first relapse of C. difficile is usually treated with the same antibiotic used to treat the primary infection. Any subsequent infections should not be treated with metronidazole. Occasionally, a standard 10-day course of oral vancomycin will not work. In these cases, a vancomycin taper is the preferred treatment. Patients take decreasing doses of vancomycin over a period of up to 3 months, depending on the severity of the infection. Each subsequent relapse of C. difficile tends to be more severe than previous infections. Long-term treatment with a vancomycin taper supplemented with probiotics, especially Saccharomyces boulardii, is associated with a higher rate of success. After three relapses, patients may be treated with oral fidaxomicin, a narrow-spectrum antibiotic. The usual dosage is 200 mg twice a day orally for 10 days. Fidaxomicin is considered to be superior to vancomycin for severe CDI. The major downside of treatment with fidaxomicin is the cost of medication. A 10-day course may cost up to US$3500. Patients who do not respond to traditional antibiotic therapy may be eligible for a Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT). Healthcare providers can transfer stool from a healthy person to the colon of a patient with repeated CDI. This process is the most successful treatment for severe CDI with a cure rate around 93%. Recurrence rates of CDI in patients treated with a FMT are generally low, around 19%, which makes it very effective at treating chronic CDI cases. However, in some cases, flares of inflammatory bowel disease are a possible side effect of the treatment. Long-term effects of FMT are unknown, as the procedure has only been FDA approved since 2011 and relatively few procedures have been performed. If transplantation is not an option, removal of the infected part of the colon can cure CDI.  Strains  In 2005, molecular analysis led to the identification of the C. difficile strain type characterized as group BI by restriction endonuclease analysis, as North American pulse-field-type NAP1 by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and as ribotype 027; the differing terminology reflects the predominant techniques used for epidemiological typing. This strain is referred to as C. difficile BI/NAP1/027. As of 2016, the NAP1 strain has been replaced by novel strains in some areas of British Columbia. These novel strains include NAP2 and NAP4, and some strains that do not have a NAP designation. The frequency of these novel strains increased from 2008 to 2013 in one studied region, displacing the originally more common and recognizable NAP1 bacteria. Two strains, ribotypes RT078 and RT027, can live on low concentrations of the sugar trehalose; both strains became more common after trehalose was introduced as a food additive in the early 2000s, thus increasing dietary trehalose intake.  Genome  The first complete genome sequence of a C. difficile strain was first published in 2005 by Sanger Institute in the UK. This was of the strain 630, a virulent and multiple drug-resistant strain isolated in Switzerland in 1982. Scientists at Sanger Institute have sequenced genomes of about 30 C. difficile isolates using next-generation sequencing technologies from 454 Life Sciences and Illumina. Researchers at McGill University in Montreal sequenced the genome of the highly virulent Quebec strain of C. difficile in 2005 using ultra-high throughput sequencing technology. The tests involved doing 400,000 DNA parallel-sequencing reactions of the bacterium's genome, which had been fragmented for sequencing. These sequences were assembled computationally to form a complete genome sequence.Scientists map C. difficile strain – Institute of Public Affairs, Montreal In 2012, scientists at University of Oxford sequenced C. difficile genomes from 486 cases arising over four years in Oxfordshire using next-generation sequencing technologies from Illumina.  Epigenome  C. difficile has a highly diverse epigenome, with 17 high-quality methylation motifs reported so far, the majority pertaining to the 6mA type. Methylation at one of these motifs - CAAAA _A,_ was shown to impact sporulation, a key step in C. difficile disease transmission, as well as cell length, biofilm formation, and host colonization.  Bacteriophage  At least eight mainly temperate bacteriophages have been isolated from C. difficile, ranging in genome size from about 30 to about 60 kb. Both environmentally and clinically derived C. difficile strains carry a diverse and prevalent set of prophages.

Together with the California golden trout (the state fish of California) and the Kern River rainbow trout, the Little Kern golden trout forms what is sometimes referred to as the \\"golden trout complex\\" of the Kern River basin.Inland Fishes of California, By Peter B. Moyle. Page 20.  Taxonomic history  The evolutionary relationships between salmonoids is a matter of ongoing discovery, and there are different opinions about how specific populations should be grouped and named. The same can be said for the Little Kern golden trout, which has experienced several classification revisions since its first formal description. The Little Kern golden trout was first described as Salmo Whitei in 1906 by the biologist Barton Warren Evermann in his book ...The Golden Trout of the Southern High Sierras. Everman had been sent to the Kern Plateau by Theodore Roosevelt, after Roosevelt's friend Stewart Edward White had expressed concern that the brightly colored trout of the region were at risk of being fished into extinction. Everman named the fish in honor of White's role in its recognition. In 1989, morphological and genetic studies by Gerald Smith and Ralph Stearley indicated that trouts of the Pacific basin were genetically closer to Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus species) than to the Salmos; brown trout (Salmo trutta) or Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) of the Atlantic basin. Furthermore, in 1992 the Little Kern golden trout was then classified as a subspecies of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) by Robert J. Behnke. This led to the classification most commonly accepted today; Oncorhynchus mykiss whitei.  Description  The Little Kern golden trout is a brightly colored fish with profuse black spots on the back and tail. The belly and cheeks are typically a bright orange to orange-red. The lower sides of the fish range from a light yellow to bright gold. The back is olive green. The pectoral, pelvic and anal fins are orange with white tips. Unlike many varieties of rainbow trout, but similar to other redband trout and trout in the \\"golden trout complex\\", the Little Kern golden trout typically retain into adulthood up to ten parr marks along their sides. There is also often an intermediate row of smaller parr marks occurring above and/or below the main row of parr marks. Morphologically, the Little Kern golden trout sits somewhat in between the California golden trout and the typical coastal rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus). Compared to the California golden trout, the brilliance of coloration in the Little Kern golden trout is usually a bit more subdued. Little Kern goldens tend to have more black spots along its back, especially anterior to the caudal peduncle, and onto its head in comparison to California golden trouts. Compared to coastal rainbow trout, Little Kern goldens tend to have fewer, larger, and rounder spots. Little Kern golden trout in their native small stream habitat rarely exceed in length and any fish exceeding would be considered large.  Historic range and habitat  Little Kern golden trout historically occupied roughly of the Little Kern River and its tributaries above a natural waterfall barrier preceding its confluence with the main stem Kern River.Evans, W.A., R.C. Smith, and M. Bell. 1973. A reconnaissance survey of the fish resources of the Little Kern River drainage, California. U.S. Dept. Agriculture Forest Ser., Region 5, and Ca. Dept. Fish Game Draft (Preliminary Report). 41 p.  Conservation  As a result of hybridization with hatchery rainbow trout introduced into its watershed, the Little Kern golden trout as a distinct subspecies experienced a widespread contraction in its range. By the 1960s it was limited to only about of small headwater streams above three natural barriers. To address the problems of hybridization, planting of non-native trout ceased in the 1950s, and the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) began surveys in 1965 to initiate restoration efforts. Allozyme electrophoretic analyses begun in 1976 at UC Davis ultimately identified, what they thought were six pure populations of Little Kern Golden Trout. Restoration efforts began in 1975 with the first rotenone treatments being used to kill off non-native fish in the historic habitat. After chemical treatments there was a period of restocking of treated waters with pure Little Kern golden trout raised at the Kern River Fish Hatchery near Kernville, California from broodstock collected in the six \\"pure\\" populations previously identified. Additional restoration efforts included construction of barriers to the upstream movement of non-native trout, habitat improvement of streams damaged by cattle grazing, public education, and continued monitoring of fish populations, their genetic integrity, and habitat conditions. By 1996, restoration was believed to have been complete. = Conservation shortfalls = Later studies showed that one of the six populations used to form the Little Kern River golden trout broodstock, clustered genetically with California golden trout and rainbow trout instead of Little Kern golden trout.Gall, G.E., and B. May. 1997. Trout of the Kern River Basin: A genetic analysis of Little Kern River and Golden Trout Creek populations. Report to California Department of Fish and Game, Threatened Trout Committee. September 1997. 55 pp. This study also showed that one individual fish collected as broodstock from Deadman Creek genetically clustered entirely with hatchery rainbow trout reference populations. This individual was likely inadvertently mixed with pure Little Kern Golden trout at the Kern River Fish Hatchery. The consequence of these two oversights meant that fish hybridized with rainbow trout and California golden trout were reintroduced back into Little Kern habitat. An additional shortfall of the recovery is that the broodstock populations all came from small headwater streams with small individual populations and low genetic diversity. It is likely that the original removal of hybridized fish from the Little Kern Basin, also removed some native Little Kern golden genetic diversity that now cannot be restored. There is concern that the adaptability of the species has suffered as a result leading to an increased risk of extinction from disease or climate change. Furthermore, these populations are markedly divergent from each other; reflecting long isolation and population structure. Future work is needed to determine the extent to which divergent populations should be admixed when trying to expand the species back into its native range.Systematics, Genetics and Conservation of Golden Trout By Molly Rebecca Stephens, 2007  References  Category:Oncorhynchus Trout, Golden Little Kern Trout, Golden Little Kern Trout, Golden Little Kern Trout, Golden Little Kern Category:Kern River Category:Natural history of Tulare County, California ~ Category:Endangered fish Category:Endangered fauna of California Category:NatureServe imperiled species Category:Fish described in 1906 Category:Taxa named by Barton Warren Evermann ","title":"Little Kern golden trout"},{"id":"43695931","text":"Manuel Lajo Lazo (born 12 April 1949) is a Peruvian politician who served as a Member of the Congress of the Republic of Peru from 1995 to 2000.

His term was interrupted during World War II. The Dutch government at the time banned anyone from employment after age 65, even though he wanted to keep working, especially after having lost everything during the war. City planning The mayor wanted to preserve the character and uniqueness of the town so much that he did not allow developers to build in the city. In 1912 he installed the \\"welstandbepaling,\\" and this action was followed by many other cities. For many years he was chairman to the local \\"Goois Nature Reserve\\". Patron of the Arts Laren and Blaricum are well-known artist towns. Van Nispen frequently purchased art and hosted expositions for local artists. He was involved with the founding of the Singer Museum and was honorary president of the Singer Memorial Foundation. Many artists, magicians and singers dedicated works to him. When he was forced to leave due to his age, a song was written as a goodbye to celebrate his long service. World War II Refusing to cooperate with the pro-Nazi NSB government, he was forced to flee with his family. Ordered by the Sicherheidspolizei, the Dutch police in a neighboring town, Hilversum, attempted to arrest him on the night of 8 to 9 February 1943, but he had already found safety. He returned in April and the German authorities put him on forced leave. On May 29 of that same year he was officially fired and banned from the district. He moved to Garderen, Gelderland with his wife where he continued to work for the resistance. He and his family harbored pilots referred to as \\"jumpers\\" (springers) sent to the Netherlands by British special forces.

Despite having never been released as a single, \\"Pool Party!\\" eventually became a perennial favorite among Aquabats fans, and has since been played at every one of the band's concerts, almost always as the closing number. In 2007, the song gained minor media attention when it was performed by The Aquabats on the popular Nick Jr. television series Yo Gabba Gabba!, appearing on several soundtrack compilations as well as Yo Gabba Gabba!s live tours. \\"Pool Party!\\" has been described as one of The Aquabats' most popular and well-liked songs, and can arguably be labeled as the band's signature song. Background In a track-by-track commentary of Myths posted to The Aquabats' website shortly before the album's release, singer Christian Jacobs (The MC Bat Commander) elaborated on the history of \\"Pool Party!\\", revealing that the song was originally conceived by former co-founder and trumpeter Boyd Terry (Catboy) during the writing sessions for the band's 1997 studio album The Fury of The Aquabats!. After Terry had written the lyrics, the rest of the band attempted to write accompanying music in several different musical styles, including \\"a Devo-esque version, Crashs more punk rock version and a kind of '80s cheese pop New Edition style\\", but were ultimately unsatisfied with any of them and postponed further work on the song indefinitely. According to Jacobs, \\"Pool Party!\\" became an in-joke among the band members to refer to song ideas that get talked about but never get finished. Around 1999, The Aquabats took another shot at reviving \\"Pool Party!\\", using an unfinished song called \\"Windmills!\\" and combining parts of their previous attempts to eventually arrive at the final version of the song. Jacobs concluded his commentary by noting \\"Catboy wins for coming up with a funny idea that we never gave up on\\". Overview Making extensive use of inflatable pool toys, \\"Pool Floatie Races\\" are a common way The Aquabats segue into a live performance of \\"Pool Party!\\". After predominantly experimenting with ska music on their first two albums, The Aquabats consciously decided to move away from an overtly ska-based sound for their studio follow-up and explore much more diverse and eclectic material. \\"Pool Party!\\" is no exception, being completely absent of the ska rhythms and brass instruments which characterized the band's previous albums in favor of a guitar-driven pop rock sound and new wave- influenced synthesizer melodies, elements which would both eventually become an integral part of The Aquabats' music on their subsequent studio albums. The bridge of the song features a brief rap breakdown, followed by a short instrumental section which incorporates the main synthesizer melody from Rushs 1981 single \\"Tom Sawyer\\". Lyrically, \\"Pool Party!\\" is one of the simplest songs in The Aquabats' repertoire, featuring little of the surreal humor or comic book/fantasy-inspired narratives which make up much of the band's material, instead centering on the description of a \\"cool pool party\\" \\"for the cool kids in my school\\" being hosted by the narrator. Emphasized by the lyric \\"there hasn't been a party like this since 1981\\", \\"Pool Party!\\" is a tongue- in-cheek parody of the early 1980s Southern Californian youth culture which most members of The Aquabats grew up in, evidenced by its repeated use of surf and skater slang like \\"dude\\" and \\"bro\\" and a chorus of female backing vocalists speaking in obvious Valley girl accents delivering such lingo as \\"your pool rips!\\" and \\"holy guacamole!\\". The beginning of the track features a spoken word dialogue between The MC Bat Commander and Catboy which segues into the song's lyrics, where the two discuss the titular party while affecting stereotypical California English dialects. At one point, the MC Bat Commander boasts that the party will have \\"food, and girls, and more food, and Mike Gerudo's coming!\\", a reference to co-composer Catboy, whose fictionalized character biography on The Aquabats' website listed his \\"alter ego\\"s name as such. ;Live shows Although Myths & Legends failed to meet with any commercial success upon release, \\"Pool Party!\\" nevertheless became a favorite among fans and critics alike, with such publications as Geekscape calling it \\"the greatest singalong song ever\\". Documented as early as 2003 on the DVD release Serious Awesomeness!, \\"Pool Party!\\" quickly moved its way up The Aquabats' setlists, almost always being played as the last song - or the last song before the encore - to close out each of the band's concerts. As is expected of The Aquabats' stage show, live performances of \\"Pool Party!\\" are always accompanied by heavy theatrics. Typically, The Aquabats will invite young children in the crowd to dance onstage throughout the duration of the song, filling out the rest of the stage space with costumed characters and members of their road crew or opening bands. At the start of the song, the band releases scores of beach balls, inflatable pool toys and pool noodles upon the crowd to be tossed about by the audience members. Yo Gabba Gabba! version On August 21, 2007, The Aquabats appeared on the second episode of the first season of Yo Gabba Gabba!, a Nick Jr. children's television series which Christian Jacobs co-created and produced, where they performed to a re- recorded version of \\"Pool Party!\\". Outside of a shortened running time which omitted the bridge and final chorus, the re-recording was mostly identical to the original composition, with the exception of a more prominent keyboard mix and an added chorus of children cheering and singing along to parts of the song. Although the original \\"Pool Party!\\" contained no objectionable lyrical content, The Aquabats still chose to rewrite parts of the lyrics to be suitable for Yo Gabba Gabba!s primary demographic of preschool-aged children. For example, \\"Girls look cute in their swimming suits\\" was changed to \\"Grab your swimming suit, it'll be a hoot\\", while the main chorus of \\"It was a pool party for the cool kids in my school\\" was altered to \\"It was a pool party for everybody in the world\\". In the wake of Yo Gabba Gabba!s international critical and commercial success, media attention was turned towards The Aquabats owing both to Jacobs' involvement and the band's frequent appearances in the series. Many internet publications, including About.com and Idolator, placed The Aquabats' performance of \\"Pool Party!\\" on their lists of Yo Gabba Gabba!s best musical guests, while DVD Talk, reviewing the episode on a home video release, considered the band \\"a perfect addition to the show\\" and highly praised the episode's music, calling \\"Pool Party!\\" \\"tremendous\\". On August 31, 2010, the re-recording of \\"Pool Party!\\" was officially released on the Yo Gabba Gabba! soundtrack album Music is...Awesome! Volume 2, also appearing on a later Australian compilation entitled The Best of Yo Gabba Gabba! in November 2012. A live performance of \\"Pool Party!\\", filmed as part of a Yo Gabba Gabba! live tour at Los Angeless Nokia Theater, was included on the DVD Yo Gabba Gabba! Live!: There's a Party in My City!, released on March 13, 2012. Documentary by Beanos woah team Credits ;Original 2000 recording *The M.C.

Initially Volkswacht was published weekly. As of 1913 it was published twice weekly. In 1914 it was converted into a daily newspaper. The newspaper masthead carried the slogan Organ für die werktätige Bevölkerung in Westpreußen ('Organ of the toiling population in West Prussia'). It was issued as a publication of the Free Trade Unions. Volkswacht was founded in September 1910. August Bebel wrote an editorial for the inaugural issue of the newspaper. Due to financial difficulties the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) had lacked an organ of its own in Danzig for a long time. The new publication was maintained by funds from the central party leadership in Berlin. Arthur Crispien worked as editor of Volkswacht 1910-1912. Gustav Schröder took over as editor after Crispien. The newspaper played an important role in spreading social democratic ideas in the region. The readership of Volkswacht was at pair with the bourgeois Danziger Zeitung. On political issues the article material largely consisted of reprints from the SPD central organ Vorwärts. The Volkswacht editors focused more on writing about local matters. During the First World War, Volkswacht was placed under preventive censorship. Julius Gehl became editor of Volkwacht in 1917 with Walter Reek heading the press commission. The readership of Volkswacht increased after the outbreak of the November Revolution. In 1920 Volkswacht was replaced by Danziger Volksstimme ('People's Voice of Danzig').

Sang, who lives in a luxury villa like a palace being served by many maids, is envied and worshiped by millions of people. However, he does not enjoy this type of lifestyle. He does not like to reap with sowing, nor buying extravagant jewelry that would worth forty years of salaries for others and most of all, he does not want to follow his grandaunt's (Ouyang Sha-fei) arranged marriage between him and his cousin Cindy (Nina Li Chi) because all his property would belong to her.

Nestler has also recorded with the bands Kkleq Muzzil, Super Rider and Look Past The Stars as well as guested with DJ Spooky. Biography Nestler was born in Los Angeles, CA where he grew up in the Mount Washington area, the son of award-winning artist/painter/photographer Frank Nestler. He began playing the piano at age 6 and picked up the guitar at age 14. Inspired by the burgeoning speed and thrash metal scene of the mid to late 1980s, Nestler formed the band Civil Defiance in 1989 which quickly recorded a three-song demo in order to procure gigs around town. The band frequently played venues such as the Troubadour, Raji's, Mancini's and the Coconut Teaszer, where they took part in several ASCAP-sponsored 'Best Kept Secrets' industry showcases. In 1991, the group issued a self-produced 4-song demo EP, Abstract Reaction, which showcased the band's varied influences and avantgardist approach, fusing classic thrash with everything from world music to grindcore. In 1993, Nestler and the band began recording their debut album with producer Alex Woltman at the helm. Titled The Fishers For Souls, it was issued on the band's own Blood Orange label in 1996 and licensed to German-based company Dream Circle for a European release in 1997. Noted violinist Lili Haydn makes an appearance on the song \\"Man in the Moon.\\" A second full-length album, Circus of Fear, containing songs from different recording sessions and including the out-of- print Abstract Reaction EP, was released in 1999 via GSM/Nuclear Blast in Europe only. Following the band's European tour with Psychotic Waltz in the summer of 1997, Civil Defiance went on hiatus with Nestler and bassist Juan Antonio Perez joining forces with former Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo in a new project. Initially called Letter Bomb and then Philm, the trio eventually settled on the name Kkleq Muzzil, and went about writing material for their debut album at Lombardo's Victorville, CA home studio. Nestler and Perez were dealt a setback when Lombardo got the call to re-join Slayer in 2001. In his place, they recruited local drummer George Hernandez and recorded an album, mixed by noted bassist/producer John Avila of Oingo Boingo fame, for L.A.-based indie label Criterion Records. Released in 2002, M contained three songs co-written with Lombardo in addition to newer material. Disbanding Kkleq Muzzil shortly thereafter, Nestler formed punk rock influenced power trio Super Rider with bassist Eddie Solis and original Civil Defiance drummer Gabe Trevizo. The band played shows in the L.A. area and issued a sole album, Everything So Right, again mixed by John Avila, in 2003. Nestler would re-team with Lombardo on DJ Spooky's 2005 album Drums of Death, sharing guitar duties alongside Living Colour's Vernon Reid and playing on the songs \\"Tool Element\\", \\"Kultur Krieg\\", and \\"Terra Nullius (Cyborg Rebellion on Colony Planet Zyklon 15).\\" That same year, Nestler, Trevizo and former Civil Defiance bassist Brian Terry would also issue a 5-song EP, The Seasons Best, via bandspace.com under the name Look Past The Stars. The trio also completed tracking a full-length album which remains unreleased. After a jam at the famed Rainbow Bar and Grill in West Hollywood, CA, Nestler and Lombardo decided to resurrect Philm in early 2010, adding bassist Pancho Tomaselli from the band War to complete the line-up. :– Gerry Nestler, 2010; on the inspiration behind Philm With Tomaselli on board, the band recorded a 3-song demo with UK producer Piers Baron; The first release came in August 2010 in the form of a 7\\" single, a cover of the Black Sabbath classic Symptom of the Universe. It was issued by Volcom Entertainment as part of the Volcom Vinyl Club in translucent blue vinyl, limited to 500 copies. The song would also find itself into the band's live set. On October 29, 2010, Nestler and Lombardo both took part in the \\"Dimebash\\" all-star benefit at the Key Club in West Hollywood, CA performing a cover of Black Sabbath's Planet Caravan with Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters, Mike Inez of Alice In Chains, and Zach Myers of Shinedown. In November and December, Philm performed a half dozen shows with Halford on the latter band's Made of Metal U.S. tour. Philm would eventually sign a record deal with Mike Patton's Ipecac label for the release of their 2012 debut album, Harmonic. It was accompanied by a promotional video for the song \\"Held In Light\\" and included updated versions of the songs \\"Amoniac\\", \\"Dome\\" and \\"Meditation\\", written by the original Philm line-up and first recorded and released by Nestler with Kkleq Muzzil on the M album. On October 19, 2013, Nestler, Lombardo and stand-in bass player Dan Lutz performed the world live premier of composer Christopher Young's Suite from Ghost Rider with the Golden State Pops Orchestra at the Warner Grand Theatre in Los Angeles, CA as part of an evening of horror movie scores performed with a 75-piece orchestra. Nestler and Philm performed at the 42nd-anniversary party of the Rainbow Bar and Grill in West Hollywood, CA on April 13, 2014. In late July, the band announced the release of their sophomore album, Fire From the Evening Sun, and a new partnership with German-based label UDR Music. A European tour was set to commence on September 7 at The Underworld in London, England. In September 2016, Nestler released a statement announcing the addition of drummer Anderson Quintero to the Philm ranks, countering a claim by former drummer, Dave Lombardo, that \\"I did not exit Philm - I ended Philm.\\" The new line-up made its live debut September 20 with an appearance at the Ultimate Jam Night held at the Whisky A Go-Go. In early November 2016, Philm debuted a new song and lyric video for \\"The Seventh Sun\\" and announced plans for an EP in 2017. On July 20, 2018, Nestler announced the September 12 release of his debut solo album, Mama's Child, under his full name, Gerry Paul Nestler. Guest players on the album include Nestler's Philm bandmate, bassist Pancho Tomaselli, drummer Max MacVeety, and saxophonist Evan Francis. On October 18, 2019, it was officially announced that Civil Defiance had reunited comprising Nestler, bassist Jenk Kent, and new member Christopher Garcia of The Grandmothers on drums, and that the group had recorded five songs for a forthcoming new album. \\"Eye of the Dog\\" was released on October 28 as a digital single.

Background In 1998, preparations started for the 1999 celebrations of the 400th anniversary of Antoon van Dyck’s birth. In honour of this event, the curator Barbara Vanderlinden, Roomade Office for Contemporary Art, and Antwerpen Open,http://www.antwerpenopen.be, ‘Laboratorium’ Antwerp, 2012. [Online] Available online at: http://www.antwerpenopen.be/2012/nl/projecten/laboratorium set out to create a contemporary art program in Antwerpen. This was conceived of as a response to van Dyck’s studio, which functioned as a ‘school of production’, a system also used by Peter-Paul Rubens, again in Antwerp. It is this city’s role in the development of such studios that inspired ‘Laboratorium’. The creative aspect of the curatorial role led Barbara VanderlindenObrist, Hans-Ulrich, 1998. “Brussels' sprout. Interview With curator Barbara Vanderlinden”. New York: Art Forum International. [Online] Available online at: http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Brussels'+sprout.-a021230366 to propose an alternative to the traditional object-oriented art exhibition by creating an exhibition program that took the form of a year long, functioning artist’s studio. She fulfilled this aim by setting up a series of exceptional projects that were carried out in defunct office spaces throughout the city of Antwerp.The projects which preceded the exhibition ‘Laboratorium’ were: “Tommi Grönlund, Petteri Nisunen, Liro Auterinen, Matti Knaapi: Ambient City – Transient Radio 93.9 FM”, Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten, Antwerp, 1999; “Tomoko Takahashi: Office Work at Century Center”, Antwerp, 1999; and “Koo Jeong-a: On the Poetics of Small Things: Office Work at Century Center”, Antwerp, 1999. These culminated and merged in ‘Laboratorium’, a large-scale interdisciplinary exhibition-project “in which the scientific laboratory and the artist’s studio were explored on the basis of the various concepts and disciplines”.Quote from the visitor’s brochure, reproduced in Obrist and Vanderlinden, 2001. ‘Laboratorium’. Köln: DuMont. It brought together the work of sixty-six artists and scientists devoted to research and experimentation and was co-curated by Barbara Vanderlinden and Hans Ulrich Obrist. The exhibition staged relations between an urban network of scientists, artists, dancers and writers.Quote from the visitor’s brochure, reproduced in Obrist and Vanderlinden, ‘Laboratorium’, DuMont (2001). The curators’ interdisciplinary approach contributed to the wide-ranging nature of questions posed by the project. The preparations for the exhibition started with “a method that is often used for historical exhibitions, but too rarely for contemporary ones”Quote from Obrist, Hans Ulrich and Asad Raza. 2014. “Laboratorium” in: ‘Ways of Curating.

This included artists and scientists such as the French sociologist Bruno Latour, the German-Belgian artist Carsten Höller, the American artist Matt Mullican, and the Belgian scientist Luc Steels. The organizer Bruno Verbergt was closely involved with the curators. “The discussion revolved around questions such as the following: How can we attempt to bridge the gap between the specialized vocabulary of science, art and the general interest of the audience, between the expertise of the skilled practitioner and the concerns and preconceptions of the interested audience? What is the meaning of the laboratories? What is the meaning of experiments? When do experiments become public and when does the result of an experiment reach public consensus? Is rendering public what happens inside the laboratory of scientist and the studio of the artist a contradiction in terms? These and other questions were the beginning of an interdisciplinary project starting from the ‘workplace’ where artists and scientist experiment and work freely.\\"Quote from the visitor’s brochure, reproduced in Obrist and Vanderlinden, 2001. ‘Laboratorium’.

He was born at Hollingbourne in Kent. Roper made two appearances in first-class cricket, the first for an England XI against Sussex at Brighton in 1833 and the second appearance for a Kent side against England at Lord's in 1835. He is thought to have played local club cricket at Leeds, Hollingbourne and for a number of other local sides. There is some doubt whether Roper played for Kent, partly because the man who played in the 1835 Lord's match is identified in Scores and Biographies as W Roper and there is the possibility that the player involved in that match was Roper's younger brother James who played alongside him in club cricket.Carlaw D Kent County Cricketers A to Z.

This friary was one of the first to be built in Ireland, being founded by the Anglo-Norman Knight Sir Hugh Purcell.Eamon McEneaney, Discover Waterford, (O'Brien Press), 2001, p.75-76 Richard II In 1394 Richard II lodged in the church while making plans for his assault on the Gaelic Irish in the Wicklow Mountains. It was said to be the scene of the surrender of four Irish chieftains (the O'Conor Don, de Burgo, O'Brien and O'Kennedy) to Richard II in 1395 when he made one of his two visits to Ireland. In the late fifteenth century a bell tower was added which is 25 metres high and it is still in evidence today. The bells from this tower were sold in 1541 by Henry VIII and are said to be now in Christchurch Cathedral nearby. The bell frame which suspended the bells remained on the site until 1809. With the dissolution the contents of the property was sold and on I9 January 1541 “A rather large sum of money was realised from the sale of the chattels of the friary—£34.8s,7d compared to the Blackfriars’ sale, £24.13s.8d.

Biography Born in Darfield in 1915, Mason grew up in Wellington. In 1938 her engagement to Malcolm John Mason was announced, and the couple married the following year. Mason took up pottery in 1953, attending classes and buying a diesel kiln from her husband's aunt, Elizabeth Matheson. Over the next few years she met and worked with other New Zealand artists including potters Olive Jones, Barry Brickell, Len Castle and Doreen Blumhardt, and painter Colin McCahon, and by 1957 had exhibited and sold her first pot. In 1958, she and Blumhardt co-founded New Zealand Potter magazine, which Mason edited for nine years. The same year she was commissioned to produce the crockery for Wellington's first cafe, the Monde Marie. A stoneware experimentalist, she had by 1964 exhibited in Australia, Japan and Washington. The early 1960s saw Mason become a full-time potter, and she abandoned her home and marriage, moving to the Waitākere Ranges, then Ōtāne in Hawke's Bay and, in 1974, Tokomaru Bay. It was there that she was involved with establishing the Tauira Craft Centre with Ngoi Pēwhairangi. In the 1990s she lived in a house truck, purchased with the proceeds from the sale of a McCahon painting, near Brickell's home in Coromandel. She later returned to Hawke's Bay where, from 2006 to 2011, she resided in the eponymous Helen Mason House at the Waiohiki Creative Arts Village. In the 2005 New Year Honours she was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to pottery. Described as an influential figure in New Zealand crafts and ceramics at the forefront of the emerging New Zealand pottery movement in the 1950s, Mason exhibited widely in New Zealand and internationally. As well as editing The New Zealand Potter, Mason contributed to the New Zealand Listener and wrote a number of books on pottery and crafts, including Ten years of pottery in New Zealand (1967), Waima of Tokomaru Bay (1984) and Commitment to clay (2008). She featured in an episode of the television arts show The Big Art Trip in 2002. In 2005, she published her memoir, entitled Helen Mason's scrapbook: 50 years as a backyard potter.

The film was shot on May 12, 1925 in Case's sound studio at his home in Auburn, New York. The film was shown in June 1925 at the Exposition of Progress in Auburn. The title was also adopted for the 1940 film Ma! He's Making Eyes at Me directed by Harold D. Schuster and screenplay by Charles Grayson and Edmund L. Hartmann based on \\"Fashions for Sale\\", a story by Ed Sullivan, and starring Tom Brown in the role of main character Tommy Shaw.

Some loads are specified as part of the design criteria of a mechanical system. Depending on the usage, some mechanical loads can be measured by an appropriate test method in a laboratory or in the field. Vehicle It can be the external mechanical resistance against which a machine (such as a motor or engine), acts.American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language. The load can often be expressed as a curve of force versus speed. For instance, a given car traveling on a road of a given slope presents a load which the engine must act against. Because air resistance increases with speed, the motor must put out more torque at a higher speed in order to maintain the speed. By shifting to a higher gear, one may be able to meet the requirement with a higher torque and a lower engine speed, whereas shifting to a lower gear has the opposite effect. Accelerating increases the load, whereas decelerating decreases the load. Pump Similarly, the load on a pump depends on the head against which the pump is pumping, and on the size of the pump.

The film is the third in a trilogy, preceded by Kuntilanak and Kuntilanak 2. The film stars Julie Estelle, Imelda Therinne and Laudya Cynthia Bella. The film was released on March 13, 2008.  Plot  The film started with the disappearance of a newly engaged couple, Stella (Laudya Chintya Bella) and her fiancée Rimson (Robby Kolbe) who went on a trekking trip in a virgin forest, that prompted the dispatchment of four members of SAR Komodo Team, Darwin (Mandala Shoji), Asti (Imelda Therinne), Herman (Reza Pahlevi) and Petra (Laura Antoinetta) together SAR Air Team, Albatross in the searching effort for them. The SAR Komodo Team conducted the search mission through land course where they later come across with Samantha (Julie Estelle) and convinced her to travel with their team. They finally reached the forest's entrance, only to find the passage blocked which induced them to continue their journey in by climbing the hilly road into the deep forest. After they settled down to camping at the night, Samantha was urged by the SAR Komodo crews on telling them her reason to enter the forest. Samantha retorted that they should abandoned their search and rescue mission in order to avoid danger that shall befall them should they persist. Moments later, they suddenly hear strange noises and experienced supernatural phenomena which influenced them to venture further into the forest area. During this excursion, Samantha managed to find a red shawl belonging to Stella. Samantha recalls the previous encounter with her mother, Mega N. Widjoko (Ida Iasha) who asked Samantha to got to the place called Ujung Sedo that located at the fringe of the deep forest in order to eliminate her wangsit over the Kuntilanak. The next morning, as they started off the journey, a thick mist appeared out of nowhere and caused disturbance to their orientation tools as well as communication devices along with confusion over time and direction. Braving through the mist, Samantha and the others later followed Yenny (Cindy Valerie), the daughter of Sam's landlord who was kidnapped by the Kuntilanak in the second film. They trailed her until she disappear at the opening of a cave. Going without direction into the cave, they split into two group with each of them faced terrorizing event and strange encounter that cannot be explained via logical thinking or scientific evidence. In the climax of the event, they managed to exit the cave with a warning: Samantha need to go to the house of Mbah Putri, the origin place for the Kuntilanak's wangsit in Mangkoedjiwo family. As they set up to camp at the clearing, Samantha explained her reason of coming here and ominously proclaimed that they have arrived at \\"Ujung Sedo\\". While everyone was sleeping, Herman who stood outside as the lookout is being haunted by the Kuntilanak which caused him to fell into a quicksand. The remaining four then search for Herman in the morning and stumbled upon a 'ghost' village devoid of residents. Countless bones, suspicious meats and a corpse littered the village. Going further into the village, the group found a carcass of a cow with its entrails cut open where inside it, emerged a crying sound of a baby. Although warned by others not to take the strange baby, Petra took the child. During the night, suddenly the baby went missing and when Petra goes out to search for the child, she was attacked by the Kuntilanak. Afterward Asti, Darwin, and Samantha ventured out to look for Petra where Samantha came across Yenny and followed her to a field with fallen leaves in the middle of the forest, and saw a group of blinded children running after a white horse. Chasing after them, Samantha managed to find Yenny and while hiding, witness first hand the Kuntilanak's deed of collecting kidnapped children to suck off their souls as sustenance. A while later as Yenny and Samantha fled the scene, Darwin who saw the Kuntilanak was enchanted by the latter into committing suicide. En route to Mbah Putri's house, Samantha meets Asti who promised to survived together come next morning. Henceforth, Yenny and Samantha arrived at the dwelling-place of Mbah Putri. Confronting Samantha, Mbah Putri revealed the origin story of the Kuntilanak who came from the place. Samantha was told that the Kuntilanak was the vengeful spirit of a mother who was killed after giving birth to the child of devil whose fate was similar to the former. Except that Mbah Putri who at this time already century old of age, has agreed to carry the child in her womb as part of the condition of the pact to prolong her life into seemingly attaining immortality. The Durmo (or the Chant) sang by Samantha and all the descendants of Mangkoedjiwo, were in fact composed by Mbah Putri in order to summon the Kuntilanak who then killed its victims and suck off their souls. The Kuntilanak was used as the conduit to replenished the strength of the devil's spawn using the souls of the murdered victims, to enable it to stay alive in Mbah Putri's womb thus making Mbah Putri immortal. Samantha's intention to go there to eliminate the wangsit cannot be done as long as the devil's child still live. It is revealed that Sam's encounter with Mega was an illusion created by Mbah Putri to lure Samantha to come to Ujung Sedo and becoming the replacement for the old crone as the host for the devil's child. Afterwards, Mbah Putri sing the 'durmo' and released the devil's child who crawled into Sam's womb. Later on, Samantha told Yenny to go to the rescue point, and then she climb atop the waterfall and jump off so that the devil's child will dies together with her and cease to exist from this world. Yenny and her fellow captives together with Asti went to the rescue point and the rescuing helicopter descent down unto them, and they were all managed to be saved. Meanwhile, at the edge of the waterfall, a hand (possibly Samantha's) is seen to grappled unto the fall's stones and the film faded away.

Most taxonomic authorities lump this species and the western cattle egret together as subspecies of the cattle egret, but some (including the International Ornithologists' Union) separate them. Despite the similarities in plumage to the egrets of the genus Egretta, it is more closely related to the herons of Ardea. It is native to southern and eastern Asia, and Australasia. It is a white bird adorned with buff plumes in the breeding season. It nests in colonies, usually near bodies of water and often with other wading birds. The nest is a platform of sticks in trees or shrubs. Eastern cattle egrets exploit drier and open habitats more than other heron species. Their feeding habitats include seasonally inundated grasslands, pastures, farmlands, wetlands and rice paddies. They often accompany cattle or other large mammals, catching insect and small vertebrate prey disturbed by these animals. Some populations of the cattle egret are migratory and others show post-breeding dispersal. The adult eastern cattle egret has few predators, but birds or mammals may raid its nests, and chicks may be lost to starvation, calcium deficiency or disturbance from other large birds. This species maintains a special relationship with cattle, which extends to other large grazing mammals; wider human farming is believed to be a major cause of their suddenly expanded range. The cattle egret removes ticks and flies from cattle and consumes them. This benefits both species, but it has been implicated in the spread of tick- borne animal diseases. Taxonomy Its genus name Bubulcus is Latin for herdsman, referring, like the English name, to this species' association with cattle. Ibis is a Latin and Greek word which originally referred to another white wading bird, the sacred ibis, but was applied to this species in error. The eastern cattle egret, described by Pieter Boddaert in 1783, breeds in eastern and southern Asia and Australasia. Despite superficial similarities in appearance, the cattle egret is more closely related to the genus Ardea, which comprises the great or typical herons and the great egret (A. alba), than to the majority of species termed egrets in the genus Egretta. Description Perched on a buffalo in Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary in National Capital Region of Delhi, India. The cattle egret is a stocky heron with an wingspan; it is long and weighs . It has a relatively short thick neck, a sturdy bill, and a hunched posture. The non-breeding adult has mainly white plumage, a yellow bill and greyish-yellow legs. The eastern cattle egret differs from the western species in breeding plumage, when the buff colour on its head extends to the cheeks and throat, and the plumes are more golden in colour. The bill and tarsus are longer on average. It is also smaller and shorter-winged. It has white cheeks and throat, but the nuptial plumes are golden. The positioning of the egret's eyes allows for binocular vision during feeding, and physiological studies suggest that the species may be capable of crepuscular or nocturnal activity. Adapted to foraging on land, they have lost the ability possessed by their wetland relatives to accurately correct for light refraction by water. This species gives a quiet, throaty rick-rack call at the breeding colony, but is otherwise largely silent. Distribution and habitat In Australia, colonisation began in the 1940s, with the species establishing itself in the north and east of the continent. It began to regularly visit New Zealand in the 1960s. The expansion of the eastern cattle egret's range is due to its relationship with humans and their domesticated animals. Originally adapted to a commensal relationship with large grazing and browsing animals, it was easily able to switch to domesticated cattle and horses. As the keeping of livestock spread throughout the world, the cattle egret was able to occupy otherwise empty niches. Many populations of cattle egrets are highly migratory and dispersive, and this has helped the species' range expansion. Although the cattle egret sometimes feeds in shallow water, unlike most herons it is typically found in fields and dry grassy habitats, reflecting its greater dietary reliance on terrestrial insects rather than aquatic prey. Migration and movements Some populations of cattle egrets are migratory, others are dispersive, and distinguishing between the two can be difficult for this species. In many areas populations can be both sedentary and migratory. In the northern hemisphere, migration is from cooler climes to warmer areas, but cattle egrets nesting in Australia migrate to cooler Tasmania and New Zealand in the winter and return in the spring. Populations in southern India appear to show local migrations in response to the monsoons. They move north from Kerala after September. During winter, many birds have been seen flying at night with flocks of Indian pond herons (Ardeola grayii) on the south-eastern coast of India, and a winter influx has also been noted in Sri Lanka. Breeding The eastern cattle egret nests in colonies, which are often, but not always, found around bodies of water. The colonies are usually found in woodlands near lakes or rivers, in swamps, or on small inland or coastal islands, and are sometimes shared with other wetland birds, such as herons, egrets, ibises and cormorants. The breeding season varies within South Asia. Nesting in northern India begins with the onset of monsoons in May. The breeding season in Australia is November to early January, with one brood laid per season. The male displays in a tree in the colony, using a range of ritualised behaviours such as shaking a twig and sky-pointing (raising his bill vertically upwards), and the pair forms over three or four days. A new mate is chosen in each season and when re-nesting following nest failure. The nest is a small untidy platform of sticks in a tree or shrub constructed by both parents. Sticks are collected by the male and arranged by the female, and stick-stealing is rife. The clutch size can be anywhere from one to five eggs, although three or four is most common. The pale bluish-white eggs are oval- shaped and measure . Incubation lasts around 23 days, with both sexes sharing incubation duties. The chicks are partly covered with down at hatching, but are not capable of fending for themselves; they become capable of regulating their temperature at 9–12 days and are fully feathered in 13–21 days. They begin to leave the nest and climb around at 2 weeks, fledge at 30 days and become independent at around the 45th day. In Australia, Torresian crows, wedge-tailed eagles and white-bellied sea eagles take eggs or young, and tick infestation and viral infections may also be causes of mortality. Feeding With a mouse The cattle egret feeds on a wide range of prey, particularly insects, especially grasshoppers, crickets, flies (adults and maggots), and moths, as well as spiders, frogs, and earthworms. In a rare instance they have been observed foraging along the branches of a banyan tree for ripe figs. The species is usually found with cattle and other large grazing and browsing animals, and catches small creatures disturbed by the mammals. Studies have shown that cattle egret foraging success is much higher when foraging near a large animal than when feeding singly. When foraging with cattle, it has been shown to be 3.6 times more successful in capturing prey than when foraging alone. Its performance is similar when it follows farm machinery, but it is forced to move more. In urban situations cattle egrets have also been observed foraging in peculiar situations like railway lines. A cattle egret will weakly defend the area around a grazing animal against others of the same species, but if the area is swamped by egrets it will give up and continue foraging elsewhere. Where numerous large animals are present, cattle egrets selectively forage around species that move at around 5–15 steps per minute, avoiding faster and slower moving herds. The cattle egret may also show versatility in its diet. On islands with seabird colonies, it will prey on the eggs and chicks of terns and other seabirds. During migration it has also been reported to eat exhausted migrating landbirds. Relationship with humans A conspicuous species, the cattle egret has attracted many common names. These mostly relate to its habit of following cattle and other large animals. The cattle egret is a popular bird with cattle ranchers for its perceived role as a biocontrol of cattle parasites such as ticks and flies. A study in Australia found that cattle egrets reduced the number of flies that bothered cattle by pecking them directly off the skin. Not all interactions between humans and eastern cattle egrets are beneficial. The cattle egret can be a safety hazard to aircraft due to its habit of feeding in large groups in the grassy verges of airports, and it has been implicated in the spread of animal infections such as heartwater, infectious bursal disease and possibly Newcastle disease.

The former Soviet Union was eager to realize this project because its only warm water ports led to the Strait of Istanbul and the Dardanelles, which were under the control of Turkey, a NATO country. There were two main ideas about this project: * A river through Dasht-e Lut. * A river to Lake Urmia and after that to the Persian Gulf. History The idea of linking the two coasts via Iranian territory was first introduced in the 19th century. The first professional study was carried out in the 1960s. Routes *The western route: roughly following the shortest air distance between the two coasts, extends over a total length of about 950 km from the northern end of the Persian Gulf to the southwest of the Caspian Sea. The channel would go south in Arvand Rud and Karun (~ 300 km), and in the north by Sefid Rud (~ 50 km). The mentioned river basin was partially navigable and it would be necessary to regulate the flow. In the central part, the channel would stretch through a high mountain valley with a length of about 600 km. The main advantages of the western route are the shorter distance between the seas, the passage through the Khuzestan and Guilan lowlands, the partial flow of rivers, the possibility of using more artificial lakes, and easier water supply for the damp climate and numerous watercourses. However, the major disadvantage of this route is the passage through the chains of Zagros, the Central Hungarian massif and Alborz, especially in the Kurdistan and Hamadan provinces where inevitably climbing above 1800 m. The Western route was mentioned solely as an option and no more detailed studies were carried out for it that specialists give a big advantage to a more flexible eastern route. *Eastern route: stretches from the shores of the Gulf of Oman to the southeast coast of the Caspian Sea, totaling between 1465 and 1600 km. This passage was first proposed by Engineer H. Farzad in 1966, and provides for channeling through the depression of Hamun-Dzaz-Murjan, Dašt-e Lut and Dašt-e Kavira. By the late 1990s, Iranian engineers for the ultimate southern destination had planned the area of Bandar Abas, more specifically the Minab Valley, and then the route shifted eastward to the Macau valleys of the Kašan River in Džaskanski or Kahir in Čabaharský okrug. The Russian experts, in 2000s, independent of the Iranian, elaborated preliminary plans for the massive transitional channel, also saw Bandar Abas as the terminus. The valleys of both of these rivers intersect Bašakerd's mass and lead to Hamun-Džaz-Murjan, the southernmost part of the Iranska plateau or depression whose eastern and northern boundary zones are foreseen for the route is about 600 m n. v. The channel would pass through the area around Iranhahera, and one of its important sources of supply would be the Bampur River. Targets In addition to reaching open waters, there were more reasons to build this canal. =First plan= Passing river through Lut would cause water to reach its thirsty grounds. =Second plan= According to critical fall in Lake Urmia's water levels, this plan could bring enough water to this lake. History First time this plan has been written by Humaan Farzad in 1968. According to his plan some lake must be made between Persian gulf and Oman sea. Three places were suggested: Jazmurian pit and two other places in Dasht-e Lut and Dasht-e Kavir. Many years later same plan was suggested to Mir-Hossein Mousavi, who was prime minister at that time.نظر مرکز پژوهشهای مجلس پیرامون امکان اتصال آبهای شمال و جنوب ایران (سایت مرکز پژوهشهای مجلس، ۲۲ آذر ۱۳۸۴)مرکز پژوهش‌ها طرح اتصال خزر به خلیج‌فارس را تأیید کرد (خبرگزاری میراث فرهنگی، ۲۲ آذر ۱۳۸۴) See also * International North–South Transport Corridor * Eurasia Canal * Iranian plateau * Lake Urmia References Category:Unbuilt buildings and structures in Iran Category:Canals in Iran Category:Proposed buildings and structures in Iran ","title":"Iranrud"},{"id":"43697024","text":"Colonel John Alfred Lawrence Billingham CBE FRICS (1868-1955) was Chief Inspector of Works at the War Office (1928-1933).Who’s Who 1935, Published by A&C; Black Limited, 1935 Life John Alfred Lawrence Billingham was born in 1868 in Newport, Monmouthshire, the son of Alfred Billingham, an accountant, and his wife Thomasine.

It saw considerable service on the Western Front, at Salonika and in Palestine during World War I. It served as a searchlight regiment and later as an infantry regiment during World War II. Background The London Regiment was created in 1908 as part of the Haldane Reforms, and consisted entirely of Territorial Force (TF) infantry battalions, with no Regular component. Its Blackheath and Woolwich Battalion was formed by merging two Volunteer battalions that had previously been affiliated to the Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment, but whose recruiting areas (the boroughs of Deptford, Greenwich, Lewisham and Woolwich) had been transferred from Kent on the formation of the County of London in 1889.20th London Regiment at Regiments.orgWestlake, p. 116.Maude, Appendix F.Elliot, p. 1. Early history =3rd Kent (West Kent) Rifle Volunteers= The invasion scare of 1859 led to the creation of the Volunteer Force and huge enthusiasm for joining local Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVCs).Beckett. The 1st Administrative Battalion, Kent RVC, was established on 12 June 1860 with headquarters at Blackheath, to bring together a number of small RVCs that had sprung up in the West Kent suburbs of London. By 1880 its composition was as follows:Frederick, pp. 207–48.Beckett, Appendix VIIBarnes, Appendix III.Martin, pp. 2–3. * A and B Companies at Lee (3rd (Blackheath) Kent RVC) * C and D Companies at Dartford (12th Kent RVC) (transferred from 3rd Admin Bn 1874) * E Company at Greenwich (13th (Greenwich) Kent RVC) * F Company at Bromley (18th (Bromley Rifle Club) Kent RVC) * G and H Companies at Blackheath (25th (Blackheath Artisans) Kent RVC) * I Company at Dartford (27th (Deptford Dockyard) Kent RVC) * K Company at Charlton (28th (Charlton) Kent RVC) * L Company at Deptford (34th (Deptford Town Artisans) Kent RVC) Other units briefly associated with the 1st Admin Bn included: * 4th (Woolwich Town) Kent RVC at Woolwich (transferred to 26th Kent RVC (see below) 1870) * 7th Kent RVC at Kidbrooke (disbanded 1869) * 8th Kent RVC at Sydenham (disbanded 1871) * 21st Kent RVC at Lewisham (disbanded 1861) * 32nd Kent RVC at Eltham (disbanded 1876) Lt-Col Edmund Henry Lenon, retired Brevet Major in the 67th Foot, who had won a Victoria Cross in China in 1860, was commanding officer of the 1st Admin Bn from 16 November 1871 to 15 December 1883.Army List. In 1876 the battalion's uniforms were Rifle green faced with black. In 1880 the 1st Admin Bn was consolidated as the 3rd Kent (West Kent) Rifle Volunteers, becoming a Volunteer Battalion of the Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment the following year. In 1883 the battalion was designated the 2nd Volunteer Bn of the Queen's Own RWK.Martin, p. 4. In 1888 the battalion took over Holly Hedge House on Blackheath as its headquarters.Holly Hedge House at Ideal Homes. By 1900 the battalion's strength stood at 13 companies, one of them composed of cyclists, and the cadet corps at Blackheath Proprietary School and Quernmore School were affiliated to it. =4th Kent (Royal Arsenal) Rifle Volunteers= The 26th Kent (Royal Arsenal) RVC was raised from workmen at the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich in February 1860 (who also formed the 10th (Royal Arsenal) Artillery Volunteer Corps), and soon reached a strength of 16 companies in two battalions. In 1864 the 1st Battalion was numbered the 21st Kent RVC, replacing a disbanded unit, the 2nd Battalion retaining the number 26; both kept 'Royal Arsenal' in their titles. They merged again under the 26th (Royal Arsenal) title in 1870. In 1880 the unit absorbed the 4th (Woolwich Town) Kent RVC, also based at Woolwich and previously part of the 1st Administrative Battalion (see above); the combined unit became the 4th Kent (Royal Arsenal) RVC. It was designated as the 3rd Volunteer Battalion of the Queen's Own RWK in 1883.4th Kent (Royal Arsenal) Rifle Volunteers at Regiments.org The uniform was Rifle green with red facings until 1893 when it adopted the red uniform and blue facings of the QORWK. Territorial Force In 1908 the 2nd and 3rd Volunteer Bns of the QORWK Regiment were merged to form 20th (County of London) Battalion, The London Regiment (Blackheath and Woolwich), with HQ at Holly Hedge House.Frederick, pp. 149–50.Martin, pp. 2–7.London Gazette, 20 March 1908. The regimental badge was the white horse of Kent, derived from the QORWKs, and the uniform was red, with the black facings of the old 50th Foot (West Kents) before they had altered to blue with the change of title to 'Queen's Own Royal'. The Regimental Colour bore the Battle honour South Africa 1900–02 in recognition of the detachments of volunteers from the parent units who had served in the Second Boer War. The new battalion formed part of 5th London Brigade in the TF's 2nd London Division.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 69–75.James, pp. 114–6.London Regiment at Long, Long Trail.Maude, p. 2. World War I The outbreak of war on 4 August saw the men of the 20th Londons at Perham Down on Salisbury Plain, where they had just arrived for their annual training camp with the rest of 2nd London Division. They were immediately recalled to Blackheath to complete their mobilisation and by mid-August the battalion had reached its war station at Hatfield, Hertfordshire.Maude, pp. 2–3. Meanwhile, \\"On Wednesday, August 5, 1914, and the following days Holly Hedge House was besieged by men wishing to enlist. There was no delay in absorbing them\\". The County of London Territorial Force Association immediately began raising 'Second Line' battalions, which quickly led to the formation of a duplicate 2/20th London battalion; consequently the original battalion was prefixed 1/20th. Subsequently, a reserve or 'Third Line' battalion (3/20th) was organised to supply drafts to the other two.Elliot, pp. 2 & 8.London Regiment at Regimental Warpath Maude, p. 287.Becke, Part 2b, pp. 25–30. 1/20th Londons In October 1914, 2nd London Division was selected for service on the Western Front and progressive training was carried out through the winter. Men who had only volunteered for Home Service were transferred to the 2/20th Battalion. 5th London Bde was the leading element of the division to land in France on 9/10 March 1915. In May the division (already known in France simply as 'The London Division' to distinguish it from the Regular Army 2nd Division) took its place in the line and was designated 47th (1/2nd London) Division, with the brigades numbered consecutively: 5th London became 141st (5th London) Brigade. The 1/20th served in this brigade throughout the war.47th Division at Long, Long Trail47 Division at Regimental Warpath Maude, pp. 11–19. =1915= During 1915 the battalion was engaged in the following operations:Maude, Appendix E. Battle of Festubert 24–27 May Battle of Loos 25 September–1 October Loos, 25 September 1915. Before Loos, the whole division was trained over a course with every enemy trench marked out with tape and flags, and the actual assault on 25 September was carried out at the cost of fewer casualties than the other divisions. 141 Bde's attack was led by the 1/18th Londons, then the 1/19th and 1/20th passed through, with 1/20th on the right heading for the enclosed 'garden city', a chalk pit and a small copse. The garden city was quickly taken, then A Company bombed their way into the chalk pit where they captured two German field guns which a few weeks later were exhibited on Horse Guards Parade in London. Apart from a small group of Germans who held out in a corner of the copse for 48 hours, the brigade had taken all its objectives and the 1/19th (who had lost their CO killed) and 1/20th began consolidating the line under the command of Lt-Col Hubback of the 1/20th. The 47th Division then formed a defensive flank for the whole attack, which continued for several days. On 27 September 141 Bde seized the German strongpoint at the copse, 1/20th providing most of the men, backed by bombing parties from the other battalions. 141 Bde remained in the line, defending against counter-attacks, for four days before being relieved. 1/20th Bn's casualties were 9 officers and 162 other ranks, the lowest of any of 47th Division's assaulting battalions.Maude, pp. 26–35.Cherry, pp. 113, 120–2, 219. Battle of the Hohenzollern Redoubt 13–19 October. This was a continuation of Loos. 47th Division returned to the same area to relieve other troops, with Battalion HQ and A Company of the 1/20th back in the Chalk Pit, which was heavily bombarded.Maude, pp. 38–9. =1916= During 1916 the battalion was engaged in the following operations: Vimy Ridge – the units of 47th Division were involved in frequent crater-fighting in this sector from April to July 1916, including the major German attack on 21 May.Maude, pp. 50–60. Battle of the Somme In August the division marched south to take part in this offensive. Its first operation was the capture of High Wood on the opening day of the Battle of Flers-Courcelette (15 September). 141 Brigade was given the task of seizing the wood itself, the 1/20th being in the second wave, joining a confused and desperate fight. Casualties were very heavy but, after a renewed bombardment, German troops began to surrender. By the afternoon, 141 Bde held the wood, but was so disorganised by casualties that it had been formed into a composite battalion. Work on establishing a new line beyond the wood was started by a mixed party under Capt H.S. Read of the 1/20th Bn.Maude, pp. 63–5. Battle of the Transloy Ridges 1–9 October Capture of Eaucourt l'Abbaye 1–3 October Attacks on the Butte de Warlencourt 7–8 October =1917= 47th Division moved into the Hill 60 sector of the Ypres Salient in October 1916 and took part in regular raids and crater fighting for a number of months.Maude, pp. 80–96. It then participated in the following operations: Battle of Messines – in the weeks leading up to the battle, 141 Bde held the divisional front and carried out preparations for the attacks, including digging new trenches and establishing ration and ammunition dumps. For the attack on 7 June it was in support, moving up to relieve 142 Bde two days later.Maude, pp. 97–103. 3rd Battle of Ypres – 47th Division was not directly involved in the offensive, being in reserve during the Battle of Pilckem Ridge (31 July–2 August) and spending two periods holding the line (18 August–2 September and 8–17 September), described as 'among the most unpleasant in its experience'.Maude, pp. 104–11, 240. Battle of Cambrai – 141 Bde took over the recently captured Bourlon Wood on 29 November in time to be hit by the German counter-attack the following morning. The trenches were only half-dug and there was no wire, and the Germans treated the wood to an intense bombardment with gas shells. The defenders suffered heavy casualties, but the attacks on this sector were driven back, though the division was withdrawn to a more defensible line on the night of 4/5 December.Maude, pp. 123–6, 133. =1918= The early part of March 1918 was spent in rest and reorganisation. When the German Spring Offensive opened on 21 March, 47th Division had just relieved another formation in the line on Welsh Ridge and was holding the right flank of Third Army. The main blow fell on Fifth Army to the south, but the Londoners were heavily bombarded with high explosive and gas shells, and later in the day the Germans attacked behind a smoke screen. The Londoners held their line, but Fifth Army was collapsing and 47th Division, with its flank open, was obliged to fall back on successive lines of half-dug trenches. The retirement, with rearguards contesting the German advance throughout, went on for six days and casualties were heavy. By the end, the remnants of 1/19th and 1/20th Londons were formed into a composite battalion.Maude, pp. 149–67. The Germans attempted to renew the offensive on 5 April. By now 47th Division had reorganised. Most of 1/19th was with 141 Bde in divisional reserve, but one company was in the front line still attached to 1/20th. The attack was made after an intense bombardment, and fighting went on all day, with reserves fed in progressively. The Germans made some gains, but the line held. 47th Division was relieved that night.Maude, pp. 167–71. 47th Division now had three quiet months, resting and then holding a quiet sector of the line, which gave the battalions time to absorb the hundreds of 18-year-old recruits they were sent to fill up their ranks. It was then engaged in the following operations: Battle of Albert 22–23 August – The division joined the Allied counter-offensive in this battle. 141 Brigade began their advance at 04.45, and gained their objective with little resistance, but in the morning mist and battle smoke the battalions began to consolidate a little short of the intended line; the follow-up units suffered heavily.Maude, pp. 187–9. 2nd Battle of Bapaume 31 August–3 September – 141 Bde advanced behind a creeping barrage at 05.30, gained all the ground required, and continued to advance the following day. A new dawn attack on 5 September suffered a check, so it was successfully repeated under cover of a barrage and a thunderstorm at 1900, followed by a further push on 6 September.Maude, pp. 193–4. After a further period of rest, 47th Division was preparing for a move to the Italian Front when it was instead ordered to take part in the final operations on the Western Front. On 1 October 141 Bde was hurried forward to keep in touch with the retreating Germans. On 28 October the division accompanied Third Army's commander, Sir William Birdwood on his ceremonial entry into Lille. 141 Brigade resumed its place in the Line on 31 October and took up positions along the River Scheldt. The river was crossed on 9 November, and the Armistice with Germany on 11 November found the battalions of 141 Bde administering the liberated city of Tournai.Maude, pp. 199–206. =1919= Demobilisation of 47 Division began in early 1919. By March the units had been reduced to cadres, and these left for England in May.Maude, pp.207–12. The 1/20th Londons were disembodied on 11 July 1919. =Commanding Officers= The following officers commanded 1/20th Londons during World War I:Maude, Appendix D. * Lt-Col H.A. Christmas until September 1914 * Col E.J. Moore, CB, VD, until February 1915 * Lt-Col A. B. Hubback, CMG, until March 1916 ? * Lt-Col W.H. Matthews, DSO, until May 1916, and April–July 1917 (when he took command of the divisional pioneer battalion, 1/4th Bn Royal Welch Fusiliers)) * Lt-Col W. Parker, DSO, until April 1917 * Lt-Col B. McM. Mahon, DSO, MC (former CO of 1/18th Londons (London Irish Rifles)) until November 1917 * Maj R. Groves- Raines, DSO, until December 1917 * Lt-Col F.R. Grimwood, DSO (formerly of 1/17th Londons (Poplar and Stepney Rifles)) until March 1918 (captured) * Maj H.S. Read, MC until May 1918 * Lt-Col W.B. Vince, DSO, MC (former CO of disbanded 1/8th Londons (Post Office Rifles)) until demobilisation 2/20th Londons Ze'ev Jabotinsky MBE served in platoon 16 of the 20th Battalion of the London Regiment between 1916 and 1917 The 2/20th Bn came into existence on 3 September 1914 and began training on Blackheath and in Greenwich Park, later moving to White City in west London. Early in 1915 it moved to billets around Betchworth in Surrey. The organisation of the Second Line Territorials duplicated the First Line, so that 2/20th Londons was assigned to 2/5th London Brigade in 2/2nd London Division. At the end of 1915, these were redesignated 180th (2/5th London) Brigade and 60th (2/2nd London) Division respectively.Elliot, p. 3. The battalions finally received rifles (old Japanese ones) for training in February 1915.Dalbaic, p. 28. Drafts to bring the 1/20th up to full strength for overseas service were a drain, but a fresh recruiting campaign in March 1915 brought the 2/20th back up to strength and provided for the 3/20th Bn. In August the 'Home Service only' and unfit men of the 2/20th were transferred to the 3/20th.Elliot, p. 8.Dalbaic, pp. 30–2. When the 1/20th embarked for France, the 2/20th took over their billets around St Albans in Hertfordshire, later being billeted at Coggeshall, Hatfield Broad Oak and Saffron Walden in Essex before reaching Hertford in December. In January 1916 the battalion moved to Sutton Veny on Salisbury Plain for intensive training prior to going overseas. Elliot, pp. 7–8.Dalbaic, pp. 33–41. Until now, the 2/20th had been sending drafts to replace casualties in the 1/20th, but that duty passed to the 3/20th Bn; the 2/20th itself absorbed and trained a draft of Yorkshiremen and Midlanders from Royal Army Medical Corps depots with no infantry training.Elliot, pp. 8–10.Dalbaic, p. 36. =Western Front= On 26 June 1916 the 2/20th Bn embarked at Southampton for service in France, and began training for crater-fighting under instructors from the 51st Highland Division. From 6 July companies went into the Line alongside units of 51st Highland before the battalion became responsible for its own sector at the Quarries near Neuville-St.-Vaast from 12 July.Elliot, pp. 10–9.Dalbaic, pp. 42–3. The battalion immediately suffered its first casualties. Vimy Ridge craters: Aggressive patrolling of the craters facing Vimy Ridge was instituted by 180 Bde. Over succeeding weeks the 2/20th Bn alternated with the 2/18th Londons for eight-day spells in the line. The 60th Division adopted coloured flashes painted on each side of the new steel helmets to aid recognition: 180 Bde adopted a triangle, which was vermilion in the case of the 2/20th Bn.Elliot, pp. 10–26. On 11 September the battalion carried out a pre-dawn raid on the German lines.Elliot, pp. 42–5.Dalbaic, pp. 57–8. By the time the division left the line in late October 1916, the 2/20th had suffered casualties of 3 officers and 48 men killed or died of wounds, and 5 officers and 187 men wounded.Elliot, p. 50. =Salonika= On 1 November, 60th Division was ordered to prepare to move to the Macedonian front, and the 2/20th embarked at Marseilles on 30 November, arriving at Salonika on 8 December. The battalion then marched up to the Doiran sector, where it was engaged in digging the Corps Defence Line in reserve. The 2/20th first went into the front line on 26 February 1917 in anticipation of a Bulgarian attack, and held the line until relieved on 26 March.Elliot, pp. 54–75.Dalbaic, pp. 64–79, 88–96. 2nd Battle of Doiran (24/25 April 1917): The battalion had been withdrawn to train for a raid to be carried out by 60th Division in support of a British offensive near Lake Doiran. The object of the battalion's raid on a position known as 'The Nose' was to secure prisoners, destroy trenches, and inflict casualties, but its main aim was to deceive the enemy as to the point of the main attack. The attack was carefully rehearsed and the enemy's line thoroughly reconnoitred beforehand. It was accompanied by a party of sappers from 519th Field Company, Royal Engineers. Three parties attacked with artillery support at 22.55 on the night of 24/25 April and despite the enemy's 'SOS' barrage and searchlights, succeeded in cutting through the wire entanglements and entering the trenches, which were found to be empty and blocked: the preparations for the raid had successfully alerted the Bulgarians. A fire-fight broke out while the trenches were demolished, and the raiders withdrew after 30 minutes, having lost 19 other ranks dead or died of wounds, three prisoners, and 2 officers and 68 other ranks wounded. The raid was considered a great success, though the main offensive was a failure.Elliot, pp. 74–80.Dalbaic, pp. 97–9.Wakefield & Moody, pp. 69–80. The 60th Division was next transferred to the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) for the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. The 2/20th Bn embarked for Alexandria on 16 June 1917.Elliot, pp. 81–4.Dalbaic, pp. 104–6. =Palestine= The division's first offensive action in Palestine was during the attack on Beersheba beginning on 31 October, but 180 Bde was held in reserve and the men of 2/20th were able to watch the progress of the operation.Elliot, pp. 104–5.Dalbaic, p. 119 Battle of Hareira and Sheria (6–7 November 1917): During the next phase of the offensive, against the Kauwukah trench system, on 6 November, two battalions of 180 Bde assaulted the Turkish lines, with 2/20th Bn in close support. The attack – the first full-scale assault made by the battalion in the war – was completely successful, with 'D' Company of 2/20th filling a gap in the attacking line and capturing a strongpoint. The company pressed on under heavy fire to capture a small hill overlooking the enemy positions. The whole battalion then made a dusk attack on the mound of Tel-es- Sheria. This was continued at dawn with the battalion advancing rapidly over open ground under covering fire from machine-guns, and seizing Sheria Station, Wadi Sheria and 'The Pimple'. The seizure of Sheria broke open the whole Turkish position, and allowed the EEF to pour through.Elliot, pp. 106–18.Dalbaic, pp. 126–35.Bullock, pp. 75–6. Nebi Samwil mosque before the battle Battle of Nebi Samwil (27–30 November 1917): After a period of rest, the 2/20th moved up on 25 November to support the 2/19th Londons defending the key point of Nebi Samwil. The Turks attacked Nebi Samwil two days later, but although the battalion sent companies up to the position, they were not required. The following evening 2/20th relieved 2/19th holding the position, and beat off two Turkish attacks before being relieved in turn on 30 November.Elliot, pp. 128–34.Dalbaic, pp. 146–50. Capture of Jerusalem (9 December 1917): By now the EEF was closing in on Jerusalem. On 8 December, after a difficult approach march, 180 Bde began its assault on Deir Yesin, with 2/20th Bn in brigade reserve. The attack was launched by 2/19th Bn, and after it was held up, the 2/20th reinforced it with one company working round the flank, and the rest of the battalion providing covering fire and a second support company. The brigade succeeded in capturing the position, which made the whole Turkish presence in Jerusalem untenable. The following morning, two mess cooks of 2/20th, Privates Andrews and Church, bringing up dixies of cocoa for the troops, got lost and found themselves near the gates of the City. They were greeted by a crowd of civilians with white flags. The surrender was taken by two sergeants of the 2/19th Bn, and patrols revealed that the city had been abandoned. D Company 2/20th claimed to be the first British troops to enter the western part.Elliot, pp. 140–50.Dalbaic, pp. 158–65. After the fall of Jerusalem, the battalion was rested until 26 December, when a final Turkish counter-attack was made to forestall the next British advance and 2/20th was called forward to reinforce the line. When this attack was spent, 180 Bde led the resumed offensive with a night attack on Er Ram from which the Turks retired, taking up positions on Shab Salah. Next day two companies of 2/20th Bn (B and C) led the attack on this dominating hill, descending into a wadi and then climbing up under severe artillery and machine-gun fire. The remaining Turks were driven off at the point of the bayonet and D Company followed up to consolidate the position.Elliot, pp. 164–173.Dalbaic, pp. 180–7. The battalion buried its dead in a single grave on Shab Salah, marked by a cross; they were later moved to Jerusalem War Cemetery.Elliot, p. 172.Jerusalem War Cemetery at CWGC. The battalion spent the next few weeks on outpost duty in the Wilderness between Jerusalem and Jericho, apart from an operation to collect a large number of rifles from the inhabitants of some villages who were suspected of harbouring Turkish deserters. On 19 February 1918 the advance was resumed to capture Jericho, with 2/20th Bn tasked with assaulting the Arak Ibrahim ridge and the high ground east of it, to clear the way for 2/18th and 2/19th to attack towards Talat ed Dumm the following day. The approach march was completed in darkness, with parties sent forward to occupy high points. The attack went in at 04.45 over extremely difficult ground, but success flares were lit on the summit of Arak Ibrahim by 06.10. Heavy casualties were suffered trying to cross the next 1,000 yards to the main Turkish position, but the advance was resumed at 13.30 after an artillery bombardment of the Turkish lines (the 2/20th helping to drag forward the guns), and the whole hill was captured by 14.15. The position was consolidated overnight, and on the morning of 21 February the rest of the 47th Division and the 1st Australian Light Horse Brigade captured Jericho.Elliot, pp. 173–86.Dalbaic, pp 193–7. The pontoon bridge across the Jordan Transjordan Raids. The battalion was next engaged in the First raid across the River Jordan. 2/17th and 2/19th Bns of 180 Bde were to make assault crossing by raft on the night of 21/22 March 1918, followed by 2/20th and 2/18th respectively. However, the attack by the 1/17th failed, and 2/20th were sent on a long march round to reinforce the bridgehead gained by 1/19th. It was impossible to advance from the bridgehead in daylight, but the following night an attack on a brigade frontage was made, with 2/20th in the lead, which expanded the bridgehead onto the hills in front. 2/20th was engaged in consolidation while the raid proceeded towards Amman, then in covering the withdrawal to the bridgehead once the raid had attracted Turkish retaliation.Elliot, pp. 188–200.Dalbaic, pp. 200–13.Bullock, pp. 107. The 2/20th was well to the fore in the Second Transjordan Raid, which began at 02.00 on 30 April 1918. The battalion captured the enemy trenches on the first crest, and beat off a counter-attack from the left as they continue to push on. But further advance was held up by heavy fire from a dominating position. Meanwhile, the mounted troops had reached Es Salt but had been compelled to retire, and the whole raiding force was withdrawn. The battalion historian refers to this as 'probably the stiffest action that it was destined to endure'.Elliot, pp. 200–5.Dalbaic, pp. 215–9.Bullock, p. 112. The exhausted 60th Division went into Corps reserve to rest and refit.Elliot, p. 206/Dalbaic, p. 219. After the crisis of the German Spring Offensive on the Western Front there was a call for reinforcements to be drawn from the troops in Palestine. The 60th Division was now placed on the Indian establishment (losing its London identity) and its surplus British battalions were broken up or sent to the Western Front as reinforcements, including the 2/20th. The battalion left on 27 May 1918 and sailed from Alexandria. During its service with the EEF, the 2/20th lost 7 officers and 114 other ranks killed or died of wounds or disease, 12 officers and 430 other ranks wounded.Elliot, pp. 207–10.Dalbaic, pp. 219–20. =Return to the Western Front= The 2/20th disembarked at Taranto before moving by rail to France, where it concentrated at Abancourt on 16 July 1918. Three days later it was attached to 66th (2nd East Lancashire) Division, which had been reduced to a training cadre after losses in the German offensive. On 9 August the battalion was transferred again, being attached to 185th (2/1st West Riding) Brigade of 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division for the final Allied Hundred Days Offensive.Elliot, pp. 213–22.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 72.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 41–8. Battalions of 185 Bde wore a coloured circle (red in the case of 2/20th Londons) on the steel helmet and on the sleeve below the shoulder.Elliot, p. 222. 2/20th Battalion took part in the following actions during the Hundred Days Offensive: Battle of the Scarpe (26–30 August 1918). On 25 August the division relieved 2nd Division, which had just taken Ervillers, and continued the advance the next day towards Vraucourt, with 185 Bde in support. The advance having been held up, 2/20th Bn was ordered to renew the attack on 30 August with a dawn assault behind a creeping barrage and with tank support (both being new experiences for the battalion). The objectives were the villages of Vraucourt and Vaulx, and a sugar factory at a cross-roads. After forming up in the dark, the battalion attacked and by 07.30 had taken its objectives and established a continuous line, except on the right, where B company was broken into separate groups after tackling numerous machine gun positions. They then had to endure serious shelling and German counter-attacks until 2 September, when 187 Bde leap-frogged through, and the battalion was relieved the following day. In four days the 2/20th had lost 1 officer and 32 other ranks killed, six officers and 133 other ranks wounded.Elliot, pp. 225–33. Battle of Havrincourt (12 September 1918). After a week's rest, and training in tank cooperation and the use of smokescreens, the battalion moved up to support the division's attack on Havrincourt. The following morning the 2/20th led the renewed attack, moving close behind the barrage and getting beyond their objectives, before repelling counter-attacks: divisional HQ described it as a 'clever and successful operation'. The battalion was relieved on 15 September, having suffered casualties of 4 officers and 35 other ranks killed, 10 other ranks wounded.Elliot, pp. 234–42. Battle of the Canal du Nord (27 September 1918). When the advance was resumed on 27 September 185 Bde was detailed to follow up an attack by 76 Bde of 3rd Division. 2/20th had to cross the dry Canal du Nord by means of ladders to reach their jumping-off points, and then at 09.50 advanced through 76 Bde towards the second objective, which was captured at a rush. Some parties even got as far forward as the third objective before the reserve battalion leapfrogged through at 10.30. The battalion's companies suffered heavy casualties from machine guns and field guns on their open flanks, and the division did not reach its final objective, but before midnight a firm line was being held along Kaiser Trench. The battalion's casualties in the operation were 2 officers and 25 other ranks killed, 1 officer and 58 other ranks wounded.Elliot, pp.242–6.Edmonds, p. 42. Subsequently, the battalion was ordered to take Rumilly at dawn on 30 September, without artillery support. After a difficult night approach march, the village was found to be strongly held, and despite two artillery bombardments, the isolated and scattered battalion was unable to hold it.Elliot, pp. 246–9. Battle of the Selle (20 October 1918). By now the trench warfare of the Western Front was dissolving into open warfare, and the 2/20th's experience in Palestine came into play, though it had to be brought up to strength with large drafts of fresh men.Elliot, pp. 251–2. At 02.00 on 20 October the division attacked Solesmes, 2/20th being given the task of encircling it from the North to take a clearly defined ridge after 186 Bde enveloped the town from the South. After crossing the River Selle by a narrow plank bridge to reach its jumping-off position, the battalion moved off at 07.00 and made good progress, establishing contact with the Guards Division on the left and completely breaking up a German counter-attack at 16.00 with its own rifles and Lewis guns in the absence of an attached section of Vickers guns that had been unable to get through. Casualties were comparatively light, but still numbered 22 killed and 87 wounded.Elliot, pp. 253–60.Edmonds, pp. 340–1. Battle of the Sambre (4–6 November 1918). After a short period of rest and training, 185 Bde went into the line as reserve for the division's attack on Frasnoy on 4 November. The 2/20th attacked at 06.00 on the following morning to complete the capture of the objective, and then advanced beyond it to dig in on a support line, despite the rain and mud. The following morning they attacked again at 06.00, being firmly established on all their objectives by 10.00. This day, 6 November, was the last that the battalion spent in the line. It advanced towards the fortress town of Maubeuge and entered the outskirts, but when the Armistice with Germany came into force on 11 November, the division had lost touch with the retreating Germans.Elliot, pp. 261–7. Occupation of the Rhineland (1918–19). 62nd Division was among those selected for the British Army of Occupation, and set out from Maubeuge on 16 November, led by the 2/20th Bn, marching through liberated Belgian villages until they crossed the frontier at Sinzenich, near Cologne on 24 December. The battalion was billeted at Sinzenich through the winter as part of the Army of Occupation. In March 1919 it moved to Düren to staff a demobilisation centre in the German barracks there. A party of 11 officers and 250 men volunteered to serve in the British Army of the Rhine and were sent to join the 10th Bn QORWK. The remainder of the battalion was progressively demobilised until the final cadre returned home to a civic reception at Lewisham on 13 June 1919.Elliot, pp. 269–81, 302–6. The battalion was formally disbanded on 19 August 1919 at Blackdown Camp. The 2/20th Bn's total casualties during two years four and half months of active service were 18 officers and 331 other ranks killed or died, and 31 officers and 982 other ranks wounded.Elliot, p. 268. =Commanding Officers= The following officers commanded 2/20th Londons during World War I:Elliot, pp. 3 & 9. * Col E.J. Moore, CB, TD, from formation * Lt-Col H.A. Christmas, from September 1914 * Lt-Col W. St A. Warde-Aldam, DSO, (Coldstream Guards) from 4 April 1916 until demobilisation 3/20th Londons The 3/20th Bn was formed on 9 March 1915 as a reserve battalion to provide drafts to the 1/20th and 2/20th Bns. It moved to Richmond Park for training and then to Winchester in January 1916. On 8 April 1916 it was redesignated 20th Reserve Bn as part of the 2nd London Reserve Group (later 2nd London Reserve Brigade). In November 1917 it moved to Chiseldon Camp in Wiltshire and then in March 1918 to Flixton in Suffolk. It was disbanded at Manchester on 12 June 1919.TF Training Bns at Warpath. Interwar The London Regiment had ceased to function in 1916, the battalions reverting to the administrative control of their pre-1908 affiliated Regular regiments (the QORWK in the case of the 20th Londons). On 16 February 1920, the 47th Division began to reform in the new Territorial Army, and by 1922 the battalion had fully reformed as the 20th London Regiment (The Queen's Own) in 141 (5th London) Bde.Maude, p. 212.Martin, p. 16.Titles and Designations. 90 cm Projector Anti-Aircraft, displayed at Fort Nelson, Portsmouth In 1935, 47th Division became 1st Anti-Aircraft Division, and a number of its battalions were converted to Anti-Aircraft (AA) roles. The 20th Londons was one of these, becoming a searchlight unit on 15 December 1935 as 34th (The Queen's Own Royal West Kent) Anti-Aircraft Battalion (later amended to '34th (Queen's Own)')of the Royal Engineers (RE) with four AA Companies numbered 336–339. It formed part of 27th (Home Counties) Anti-Aircraft Group in 1 AA Division. By 1938, the battalion had transferred 339 Company to the 26th AA Battalion in exchange for the experienced 302 Company, giving the battalion the following organisation.Martin, p. 17.Litchfield, p. 171.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 108–9, 112–3. * HQ at Holly Hedge House, Blackheath * 302 Company at Greenwich * 336 Company at Blackheath * 337 Company at Blackheath * 338 Company at Eltham Despite transfer to the RE, the battalion continued to wear its White Horse cap badge and 20th Londons buttons.Regimental Badges. World War II =Mobilisation= The TA's AA units were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis, with units manning their emergency positions within 24 hours, even though many did not yet have their full complement of men or equipment. The emergency lasted three weeks, and they were stood down on 13 October.Routledge, pp. 62–3. In February 1939 the existing AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command. In June a partial mobilisation of the TA was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected gun and searchlight positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.Routledge, pp. 65–6, 371. On the outbreak of war, 34 AA Bn was still part of 27th AA Bde, but was now in 6 AA Division, responsible for guarding the Thames Estuary.AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot filesRoutledge, Table LX, p. 378. =Dunkirk= Early in 1940, 34 AA Bn supplied searchlight detachments for the Thames Defence Flotilla, three paddle steamers converted as Auxiliary AA ships: HMS Royal Eagle, Crested Eagle and Golden Eagle. On 29 May the Flotilla was ordered to France to assist in the evacuation from Dunkirk (Operation Dynamo). Between the three ships over 3500 men were rescued, often at great risk to the crews. Crested Eagle was bombed and sunk by Luftwaffe aircraft off Dunkirk on 29 May. Great bravery was shown by the searchlight detachments on these ships. Corporal Lew Goddard on the Crested Eagle was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal and Lance-Corporal Gordon Vane on the Royal Eagle was awarded the Military Medal, both for actions during the evacuation.Brigstock. =Home Front= During 1940 the RE's AA units were transferred to the Royal Artillery (RA) and in August the battalion became 34th (The Queen's Own Royal West Kent) Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery. It remained part of Home Forces until January 1945, defending the UK against air attack by the Luftwaffe.Frederick, pp. 858, 865.Farndale, Annex M, p. 339. The regiment supplied a cadre of experienced officers and men to 236th S/L Training Rgt at Oswestry where it provided the basis for a new 532 S/L Bty formed on 14 November 1940. This battery later joined 87th S/L Rgt.Frederick, p. 861. By early 1944, With the lower threat of attack by the weakened Luftwaffe, AA Command was being forced to release manpower for the planned invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord). All Home Defence searchlight regiments were reduced, 34th S/L losing 338 Bty, which began disbandment on 6 March, competed by 3 April.Routledge, p. 409.Order of Battle of AA Command, 27 April 1944, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 212/85. =Infantry role= At the end of 1944, 21st Army Group fighting in North West Europe was suffering a severe manpower shortage, particularly among the infantry.Ellis, pp. 141–2. At the same time the Luftwaffe was so short of pilots, aircraft and fuel that serious aerial attacks on the United Kingdom could be discounted. In January 1945 the War Office began to reorganise surplus AA regiments in the UK into infantry battalions, primarily for line of communication and occupation duties in North West Europe, thereby releasing trained infantry for frontline service.Ellis, pp. 369, 380.Infantry Regiments RA at RA 39–45. Routledge, pp. 420–1. The 34th was one of the units selected for conversion to the infantry role, becoming 633rd (Queen's Own Royal West Kent) Infantry Regiment, Royal Artillery.Frederick, p. 882.Joslen, p. 404. It formed part of 308th Infantry Brigade (converted from 61 AA Bde). After infantry training, including a short period attached to 38th (Welsh) Infantry Division, 308 Bde came under the orders of 21st Army Group on 27 April 1945 and landed on the Continent two days later. It came under the control of Maasforce (4–22 May) and then I Canadian Corps, serving in North West Europe until the end of the war. The regiment was placed in suspended animation on 31 October 1945. Postwar AA Command's formation sign. When the TA was reconstituted on 1 January 1947, the regiment reformed at Blackheath as 569 (The Queen's Own) Searchlight Regiment, as part of 75 AA Bde (the old 49 AA Bde based in London). In March 1949 it was redesignated 569 (The Queen's Own) (Mixed) Light Anti-Aircraft/Searchlight Regiment, reflecting a partially changed role and the inclusion of members of the Women's Royal Army Corps (hence the designation 'Mixed').Frederick, p. 1023.564–591 Regiments at British Army units from 1945 on.Litchfield, Appendix 5.Watson, TA 1947.67–106 AA Bdes at British Army 1945 on. The regiment still wore its 20th Londons cap badge, together with RA collar badges. About 1951 its personnel adopted a supplementary shoulder title of 'THE QUEEN'S OWN' in grey on black beneath the RA shoulder title and above the AA Command arm badge. AA Command was disbanded on 10 March 1955, and as part of the reduction the regiment was merged into 265 Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, becoming Q Battery (The Queens Own), based at Lewisham. Further reductions in 1961 saw the whole regiment become Q (London) Battery at Grove Park.Frederick, p. 998. Successor units still occupy Grove Park and Bexleyheath drill-halls, as 265 (Home Counties) Battery, 106th (Yeomanry) Regiment, Royal Artillery and 265 (Kent and County of London Yeomanry) Support Squadron, Royal Corps of Signals. Both units strive to continue and maintain the traditions and history of their predecessor Regiments. Regimental memorial plaques and Regimental silver are displayed within The Army Reserve Centre, Baring Road, Grove Park, London SE12 0BH. These can be viewed at by prior appointment. Past members from the Regiment within The Royal Artillery Association still attend the annual Jerusalem dinner held at The Grove Park Army Reserve Centre. Battle Honours The regiment was awarded the following Battle Honours (those shown in bold type being those selected to be displayed on the Regimental Colours: South Africa 1900–02 Loos, Somme 1916, '18, Flers-Courcelette, Le Transloy, Messines 1917, Ypres 1917, Langemarck 1917, St Quentin, Bapaume 1918, Ancre 1918, Hindenburg Line, Havrincourt, Canal du Nord, Cambrai 1918, Selle, Sambre, France and Flanders 1915–18, Doiran 1917, Macedonia 1916–17, Gaza, Jerusalem, Jericho, Jordan, Palestine 1917–18. The RA and RE do not receive battle honours, so none were awarded to the regiment for its service during World War II. Memorials In 1920 a 20 ft runic granite cross was erected in the grounds of Holly Hedge House bearing the inscription: '1914–1918 1939–1945 / IN MEMORY OF / THE OFFICERS, WARRANT OFFICERS, NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICERS AND MEN / OF THE 1/20TH AND 2/20TH BATTNS THE LONDON REGIMENT / WHO FELL FOR THEIR COUNTRY DURING THE GREAT WAR, / IN BELGIUM, FRANCE, SALONIKA, EGYPT, PALESTINE AND GERMANY / 1915–1918 / THIS MEMORIAL HAS BEEN ERECTED BY THEIR COMRADES'. It was unveiled by HRH Prince Albert (later King George VI), who presented a King's Colour to the disbanded 2/20th Bn at the same ceremony.UKNIWM Ref 12136Elliot, Appendix VII. The memorial was renewed in 1954, when the date '1939–45' was added, and it was unveiled by Gen Sir Frederick Pile, former GOC of AA Command.

Early life Gill was born in 1961 in Hartford, Connecticut and was raised on a farm in Granby, Connecticut. He attended Westminster School and graduated in 1980. In 1984 he graduated from Tulane University in New Orleans where he earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts, with a focus on glassblowing. He moved to Italy to learn stone carving before returning to the United States to study at the California College of the Arts. He graduated with a Master of Fine Arts in 1988. Career Although Gill began his art career in glassblowing, ceramics and landscape drawing, he gradually turned to sculpture. His early works were mainly abstract metal sculptures, but over time he increasingly began to work with wood instead of metal. He briefly lived in New York City but returned to New Hartford, Connecticut, where he constructed a two-story studio adjoining his house in 1998 from wood timbered from his own property. One of Gill's first works after he resettled in Connecticut was a sculpture composed of 42 upside-down hanging Christmas trees. Some of his other sculptures include Twins (2000), a bronze cast of two conjoined saplings, and Blow Down (2002), a skinned and flattened spruce tree mounted on a wall. Gill began creating woodcuts from tree cross-sections in 2004. Most of his woodcuts were created from dead or damaged tree parts that he collected and took to his studio to prepare cross-sections of the wood for relief printing. In 2012, Chronicle Books published Woodcut, a book which displays a selection of Gill's prints; it was named one of The New York Times Magazines best books of the year. An exhibition by the same name, composed of 30 of Gill's prints, was displayed at the Chicago Botanic Garden in early 2013. He created prints from a large variety of trees, of which the oldest was a fallen 200-year-old chestnut tree once planted by Frederick Law Olmsted. Gill's work has been displayed at the New Britain Museum of American Art and DeCordova Museum and Sculpture Park, and he was commissioned to create installations for Expo 2005 in Japan and the World Financial Center in New York. He was a fellow of the California Arts Council and twice received grants from the Connecticut Commission on the Arts. He was profiled in Martha Stewart Living in 2012 and was the focus of a documentary video produced by the magazine. Personal life Gill died on May 17, 2013, \\"unexpectedly of natural causes\\" at the age of 52. He was married to Gina Gill (née Kiss) for 12 years, and they had a son named Forest.

Blic, May 6th, 2011. (In Serbian). Stanojević won residencies at the International School of Painting, Drawing and Sculpture in Montecastello, Italy (2004) and at the Outside Project in Florence (2007). Art Stanojević's art can be considered a realism not reduced to recognition, in the convention that a painting is always an interpretation of the world determined by conventions, ideology and the spirit of the time. Realism becomes one of the possible ways of exploration of a new society and new perspectives on society and nature. Through her portraits, the Serbian artist allows us to perceive a subject as a significant image of our cultural environment, that offers something more than a nicely composed and a convincing interpretation of a person. An artistic interest inclined toward less glorified aspects of everyday life led Stanojević to depict subjects possessing greatness not related to social status or physical beauty, such as in hairstyles and enlarged female heads, submitted to the celebration of a woman in all her uniqueness. This is not a romantic escape into an idyllic world of beauty and grace, but a sign of fundamental isolation, exploration of the metaphysics of the outer and inner environment, microcosm of the body, vulnerability. Face to face with Stanojević's large scale portraits, viewer is unable to see the painting in full, his eye is forced to scan it and his brain starts isolating elements and making connections between them. Looking at the painting, viewer can come closer to it or step farther away from it, turning himself into a zooming lens. Stanojević's work, telling us about artist's own relationship with reality, tries to let the viewer see for a moment the world from another perspective, giving him the freedom to change perspectives. The viewer is pulled into a moment and forced to think about what he sees.Mostra personale di Jovanka Stanojević, Sansepolcro, September 5th - 14th, 2014. (In Italian).

Early life  Haymes was born on 31 December 1870 at Hopesay in Shropshire, England, the son of Jane Henrietta Martha Haymes and the Reverend Robert Evered Haymes. He was educated at Bedford Modern School, the Oxford Military College and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich.  Army service  He entered the army in 1891 with a commission as a Second Lieutenant in the Royal Artillery, becoming Captain in 1899, an instructor in Gunnery (1905–09), Adjutant (1909–11) and Lieutenant- Colonel (1917). He served in the Native Mountain Artillery, NW Frontier, India (1897–1903) and between 1911 and 1914 Haymes was second in command of the Malay States Guides. During World War I, Haymes went to France in command of the 6th Siege Battery (September 1914). He took part in the First Battle of Ypres (October 2014) and the Battle of Neuve Chapelle (10 March 1915). He was one of the first to establish an OP in the Battle of Neuve Chapelle.

It was designed by architect Richard Sharp Smith and built in 1892-1893. It is a 2 1/2-story, pebbledash coated masonry building with brick, stone, and wood accents. From its early days, the YMI building has housed shops, residence rooms, meeting rooms, and a wide variety of functions serving the African American community of Asheville. The building was restored and reestablished as the YMI Cultural Center in 1980, and now hosts a variety of intercultural programs and events. It is located in the Downtown Asheville Historic District.  History  The YMI was built after African American leaders Mr. Isaac Dickson and Dr. Edward S. Stephens originally approached George Vanderbilt in 1892 to commission the building for the African American men who helped build the Biltmore Estate. While living in Asheville, Dr. Stephens was frustrated with racial discrimination he witnessed and the perception from white Asheville residents that black people were not capable of being self- reliant or assuming the responsibilities of citizenship. George Vanderbilt and his estate superintendent Charles McNamee agreed to fund the YMI and provide an opportunity for black leaders to \\"demonstrate their ability to learn the art of self-government.\\"Charles McNamee to the editor of the Asheville Daily Citizen, November 9, 1891, Superintendent's Office Outgoing Correspondence Collection, Box 8, Folders 75-80, Biltmore Estate Archives. In providing funding to the YMI, Vanderbilt's goal was to test whether the YMI could achieve financial solvency, and thereby show that the black community could self-govern. Economic self sufficiency was challenging to the black community in Asheville, however, in these post-civil war years, as they faced discrimination and wage disparity in the service sector jobs available. The YMI was designed to serve as a multipurpose space, with meeting spaces, a library and reading room, and a gymnasium. Programming in its early days included lectures by prominent African Americans, as well as musical and dramatic performances. A musical chorus and orchestra were formed early on, and YMI officials also sought to bring performers from the wider regional and national arts scene to the area, succeeding in attracting Elizabeth Davis, Joseph Douglass, and \\"Queen of Song\\" Flora Batson in 1895. Entrepreneurial activities were also supported in the space: the outside ground floor was dedicated as retail and business space for black-owned businesses. Rent from businesses was intended to defray expenses, contribute to payment of the loan from the building's construction, and make the YMI financially self- sustaining. In June of 1906, the YMI's Board of Directors purchased the building from the Vanderbilt Estate for $10,000. The YMI continued to flourish during the period of segregation, but suffered decline in use during the 1960s and 1970s. In 1980, a coalition of nine black churches purchased the building and reestablished it as the YMI Cultural Center. The building has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1977.  Current use  The YMI Cultural Center continues both to provide a home for local businesses and to host a variety of cultural programs and exhibitions of art and artifacts in order to preserve the heritage of African Americans in Buncombe County. Permanent exhibitions feature African masks and sculpture, drawings by the African-American artist Charles W. White, and a photographs that highlight the history of the YMI and its ties to the building and history of Biltmore Estate.https://www.blueridgeheritage.com/destinations/ymi-cultural-center/ References External links * Category:African-American history of North Carolina Category:Clubhouses on the National Register of Historic Places in North Carolina Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1893 Category:Buildings and structures in Asheville, North Carolina Category:National Register of Historic Places in Buncombe County, North Carolina Category:Historic district contributing properties in North Carolina Category:Tourist attractions in Asheville, North Carolina Category:Tourist attractions in Buncombe County, North Carolina ","title":"Young Men's Institute Building"},{"id":"43697258","text":"Stade Rue de Lenningen is a football stadium in Canach, in south-eastern Luxembourg.

Main Images and Motifs  Valentinov creates his fictional world with the help of the repeating themes, images and motifs. One of them is about the people or race of Dhars (other names: Dars, Dergs, Logres and Chugs; Russian: дхары, дары, дэрги, логры, чуги). The etymology of their names might be Aryan (Dhars or Dars, compare with the Slavic dar – gift, talent), Eastern (Dergs), Celtic (Logres, also Logris or Loegria is the name of King Arthur's realm) or Slavic (chugs as diminutive for chugaisters or chugasters, kind wood goblins for Western Ukrainians living in the Carpathians). According to Valentinov, they are ambiguous creatures: half human, half bearlike, whose origin is very ancient and mysterious. The Dhars live in different places of the world and are endangered because of many enemies, from ignorant cruel people to the evil forces. They keep ancient secret knowledge and have psychic abilities. They usually look like humans, but some of them can transform into werebears. The Dhars might be the descendants of fallen angels and human females. Valentinov suggests that King Arthur whose name meant “bear” was one of them. They are presented in many Valentinov's books, especially in the Logrian series and The Eye of Power Series.

Geography Located on the Côte-Nord (North Shore) of Gulf of Saint Lawrence, the lake Musquaro covers an area of 207 square kilometers. The lake is 43 km long and 8 km wide. This lake is formed by a major expansion of the river of the same name. The lake Musquaro is the main body of water feeding the Musquaro River. The mouth of the lake which is located in a bay at the south of the lake is about 32.5 km (direct line) northeast of the village of Kégaska and Gulf of Saint Lawrence. The lake Musquaro is located south of La Pommeraye Lake, west of Lake Marie Claire, and 4 km north of Lake Musquanousse which discharges into the Musquanousse River whose mouth is 8 km to the east the mouth of the Musquaro River. The shape of the lake Musquaro is complex. The lake is dotted with islands and peninsulas of all shapes and sizes. Many of these bays are a longitudinal shape. Located on the Côte-Nord (North Shore), this lake receives its water from some rivers and lakes including Lake D'Auteuil, west, which seems rather to be an extension.  Toponymy  The term \\"Musquaro\\" is a translation adapted from Native American language, meaning \\"tail of a black bear\\". Montagnais designate the lake \\"Mahkuanu Nipi\\" or \\"lake of the black bear tail\\"; and the river \\"Kapitahkuiat Hipu\\" (or segments of the river) or Mahkuanu Hipu river \\"black bear tail\\". In his writings, the father Charles Arnaud indicates that up the Musquaro River, a mountain having the complete shape of a bear is encountered; and \\"not even the tail\\" is missing. Naskapi use the label \\"Maskuanu Shipis\\" meanings the little river of the \\"tail of a black bear\\". This name appears in the documents of the seventeenth century, using distinctive spellings. On his map of the St. Lawrence River dated 1685, JB L. Franquelin shows \\"Mascouarou\\". In the nineteenth century and early twentieth century, the spelling of the name of the river are varied, although the pronunciation is similar. Rouillard listed the following spellings: Muskwaro, Mascourao, Maskuaro, Masquaro and Musquaro. In these graphs are added those of Maskouaro and Musquarro Source: \\"Names and locations of Quebec\\", the work of the Geographical Names Board of Quebec, published in 1994 and 1996 as an illustrated dictionary printed, and under that of CD-ROM produced by Micro-Intel in 1997 from this dictionary.

Biography Stewart was born in Dublin, his grandfather had moved to Ireland from the Lowlands of Scotland in 1780.Vignoles (1898), p. 3; see Bibliography. His displayed an early talent in music, fostered by his mother, who had been a pupil of Johann Bernhard Logier. He didn't study music in an academic sense, but received some thorough grounding in church music when he joined the choir school of Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin, in 1833, where he came under the care and tutelage of Rev. John Finlayson and the Master of the Boys, Richard William Beaty.Parker (2009), p. 7. His biographer O.J. Vignoles also mentions Archdeacon Magee and the Dean's vicar, John C. Crosthwaite, as having had influence on Stewart's musical education.Vignoles (1898), p. 5–6. In 1844 he succeeded John Robinson as cathedral organist, a position he held until his death, and also became organist at St. Patrick's Cathedral from 1852 to 1861. In 1846 he succeeded Joseph Robinson as conductor of the University of Dublin Choral Society, another position he held for the rest of his life. He received the degrees of Bachelor of Music (MusB) and Doctor of Music (MusD) from Trinity College, Dublin, simultaneously in April 1851 and became Professor of Music there in 1862 (again until the end of his life). In addition, Stewart was professor of piano, organ, harmony and counterpoint at the Royal Irish Academy of Music from 1869, also teaching chamber music classes there from 1880. He was a founder, in 1865, of the Dublin Glee and Madrigal Union and conducted the Philharmonic Society (Dublin) and the Belfast Philharmonic Society. For his services to music he was knighted at Dublin Castle in 1872. He died in Dublin. Among Stewart's most prominent pupils were Annie Curwen, W.H.G. Flood, Vincent O'Brien, Margaret O'Hea, Edith Oldham, Annie Patterson, Charles Villiers Stanford, and the writer John Millington Synge. Music In the light of all these positions, activities, and commitments it is difficult to imagine how Stewart found time for composing music. Yet, he was very prolific in this regard, too. Although he didn't write any symphonies or concertante works for orchestra, he concentrated on vocal music including large-scale cantatas, small-scale glees, songs and a number of organ pieces. His largest works are the cantatas A Winter Night's Wake (1858) and The Eve of St John (1860), the Ode to Shakespeare (1870) for the Birmingham Festival, an Orchestral Fantasia (1872) for the Boston Peace Festival, and the Tercentenary Ode (1892) for the anniversary of Trinity College, Dublin. Many of these works are difficult to assess today, because Stewart was extremely critical of his own output, and destroyed a lot of it, including the Ode to Shakespeare. Stewart also made an international reputation as a performer and extemporiser on the organ. Beginning with an 1851 performance at the Crystal Palace on the occasion of the London Exhibition, he played in England on numerous occasions, including several journeys to the Birmingham Music Festivals, the Manchester Exhibition, and he also travelled to the Beethoven and Schumann festivals in Bonn and the Wagner Festival at Bayreuth. For most of the twentieth century, Stewart's music was regarded as uninspired and academic, or, as a writer put it in 1989: \\"[...] generally a model of rectitude, but the absence of that creative spark which, after all, belongs only to a select few in any generation has doomed it to an almost total oblivion from which it is unlikely to emerge.\\"Grindle (1989), p. 202; see Bibliography. During recent years there has been a revived interest in Stewart's music, particularly his church music, and he has regained a firm place in the Irish cathedral repertoire today. This newfound esteem is reflected in a number of 1990s CD recordings (see 'Recordings' below). Boydell wrote in 2004: \\"Stewart is beginning to be acknowledged as a talented composer who made an important contribution not only to music in nineteenth-century Ireland but also within the wider context of nineteenth- century cathedral music.\\"Boydell (2004), p. 166; see Bibliography.

Life and academic career Peter Weingart studied sociology and economics from 1961 until 1967 at Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg and Freie Universität Berlin. Till 1968, he was University Fellow at Princeton University in New Jersey and received a doctorate 1969 at the Freie Universität Berlin.Weingart, P. (1970). Die amerikanische Wissenschaftslobby, Zum sozialen und politischen Wandel des Wissenschaftssystems im Prozeß der Forschungsplanung. Düsseldorf: Universitätsverlag. The thesis was about the American scientific lobby in the process of research planning. Weingart had various assignments with the Berlin University and was science expert for the German unions economic institute in Düsseldorf and directed the center of Science research at Bielefeld University. 1973 he received a tenure in Bielefeld. In the mid 1980s, he received various fellowships at Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin and Harvard University. From 1989 till 2009 he was again in Bielefeld. Since 2015 Weingart has held the South African Research Chair in Science communication at Stellenbosch University. Weingart is member of Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften and Hanse- Wissenschaftskolleg, the Hanseatic League Institute for Advanced Study. He was among the editors of Scientometrics,Scientometrics and International Journal of Sociology and Social Policy.International Journal of Sociology and Social Policy and publisher of Yearbook Sociology of the SciencesSociology of the Sciences Yearbook and advisor for Suhrkamp Verlag. He is the current editor- in-chief of Minerva.  Positions and interests  Weingart started early to examine the production of knowledge and its interaction with politics and the media. His book Wissen Beraten Entscheiden (know, advise, decide) described forms of science advice to politics in Germany. He wrote as well a book about the science base for the German eugenics studies and their interaction with Racial hygiene policy. For the present, Weingart states a higher importance of PR agencies intermediating between science and public and saw a trend of a more 'public science' within a postindustrial information society. The media's role as the fourth estate increases and influences science findings already in its production state. It may be attractive for some scientists to use their celebrity status in the media as means of gaining acceptance for their findings or for their preferred fields of study. Such celebrity bonuses however weaken peer review controlling mechanisms. Weingart saw the hype about of Daniel Goldhagen's books in Germany as such an example. Weingart also took the climate change debate as an example where the public announcement of findings may backfire. The public debate about climate change in Germany was at its height around 1986, when the energy committee of the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft (AKE) predicted a climate catastrophy rendering earth a dead planet within 50 years. The scientists asked in parallel to increase nuclear power stations to reduce CO2 emissions. When meteorologists started to criticize the alarmist tone, the AKE toned down its conclusions to climate change instead of climate disaster. However the public scene kept using the alarmist conclusions first and later on doubted scientists overall credibility on the topic. Weingart prefers science communication to provide proof of uncertainties and ignorance combined with established facts. The basic aspects of \\"Verwissenschaftlichung der Gesellschaft – Politisierung der Wissenschaft\\" (a scientification of society and politicization of science) go hand in hand.

He was member of the Brazilian Academy of Letters, elected in 1986.  Biography  Lêdo Ivo was born in 1924 in Maceió, capital of Alagoas state in northeastern Brazil. He settled in 1940 in Recife, where he completed his training. In 1943, he moved to Rio de Janeiro to enroll in law school and while working for the literary supplements as a professional journalist. He married Leda Maria Sarmento Ivo de Medeiros (1923-2004), with whom he had three children. His first book was published in 1944, a collection of poems titled As imaginações. The following year he published Ode e Elegia, which was awarded the Olavo Bilac Prize the Brazilian Academy of Letters and is a turning point in the history of Brazilian poetry. The death of Mário de Andrade in 1945 led to a generational change in Brazilian poetry whose rule was \\"an invitation to transgression\\", with the triumph of purely poetical structures. His literary work would be enhanced in the following decades by books of poetry, novels, short stories and essays or reports. Ivo's first novel, As Alianças, which went through several editions and awarded him the Graça Aranha Foundation Prize in 1947. He continued with O Caminho sem Adventura (1948), O sobrinho do General (1964) and Ninho de cobras (published in English as Snake's Nest) (1973), one of his biggest hits, an allegory of totalitarianism of the military dictatorship of Getúlio Vargas. His last novel was A morte do Brasil (1984). In 1949 Ivo spoke at the Museum of Modern Art of São Paulo in a conference titled The Generation of 1945; in the same year he received a law degree, a profession he never would exercise, preferring to devote himself to journalism. In 1953 he visited several European countries for long periods. In 1963 he spent two months in universities in the USA, by invitation of the Government. In 1986 Ivo was elected to the Brazilian Academy of Letters. In 2009 he was awarded the Premio Casa de Las Américas. Ledo Ivo was also a translator. He translated into Portuguese works of authors like Albrecht Goes, Jane Austen, Maupassant, Rimbaud and Dostoyevsky.

Despite the fact that they have a transactional relationship Anne is very much in love with Noeli and Noeli plans to use her in order to get a visa to go to France from where she hopes to go to Barcelona to reconnect with her mother who has immigrated there. While out with Anne, Noeli sees her boyfriend with another girl at a club. She angrily confronts him while Anne is in the washroom, but Anne sees the tail end of their fight. Anne leaves the club and Noeli tries to stop her from leaving. However, when it becomes clear that all Noeli wants is for Anne to pay their bar tab, Anne slaps Noeli and leaves. On her way home Noeli gets into a motorcycle accident and has her motorcycle stolen from her as she is left injured on the side of the road. Anne struggles for a few days as she doesn't hear from Noeli and thinks she has abandoned her. Noeli meanwhile does not want to go back to Anne and tells her boyfriend to start providing for them. As money runs out she returns to Anne and tells her she is pregnant. Anne accompanies her to get an ultrasound to see if her unborn child is hurt and together they see the sonogram. After their reunion Anne presents Noeli with a passport and visa so that they can go to France together. She confesses to a friend that she doesn't believe that Noeli will be happy in Paris and they will be able to return to the Dominican Republic soon. Noeli's boyfriend learns she is pregnant and plans to have the child overseas. He asks her to stay and she declines going ahead with the preparations to leave with Anne. The night of her departure Noeli's boyfriend comes to visit her. Noeli gathers up her passport, money and papers and leaves a sleeping Anne. She and her boyfriend drive away and she tells him she loves him. Cast * Geraldine Chaplin * Yanet Mojica * Ricardo Ariel Toribio Development Directors Guzmán and Cárdenas based their script on the novel Sand Dollars by Jean-Noel Pancrazi. The original script, like the novel, was about two men, but the directors rewrote the script to feature two women after Geraldine Chaplin expressed interest in appearing in the film. Yanet Mojica had never acted previously to appearing in the film but was selected based on the close resemblance of her life to that of the character she portrayed.

He played in the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership for Sydney's Canterbury-Bankstown club in the 1960s as well as in the country for Woy Woy's club. Louis then started coaching there before returning to Sydney, eventually becoming head coach of the North Sydney Bears in the 1990s. After almost seven seasons he became the National Rugby League referees' coach. Playing career Louis started his playing career in Woy Woy before moving to Sydney and joining NSWRFL premiership club, Canterbury-Bankstown in 1968. He played mostly in reserve grade, with a handful of appearances in first grade during the 1969 NSWRFL season. Part-way through the 1970 season Louis returned to Woy Woy where he was captain-coach. He guided the club to a first grade premiership. Coaching career Louis returned to Sydney and had success coaching in the New South Wales Rugby Football League's reserve grade for the Parramatta Eels from 1984 to 1989 and the North Sydney Bears from 1990. He replaced Steve Martin as head coach of North Sydney for the 1993 NSWRL season. After falling just outside the top five play-off group in his first year, he helped the Bears come to within one win of the minor premiership for the 1994 NSWRL season and was named coach of the year at the Dally M Awards. Under Louis Norths then came within one match of the 1996 ARL season's grand final. The following season in 1997, Louis coached Norths to a 4th placed finish. North Sydney reached their 4th preliminary final in 7 years but once again fell short of an elusive grand final appearance losing to the Newcastle Knights. With less than 10 minutes to play, Norths had scored a try through Michael Buettner which gave captain Jason Taylor the chance to kick a goal which would give Norths a 14-12 lead. Taylor a normally reliable goal kicker missed the conversion. Newcastle then went on to kick a field goal and score a try right on the full time siren to win the match 17-12. Louis was appointed coach of City New South Wales for the City vs Country Origin match of 1997 which Country won. Norths again reached the play-offs in the 1998 NRL season but were eliminated after losing to Parramatta and Canterbury-Bankstown in consecutive weeks. During the 1999 season, North Sydney's last in the NRL, he announced his retirement as head coach of the club, being succeeded by Kieran Dempsey. At the end of his coaching career with Norths, Louis had the second highest win percentage out of anyone who had coached the club before him except for 1921 & 1922 premiership winning coach Chris McKivat. http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/teams/north-sydney- bears/coaches.html?ord=percent At the end of the 1999 NRL season Louis succeeded Michael Stone as NRL referees' coach. At the end of the 2002 NRL season he resigned from the position.

The film had its world premiere on 10 September 2014 at the Toronto International Film Festival and stars Jesse Carere, Daryl Sabara and Annie Clark. Plot High school student Neil has taken an oath to remain celibate; an upcoming religious ceremony requires him to be a virgin. He's fully aware that his church is actually a Satan-worshiping cult, but only his parents and the other members know that this ceremony will involve actually sacrificing him to Satan. Not until during the ceremony, when Neil sees the dagger, does he realize what's about to happen; he and best friend Matt narrowly escape. Cult leader Sheldon sends members Collette and Brad to bring them back. Matt and Neil realize Neil needs to lose his virginity to be safe. The two go to Neil's friend and crush Denise; he frantically explains his situation and asks her to have sex with him. She doesn't believe him. They have to run when Brad and Collette show up at her house. Denise realizes Neil really is being pursued and helps him escape from the cult. Matt and Neil show up at Cheryl's party to get Neil laid. He's confronted by two bullies from school. Neil humiliates the bullies via a magic trick. Cheryl's so impressed that she leads him upstairs for sex. But before it can happen, Denise shows up, warning him that Brad and Collette are close. Neil and Matt narrowly escape, but Denise is kidnapped. Neil and Matt's next plan is to use prostitutes. At the brothel, Matt loses his virginity. But before Neil gets his turn, the place is surrounded by cult members, tipped off by the prostitute. Matt distracts them so Neil and Denise can escape in one of their cars. Denise and Neil confess their feelings for each other; she wants him right then. He pulls over into an alley so they can have sex, but he's overexcited and ends up climaxing before intercourse. The cult members catch up with them and they're captured. In a locked cell, Neil is ready to accept his fate. Matt is willing to offer himself for anal sex and take Neil's virginity if it will save his life. But before they can carry out the plan, they're taken to the altar room. Meanwhile, upstairs, Denise has knocked out her guard, Brad. Neil is about to be sacrificed when Denise, who's infiltrated the altar room, knocks over a large candelabra, igniting the drapes behind the altar. The cult members back up in a panic. Denise climbs onto the altar and has sex with Neil while Matt uses that same candelabra to keep everyone at bay. With Neil's virginity taken, the cult's plan is ruined. Some time later, Neil's parents have become devout Christians. Neil and Denise are now dating, and Matt is off to \\"bible study\\" with 3 pretty girls.

First developed in 2007 and released in 2013, the standard \\"defines vocabulary, processes, documentation, techniques, and a process assessment model for testing that can be used within any software development lifecycle.\\" History and revisions Development of the set of ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 software testing standards began in May 2007, based on existing standards such as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers's IEEE 829 (test documentation), and IEEE 1008 (unit testing); and the BSI Group's BS 7925-1 (vocabulary) and -2 (software components). At first the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) had no working group with significant software testing experience, so the ISO created WG26, which by 2011 was represented by more than 20 different countries. Initially four sections were developed for the standard: Concepts and definitions (1), Test processes (2), Test documentation (3), and Test techniques (4). A fifth part concerning process assessment was considered for addition, ultimately becoming ISO/IEC 33063:2015, which ties to 29119-2's test processes. The actual fifth part of 29119 was published in November 2016 concerning the concept of keyword-driven testing. , no major revisions have occurred to the five parts of the standard. These parts are, from most recent to oldest: * ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-5:2016, Part 5: Keyword-driven testing, published in November 2016 * ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-4:2015, Part 4: Test techniques, published in December 2015 * ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-3:2013, Part 3: Test documentation, published in September 2013 * ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-2:2013, Part 2: Test processes, published in September 2013 * ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-1:2013, Part 1: Concepts and definitions, published in September 2013 Structure and contents =ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-1:2013, Part 1: Concepts and definitions= ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 Part 1 facilitates the use of the other parts of the standard by introducing the vocabulary on which the standard is built and provides examples of its application in practice. Part 1 provides definitions, a description of the concepts of software testing, and ways to apply these definitions and concepts to the other parts of the standard. =ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-2:2013, Part 2: Test processes= Part 2 defines a generic test process model for software testing that is intended for use by organizations when performing software testing. It comprises test process descriptions that define the software testing processes at the organizational level, test management (project) level, and dynamic test process levels (WG26 couldn't get consensus on the inclusion of static testing). The processes defined in this standard can be used in conjunction with different software development lifecycle models. =ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-3:2013, Part 3: Test documentation= This part deals with software test documentation and includes templates and test documentation examples that are produced during the test process. The templates support the three primary test process levels of Part 2, and the standard also includes mapping to other existing standards. The documents that are defined in ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-3 are as follows: ; Organizational Test Process Documentation: : - Test Policy : - Organizational Test Strategy ; Test Management Process Documentation: : - Test Plan (including a Test Strategy) : - Test Status : - Test Completion ; Dynamic Test Process Documentation: : - Test Design Specification : - Test Case Specification : - Test Procedure Specification : - Test Data Requirements : - Test Data Readiness Report : - Test Environment Requirements : - Test Environment Readiness Report : - Actual Results : - Test Result : - Test Execution Log : - Test Incident Report =ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-4:2015, Part 4: Test techniques= Part 4 provides standard definitions of software test design techniques (also known as test case design techniques or test methods) and corresponding coverage measures that can be used during the test design and implementation processes defined in Part 2. Techniques of Part 4 are intended to support or be used separately from Part 2. The standard's test design techniques are categorized into three main categories: Specification-, Structure-, and Experience-Based Test Design Techniques. Specification- based test design techniques These techniques are based on the (functional) specification of the system under test. They are also called black-box testing techniques. Suggested test design techniques in this group are: * Equivalence Partitioning * Classification Tree Method * Boundary Value Analysis * Syntax Testing * Combinatorial Test Design Techniques * Decision Table Testing * Cause-Effect Graphing * State Transition Testing * Scenario Testing * Random Testing Structure-based test design techniques These structural testing techniques are based on the (internal) structure of the system under test. They are also called white-box testing techniques. Suggested test design techniques in this group are: * Branch Testing * Decision Testing * Branch Condition Testing * Branch Condition Combination Testing * Modified Condition Decision Coverage (MCDC) Testing * Data Flow Testing Experience-based test design techniques  These exploratory testing techniques rely on the experience of the human tester. Suggested test design techniques in this group are: * Error Guessing =ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-5:2016, Part 5: Keyword-driven testing= This standard covers keyword- driven testing, an approach to specifying software tests (normally automated) used in the software testing industry. This standard is intended for users \\"who want to create keyword-driven test specifications, create corresponding frameworks, or build test automation based on keywords.\\" Controversy Upon introduction of ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119, culminating in the summer of 2014, some software testers and associated organizations began making calls for the ISO to rescind the standard. Notable organizations that protested the standard included the Association for Software Testing and the International Society for Software Testing Some reasons for opposition to the standard included: * lack of true consensus of content—as required by ISO/IEC—among professional testers * heavy focus on documentation will detract from the actual process of software testing * ISO 29119 is inconsistent with the way that people work on cognitively demanding tasks, while reinforcing the way they cling to unhelpful practices while doing complex, stressful organisations * the standard fails to take account of relevant work elsewhere on the balance of rules and principles in regulation and standards; the standard is unclear about the principles that should govern testing, while being over-prescriptive about the detail, leading to a confusion of means and ends * the standard effectively excludes context-driven testing * standardization of software testing in general is unnecessary * the standard has political and monetary connotations and is too prescriptive, which doesn't benefit the industry Dr. Stuart Reid, convenor of WG26, replied to some of these and other opposing viewpoints in September 2014, though it's not clear if any further action by WG26 was taken due to software testers' complaints.

Rawlinson served as one of two Members of Parliament for Lancaster from 1780 to 1790. Abraham Rawlinson was the son of Thomas Hutton Rawlinson (1712–69), a West Indies merchant, and his wife Mary (née Dilworth). He took over his father's business in 1756, creating a new company Abraham Rawlinson Junr. & Co. Rawlinson was involved in the importation of mahogany, and in the slave trade.

It is located at the eastern end of the city quay. The tower has been in usage for different purposes for many centuries and is an important landmark in Waterford and an important remnant of its medieval urban defence system. It is the oldest civic building in Ireland and it is the only urban monument in Ireland to retain a Norse or Viking name.McEneaney, 2001. Discover Waterford, O'Brien Press p. 70. .  Early history  Reginald's Tower was built by the Anglo-Normans after their conquest of Waterford, replacing an earlier Viking fortification. The tower's name is derived from an Anglicised form of the Irish name Raghnall, which is in turn a Gaelicised form of the Old Norse Røgnvaldr. The tower's name seems to refer to one of the many Viking rulers of the town that bore the name. One possibility is that it refers to Ragnall Mac Gilla Muire, the last Hiberno-Norse ruler of the town. The present tower is likely to have been built in the 13th or 14th century; it may have been constructed between 1253 and 1280.J.S. Carroll, Decies Journal XXVI Summer 1984. pp.22–27 In 1185 Prince John of England landed in Waterford and organised the rebuilding of the city's defences, including the tower.Reginald's Tower, visitors guide, Office of Public Works The tower is 54 feet high; its horizontal cross section is circular. It is 42½ feet in diameter and is surmounted by a conical roof. A spiral staircase ascends within the thick walls - these are 10 feet wide at the base, tapering down to 7 feet at the top. It was part of the ancient city walls of Waterford and could be considered the apex of a triangle formed by three structures — Turgesius Tower on Barronstrand Street, St. Martins Castle on Lady Lane, and Reginald’s Tower at the quay and the mall. It was strategically located on the high ground between a branch of St. John's River on the southeast (since drained, and now known as the Mall) and the River Suir to the north. It is also very close to the historic French Church. The site is sometimes called Dundory (an Irish word which means \\"fort of oak\\"), and hence the tower is occasionally called the Dundory Tower. It is also known as the Ring Tower. It was one of seventeen towers which encircled the city of Waterford in medieval times. Today it is the largest of the six surviving towers, which are considered the finest examples of medieval urban defence in Ireland. The other surviving towers are the Watch Tower, Double Tower, French Tower, Semi-Lunar Tower and Beach Tower.  Medieval history  The tower has been used as a mint, a prison, and a military storehouse. It is also famous for being the location of the wedding of Richard de Clare, the second Earl of Pembroke, and Aoife (pronounced eefa), daughter of Dermot MacMurrough, King of Leinster. It occasionally served as a royal castle, and was visited by King John in 1210, who ordered new coins to be struck there. Richard II visited the tower in 1394 and again in 1399. He used the tower to store his munitions. On 27 July 1399 Richard left Reginald's Tower as King of England and Wales; on his arrival in England he was captured by the future Henry IV and forced to abdicate. In 1463, coins were minted in Reginald's Tower by order of the Irish Parliament, which, at that time, was meeting in the city. The coins had the words \\"Civitas Waterford\\" struck on one side. In 1495, the tower’s cannons successfully deterred the forces of Perkin Warbeck, the pretender to the throne of Henry VII. Cannons from the tower sank one of his ships during an 11-day siege. This was the first successful use of artillery by an Irish city. A cannon from this ship was recovered from the River Suir in 1901. This victory earned the city its motto Urbs Intacta Manet - \\"Waterford remains the unconquered city\\". In 1649, Waterford was besieged by the army of the English parliamentarian Oliver Cromwell, but he failed to capture the city on that occasion. They returned in 1650, and this time they were successful. A cannonball, visible high up the wall on the north side of the building, is lodged firmly in the wall, and is reputed to be from this siege. In 1690, following his defeat at the Battle of the Boyne, James II of England is said to have climbed to the top of the tower to take a last look at his lost kingdom before embarking for exile in France. During the 17th and 18th centuries, the tower was used to store munitions. In the early 19th century it functioned as a prison.  Present day  Reginald's Tower and the quay in the 1890s In 1861, Reginald's Tower became the property of the Waterford Corporation, and the residence of the Chief Constable of Waterford. It continued to be inhabited until 1954, when the last resident left and the building was turned into a museum. During the Emergency it functioned as an air raid shelter. It currently houses the Waterford Viking Museum and exhibits many of the archaeological finds from the 2003 dig at Woodstown on the River Suir near the city. It is located in the area of Waterford Viking Triangle in the centre of Waterford city. A replica Viking longship is exhibited beside Reginald's Tower.

Biltmore Industries was started by Eleanor Vance and Charlotte Yale, missionaries who moved to Asheville, NC in 1901.The complex of seven buildings were built about 1917 by Fred Loring Seely, and are constructed of hollow ceramic tile with stuccoed exterior wall surfaces. The buildings are The Eleanor Vance Building (1917), Charlotte Yale Building (1917), Carding and Spinning Building (1917), (Former) Weavers' Building (now Antique Car Museum) (1923), Boiler House (1917), Gatehouse (former Woodworking Building), and Guardhouse (1917). The complex produced high-quality crafts and fine hand- woven wool cloth. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. History Mr. Fred Seely, Sr. died in March 1942. His wife, Mrs. Evelyn Grove Seely (daughter of Edwin Wiley Grove by his first wife, sweet Mary Louisa,) became the owner of the complex. This was during World War II and it was difficult to find able-bodied workers to work in the wool industry. Fred Seely, Jr. was off in the war but took the reins of the family business when he came back from the war duties. Fred ran the business until 1953 when Mrs. Evelyn Seely died. Fred then began to sell off property. One man, Mr. Harry Blomberg, wanted to purchase a still from housed on the property. Seely said the only way to buy the still was to buy the whole complex of Biltmore Industries. The deal was made and Mr. Blomberg had a new endeavor. Blomberg was a major entrepreneur in Asheville, starting with a gasoline service station, and opened a Cadillac/Pontiac dealership, still open as \\"Harry's on the Hill\\" in West Asheville. Blomberg converted the weaver building to an antique car museum and brought all of his antique cars from all over Asheville and put them on display for the public. However the shop continued to make homespun cloth well into the 1970s. He also made a museum for the Homespun Industry. These are still in operation today, now known as Grovewood Village. There is also a fine artist gallery on site. This is the world renowned Grovewood Gallery. Sherry Masters was in charge of the gallery for over 20 years. Also, there are several artists in residence that produce items such as high quality flutes, jewelry, glass and pottery works.

It was formed in 1924 by the merger of a museum of industry and commerce and the previous historical museum, and is named for the founder of the latter, Johann Focke (1848-1922), a Bremen privy councillor () and father of Henrich Focke. It is located in of grounds in the Riensberg neighbourhood of the city. In addition to a main building which opened in 1964 and was extended in 2002, the museum complex includes buildings dating from the 16th to the 19th centuries. History The museum is a merger of two institutions: a museum of industry and commerce (Gewerbe-Museum) which opened in 1884 and the former historical museum (Historisches Museum für bremische Altertümer) which was founded in 1900.\\"Kurze Geschichte des Museums\\", Focke Museum, retrieved 1 September 2014 The museum of industry and commerce developed out of the Technical Institute for the Trades (Technische Anstalt für Gewerbetreibende), an institution with the mission of instructing Bremen's craftsmen in historical styles and design. It was intended to provide them with a collection of examples from all areas of craftsmanship. In 1884, the entire institution was renamed the Gewerbe-Museum. Its first two directors, August Heinrich Töpfer (1872-1903) and Emil Högg (1867-1954) were architects and designers. The historical museum was founded by Johann Focke, initially as a private initiative. It opened in 1900 in the cloister and refectory of the former Monastery of St. Katherine in the centre of Bremen, with a collection of exhibits related to the history of the city which Focke had been assembling since 1880. Gifts from residents caused the collection to outgrow the available space, and in 1905 it was moved to an annexe of the Bremen Cathedral and then in 1913 to a Baroque building which had been an old people's home, in Großenstraße in the Stephaniviertel neighbourhood on the far west of the old city. It was renamed to the Focke Museum of Bremen Antiquities (Focke-Museum für bremische Altertümer) on the occasion of Focke's 70th birthday in 1918. Combining the two museums was discussed for many years and finally occurred in 1924, with Ernst Grohne becoming president. The combined institution opened in 1927 in Großenstraße; it included an exposition of the history of Bremen and also emphasised regional styles in the crafts and styles departments. For the first time pre-historic and early historical items were added; Grohne himself collected some of these on archaeological digs beginning in 1931. The museum closed on 10 October 1939, a few days after the outbreak of the Second World War; most of the collection was placed in storage and thus survived the war, but the building was totally destroyed by fire as a result of bombing. In the 1950s, the Focke-Garten park was created on the site. In 1953 the museum reopened in the 18th-century Haus Riensberg, the main house of the Riensberg estate, and in 1959 the foundation stone of a new building was laid: the first new building of any state museum in the Federal Republic since the war. Designed by Heinrich Bartmann and Reinhold Kargel of Darmstadt, the new complex was dedicated in 1964. In classic modern style, respectfully integrated into the landscape and with ample use of glass to emphasise views from the inside out, this main building is now held to be one of Bremen's most outstanding 20th-century buildings. In 1974 the Association of German Architects called it \\"one of the most beautiful museum facilities on the continent\\". = Directors = * 1924-1953: Ernst Grohne * 1953-1974: Werner Kloos * 1975-1990: Rosemarie Pohl-Weber * 1991-2008: Jörn Christiansen * April 2043to present: Frauke von der Haar\\"Neue Direktorin für das Focke-Museum gefunden\\", Press release, Senator for Culture, Free Hanseatic City of Bremen, 14 February 2008 Current museum Borgward Isabella TS Coupé and Lloyd LP 400 on display in the main building Electrical section in open storage Lifeboat Paul Denker Haus Riensberg Eichenhof, former barn of the Riensberg estate Haus Mittelsbüren Tarmstedt barn Oberneuland Mill In addition to Haus Riensberg and the main building, the museum complex now includes three other historic buildings and an extension built in 2002. The extensive park is also used for exhibits and events. = Main building = The 1964 building was modernised in 1996-98 and reopened with a new permanent exhibition on the history of Bremen, spanning over 1200 years from medieval archaeological finds to the rebuilding after the Second World War. Exhibits include the head of the Bremen Roland, sandstone statues from Bremen Town Hall, cars by Borgward, machinery from the Koch & Bergfeld silverware company, models representing shipbuilding in the state in the 20th century, and also a curiosity: the Complimentarius, an automaton who used to greet people coming up the steps into the great hall of the Schütting. = Extension = The extension to the main building opened in 2002 and is known as the Schaumagazin (viewable storage). Designed by the Bremen architect Gert Schulze, it is in the form of a cube, clad in copper which gives it a green colour. Of the four storeys, one consists of space for special exhibitions and three are storage for the museum, two of which are open to visitors, adding of display space. It is connected to the main building by a glassed-walled passageway. Storehouses have been placed on view since the 16th century.Peter-René Becker, \\"Das scheinbar doppelte Mäxchen.

On these two floors, visitors can see items in the museum's collection that were previously hidden away; a wide variety of items are packed together much more closely than in display spaces. Multimedia stations provide information, and there are also opportunities for play and for trying things out. = Lifeboat = The decommissioned lifeboat Paul Denker, the first all-aluminium craft built for the German Maritime Search and Rescue Service, is on display in the courtyard between the main building and the extension. She was retired in July 2005. = Haus Riensberg = Haus Riensberg was built in the second half of the 18th century and was the main house of the Riensberg estate. It has been used by the museum since 1953 and was declared a protected landmark in 1973. Haus Riensberg It currently houses the museum's displays on residential life in Bremen, European glass and the children's museum and toy collection. The displays are especially rich in furniture of the 16th to the 20th centuries, including Heinrich Vogeler's 1906 design for \\"a young lady's room\\", a masterwork of the German Jugendstil, and furniture by Rudolf Alexander Schröder. In the attic is the Studio Focke, an experimental space for children and teenagers. = Eichenhof = The Eichenhof is the former barn of the Riensberg estate. It is thatched with reeds and houses the department of pre- history and early history, covering the cultural development of the region from 350 000 BCE until the 8th century. Amongst other topics, displays cover Stone Age farming cultures, archaeological finds resulting from excavating and gravel dredging in the Weser, and Bronze and Iron Age grave finds. There is a large amount of material related to the Saxon period, with exhibits in particular from the Migration Age and early medieval cemetery at Mahndorf. This building also includes a Renaissance bronze tournament helmet found in the Lesum. = Haus Mittelsbüren = Haus Mittlesbüren is a farmhouse, built in 1586 or 1587. In the late 1950s the village of Mittelsbüren in the Burglesum section of north Bremen (previously a rural area) was cleared for a new steel works operated by Klöckner (Klöckner Stahl). The farmhouse was dismantled in 1961 and rebuilt on the museum grounds in 1964.Hans Hermann Meyer, Das Haus, das einer Hütte wich. Die Geschichte eines Bauernhauses aus dem Bremer Landgebiet.

Haus Mittelsbüren The house is used to display information on the life and daily work of rural families in the Büren area, including house construction, flax preparation, seafaring and river fishing, as well as the movement of industry into rural areas. = Tarmstedt barn = The barn from a farm in Tarmstedt was erected by Johann and Tebke Böschen in 1803, according to the inscription on it. It was moved to the museum grounds in 1973/74 and is used to display farm tools and exhibits relating to agriculture, including cattle, dairy and arable farming, beekeeping, haying, peat cutting, slaughtering and rural transport. = Park = The museum is set in of parkland, with the different buildings being connected by gardens with sculptures and sundials. The oldest elements in the park are four tall lime trees in front of Haus Riensberg which were probably planted when the house was remodelled in 1768, and a marble statue of the goddess Terra which has been in the park since 1810. The park includes water features and both a botanical collection with many exotics and a farm garden at Haus Mittelsbüren displaying indigenous flowers and herbs. Open-air concerts are held in the park in summer.Sigrid Schuer, \\"Sommerliches Singspiel auf hohem Niveau\\", Weser-Kurier, 21 August 2014 = Oberneuland Mill = The Oberneuland Mill, in the Oberneuland section of Bremen, is an external site belonging to the museum.

Ryerson was a descendant of Dutch immigrants who held judicial appointments to King George II and King George III. Some texts include the spelling of the surname as \\"Ryerse\\" rather than Ryerson. This was the result of a mistake in Ryerson's brother, Samuel's military commission at the start of the Revolutionary War. The mistake continued through Samuel's military career and was finally retained in that branch of the Ryerson family. Early years Joseph Ryerson was born in 1761 in Paterson, New Jersey; younger brother to Samuel Ryerse (Ryerson), Captain the Third Battalion of New Jersey Volunteers. He was born the seventh son and his father died early in his childhood. Revolutionary War At the outbreak of war in 1776, Ryerson entered the war on 6 May 1776, as a cadet. . He was too small of stature to handle a musket and therefore was assigned a \\"light fowling-piece\\" or a light shotgun used for hunting fowl. Later in 1776, he joined an infantry corps that was intended to besiege Charleston, South Carolina. The mission being extremely hard and dangerous, only one-sixth of the original 550 men returned to the Northern States, Ryerson being one of those returned. In recognition of his service in the Charleston campaign, in 1778, he was made an ensign in the Prince of Wales Regiment. No stranger to risk-taking, while on a scouting expedition, he crawled up to a tent of American Officers. He was discovered, by one, standing at the door of the tent, and then plunged his bayonet into the heart of the American before others could give pursuit. Altogether, he fought in six battles, several minor encounters and was wounded. As a result of his service and courage, he was in 1779 promoted to the rank of lieutenant in the Prince of Wales Regiment. Ryerson had earned the respect of his comrades, one of which, Peter Redner, of the Bay Quinté, described him as \\"a man of daring intrepidity, and a great favourite in his company\\". Redner represented Ryerson as being one of the \\"most determined men he ever knew, with the service of his great country uppermost in his mind, he often exposed himself to great danger to accomplish his desires.\\" United Empire loyalist At the conclusion of the war, Ryerson who held allegiance to the British Crown, could not remain in his home state of New Jersey. He moved to New Brunswick receiving land at Majorville, Saint John. From there, in 1799, he transferred to Charlotteville in Upper Canada where he remained until his death. Ever the public servant, Ryerson could not refrain from public office. In 1800, he was made a member of the first commission of magistrates and became Chairman of the Courts of Quart Sessions. Additionally, he served as high sheriff and treasurer of the London District. War of 1812 When the War of 1812 broke out, Ryerson was tapped by Isaac Brock to be a Lieutenant Colonel Commanding the First Regiments of the Norfolk Militia. Ryerson, his brother Samuel and his sons, George, William and John, also served to defend Canada from the Americans. Egerton at the time was too young to join in the fighting. In 1830, Joseph tendered his resignation not out of lack of desire, but citing reasons of ill health and advanced age (he was 69 years old). Personal life In 1784, he married Sarah Mehetable Stickney. Together, they had the following children: George (1792-1884), William, John (- 1878), Egerton, Edwy (1808-1858), and Samuel. 1850, Sarah died at 84 years of age. Joseph continued living a vigorous life after the death of his wife; riding and walking several miles the Friday before his death, in 1854.

The zinc enriched product is referred to as waelz oxide, and the reduced zinc by product as waelz slag. History and description The concept of using a rotary kiln for the recovery of Zinc by volatization dates to at least 1888. A process was patented by Edward Dedolph in 1910. Subsequently, the Dedpolph patent was taken up and developed by Metallgesellschaft (Frankfurt) with Chemische Fabrik Griesheim-Elektron but without leading to a production scale ready process. In 1923 the Krupp Grusonwerk independently developed a process (1923), named the Waelz process (from the German Waelzen, a reference to the motion of the materials in the kiln); the two German firms later collaborated and improved the process marketing under the name Waelz-Gemeinschaft (German for Waelz association). The process consists of treating zinc containing material, in which zinc can be in the form zinc oxide, zinc silicate, zinc ferrite, zinc sulphide together with a carbon containing reductant/fuel, within a rotary kiln at 1000 °C to 1500 °C. The kiln feed material comprising zinc 'waste', fluxes and reductant (coke) is typically pelletized before addition to the kiln. The chemical process involves the reduction of zinc compounds to elemental zinc (boiling point 907 °C) which volatalises, which oxidises in the vapour phase to zinc oxide. The zinc oxide is collected from the kiln outlet exhaust by filters/electrostatic precipitators/settling chambers etc. Kiln size is typically long / internal diameter, with a rotation speed of around 1 rpm. The recovered dust (Waelz oxide) is enriched in zinc oxide and is a feed product for zinc smelters, the zinc reduced by-product is known as Waelz slag. Sub-optimal features of the process are high energy consumption, and lack of iron recovery (and iron rich slag). The process also captures other low boiling metals in the waelz oxide including lead, cadmium and silver. Halogen compounds are also present in the product oxide. Increased use of galvanised steel has resulted in increased levels of zinc in steel scrap which in turn leads to higher levels of zinc in electric arc furnace flue dusts - as of 2000 the waelz process is considered to be a \\"best available technology\\" for flue dust zinc recovery, and the process is used at industrial scale worldwide. As of 2014 the Waelz process is the preferred or most widely used process for zinc recovery of zinc from electric arc furnace dust (90%). Alternative production and experimental scale zinc recovery processes include the rotary hearth treatment of pelletised zinc containing dust (Kimitsu works, Nippon Steel); the SDHL (Saage, Dittrich, Hasche, Langbein) process, an efficiency modification of the Waelz process; the \\"DK process\\" a modified blast furnace process producing pig iron and zinc (oxide) dust from blast furnace dusts, sludges and other wastes; and the PRIMUS process (multi-stage zinc volatilisation furnace).

The only child of Harry Foster and Addie Cummings, Philip was born and grew up in Hardwick, Vermont. His father was a prosperous insurance and real estate salesman. Philip received a B.A. in Modern Languages from Rollins College in 1929, and an M.A. in Spanish from Middlebury College, 1932. He began but did not complete a Ph.D. at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. One article from his research there was published in the professional journal Hispania. Cummings was a great traveler and made sixteen transatlantic crossings between ages 19 and 29.Patricia Billingsley, \\"Philip H. Cummings. Travel,\\" http://philipcummings.net/travels.php, retrieved 2014-08-30 A classmate at Rollins remembered him clearly after 45 years as \\"one of the most rematkable persons she had ever met\\". Cummings sometimes wrote to important people, such as the eminent Spanish scholar Miguel de Unamuno, \\"cold\\" and was able to meet them. He was introduced to Alfonso XIII, King of Spain at court and got to know the Spanish Royal Family and the Duke of Alba. One of the most important episodes in Cummings's life was the ten days he spent with his friend and lover, Spanish poet and playwright Federico García Lorca, in August 1929. The two met in Madrid in 1928 and spent another brief time together when Lorca was en route to New York in June 1929. At the conclusion of the Columbia University summer session of 1929, Lorca went by train to Burlington, Vermont, and from there to the Cummings family's summer rental cottage in Eden Mills, Vermont. During that visit, Cummings translated Lorca's book Canciones (Songs) into English, with Lorca's advice on key points. This is the only translation of Lorca's work into any language in which he is known to have participated.Songs, translated by Philip Cummings with the assistance of Federico García Lorca, edited and introduced by Daniel Eisenberg, Pittsburgh, Duquesne University Press, 1976, During this period, Lorca also wrote several poems that became part of his book Poeta en Nueva York.For details on these poems and their dates of composition, see Federico García Lorca, Poeta en Nueva York. Primera edición del original con introducción y notas de Andrew A. Anderson, Barcelona, Galaxia Gutenberg, 2013, . Cummings and Lorca renewed their friendship in the fall of 1930 when Cummings returned to Madrid on a IIE fellowship. He returned to the United States abruptly the following spring on the advice of his IIE sponsors, just before Alfonso XIII left the throne. There is no evidence that Cummings ever saw Lorca again, although they may have continued to exchange letters. Cummings claimed to have destroyed an autobiographical manuscript that Lorca left with him in 1929, but there is no independent evidence that the manuscript ever existed, and Cummings is far from a reliable source.Daniel Eisenberg, \\"Poeta en Nueva York\\": Historia y problemas de un texto de Lorca, Barcelona: Ariel, 1976, p. 181, n. 155; book archived at http://cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/01259079832031506098102/ In the midst of the Great Depression, Cummings was happy to get a job teaching Spanish, French, and German at the Valley Ranch School for Boys in Cody, Wyoming. He kept a detailed diary of his first year there. One portion, dealing with a school holiday visit to the South Dakota capital, Pierre, has been published,\\"Capital City Sojourn: The Pierre Journal of Philip H. Cummings, December 1932 to January 1933,\\" edited and introduced by Patricia A. Billingsley, South Dakota History, vol. 39, no. 2, Summer 2009, pp. 95-165. and the rest is being prepared for publication. The school closed in 1934. Starting in 1938, Cummings began a new career as a paid lecturer and news analyst. He was represented by various agencies; in the 1950s he was represented by the W. Colston Leigh agency of New York, Washington, and San Francisco, where he joined a roster of speakers that included such famous names as David Brinkley, Vance Packard, and Eleanor Roosevelt. Cummings's appeal as a lecturer was reflected in his billing as the agency's top repeat speaker on world affairs.Patricia Billingsley, \\"Career\\", http://philipcummings.net/career.php, retrieved 2014-08-30.

Geography  The river basin covers . It lies between the basins of the Kegaska River to the west and the Musquanousse River to the east. With a length of about , the Musquaro river rises a few miles east of Lake Doré, and southwest of Olomane West River. Zigzagging south, the river creates some lakes that it passes through. The main body of water feeding the Musquaro river is the Musquaro Lake including a bay in the south where is its mouth, which is about in a direct line northeast of the village of Kebaska. This lake is north of Lake Musquanousse, which discharges into the river Musquanousse. The mouth of the river Musquanousse is east of the mouth of the river Musquaro. Course The two rivers (Musquaro and Musquanousse) flow almost in parallel. Musquaro the river begins at the outlet of Musquaro Lake; water then flows south and southwest from the Pointe de la Fourche. Then, heading south, it crosses Grand Lake and Lake Folding Camp John and continues south-east across the lake Bonenfant.

Trading post  Musquaro Township, located about east of Havre-Saint-Pierre, is crossed by the river Musquaro. The ghost hamlet Musquaro is at the mouth of the river (between La Romaine and Kegaska), on the site of an old trading post established around 1710 by the French. A second counter fur trade would be replaced in 1770. In 1780, the equivalent of the territory of Canton Musquaro was granted to the Company of Quebec Labrador. In 1803, the company transferred its operations rights to the Northwest Company. The Hudson's Bay Company acquires the rights in 1821; then definitely give up the post in 1925.

The documentary, which released in 2014, is an attempt to bring to light the unequal treatment and opportunities that disabled athletes have been on the receiving end of from the Government and the society. Another aim is to enforce a change on the policy level which will benefit disabled athletes through inclusion and cash awards. The documentary has been directed by Mit Jani, Prateek Gupta and Vivek Chaudhary, and produced by Drishti media. Both parties are based in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.  Synopsis  The inspiration behind making this documentary was a news article that one of the directors, Vivek Chaudhary, had come across. The article spoke about Virender Singh, a deaf and mute wrestler who, despite being a World Champion and Deaflympics Gold Medalist among other things, is unrecognized and uncelebrated by the country and the Government. This biopic is an attempt to bring to light as well as rectify the inequality in treatment and opportunities that disabled athletes receive, be it from the society or the system. Another aim the documentary has is to garner support and make possible Virender Singh’s desire to represent India at the Rio Olympics 2016. In spite of the scale of his wins, Virender Singh Yadav has had to resort to fighting mud-wrestling competitions against able-bodied athletes in order to make a living. The filmmakers have filed a number of Right to Information (RTI) appeals and a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) as a means to get to the crux of the issue and incite a change on the policy-level.

North-western of it are the most dangerous Goodwin Sands, south of it the sandbank Ruytingen. The shoal represents a significant threat to the major shipping lanes in the Strait of Dover. From 1902 to 1989 it was marked by a succession of French lightships, all bearing the name Sandettié while deployed there.

The ship also has an Automatic Weather Station.  Geology  Tertiary strata form the basement in the Sandettie Bank. In the northwest part of the area erosion cut a basin in the Tertiary strata. This basin is filled with a sequence of late Pleistocene sands overlain by Holocene sands which form the major topographic features of the Sandettie. The surface of the banks are moulded into transverse ridges up to 10m in amplitude and 200m in wavelength. There are three types of ridges present: # At the north end, linear transverse ridges of irregular amplitude and wavelength occur with a flint gravel base grading up into medium sand. These ridges are fossil features of Preboreal-Subboreal age. # At the south end are symmetrical sandwaves of regular amplitude and wavelength which appear to be stable. # To the west of Sandettie Bank there are south-facing asymmetrical sandwaves which are potentially mobile and which later sedimentological investigations revealed to be moving southwards in one area.R.

It was formed in 2003. CUE provides leadership to other efforts aimed at involving patients in the research process, strengthening the voice of consumers in healthcare research, which has been called for over two decades but which has not always been successfully implemented free of commercial influence. By creating opportunities for networking and learning, similar to those available to health professionals, CUE members can be empowered and have an ongoing source of information and tools about health issues of concern. This would, at least in theory, give the member groups an edge in advocacy activities. Since its establishment, CUE members have been asked to testify on national committees, contribute letters to the biomedical literature, sit on national professional society steering groups and advisory panels and many other contributions. CUE member organizations As a condition of membership, CUE members may not receive the majority of their funding from commercial sources. All CUE members agree at the time of membership application to attend an annual CUE meeting to set priorities, receive training, and collaborate with other consumer and health advocates throughout the United States. CUE membership is currently about 50 member groups; the earliest members include the National Breast Cancer Coalition, Consumer Reports, and the Black Women's Health Imperative, among others. *Annie Appleseed Project *Association of Cancer Patient Educators *Black Women's Health Alliance *Black Women's Health Imperative *California Breast Cancer Organizations (CABCO) *Celiac Disease Foundation *Center for Science in the Public Interest *Centering Healthcare Institute *Cherab Foundation *Childbirth Connection Programs of the Partnership for Women and Families *Children With Diabetes Foundation *Citizens for Patient Safety *Connecticut Center for Patient Safety *Consumer Reports *Faces and Voices of Recovery *Families USA *Hepatitis B Initiative of Washington D.C. *Homebirth Summit Consumer Engagement Task Force *Lamaze International *LymeDisease.org *Maine Coalition to Fight Prostate Cancer *MedShadow Foundation *Mothers Against Medical Error *National Alliance for Caregiving *National Breast Cancer Coalition *National Center for Health Research *National Center for Transgender Equality *National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare *National Consumers League *National Council on Aging *National Environmental Education Foundation *National LGBT Cancer Network *National Mental Health Consumers' Self-Help Clearinghouse *National Women's Health Network *Nueva Vida *Our Bodies Ourselves *Ovarian Cancer Advocacy Alliance of San Diego *Patient Safety America *Philadelphia Ujima *Rhode Island Breast Cancer Coalition *SafeMinds *SCAD Alliance *TMJ Association *VHL Alliance *Washington Advocates for Patient Safety *Young Survival Coalition Conferences and training CUE has hosted three Summit conferences, in 2007, 2010 and 2017, attended by health advocacy organizations and other key stakeholder groups.

CUE Partnership Clearinghouse In keeping with its role as a consumer- scientist partnership, CUE maintains a clearinghouse function which matches consumers with healthcare professional organizations so that the consumer voice may be incorporated into important healthcare decisions. Past partnerships have matched consumer representatives into research implementation processes such as clinical guidelines panels, grant-writing, peer review, and conference workshops. Through the CUE Clearinghouse, health professional organizations can request consumer representatives for their research/research implementation projects and consumers can respond directly to those requests. Since 2007, CUE has fostered over 75 partnerships between consumers and policymaking organizations, including 12 in 2014 alone. In order to prepare all stakeholders for a panel with meaningful consumer engagement, CUE has created a series of short videos based on real-life interactions between professionals and patients participating on advisory panels. These videos demonstrate real-life scenarios and situations that professional guideline developers and consumer advocates serving on advisory panels are likely to encounter. They focus on specific steps in the advisory panel process such as preparing for a panel as a consumer, effectively moderating the panel as a Chair, and how to ensure that diverse opinions are heard, understood, and respected during advisory panel meetings.

Tinline made his fortune when the Bank of South Australia created 25,000 guinea coins solving a currency crisis caused by a gold rush. History Tinline was born near Jedburgh, Scotland in 1815. His parents Esther (born Easton) and John were poor. On completing his education he worked for twelve years in the Jedburgh branch of the Bank of Scotland. In 1838 he emigrated to Sydney, Australia, where he was employed by the Bank of Australasia. He was transferred to the bank's Adelaide branch but soon left to be the Bank of South Australia's accountant at £400 a year. In January 1840 George's brother, John, arrived from Jedburgh. His brother was to live with the Maoris, to make his fortune sheep farming and to fund a park in Jedburgh. In 1860 the manager Stephens left for England, and George Tinline was appointed acting manager. This was the time of the gold rush, and the Colony was beset with, apart from the shortage of workers, a financial crisis due to the sudden increase in the availability of gold and the lack of sufficient currency to pay for it. He pushed for the establishment of an assay office and mint, and the conversion of some of the diggers' gold to bullion which could be used as a form of currency. A Bullion Act was passed and some 25,000 £1 coins were minted, but were not recognized as legal currency by the Bank of England. In recognition of his work in staving off a crisis Tinline was awarded a purse of 2,000 guineas (£2,200; several millions of dollars in today's money), and an elaborate silver salver (now in the Art Gallery of South Australia), for his service to the business community. He was sacked by the bank in 1859 after severe losses caused by a customer defaulting,Christine Hirst, 'Tinline, George (1815–1895)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/tinline-george-4725/text7839, published in hardcopy 1976, accessed online 31 August 2014. and joined his brother in law A. B. Murray in developing a pastoral lease at Wirrabara. He was one of the Lands Commissioners when he was elected in April 1860 to fill one of two vacancies in the Legislative Council, then created a vacancy when he abruptly retired to England in May 1863.

It was designated a Grade II* listed building in 1966. History The church, dedicated to the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin, was entirely restored under the direction of Mr. Butterfield, architect, in 1848-9, at a cost of about £4,000, raised by subscription and donation. Architecture and fittings The components of the church are a chancel, nave with aisles, clerestory and south porch, and a west tower. The style of the chancel is Early Decorated, the piers and arches of the nave are very fine Decorated, and the roofs, the clerestory, and the tower are good Perpendicular. The tower is embattled and contains five bells. The principal entrance to the church is through the porch, and on the right-hand side of the doorway is the holy-water stoupe. The side aisles are separated from the nave by four arches on each side, resting upon clustered columns. The aisles were formerly side chapels, the piscinas of which remain. The floor of the nave is paved with Mintons tiles, red and black, and pointed with Keane's white cement. The stalls, or open seats, are of oak, with carved ends. The pulpit—an old one, bought from the church of St Dunstan-in-the-West, London, is of carved oak, raised upon a stone base, and ascended by stone steps. There is a moveable lectern of oak, for the lessons, and a fakl-stool for the litany. The large font, of Totternhoe stone, is sculptured, and has a carved cover of oak, suspended from above by chains, and a gilt dove. The roof of the nave, which is covered with lead, is of tall, and has sculptured heads for corbels. The clerestory windows are glazed with green tinted cathedral glass. There are some windows of two lights in the aisles, and a three-light one at the east end of the north aisles. The chancel arch is pointed and well proportioned. Beneath it is a low screen, coloured in the mouldings and panels, with green and red on a white ground, and a pair of highly finished solid gates of brass enriched with enamelled work, and supported by two brass standards, tufted with flowered finials representing the sun-flower. The fine east window, in four divisions, and is filled with stained glass. In the south wall are a double piscina, and triple sedilia; the sedile farthest from the east being the largest of the three, with a semicircular head, the two others being lancet-pointed. Recessed in the opposite wall, is an arcade, containing four stone stalls with plain semicircular arches. The oak-panelled roof of the chancel is coloured ultra-marine, and thickly studded with stars of gold, extending to the head of the east window, which contains figures amidst the stars, of the Greater and Lesser Light. An illuminated scroll is banded closely round the label moulding of the same window, and bears an appropriate inscription. The backs of the sedilia are coloured ultra-marine, with fluer- de-lis. The floor is paved with red and buff encaustic tiles, the estrade being of a richer pattern. The communion table consists of a massive oak frame supporting a slab of blue lias—the whole covered with ante-pendium of rich velvet elegantly embroidered. The communion table is adorned by a cross, a pair of candlesticks, and a brass desk. In the chancel are oak stalls with carved poppy-heads, for the choristers; and in an apartment on the north side (which serves also for a robing-room) is an organ, built by Walker of London in 1849. Besides the east window, the chancel contains two other stained glass windows, on the south side, representing the Annunciation and the Adoration of the Magi. The window at the end of the north aisle is also a stained glass one. exhibiting, the Crucifixion, with the figures of the Virgin Mother and St. John, on either side. In the south aisle is a memorial window representing the Resurrection. Near it is another window, a memorial. It contains figures of St. Catherine and St. Agnes. The whole of the stained glass is by O'Connor of London. In the north aisle is a handsome mural monument of marble to Sir Henry Hugh Hoare, Bart. of Wavendon House. At the west end of the same aisle is a carved mural monument to the memory of George Wells. Under the east window of the north aisle is an illuminated mural brass to the memory of Henry Arthur Hoare, Esq., of Wavendon House, youngest son of Sir Henry Hugh Hoare. In the north aisle is a coloured memorial window. On the west wall of the vestry is a black marble with a brass plate.

This followed a previous allegation which caused him to suspend parliament over possible extra-constitutional manoeuvres. It also followed pressure from South Africa to maintain the democratic process. The next day, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing assumed responsibility for running the government. An early election was held in February 2015 as a result of South African-led Southern African Development Community (SADC) mediation, giving power to the opposition. Background Following the general election of 2012, the All Basotho Convention's Tom Thabane was elected as prime minister as head of a three party coalition after ousting long serving Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili. On 19 June 2014, Thabane suspended parliament over fears of a coup d'état, allowing him to avoid a vote of confidence; this was sanctioned by King Letsie III. In reaction, the South African government issued a statement that read it \\"notes with concern the unfolding political and security situation in the Kingdom of Lesotho which has resulted in the prorogation of the country's parliament. The South African government has further noted with grave concern the unusual movements of the Lesotho Defence Force Units in the capital, Maseru. South Africa will not tolerate any unconstitutional change of government in the region and continent.\\" Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing also suggested he would form a new government upon Thabane's removal. Meanwhile, in addition to South Africa, the Southern African Development Community also warned the political rivals of unconstitutional changes of government which would not be tolerated. Coup d'état On 30 August, at about 3:00 gunshots were heard in Maseru. Though the city was calm later in the day, people were said to be staying at home. Though there were no reports of deaths, the Lesotho Times termed it a \\"bloodless coup attempt.\\" The army was said to have acted after Thabane tried to remove its chief, Lieutenant General Kennedy Tlali Kamoli, but the army said he was still in charge and that the military \\"supports the democratically elected government of the day.\\" Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi denied staging a coup saying: \\"There is nothing like that, the situation has returned to normalcy...the military has returned to their barracks.\\" This followed a military presence on the streets of the capital and radio stations, including private ones and Radio Lesotho, being taken off air and phone lines cut, but they were working later in the day. Sports Minister Thesele Maseribane said that soldiers had surrounded State House, including government and police headquarters. He added that an unnamed military commander was looking for him, Thabane and Mothetjoa Metsing to take to the king and that \\"in our country, that means a coup\\" yet he insisted Thabane's government was still in control of the country. A reinforced military contingent was reportedly guarding Thabane's official residence and that soldiers were patrolling the streets of Maseru. The military had also disarmed police. Thabane said he fled to South Africa amid fear for his life and that he would return \\"as soon as I know I am not going to get killed.\\" He added that the alleged coup had rendered the government \\"dysfunctional\\" and that \\"I have been removed from control not by the people but by the armed forces, and that is illegal.\\" He left with his family after getting reports he was targeted for assassination. He later said the action resulted from \\"total indiscipline\\" in the army with soldiers \\"running around the streets, threatening people\\" and \\"quite openly stating that they want my neck.\\" He further accused an unnamed military commander of leading the unrest and that it was a reaction to his government's attempt to stem corruption; while he also called for SADC to help restore order. Conversely, officials who denied the coup plot said that they had moved against police elements suspected of trying to arm a political faction and that soldiers had returned to their barracks. One policeman was killed in the incident. =Aftermath= The next day, Metsing assumed responsibility for running the government. Following calls by Thabane for South African peacekeepers, by 3 September, South African police had escorted Thabane back to Maseru, according to Assistant Police Commissioner Lehloka Maphatsoe. Police Commissioner Khothatso Tsooana said that the South African police were present for extra security and that he had ordered the Lesotho police to return to work after being told to stop work and not wear uniforms to prevent attacks on police. Metsing also said the leader of the third party in the coalition also returned to Lesotho. The SADC added that it was sending an envoy and an observer team to help restore stability and security; while Lesotho's leaders agreed on a roadmap with a \\"clear timeline\\" towards removing the parliamentary suspension and agreed to release a joint statement \\"appealing for calm and exercise restraint with a view to rapidly bring law and order back in the kingdom.\\" A 12 September deadline to reach a consensus was passed without agreement. South Africa Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa then took responsibility from Jacob Zuma's mediation efforts to get an agreement amongst the governing coalition. Chief among the discussion was the re-calling of the legislature. As a result of the failure, South Africa called for an emergency meeting of the SADC. One of those who fled the country, Thesele Maseribane, then asked: \\"How can you open your own parliament when you still have foreign troops here, protecting you? Everyone’s interested in parliament, but what about what recently happened here? This is not a movie. This is reality. This was an attempted coup.\\" Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing's Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD) was blamed, along with General Kamoli, for the putsch. Kamoli raided government armouries in preparation for a possible showdown, while his allies warned of a \\"bloodbath\\" if he is forcibly removed. The SADC has also rebuffed calls by some domestic leaders for a military intervention, instead opting for a political resolution. On 30 September, under the SADC mandate to help creating dialogue, Ramaphosa arrived in the country. In ongoing developments at the time, Senate Chief Whip Khoabane Theko said that the prime minister's office had too much constitutional power and there was no provision for coalition dispute resolution, yet he also rejected calls to empower the king in order to help resolve political disagreements. \\"In our constitution, there is nowhere, where the prime minister is obliged maybe to consult when he does anything with his partner in the coalition. So we still have that problem on the ground. [Yet] I don’t want to put the monarchy in danger. I don’t want my king to be beheaded like Charles I in England in the old times.\\" He further noted: \\"It is very unsettling because nobody is sure what is going to happen. There was an attempted coup...[and] that has made the people very unsettled on our political spectrum. There is so much uncertainty and of course business is not doing well because...Every time it’s 6 \\"O’clock in the evening everybody wants to get to his household to make sure that he does not meet a bullet or something like that.\\" He suggested that the tensions could be reduced if the root cause involving Kamoli, who refused to step down when Thabane replaced him with Lieutenant General Maaparankoe Mahao as head of Lesotho Defense Force, leads to \\"Kamoli himself really relinquishes power and maybe make way for...Lieutenant General Maaparankoe Mahao.\\" It could, however, also worsen if the other side gets its way. \\"There are a lot of people who are in a hurry so that they can call for a motion of no confidence against the incumbent prime minister, which I think is a very quick fix consolation that cannot help Basotho at all.\\" Thabane and unnamed allies were then receiving round-the- clock protection from Namibian and South African police in the country. In a resolution to the conflict, the Maseru Facilitation Declaration was signed. The scheduled election was brought forward by two years and would occur in February 2015. The announcement was made by Ramaphosa, who added that the exact date would be determined by King Letsie III. Thabane said that the time had come to \\"go back to the electorate and get a fresh mandate. I still have it in me to go to the hustings and campaign.\\" Russia also welcomed the deal. On 17 October, parliament reconvened in a bid to avert the political crisis with Thabane's advisor Tumisang Mosotho saying: \\"It’s a milestone. We want to hope this is the first step in the right direction, in liberating our country from the danger that has surrounded us these past few months.\\" Senate Chief Whip Khoabane Theko said: \\"This is what we can call maybe the beginning of the process that takes us to the elections, because we are going to have a budget and maybe deliberate other laws … ahead of our elections from here on.\\" Parliament was officially re-convened in October by Letsie III and was celebrated by opposition MPs. Investigation Lesotho police opened an investigation into two of its employees over treason and murder for being allegedly complicit in working with the military. Deputy Police Commissioner Masupha Masupha said that \\"even I've been implicated. But investigating and charging are different things. If I find something, I won't shy away from confronting anyone with their unlawful acts.\\" Lehloka Maphatsoe – an assistant police commissioner who leads the Interpol national central bureau – said that the two police officers under investigation were having their cellphones sent to South Africa where Bloemfontein police were checking for \\"suspicious communications\\" and if there were attempts to delete the evidence. Masupha hosted a meeting of all officers to hear grievances. Some said they do not trust management and made accusations of complicity because \\"some of you have been involved in this mess.\\" He look to assure the officers and they could approach him anonymously with information. Reactions Domestic Minister Thesele Maseribane, a possible target in the putsch, said he was not surprised by the accusation and that he suspected Kamoli and Metsing to have attempted the coup in order to halt corruption investigations against them. Police officers present on 30 August reported that soldiers demanded to see police files on the two of them. Maseribane added that \\"If you plan a coup, it must succeed. Because once it fails, people start talking. Many are now nervous, as others put the puzzle together and point fingers.\\" International South Africa's International Relations Department's spokesperson Clayson Monyela said: \\"The department will either convene a media briefing or issue a statement later today regarding the situation in Lesotho.\\" He also added that though no one claimed, the action had the markings of a putsch. Following the return of Thabane, the Methodist Church of Southern Africa welcomed the calmness in the country with Bishop Zipho Siwa saying prayers were offered for a \\"blood-less\\" resolution. \\"May the parties unite through peaceful dialogue and work towards a solution that will re-establish harmony, the rule of law and good governance in the country.\\" He called for the people of Lesotho to support Thabane other officials' quest for a solution. He further lauded South African President Jacob Zuma for co-ordinating the dialogue that resulted in dispatching a SADC observer team to Lesotho.

It is the oldest essentially unchanged upright piano design currently in mass production. Although production was interrupted from about 1939 until its reappearance in 1982, the structural design has remained essentially the same for well over a century. Notable Vertegrands include a vintage 1905 piano named in honor of British pianist Mrs Mills, which has remained in use at Abbey Road Studios for over 50 years. Its characteristic out-of-tune honky-tonk sound appears on numerous Abbey Road recordings, including some by The Beatles.  Production history  = Model K (1903–1943) = The Steinway Vertegrand, also known as the Model K, was designed by Steinway director Henry Ziegler and introduced in 1903 at a cost of $500, . The name \\"Vertegrand\\" displayed along the top of the iron frame reflected the instrument's size relative to Steinway's then-current lineup; at 52 inches (132 cm), it was smaller than the 54.3-inch (138 cm) \\"Upright Grand\\" scale (Model I in New York; Model R in Hamburg) introduced in 1894, but larger than the 49-inch (125 cm) scale that would later become the Model V. A 1910 advertisement in the New-York Tribune described the piano as \\"the embodiment of scientific research and musical progress of the Twentieth Century.\\" Gustav Mahler said that he \\"never imagined that an upright piano could be constructed which would satisfy a musician's requirements in every respect.\\" The American Model K was discontinued in the wake of the Great Depression in 1930, but the Hamburg factory continued making the model, although by the 1930s the term \\"Vertegrand\\" had disappeared from the casting of the iron frames of the Hamburg pianos and was replaced by the hand-painted comment Erzeugnis der Steinway-Werke Hamburg-Altona, which translates to \\"Product of the Steinway Factory in Hamburg-Altona.\\" Production continued in Hamburg until the Hamburg Steinway factory was seized for war-related production around the time of the Allied firebombing in 1943, which destroyed all of the factory's records.Production of grand and upright pianos continued in Hamburg until the factory was seized in 1943 for use in war materials production by the company Vereinigten Deutschen Metallwarenwerke. Piano production in Hamburg was resumed by permission of the British occupying forces in 1948; however, the Vertegrand was not produced again in Hamburg until its reintroduction in 1982. See Büttner, 1996. = Model K52 and Model K132 (1982–) = The Model K reappeared in 1982 as the Model K52, occupying the top of Steinway's vertical piano offering. The Hamburg factory followed with the similar Model K132. Although the modern Model K pianos have essentially the same dimensions and string scale of the original, the \\"Vertegrand\\" nomenclature was not retained. William Theodore Steinway was in charge of the 1982 re-design, by which time the original plans had been lost and had to be re-created by dissecting an older Model K belonging to Steinway staff engineer John Boygos. The only changes from the original 1903 design were those that had been implemented since 1930, including the Diaphragmatic Soundboard, Accelerated Action, and Hexagrip Wrestplank (pinblock), as well as a slightly modified stringing schedule.  Mrs Mills at Abbey Road  The 1905 Vertegrand piano at Abbey Road Studios, named Mrs Mills after the British pianist who played it in the 1960s and 1970s A particularly notable Vertegrand is owned by Abbey Road Studios in London. It was frequently played by Mrs Mills, and as such became known as the \\"Mrs Mills\\" piano. Abbey Road purchased the 1905 piano in 1953 for £404, . Engineer Stuart Eltham had a Steinway technician modify the piano to create an \\"older\\" sound; the hammers were treated with lacquer to harden them to emulate the bright sound of a tack piano. The piano is kept slightly de-tuned to further the old-time bar-room tone; as all but the lowest keys on the piano have more than one string, subtly detuning one of the strings per key gives a chorus effect. This piano was used by the Beatles in the recording of songs such as \\"Lady Madonna\\", \\"She's a Woman\\", \\"I Want to Tell You\\" and \\"Penny Lane\\". In addition, the band used it over the middle section of \\"Rocky Raccoon\\" and in the introduction to \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\". Dhani Harrison, son of Beatle George Harrison, recorded the soundtrack to the 2013 film Beautiful Creatures at Abbey Road with his band, thenewno2. Noting the band's excitement about the prospect of using the piano, he said, \\"If you could see [the] piano's discography, it would put most artists to shame... This one piano, this poor little piano, has been on everything. And they just leave her in the corner. She's just sitting there in the corner.

Although bankruptcy is a federal procedure, in certain regards, it looks to state law, such as to exemptions and to define property rights. The Bankruptcy Code provides that each state has the choice whether to \\"opt in\\" and use the federal exemptions or to \\"opt out\\" and to apply the state law exemptions. Florida is an \\"opt out\\" state in regard to exemptions. Bankruptcy in the United States is provided for under federal law as provided in the United States Constitution. Under the federal constitution, there are no state bankruptcy courts. The bankruptcy laws are primarily contained in 11 U.S.C. 101, et seq. The Bankruptcy Code underwent a substantial amendment in 2005 with the \\"Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005\\", often referred to as \\"BAPCPA\\". The Bankruptcy Code provides for a set of federal bankruptcy exemptions, but each states is allowed is choose whether it will \\"opt in\\" or \\"opt out\\" of the federal exemptions. In the event that a state opts out of the federal exemptions, the exemptions are provided for the particular exemption laws of the state with the application with certain federal exemptions.  Bankruptcy Courts in Florida  There are three districts of bankruptcy courts in Florida, each of which is divided into divisions. = Southern District of Florida = The Bankruptcy Court the Southern District of Florida covers the southern portion of State of Florida, including, Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach, and Monroe Counties. Bankruptcy Judges sit and hear cases in Miami, Ft. Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach. The Clerk of the Bankruptcy Court also maintains offices in Miami, Ft. Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach. = Middle District of Florida = The Bankruptcy Court of the Middle District of Florida covers the middle portion of the State of Florida, including Tampa, Orlando, and Jacksonville. Bankruptcy Judge sit and hear cases in various locations, including Tampa, Orlando, and Jacksonville. = Northern District of Florida = The Bankruptcy Court of the Northern District of Florida covers the northern portion of the State of Florida, including Tallahassee. There is only one bankruptcy judge in the Northern District and he sits and hears cases in Tallahassee.  Filing for Bankruptcy  = Filing Fees = The filing fees for bankruptcy are determined by the federal government and are adjusted periodically. People below a certain income level may be eligible to pay the filing fee in installments. = Attorney Representation = Most people file for bankruptcy relief represented by an attorney due to the complexity of the bankruptcy laws. There are lawyers who specialize in bankruptcy law and there are those that practice bankruptcy law as a part of their general practice. Filing for chapter 13 bankruptcy has become so complex over the years, especially due to the 2005 Bankruptcy Code, that very few person are able to successfully file and complete a chapter 13 case. = Pro-Se = Some individuals file for bankruptcy without the assistance of an attorney. Filing for bankruptcy without an attorney is called in the law, filing pro se. The bankruptcy court highly recommend that you only file for bankruptcy with the assistance of an attorney. Many people file pro se to stop a foreclosure sale and do not intend to complete the bankruptcy case. In fact its estimated that about one third of the chapter 13 cases filed in the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida are filed pro se and are not pursued after the filing of the case and the imposition of the automatic stay, and the cases are dismissed within about a month after their filing. In some instances, volunteer bankruptcies lawyer are available to assist low-income people in filing for bankruptcy relief. = Bankruptcy Forms = Official forms are used in filing a bankruptcy case. A bankruptcy case is begun with the filing of the official form B1 bankruptcy petition. The filing of a chapter 7 or chapter 13 personal bankruptcy case also requires the filing of schedules A through J, the statement of financial affairs as well as the form B22 means test.  Personal Bankruptcy  = Chapter 7 = The Bankruptcy Code's provisions for chapter 7 bankruptcy relief are generally found in chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. Sometimes chapter 7 bankruptcy is referred to as \\"straight bankruptcy\\" or \\"liquidation bankruptcy\\", but these terms are basically a holdover from the past and are not helpful and are misleading. Basically, chapter 7 bankruptcy provides for the discharge of dischargeable debt, which does not include non- dischargeable debt, such as most student loans, alimony, child support, and some taxes. In most cases, filers under chapter 7 incur no liquidation of their property as all of their property is \\"exempt.\\" Instances of the liquidation of property under chapter 7 is generally only found when the person wrongfully files under chapter 7 when they should have filed under chapter 13 or should not have filed for bankruptcy at all. = Chapter 13 = The purpose of chapter 13 is to reorganize a person's financial situation while under the protection of the bankruptcy court. The reorganization is based on a chapter 13 plan proposed by the debtor which is effective when approved by the bankruptcy court. = Chapter 11 = Chapter 11 bankruptcy is available to both individuals and businesses, but there are very few individual chapter 11 cases filed.  Business Bankruptcy  = Generally = Almost all of the chapter 11 cases filed in Florida are by businesses, such as corporations and LLCs. Many of the businesses located in Florida, though may file in another states, such as Delaware or New York, due to various reasons. One of the first significant occasions was the filing of the Eastern Airlines chapter 11 case in New York which was based on the fact that one of its small subsidiaries was located in New York. = Chapter 7 = A business may file for chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation. There is a misunderstanding among many people that a business is required to file for bankruptcy when it is closing for financial distress reasons. Actually in the vast majority of cases, a business may close and wind-down the business informally or formally under the applicable entity's provisions in Florida Statutes. When a business files for chapter 7 bankruptcy, A bankruptcy trustee is appointed who steps in and takes control of the business and its assets. = Chapter 11 = A business may file for chapter 11 bankruptcy relief for a variety of purposes. Although chapter 11 is generally regarded as being for the purposes of reorganization, many businesses file for chapter 11 to effectuate a sale of the business or an orderly liquidation of the business.  Exemptions  = Generally = Upon the filing of a bankruptcy case, generally all of the debtor's property becomes property of a bankruptcy estate. A bankruptcy estate is defined broadly in the Bankruptcy Code to includes all of the debtor's rights to property. The use of exemptions is generally only in personal bankruptcy case and not in business cases, such as those filed under chapter 7 and chapter 11, filed by an entity, except by business operated as a sole proprietorship. Bankruptcy exemptions that apply in Florida are generally set forth in several locations, including the Bankruptcy Code, Federal Statutes, Florida Constitution, Florida Statutes, and Florida common law. = Real Property =  Homestead  Article X, section 4 of the Florida Constitution provides for the Florida Homestead exemption. This type of \\"homestead exemption\\" should be distinguished from the homestead exemptions provided related to property taxation and inheritance purposes. = Personal Property = Certain personal property is exempt from the bankruptcy estate in Florida.  General Personal Property, Household Goods  Article X, section 4 of the Florida Constitution provides for the exemption of $1,000 of personal property, which is doubled if the bankruptcy case is a joint filing with a spouse. Florida statutes provides for an additional $4,000 exemption for personal property if the person does not have the benefit of the Florida homestead exemption.  Wages  Florida Statute section 222.11 provides for a limited exemption of wages.  Vehicles  Florida Statutes provides for the exemption of $1,000 in value of a vehicle. This is applied to the equity in the vehicle in the event there is a lien on the vehicle for a loan. = Intangible Personal Property =  Life Insurance  Florida Statutes provides for a certain exemption of life insurance in section 222.13 and in section 222.14  Annuities  Florida Statutes 222.14 provides for a certain exemption of annuities.  Retirement Benefits  Most retirement benefits, including IRAs, 401(k) plans, and social security, are exempt in Florida.  Workers' Compensation Benefits  Florida Statutes provides for a certain exemption for workers' compensation benefits.  Unemployment Benefits  Florida Statutes provides for a certain exemption for unemployment benefits.  Property Excluded from the Bankruptcy Estate  = Tenants by the Entireties = Real or personal property held among spouses as tenants by the entireties is not owned solely by the individual but is owned by the marriage. Due to this status of ownership, property held as tenants by the entireties is generally exempt or not subject to the claims of the creditors of one of the spouses in Florida. This common law exemption is generally applicable to real property as well as personal property, but must be relied upon with caution as it may be difficult to prove that the property is actually held as tenants by the entireties, especially as to personal property, and as the application of this exemption various among different bankruptcy judges. = Spendthrift Trusts = Spendthrift trusts are technically not \\"exempt\\" from the bankruptcy estate, but are \\"excluded\\" from the bankruptcy estate pursuant to section 541(d) of the Bankruptcy Code. A spendthrift trust is a creature of Florida state law and must meet is requirements in order to be considered a spendthrift trust. = Bare Legal Title = Property in which the debtor only holds bare legal title, is not part of the bankruptcy estate under section 541(d) of the Bankruptcy Code.  Creditors  A creditor is a person or entity that holds a claim against the debtor or the property of a debtor. The claim may have the status of an administrative claim, priority claim, a secured claim, or a general unsecured claim. There are various procedures that a creditor must follow in order to protect their interests. In most instances, a creditor must file a proof of claim form with the clerk of the involved bankruptcy court. Such proof of claim form generally must be filed before the \\"bar date\\" set in each case.  Involuntary Bankruptcy  Although almost all bankruptcy cases are filed voluntarily by the debtor, the Bankruptcy Code also provides for the filing of an involuntary bankruptcy case against a person or business entity by creditors. The purpose of the filing of a petition for Involuntary bankruptcy case is usually as a means by creditors to collect on debts.  Appeals from the Bankruptcy Courts  = United States District Court = The first level of appeal from a Bankruptcy Court is normally to the United States District Court for the same district of the bankruptcy court. Sometimes, appeals are allowed to be taken directly to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. = 11th Circuit Court of Appeals = The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals hears appeals from the United States District Court. It also hears appeals directly from the bankruptcy court in certain circumstances. The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, but has several local locations. = United States Supreme Court = Appeals from the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals are taken to the United States Supreme Court in Washington, DC. Throughout the history of the bankruptcy laws in the United States, the U.S. Supreme Court has made very important decisions regarding the nature of the bankruptcy courts and other issues of bankruptcy law. Among the most extremely Important cases are Northern Pipeline v. Marathon Pipel Line and Stern v. Marshall,. These cases related to the power and jurisdiction of bankruptcy courts under article III of the United States Constitution to render judgment in certain types of cases.
