She was active in the slave trade in Farenya, Guinea. Biography Niara Bely was the daughter of Emmanuel Gomez, the Luso-African ruler of Bakia, Guinea. She studied in Liverpool. At some point, she also adopted the westernised name of Elizabeth Bailey Gomez. =Slave trader= In 1809 she married the slave trader Stiles Edward Lightbourn who spent much of his time on voyages across the Atlantic. The couple originally lived in Bangalan. Bely subsequently maintained a trading settlement located in Farenya, Guinea. While there, she became a prominent businesswoman involved in the slave trade. She resided in the fortified settlement, in a two-storey building she described as a \\"palace\\". Archaeological evidence suggests that the area became a village only after Bely set up her trading outpost. It was the destination for trading routes from the Fouta Djallon highlands. =Chief= Lightbourn was lost at sea in 1833. Two years later both Bely and her son Stiles Jr were made chiefs. Over the course of the following 30 years, the family would fight for control of the local area. The children of Bely and Lightbourn did not reside in Farenya, but instead at Gnanya, which at the time was the port for the region. In 1841, when Benjamin Campbell was investigated for involvement in the slave trade, he freely admitted that he had done business with \\"Mrs Lightbourn\\", but said that he had only bought legitimate goods such as ivory, hides, wax, gold and coffee. In 1842, Niara Bely and her colleague Mary Faber united their armies to help their allies, the Fula, to plunder the Susu capital, Thia, when weakened by throne fighting, and installing their own candidate there, which benefited Fula, Faber, and Lightburn. The 1840s are described as a great flowering period for the region's trade. On January 17, 1852, the British and Sierra Leone, in agreement with the domestic ruler, imposed a ban on the slave trade of the region, a ban which the lower river region had already adopted. Mary Faber de Sanger, who perceived the treaty as a hostile act from the lower river trader in alliance with Freetown's \\"mulatto\\" and also as a way of releasing the lower river's Susa tribe from her allied Fula tribe power, which would hurt her business, closed alliance with Niara Bely and Charles Wilkinson, and together they pillaged the Susu region by the lower river. However, the war ended with a defeat for Faber, Bely and Wilkinson (1855). Around this time, the Transatlantic slave trade experienced its final declined, however, and the slave traders of the region gradually started to invest in other business. Death In 1878 she was baptised as an Anglican, later archaeological investigations discovered the remains of the original Anglican church at Farenya. She died on 14 April 1879, with the news commemorated by the firing of the settlement's cannon the morning after. A mission who was present at the time wrote \\"The infirmities of age had pressed heavily upon her ever since her baptism, and at last she died somewhat suddenly\\". She was initially buried in a hole under a cheese tree in the middle of the village. In 1966, a graveyard was built around the location and her remains were re-interred in a cement grave. Additional, empty, graves were built for her husband and her son.

He is known primarily for portraits, genre scenes and still-lifes of flowers. Biography He was born to a Sephardic family that originally came from Portugal. Both of his parents died when he was eleven and he was placed in an orphanage operated by the Portuguese Synagogue of Amsterdam.Brief biography @ Philosemitism blog. During his stay there, he began making sketches. His talent was noticed and, at the age of fourteen, he began training as a decorative painter at the Quellinusschool. He then transferred to the Dutch State Academy of Fine Arts, where he studied with August Alleb√©, among others.Brief biography @ the De Valk Lexicon of painters from Laren-Blaricum. Self-portrait (c.1940) At seventeen, he left the orphanage and opened a studio in the Plantage neighborhood of the Jodenbuurt. He also worked in the studios of Meijer de Haan and provided illustrations for magazines. A drawing on the first page of the monthly Elsevier's Ge√Øllustreerd Maandschrift introduced him to the general public. In 1885, he was given an exhibition at Arti et Amicitiae which was well received. In 1895, he married Rosie Asscher, the daughter of a diamond cutter from London. Three years later, they moved to Laren where he became associated with the Laren School. Later, they lived in neighboring Blaricum and he eventually opened a studio in Laren in 1905. He focused on portraits; notably those of Prime Minister Hendrikus Colijn, Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis and Henri Deterding. His wife was in poor health, so he also created numerous still lifes of flowers in vases while looking after her. In 1934, a major exhibition was held at the Hotel Hamdorff in Laren; a notable meeting place for artists. When his son, Martijn, was killed in a motorcycle accident, he became thoroughly absorbed in his work. In 1941, the J√ºdische Wochenblatt Amsterdam described him as a modest man of high standards who opposed injustice. Following the German occupation, he was able to maintain a low profile at an isolated farm in Laren for a few years. However, in 1943, he and Rosie were tracked down and taken to Auschwitz. He was put to death later that year and she followed early the next year.

Also known as the Ides of October storm, it struck the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and Canada as a powerful extratropical cyclone. Songda was the twentieth named storm and the ninth typhoon of the annual typhoon season. The system developed into a tropical storm south of Minamitorishima on October 8 and strengthened into a typhoon on October 10. Songda reached its peak intensity southeast of Japan late on October 11 at an unusually high latitude, before it became extratropical on October 13. Meteorological history On October 2, the United States Central Pacific Hurricane Center started to monitor a weak trough of low pressure that had developed about to the southwest of Honolulu, Hawaii. Over the next day as the system moved towards the northwest, showers and thunderstorms gradually developed along the trough, but were showing little to no signs of organisation. The system was subsequently classified as a tropical depression by the Japan Meteorological Agency during October 3, as it crossed the International Dateline and moved into the western Pacific Ocean. Often presenting an exposed low-level circulation center (LLCC), the tropical depression drifted westward without further development for days owing to a marginal environment within the subsident region of a tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT) cell to the northwest, with moderate vertical wind shear. Late on October 7, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) eventually issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system, when the TUTT cell was beginning to move to the west-southwest, allowing convection to develop over the consolidating LLCC. Shortly after the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical depression early on October 8, the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm and named it Songda (, meaning ‚ÄúDark Brown River‚Äù) at noon, about south of Minamitorishima. It was also upgraded to a tropical storm by the JTWC several hours later. The JMA upgraded Songda to a severe tropical storm late on October 9, when it was moving along the southwest periphery of the deep- layered subtropical ridge positioned to the northeast. Later, both of the JMA and JTWC reported that Songda had developed into a typhoon at 00:00 UTC on October 10. Turning northward, the typhoon rapidly intensified and formed a well-defined eye embedded in deep central convection, due to near radial outflow being limited on the southern portion, with a very strong poleward tap into the Westerlies, very low vertical wind shear, and sea surface temperature of 28 ¬∫C. However, the eye became cloud-filled and ragged early on the next day, when Songda began to accelerate northeastward along the poleward side of the subtropical ridge. Typhoon Songda reintensified in the afternoon on October 11. Moving in-phase with such strong southwesterly vertical wind shear effectively reduced its overall impacts to the system, allowing a rapid intensification again. Therefore, Songda developed a larger and sharp eye with a very symmetric core structure. It reached its peak intensity about southeast of Tokyo, Japan at 18:00 UTC, with ten-minute maximum sustained winds at 185 km/h (115 mph) and the central pressure at 925 hPa (27.32 inHg) reported by the JMA, at an unusually high latitude (30.3¬∫N) for such powerful intensity. With one-minute maximum sustained winds at 240 km/h (150 mph) reported by the JTWC, equivalent to a Category 4 of the SSHWS, Songda was also an unusually northern super typhoon. Early on October 12, embedded deeper in the westerlies, the overall structure became more asymmetric with severe elongation and dispersion along the northern peripheries, leading the weakening trend and prompting the JTWC issuing the final warning to Songda, although the eye remained well-defined until the afternoon. Songda as a hurricane-force low near Western Washington on October 15 Moving eastward at 95 km/h (60 mph), shortly after the JMA downgraded Songda to a severe tropical storm early on October 13, the system completed an extratropical transition south of the Aleutian Islands. After the system weakened into a gale-force low and crossed the 180th meridian again in the afternoon, the National Weather Service (NWS) office in Portland dubbed it the Ides of October storm on the next day. On October 15, the system turned northeastward and underwent an explosive intensification. The Ocean Prediction Center (OPC) reported that Post-Tropical Cyclone Songda developed into a hurricane-force low approximately west of Astoria, Oregon at 11:00 PDT (18:00 UTC), 6 hours before with the central pressure decreasing to 969 mb (hPa; 28.61 inHg). Shortly after reaching hurricane-force, the extra-tropical cyclone weakened to storm- force and arrived at the coastline of Vancouver Island. The low continued to track northward and quickly became attached to a weakening stationary front, associated with a complex low-pressure system to the west, late on October 16; Songda's remnants were subsequently absorbed into the neighboring system. Preparations and impact Typhoon Songda stayed over open ocean as a typhoon and had little to no impacts while in the Western Pacific Ocean. The extratropical remnant of Songda was the last in a line of three strong low- pressure systems to affect the western coast of Canada and the United States from October 12 through October 16\\\\. The storm was predicted to be the strongest and potentially most devastating of the three. In preparation of the low pressure's arrival the cities of Victoria and Vancouver closed public parks to prevent injuries from falling trees. The City of Vancouver added 150 additional homeless spaces while the City of Victoria opened up 325 emergency shelters. A number of ferries to Vancouver Island were also cancelled during the evening of October 15 in advance of the storm. Utility providers had requested assistance from interior Canada to provide quick support in case of power outages. Environment Canada issued high wind and rain warnings for the west coast as winds of over were anticipated. As the system neared the coast, wind gusts of were recorded at Vancouver International Airport, at Victoria Airport, and at Abbotsford Airport. The highest wind gust recorded during this event was at Race Rocks on the southern tip of Vancouver Island. The winds were weaker than predicted because of the compact nature of the storm. The storm left a large number of trees knocked over. This rendered some roads impassable and resulted in structural damage to homes, cars, and power lines. At the height of the event as many as 34,000 residents were left without power.

Built in 1765, it is located in the old city of Acre, at Philippe Auguste street, north of the Templars tunnel in modern day Israel. It is named after one of the twelve apostles of Jesus. The church was built on the remains of a Crusader church. The church is still used today and is known for its beautiful interior, icons, and ornate decoration. History St. Andrew's Church ( ) was built in 1765 on the ruins of the Crusader church that was destroyed in 1261. It belongs to the Catholic Church and follows the Greek-Catholic Eastern Rite in full communion with the Pope in Rome. Thanks to its location overlooking the Mediterranean, the church was easily visible for the Crusaders. The Crusaders of the Templars order settled in Acre in the 12th century, after the fall of Jerusalem, and built a fortress on the south-west corner of the old city of Acre. Adjacent to their palace (Templum) they built the Church of Santa Anna, named after the Mother of the Virgin Mary. The 12th-century church was rebuilt and enlarged in the 13th century as a grand Gothic Cathedral. The structure of the two-story Crusader church survived and stone of the original church was used in the construction of the current building. The top floor of the original Crusader church remains and is still in ruins. In 1291, the Mamlukes destroyed the city, including most of the Crusaders' structures, but the battered two-story shell and arched halls remained standing until the 18th century. The Greek Catholic church (Melkites) split from the Greek Orthodox church in 1724. In 1765, the church was rebuilt over the ruins of the medieval church. A sign near above the door near the entrance to the church shows the year of 1802, when the Greek Catholic Archbishopric was founded at the church. It later moved to Haifa. =Modern times= The church of St. Andrew is open to the public, and serves the Greek Catholic Melkite community. On the west side of the church, facing the sea, is a small courtyard. Embedded into the wall is a segment of a head of an ancient statue, possibly one of John the Baptist, which belonged to the older Crusader church. The modern church has an ornate Templon, decorated with icons and paintings, which separates the nave and the altar, or sanctuary. The icons are of Christ, the Virgin Mary, Apostles, John the Baptist, Saints and the prophet Elijah. The names above each icon are written in Arabic, and were crafted in Syria.

After high school he attended Frank Phillips College and was drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies in the 29th round of the 2012 Major League Baseball draft. He did not sign with the Phillies and transferred to Cisco College. After one year at Cisco, he transferred to Oklahoma City University and was drafted by the New York Mets in the seventh round of the 2014 Major League Baseball draft. Wieck signed and spent 2014 with the Brooklyn Cyclones, posting a 1-1 record and 1.40 ERA in 16 relief appearances. He started 2015 with the Savannah Sand Gnats. =San Diego Padres= In June, he was acquired by the San Diego Padres as the player to be named later in an earlier trade for Alex Torres. The Padres assigned him to the Class A Fort Wayne TinCaps and later promoted him to the Class A Advanced Lake Elsinore Storm. In 23 total games started between Savannah, Fort Wayne, and Lake Elsinore, he pitched to a 7-11 record, 4.09 ERA, and 1.40 WHIP.

Her mother died in 1904, and Viktoria was raised by her father, Peter Savs, with her three younger sisters, in Arco, Trentino, near Lake Garda. Shortly before the outbreak of the First World War, her father, a master shoemaker, moved the family to Obermais (Merano).Viktoria Savs Enlistment Her father was called into military service as a Kaiserj√§ger in 1914, and was wounded in 1915 in Galicia on the Russian front. While he was at home recovering from his wounds, the sixteen-year-old Viktoria begged him to allow her to enlist. After unsuccessfully attempting to dissuade her, Peter decided to volunteer for the Austro-Hungarian Landsturm, a militia composed of troops who were too young or too old for standard military service. On June 10, 1915, she enlisted with her father as \\"Viktor,\\" concealing her biological gender from all except a few superior officers.

If all blocks in the higher level cache are also present in the lower level cache, then the lower level cache is said to be inclusive of the higher level cache. If the lower level cache contains only blocks that are not present in the higher level cache, then the lower level cache is said to be exclusive of the higher level cache. If the contents of the lower level cache are neither strictly inclusive nor exclusive of the higher level cache, then it is called non-inclusive non- exclusive (NINE) cache.  Inclusive Policy  Figure 1. Inclusive Policy Consider an example of a two level cache hierarchy where L2 can be inclusive, exclusive or NINE of L1. Consider the case when L2 is inclusive of L1. Suppose there is a processor read request for block X. If the block is found in L1 cache, then the data is read from L1 cache and returned to the processor. If the block is not found in the L1 cache, but present in the L2 cache, then the cache block is fetched from the L2 cache and placed in L1. If this causes a block to be evicted from L1, there is no involvement of L2. If the block is not found in either L1 or L2, then it is fetched from the main memory and placed in both L1 and L2. Now, if there is an eviction from L2, the L2 cache sends a back invalidation to the L1 cache, so that inclusion is not violated. As illustrated in Figure 1, initially consider both L1 and L2 caches to be empty (a). Assume that the processor sends a read X request. It will be a miss in both L1 and L2 and hence the block is brought into both L1 and L2 from the main memory as shown in (b). Now, assume the processor issues a read Y request which is a miss in both L1 and L2. So, block Y is placed in both L1 and L2 as shown in (c). If block X has to be evicted from L1, then it is removed from L1 only as shown in (d). If block Y has to be evicted from L2, it sends a back invalidation request to L1 and hence block Y is evicted from L1 as shown in (e). In order for inclusion to hold, certain conditions need to be satisfied. L2 associativity must be greater than or equal to L1 associativity irrespective of the number of sets. The number of L2 sets must be greater than or equal to the number of L1 sets irrespective of L2 associativity. All reference information from L1 is passed to L2 so that it can update its replacement bits. One example of inclusive cache is Intel quad core processor with 4x256KB L2 caches and 8MB (inclusive) L3 cache. 550x550px  Exclusive Policy  Consider the case when L2 is exclusive of L1. Suppose there is a processor read request for block X. If the block is found in L1 cache, then the data is read from L1 cache and returned to the processor. If the block is not found in the L1 cache, but present in the L2 cache, then the cache block is moved from the L2 cache to the L1 cache. If this causes a block to be evicted from L1, the evicted block is then placed into L2. This is the only way L2 gets populated. Here, L2 behaves like a victim cache. If the block is not found in either L1 or L2, then it is fetched from main memory and placed just in L1 and not in L2. As illustrated in Figure 2, initially consider both L1 and L2 caches to be empty (a). Assume that the processor sends a read X request. It will be a miss in both L1 and L2 and hence the block is brought into L1 from the main memory as shown in (b). Now, again the processor issues a read Y request which is a miss in both L1 and L2. So, block Y is placed in L1 as shown in (c). If block X has to be evicted from L1, then it is removed from L1 and placed in L2 as shown in (d). An example of exclusive cache is AMD Opteron with 512 KB (per core) L2 cache, exclusive of L1. 550x550px  NINE Policy  Consider the case when L2 is non-inclusive non-exclusive of L1. Suppose there is a processor read request for block X. If the block is found in L1 cache, then the data is read from L1 cache and returned to the processor. If the block is not found in the L1 cache, but present in the L2 cache, then the cache block is fetched from the L2 cache and placed in L1. If this causes a block to be evicted from L1, there is no involvement of L2, which is the same as in the case of inclusive policy. If the block is not found in both L1 and L2, then it is fetched from main memory and placed in both L1 and L2. Now, if there is an eviction from L2, unlike inclusive policy, there is no back invalidation. As illustrated in Figure 3, initially consider both L1 and L2 caches to be empty (a). Assume that the processor sends a read X request. It will be a miss in both L1 and L2 and hence the block is brought into both L1 and L2 from the main memory as shown in (b). Now, again the processor issues a read Y request which is a miss in both L1 and L2. So, block Y is placed in both L1 and L2 as shown in (c). If block X has to be evicted from L1, then it is removed from L1 only as shown in (d). If block Y has to be evicted from L2, it is evicted from L2 only as shown in (e). An example of non-inclusive non-exclusive cache is AMD Opteron with non-inclusive L3 cache of 6 MB (shared).  Comparison  The merit of inclusive policy is that, in parallel systems with per-processor private cache if there is a cache miss other peer caches are checked for the block. If the lower level cache is inclusive of the higher level cache and it is a miss in the lower level cache, then the higher level cache need not be searched. This implies a shorter miss latency for an inclusive cache compared to exclusive and NINE. A drawback of an inclusive policy is that the unique memory capacity of the cache is determined by the lower level cache. Unlike the case of exclusive cache, where the unique memory capacity is the combined capacity of all caches in the hierarchy. If the size of lower level cache is small and comparable with the size of higher level cache, there is more wasted cache capacity in inclusive caches. Although the exclusive cache has more unique memory capacity, it uses more bandwidth since it suffers from a higher rate of filling of new blocks (equal to the rate of higher level cache's misses) as compared to NINE cache which is filled with a new block only when it suffers a miss. Therefore, assessment of cost relative to benefit needs to be done while exploiting the choice between Inclusive, Exclusive and NINE caches. Value Inclusion: It is not necessary for a block to have same data values when it is cached in both higher and lower level caches even though inclusion is maintained. But, if the data values are the same, value inclusion is maintained. This depends on the write policy in use, as write back policy does not notify the lower level cache of the changes made to the block in higher level cache. However, in case of write-through cache there is no such concern.

She was also an economist and a historian.  Background and education  Lettice Fisher (n√©e Ilbert) was born on 14 June 1875 in Kensington, London to Sir Courtenay Peregrine Ilbert and his wife Jessie. She was educated at Francis Holland School, London and Somerville College, Oxford, where she was awarded a first in modern history in 1897. She worked as a researcher at the London School of Economics from 1897 to 1898. From 1902 to 1913, she taught history at St Hugh's College, Oxford, and she also taught economics for the Association for the Higher Education of Women in Oxford. Whilst at Oxford, Fisher was also involved in voluntary work in housing, public health and child welfare. She was an active suffragist, chairing the national executive of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS) from 1916 to 1918. She ran to become President of the NUWSS in 1919, following Millicent Fawcett‚Äòs post-war resignation, but was defeated by Eleanor Rathbone.  The National Council for the Unmarried Mother and her Child  During World War I, Fisher undertook welfare work among women munitions workers in Sheffield. It was the wartime scale of illegitimacy and its resulting hardships that led her, in 1918, to found the National Council for the Unmarried Mother and her Child, in order to challenge the stigma associated with single parent families, and to provide them with the support they needed. The Council aimed to reform the Bastardy Acts and Affiliation Orders Acts, which discriminated against illegitimate children, and also to address the higher death rates of children born outside marriage, by providing accommodation for single mothers and their babies. They also provided practical advice and assistance to single parents, and helped with their inquiries.

Background  Xu Jie was born in 868, during the reign of Emperor Xizong of Tang. He was from Pengcheng (ÂΩ≠Âüé, in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu). He was said to be dextrous, capable, and a good speaker. At some point, he became an officer under the general Cui Hong (), who was, as of 899, serving as the military governor (Jiedushi) of Fengguo Circuit (Â•âÂúã, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan). In 899, a number of Fengguo officers, led by Cui Jingsi (), were fearful of the major warlord Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), who was forcing Cui Hong into submitting to him. They coerced Cui Hong into abandoning Fengguo's capital Cai Prefecture () and fleeing to the domain of another major warlord, Yang Xingmi the military governor of Huainan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 261. As they approached Yang's domain, Cui Hong sent Xu in advance to meet Yang to submit. Yang subsequently retained Xu to serve as an officer under him. By 906, Huainan was under the rule of Yang Xingmi's son and successor Yang Wo. That year, Yang Wo, taking advantage of a succession struggle at Zhennan Circuit (ÈéÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi) after the death of its military governor Zhong Chuan between Zhong Chuan's son Zhong Kuangshi and adoptive son Zhong Yangui (), launched a major attack on Zhennan and captured it.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 265. During the campaign, Xu served as the food supply officer, and after the successful campaign was made the prefect of Ji Prefecture (ÂêâÂ∑û, in modern Ji'an, Jiangxi).  During Hongnong/Wu  By 912, Tang had fallen, and Yang Wo's domain was now ruled by his brother and successor Yang Longyan, who carried the title of Prince of Hongnong, as an independent state. However, the governance of the Hongnong state was actually in the hands of Xu Wen, who had along with Zhang Hao, assassinated Yang Wo and become regent. Several of Yang Xingmi's old generals ‚Äî Liu Wei () the military governor of Zhennan, Tao Ya () the governor of She Prefecture (Ê≠ôÂ∑û, in modern Huangshan, Anhui), Li Yu () the governor of Xuan Prefecture (ÂÆ£Â∑û, in modern Xuancheng, Anhui), and Li Jian () the prefect of Chang Prefecture (Â∏∏Â∑û, in modern Changzhou, Jiangsu) ‚Äî were dissatisfied with the situation and were particularly not respectful of Xu Wen. Li Yu was particularly upset with Xu Wen's governance, often stating, \\"Who is this Xu Wen? I have not even met him, and now he is in control of the state!\\" In 912, when Xu Jie, then serving as the director of travel pavilions (È§®È©õ‰Ωø, Guanyishi), was on a diplomatic mission to Hongnong's southeastern neighbor Wuyue, Xu Wen had him visit Li Yu at Xuan to try to persuade Li Yu to go to the capital Guangling () to pay homage to Yang Longyan. Li Yu initially agreed. However, Xu Jie, during the conversation, stated, \\"If you do not do so, Lord, people will believe that you are rebelling.\\" Li Yu angrily responded, \\"You, sir, said that I, Li Yu, would be rebelling. Is it not the case that one who killed the Shizhong [(i.e., Yang Wo, who carried that title)] would be rebelling?\\" Xu Wen, subsequently, had the general Chai Zaiyong () attack Xuan. When Li Yu subsequently surrendered, Xu Wen had Li Yu's family slaughtered.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 268. Li Yu's son had married one of Yang Xingmi's daughters, who was spared from execution because she was the prince's sister. She subsequently married Xu Jie as his wife. In 918, Xu Wen's oldest biological son Xu Zhix√πn, whom Xu Wen had made junior regent and in day-to-day control of the state (which by that point was known as Wu), was assassinated by the general Zhu Jin, who subsequently committed suicide. As Xu Wen's other biological sons were all young, Xu Wen's adoptive son Xu Zhigao was made the junior regent.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 270. Xu Zhigao considered Xu Jie's governance of Ji Prefecture to be poor, and found him to be corrupt and obscene, and therefore removed him from the post. However, Xu Wen himself considered Xu Jie to be a good assistant, and therefore invited Xu Jie to serve on staff, as the deputy commander of Xu Wen's army;Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 276. and Xu Jie became a close associate to him. As Xu Jie resented Xu Zhigao, he often told Xu Wen, \\"The regency of the government is so important that you cannot trust it to someone of a different surname. You should let your proper son Xu Zhix√∫n [(Xu Wen's second biological son)] replace him.\\" But as Xu Wen was considering the matter and resolving to replace Xu Zhigao with Xu Zhix√∫n, he fell ill and died in 927. Shortly after Xu Wen's death, then-Wu emperor Yang Pu (Yang Longyan's younger brother and successor) split Xu Wen's titles between Xu Zhigao and Xu Zhix√∫n, with Xu Zhigao assuming Xu Wen's title as overseer of all military matters (ÈÉΩÁù£‰∏≠Â§ñÁ∏ΩËªç‰∫ã, Dudu Zhongwai Zongjunshi), while Xu Zhix√∫n took on the title of deputy supreme commander of all circuits (Ë´∏ÈÅìÂâØÈÉΩÁµ±, Zhudao Fu Dutong, with Xu Wen having been supreme commander before, and that post now left open) and military governor of Ningguo (ÂØßÂúã, headquartered in modern Xuancheng, Anhui) and Zhenhai (ÈéÆÊµ∑, headquartered in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu) Circuits, which Xu Wen had been; he also took the greater honorary chancellor title of Shizhong (). Even though Xu Zhigao remained in control of Wu's imperial government, Xu Zhix√∫n, at Jinling (ÈáëÈôµ, in modern Nanjing, Jiangsu), controlled the largest army of the state, and he, wielding that authority, contended for decision-making with Xu Zhigao, who tried to curb Xu Zhixun's military power. Given Xu Zhix√∫n's military strength, Xu Zhigao feared him, but Xu Zhix√∫n's arrogance alienated his younger biological brothers. Xu Jie, who had previously supported Xu Zhix√∫n, also realized that Xu Zhixun lacked the proper abilities to lead, and instead turned his allegiance to Xu Zhigao, informing Xu Zhigao of Xu Zhix√∫n's shortcomings. Later in 929, Xu Zhix√∫n tried to summon Xu Zhigao to Jinling to attend a ceremony where they would remove mourning clothes that they had put on for Xu Wen's death; Xu Zhigao refused, claiming that Yang Pu would not let him leave the capital. Xu Zhix√∫n, meanwhile, was tricked by Xu Zhigao to go to Guangling. Once he arrived there, Xu Zhigao detained him and did not allow him to return to Jinling, sending the officer Ke Hou () to lead the Jinling forces back to Guangling, thus consolidating the command under Xu Zhigao himself. Given Xu Jie's allegiance to Xu Zhigao at this point, Xu Zhigao became closely associated with him, with the resentment between them gone. When Xu Zhigao himself later took up his headquarters in Jinling, Xu Jie was made the commander of his army. As of 934, he, along with Li Jianxun, was beginning to encourage Xu Zhigao to take over the throne from Yang Pu.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 279. When, as part of that transition process, Xu Zhigao received the title of Generalissimo and established a headquarters in 936, Xu Zhigao made Xu Jie and a long-time advisor, Song Qiqiu, the military advisors at the Generalissimo headquarters.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 280. In 937, with Xu Zhigao's having received the title of Prince of Qi, Xu Jie and Song were made the principality's chancellors.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 281.  During Southern Tang  In fall 937, Yang Pu yielded the throne to Xu Zhigao, ending Wu, with Xu Zhigao starting a new state later known as Southern Tang. When Xu Zhigao, after taking the throne, submitted a petition to Yang accepting the throne and still treating Yang Pu like an emperor and his lord, it was Xu Jie who delivered Xu Zhigao's petition to Yang. When, subsequently, many officials were submitting petitions to Xu Zhigao asking to change place names containing \\"Yang\\" or \\"Wu\\" as part of the name, it was Xu Jie who spoke against such petitions, stating, \\"Your Imperial Majesty accepted the throne in accordance with the will of heaven and man, without seizing it by improper means. The flattering and evil people are concentrating on changing minute matters. This is not a priority, and you should not follow them.\\" Xu Zhigao agreed with his assessment. Xu Jie was subsequently made the military governor of Ningguo Circuit (ÂØßÂúã, headquartered at Xuan Prefecture). It was said that when this was announced, his wife Lady Yang, remembering what had happened with her first husband and his family, died due to her distress and anger. He was later moved to Zhennan Circuit and given the honorary chancellor title of Zhongshu Ling (). He was later recalled to the Southern Tang imperial government to serve as chancellor with the titles of Situ () and You Chengxiang (), but was not given real responsibility. It was said that he was particularly more greedy in his old age, such that his subordinates were distressed. He was also involved in alchemy, but often bought discount cinnabar of lower grades in his alchemist exercises, leading to derision. He died in 943, during the reign of Li Jing, Xu Zhigao's son and successor (as Xu Zhigao later changed his name to Li Bian, reflecting his birth surname).

Early career David Thomas Richardson was born to a Scottish borders family in Langholm, Dumfriesshire, one of eleven children. In 1779 he became an East India Company cadet, later serving under Colonel (later General) Thomas Wyndham Goddard in the 5th battalion of Sepoys, during the First Anglo- Maratha War; thereafter he transferred to the 3rd Bengal European Regiment. He was one of a number of his family to serve in the east; his brother Gilbert was captain of an East Indiaman and married Catherine Eliza Richardson; his brother William served in the Second Anglo-Mysore War, but was captured and murdered by poison on the orders of Tipu Sultan. Two of his sisters married fellow officers. Abu Taleb's visit to England Engraving of Mirza Abu Taleb Khan, who travelled to England on Richardson's invitation Richardson appears to have been transferred to military intelligence work, arising out of his knowledge of Persian and Hindustani; he is noted, later in his career, as a language examiner for the Company's staff training college. In this context, he is notable as the apparent instigator of, and companion on, a trip to Europe made between 1799 and 1802 by Mirza Abu Taleb Khan, a tax-colletor and Persian scholar associated with Oudh State during a period in which the Company was increasing its control of that territory. It appears that Abu Taleb, who had had to exile himself from Oudh after being too closely identified with British interests, may have been sponsored by the Company to make his trip, presumably with a view to retaining his utility for later company uses in Oudh. Certainly, it appears somewhat singular that an officer of the Company would invite a local to accompany him to England, but that, nevertheless, happened. Singular too was that Abu Taleb published a travel- book recounting his journey, in circa 1805, Masir Talib fi Bilad Afranji (The Travels of Taleb in the Regions of Europe), which was translated and reprinted - including by the East India Company - as Travels of Mirza Abu Taleb Khan in Asia, Africa and Europe. Richardson and Abu Taleb departed Calcutta in November 1799, by Abu Taleb's account, travelling first to Cape Town where they entered into local society notably being entertained by Lady Anne Barnard, who asserted their intelligence function in a letter to Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis. They next travelled to Dublin, where Richardson went ahead to London, leaving Abu Taleb to travel independently. Richardson's time in England seems to have been busy; he contrived to impregnate one Sarah Lester, and a son David Lester Richardson is recorded as being baptised at St. Marylebone on 15 February 1801. Yet in 1800 Richardson becomes engaged to one Violet Oliver (1780‚Äì1808) of Liddle Bank near Langholm, and August 1800 they were married. India again The couple are recorded as arriving back in India by May 1801, Richardson having used his relationship with General Harris to seek appropriate employment by the Company. He served as an occasional external examiner in languages at the Company's staff college in Fort William, and established and acted as principal of a new staff college at Barasat from 1802; he is recorded as compiling a Hindustani dictionary, but that never saw publication; and there are occasional references to translations of Indian verse by Richardson in the Calcutta literary journals. Richardson is known to have moved around India between 1801 and 1807, with five children born in three different locations; Willasey-Wilsey speculates that this was in connection with intelligence work. He was promoted from Major to Lieutenant-Colonel in 1805. Departure for England Lord Nelson, earlier in its career, being captured by Bellone By 1808, after 30 years of Indian service, Richardson determined to return to England, retiring on 29 September 1808 departing Madras on 26 October on Lord Nelson. A month later, on the 20 November, the fleet with which Lord Nelson was sailing was hit by a hurricane; by the 21 November at around the fleet had been scattered; Lord Nelson and two other East Indiamen, Glory and Experiment, also disappeared without a trace. Richardson, Violet and their three surviving children were lost. The Richardsons are commemorated in a now ruined mausoleum near Dinlabyre; Catherine Eliza Richardson, who was married to David Thomas's brother Gilbert (who died in 1801), reflected on the loss in one of her poems.

Education  Sam McKinniss was born in Minnesota and grew up in Connecticut. He graduated from the Glasgow School of Art, Glasgow, Scotland in 2005. He received a BFA in painting from the Hartford Art School in Hartford, Connecticut in 2007, and an MFA from the Steinhardt School at New York University in 2013. Work McKinniss's work has been shown in galleries and museums since 2005. His first solo show in New York, entitled \\"Black Leather Sectional,\\" opened at Joe Sheftel Gallery in May 2015 and his first solo show in Los Angeles, \\"Dear Metal Thing,\\" opened at Team Bungalow in June 2015. His show \\"Egyptian Violet\\" opened at Team Gallery in New York in October 2016. He made his first appearance at the Miami edition of the international art fair Art Basel in 2015. McKinniss paints in two distinct but complementary practices: representational works which are both seductive and funereal; and grey-scale abstractions. The two styles provide tension and counterpoint within his oeuvre. In his figurative painting, which has become the dominant practice, McKinniss works from photographs, found images as well as pictures he took. His subjects include reclining male nudes, floral still lifes, and images from popular culture. McKinniss develops a symbolist vocabulary for contemporary figurative painting; he sources material primarily from online image searching. He has painted a wide range of celebrities including Diana Princess of Wales, Prince, Tyra Banks, Whitney Houston, Madonna and Lil' Kim, as well as fictional film and television characters such as Edward Scissorhands, Catwoman, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Sam McKinniss, White Roses in a Short Glass (after Fantin-Latour), 2016, oil and acrylic on canvas, 9\\" x 12\\"McKinniss is interested in moments of unexpected emotional conflict, aggression and sexuality, defensiveness and vulnerability, pathos and humor. Seemingly disparate pop cultural icons are portrayed without cynicism in the artist's fluent painterly style. McKinniss' work is influenced by a number of eras in the history of painting, from the Baroque and Mannerist to Imagism and Abstract Expressionism. Of particular importance to McKinniss' practice are the works of Henri Fantin-Latour, a figurative French painter of the 19th Century who is known for his floral still-lives. Both McKinniss and Fantin-Latour work seek to access and distill the magic and pathos of Symbolism while limiting themselves to the knowable world: each is at once consumer and creator, curator and originator, spectator and carnivore. Fantin- Latour represents for McKinniss something close to perfection in paint, the apogee of particular skills and sensitivities. McKinniss‚Äôs embrace of Fantin- Latour demonstrates his respect of history and tradition in painting. McKinniss has made a large number of paintings with titles that incorporate ‚Äòafter Fantin Latour‚Äô, and mimic the 19th-century artist‚Äôs still-lifes. Latour‚Äôs influence on his style can be seen in the heightened colour contrasts with which he paints his figurative paintings. McKinniss painted a series of \\"men in repose\\" for the second issue of Adult.

Biography Born in St Louis, Missouri, Edwards began his musical career by singing in clubs while stationed in Germany when in the US Army. After returning to live in Duluth, Georgia, he appeared on bills with Wilson Pickett, and James and Bobby Purify, before moving to Chicago in the late 1960s. There he met Curtis Mayfield, who introduced Edwards to producer Jo Armstead at Weis Records. He recorded several singles for the label before moving to Bell Records in 1972, and then to the Atlanta-based Aware label the following year. Biography by Ron Wynn, Allmusic.com.

He followed it up with \\"Messing Up A Good Thing\\" and a self-titled album, and then his most successful record, \\"Careful Man\\", produced by Smith and written by Jimmy Lewis, which reached number 8 on the R&B; chart in 1974. It was followed by \\"Vanishing Love\\", which also made the R&B; chart. After the record company went out of business, Edwards did some shows with the Spinners, but also maintained a solo career on the Cotillion label, achieving two more R&B; chart entries with \\"Baby, Hold On To Me\\" (1976) and \\"\\"Nobody But You\\" (1977).

As of 2016, the company operates dozens of manufacturing facilities across the United States and Mexico. History Taylor Communications was founded as Standard Register Co. in Dayton, Ohio in 1912 by brothers John and William Sherman and Dayton inventor Theodore Shirmer to sell the pinfeed autographic register, a device invented by Shirmer. The device enabled multiple copies of printed forms to be fed through the machine using a hand-cranked wooden cylinder. Over the next century, Standard Register rose to prominence as one of the largest printed communications companies in the United States. On June 17, 2015, it was announced that Taylor Corporation would be acquiring the assets of the company for a reported $307 million. Several months after the transaction was complete, Standard Register re- branded as Taylor Corporation's new go-to-market subsidiary, Taylor Communications. Less than one year following the acquisition of Standard Register, Taylor Communications announced its intentions to purchase Staples Print Solutions, the commercial print division of Staples Inc.

This figure represents the cumulative human forces, cast upon the eternal emptiness of Hell. In The Gates of Hell, the sculpture appears in three different places: at the top of the left door, at the top of the right pilaster-- the one holding Crouching Woman as part of I am beautiful-- and as the central piece of Avarice at the bottom of the Gates. Judging by the position of the first figure, some authors have suggested that Rodin suspected his commission would be canceled because the arched position of the man would make difficult, if not impossible, to open and close the doors, hindering its function. Even though this figure appears in different directions in The Gates, its muscles stay the same; which hints at Rodin's idea of taking an artistic license regarding gravity. This concept heralds the modernist movement, which favors expression over verisimilitude.

Offered on DVD, the series was also broadcast on PBS, prompting PBS's ombudsmen to issue a statement clarifying to the public that it was not produced using PBS funding, which some viewers having expressed that as a concern. The series has receive numerous praises by figures like papal biographer George Weigel, card. Timothy Dolan and card. Francis George for its effort in pursuing the new evangelization in the modern world. Some critics however have noted how the series, while being relevant for providing basic teachings of the Catholic doctrine to the secular world also thought splendid and beautiful imagery, follows in different parts a strongly ecumenical viewpoint, failing to adequately present and discuss the more controversial topics of hell, sin, sexual moral and the necessity of the Church for salvation, even reducing in some cases the mission of Jesus Christ as a bearer of social justice values. Some parts also appear to be in contrast with traditional catholic teachings, especially regarding the nature of hell and heaven or when the existence of Adam and Eve is denied.

He developed a technique to capture forms in water that are invisible to the naked eye. He is committed to spreading his theory that water is the source of all consciousness. His art can be described as kinetic art, photography, BioArt, liquid photography, flow-tography, nature photography, scientific photography, and motion photography.  Education  Moses studied cinematography and fine art at Avni Institute of Art and Design in Tel-Aviv. In 2006, Moses completed his B.Arch with AIA honors award, from SCI arc (Southern California Institute of Architecture). After graduating Moses started intense training in movement and dance with Body Weather Laboratory to explore water in a somatic manner.  Career  Hakmon's series Faces of Water being exhibited at Joshua Tree National Park in 2015 at The Joshua Treenial. Hakmon's art emerged from ten years of research on water and he has committed his life to educating people about water. It all center's around his proposition that water is in fact the source of consciousness. In 2013, he discovered the technique he uses to capture images of water that are invisible to the naked eye.[1] His work expands on Masaru Emoto's talking about how water's molecular structure reacts to metaphysical stimuli, most notably found in The Hidden Messages in Water. While Emoto could only show the way water is effected by human consciousness in the form of frozen water, Hakmon was able to show these effects on water in its fluid form through photography. He has turned these photographs into installations to display in galleries and educate people about his findings. = Faces of Water = Faces of Water was Hakmon's first project that was released in 2013. It is the debut of his technique that capture's water's invisible forms. Wired Magazine says \\"Hacmon worked out technique involving a special type of film with a layer of liquid [film] that records the movement of the water itself. The film leaves Hakmon with a full-size negative, which he then develops into pictures like the ones here‚Äìan analog process from start to finish.\\" The photos show the faces of water, showing it as an architect of nature. Newbery and the Carnegie medal award-winning author Neil Gaiman said about the photos \\"Immediate thoughts involve not drinking water any longer because it has eyes and is obviously sentient‚Ä¶\\" = Cymatics = Cymatics is a subset of modal vibrational phenomena, basically a wave. Hakmon employs cymatics in his works that use water to visualize sound waves. He has worked with Mark Dresser, an American double bass player and composer, to link sound to its visualization in water. Using the technique Hakmon developed, they set up performances with Dresser's bass hooked up to the water and created a feedback loop where dresser influenced the water which in turn influenced his laying. The entire performance was improvised, playing on the idea of the natural stream of consciousness not only within a single being but between the water outside of us and the water inside of us. = Exhibits = * 2016 PUMP: Public Urban Multisensory Presentations - Long Beach, California. * 2016 H20de: an offbeat tribute on water - Electric Lodge Venice, Los Angeles. * 2016 CYAN Yacht - Water to Water (commissioned by Bono/U2) - Mediterranean Sea, France. * 2016 ELEMENTS - nature-themed exhibit - The Loft at Liz's Los Angeles * 2016 Water and Us - The Earth Day Film Festival - San Francisco, California. * 2015 Body of Water - El Camino College Art Gallery - Torrance, California * 2015 The Joshua Treenial - BoxoPROJECTS - Joshua Tree, CA * 2015 Faces of Water at The Integratron - Yucca Valley, California * 2014 de Young Museum - Modernist interpretations of Water - San Francisco, California. * 2014 Soundwave festival - SOMArts Cultural Center - San Francisco, California. * 2013 11.11 Awakening ‚Äî Impact Hub, Los Angeles. = Awards = * 2007 American Institute of Architecture (AIA) Medallion for Excellence * 2002- 2007 SCI arc Excellence Scholarship * 2003- 2006 The National Dean‚Äôs List Award * 2001 President‚Äôs Award Winner * 2001 Row Housing Design Competition First Prize = Performances = * 2016 Bodies of Water - Donna Sternberg & Dancers - Helms Bakery, Los Angeles, CA * 2016 H20de: an offbeat tribute on water Electric Lodge Venice Los Angeles * 2015 Voices of Dream - Open Gate Theater - Musical Improvisation to images of Faces of * Water - Art Share L.A. * 2014 Soundwave festival - SOMArts Cultural Center - San Francisco, California. * 2014 Sonifying Water - Live performance - collaboration with Mark Dresser and Paul Chavez. * CPMC Theatre - San Diego, California. * 2013 Jazz interpretations to Faces of Water - featuring Myra Melford-piano, Nicole Mitchell - * flutes, Michael Dessen-trombone, and Mark Dresser.

Names Vigna luteola is widely known in North America by the common names hairy cowpea or hairypod cowpea. This common name is derived from the Chickasaw waakimbala, which translates literally to \\"cow bean\\". The vine also has a variety of other common names in South America and the Caribbean. In Cuba the plant is known as frijol cimarr√≥n, Spanish for \\"wild bean\\", in Venezuela the plant is known as bajuco marullero, and in the Bahamas the plant is known as yellow vigna.Daniel F. Austinis (2004) Florida Ethnobotany Description=Morphology= Vigna luteola is a hairy, short- lived perennial vine that occurs in moist soil and grows in either a spreading or climbing fashion. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are a compound leaf of three leaflets. The leaflets are oval shaped and become acute at their apex. The leaflets are long, and wide. It has numerous yellow flowers that are long and are made of one large standard petal, two lateral wing petals, and two lower keel petals. This creates bilateral symmetry in the flower.Conley K. McMullen (1999) Flowering Plants of the Gal√°pagos It has thin, pubescent pods that are up to long and wide. The pods are range from green to brown or black. The pods contain numerous large black seeds, and the pod twists spirally when the seeds are dispersed.P. J. Skerman (1982) Les legumineuses fourrageres tropicales =Phytochemistry= The flavinoids quercetin and isorhamnetin are found in the leaves, and are thought to help the plant resist aphids. The seeds resist storage pests due to their high levels of phytic acid, trypsin, and cystatin. Taxonomy Vigna luteola was first classified as Dolichos luteolus in 1771 by Nicholas von Jacquin, naming it from plants he cultivated in Vienna. In 1859, it was moved to the genus Vigna by George Bentham, classifying it as Vigna luteola. The name Luteola is derived from the Latin luteus, meaning \\"yellow\\", in reference to the plant's yellow flowers.Roger L. Hammer (2016) Central Florida Wildflowers: A Field Guide to Wildflowers of the Lake Wales Ridge, Ocala National Forest, Disney Wilderness Preserve, and More than 60 State Parks and Preserves Habitat and Ecology Vigna luteola can be found in tropical areas on many continents. Formerly native to the New World, the plant was brought into cultivation in Ethiopia and is now spread around the world. Vigna luteola grows in most commonly in coastal habitats on the Atlantic coast of the Americas, ranging from tropical regions of South and Central America to the Gulf Coast states, as far north as North Carolina. In Africa, the plant is most common to Zimbabwe, but ranges from Senegal to Ethiopia to Egypt, and can be found in the Middle East, in Australia, and is widespread across Asia.Ib Friis, Kaj Vollesen (1998) Flora of the Sudan-Uganda Border Area East of the Nile Mohar Singh, Ishwari Singh Bisht, Manoranjan Dutta Broadening the Genetic Base of Grain Legumes It grows in swampy grasslands, on sandy lake shores, on stream sides, in wet pastures, in swamps, and in swamp forests.G. J. H. Grubben (2004) Plant Resources of Tropical Africa: Vegetables It prefers moist to wet clay soils, and will tolerate a wide range of salinities, from 0-10 ppt. It is a larval host plant for cassius blue, grey hairstreak, long-tailed skipper and dorantes skipper butterflies,Michael F. Braby (2000) Butterflies of Australia: Their Identification, Biology and Distribution is often used as a source of browsing for white-tailed deer, and ground-feeding birds often consume the seeds. Oomyces langloisii grows from dead stems of the plant in North America. Uses The flowers of Vigna luteola are eaten as a boiled vegetable in Ethiopia and Malawi, and the roots are chewed for the sweet juice. In Ethiopia the leaves and flowers are mixed with Hagenia abyssinica to treat ulcers and syphilis. In Argentina it is used to control cholesterol levels and is reported to have antimicrobial properties as well. It is also used to treat \\"ghost sickness\\", a supernatural ailment, in Polynesia. Vigna luteola is most often considered a weed for crops due to its abundance. However, the plant is palatable for livestock and grows well in friable and slightly saline soils, meaning it is used as a pasture plant and as a ground cover in many countries, such as Ghana, Zambia, and Australia. However, its short lifespan and vulnerability to insects and frost can make it ineffective.

(ITT) is a concept from the field of Translation Studies. It was established in the 1970s by Danica Seleskovitch, a French translation scholar and former Head of the Paris School of Interpreters and Translators (Ecole Sup√©rieure d‚ÄôInterpr√®tes et de Traducteurs (ESIT), Universit√© Paris 3 - Sorbonne Nouvelle). A conference interpreter herself, SeleskovitchSeleskovitch, D., [1968] 1978. See under Publications. challenged the view prevailing at the time that translation was no more than a linguistic activity, one language being merely transcoded into another. She described translation as a triangular process: from one language to sense and from sense to the other language. She coined the name Interpretive Theory of Translation and, even before Translation Studies became a field in its own right, introduced the process of translation into the vast area of cognitive research. In order to verify the first observations made as a practitioner, Seleskovitch went on to write a doctoral thesis. Soon, a handful of conference interpreters interested in research joined her at ESIT.  Basic Principles  According to ITT, the process of translation is divided into three stages: comprehension, deverbalization, and reformulation; furthermore, deverbalization assumes a vital role between both comprehension and reformulation. ITT first developed on the basis of empirical practice and observation of interpreting. Oral translation lends itself better than written translation to a detailed examination of the cognitive process of translation. Oral speech is evanescent, its sounds disappear instantly, but sense remains. Interpreters‚Äô formulations in another language show clearly that sense is the consequence of comprehension, itself made up of two elements: contextualized language meanings and cognitive complements. So ITT started with the study of oral translation, focusing on comprehension. Soon, however, practicing translators and translation scholars recognized the validity of the theory for written translation and went on to extend it to the study of pragmatic, technical, but also literary texts.See under Publications. ITT found an explanation of comprehension in Piaget‚Äôs assimilation/accommodation principle, according to which to understand, we integrate new information to prior knowledge and this prior knowledge adjusts to the new situation. Comprehension means adding extra linguistic knowledge to linguistic signs, new information constantly enriching extra linguistic knowledge. Later, language philosophers and psychologistsRiesbeck, C. K. & R. C. Schank. 1978, ‚ÄúComprehension by Computer : Expectation-based Analysis of Sentences in Context‚Äù in Studies in the Perception of Language, ed. by Willem J.M. Levelt, and Giovanni B. Flores d‚ÄôArcais,.John Wiley & Sons, pp. 247-294. Searle, J. 1979. Expression and Meaning ‚Äì Studies in the Theory of Speech Acts, Cambridge University Press. Le Ny, J.-F., 1989, Science cognitive et compr√©hension du langage, Paris : PUF. documented this fact in their studies of comprehension. ITT recognized that sense is not contained in any language or text as such but arises from cues given by the language of the written text or oral discourse plus cognitive inputs from the target reader or listener. Here again, various researchers later corroborated this view.Sperber, D. & D. Wilson, Relevance ‚Äì Communication and Cognition, Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1986. Fauconnier, G. & M. Turner, The Way We Think - Conceptual Blending and the Mind‚Äôs Hidden complexities, Basic Books, 2002. Hofstadter, D. & E.Sander, Surfaces and Essences ‚ÄìAnalogy as the Fuel and Fire of Thinking, Basic Books, 2013. Because the emergence of sense depends on the cognitive inputs of individual readers, listeners or translators, it is to some degree an individual matter; its depth will vary according to the knowledge, world experience and ideology of each individual. However, there is a vast area of overlap between the sense understood by each of the communication partners, so that communication is usually established. Speaking of translation (but the same is true for interpretation) translators, acting as mediators between authors who want to communicate and readers who want to understand them, operate in this area of overlap. Readers of the translation will bring their own cognitive complements to the translated text. The translator‚Äôs rendering enables them to discover the text superficially or deeply, in the same way as readers of the original. They may give the text personal interpretations (just as the original readers may do), but these interpretations come as an additional layer to sense; they should not be confused with sense. Polysemy, ambiguity, so often mentioned in Translation Studies, do not appear in oral or written discourse unless consciously engineered by the author. ITT always insisted that, although most words are polysemic in language systems, they lose their polysemy in a given context; the same is true of ambiguity in discourse as long as readers bring to the text the necessary relevant extra-linguistic knowledge. Of all the various possible meanings of a word, only one is apparent when used in a text. At the same time, any ambiguity is ruled out when relevant knowledge combines with contextualized word meanings, resulting in an ad hoc sense. Again, this assertion has been corroborated by various researchers.Winograd , T., Language as a Cognitive Process, Vol. 1 Syntax, London: Addison-Wesley, 1983 1983. Dehaene, S. Consciousness and the Brain ‚ÄìDeciphering how the Brain Codes our Thoughts, New York: Viking Press, 2009. ITT adds one further element, deverbalization, to comprehension and reformulation, the two translation stages usually described: Most of the sounds or graphic signs disappear as soon as comprehension sets in.Seleskovitch, D., 1968, 1975. Lederer, M., 1978, 1981. See under Publications. We all experience deverbalization in everyday communication: we keep in mind facts, notions, events conveyed by words, but we do not retain these words in our memory. The ITT found support for this postulate in neuropsychology, which suggests that language and thought are located in different areas in the brain.Barbizet, J., Etudes sur la m√©moire, deuxi√®me s√©rie, Paris : L‚ÄôExpansion scientifique fran√ßaise, 1966. Weiskrantz L., (ed) Thought Without Language, London : Clarendon Press, 1988. Pinker, S., The Language Instinct ‚Äì The New Science of Language and Mind, London: Penguin Books, 1994. Anticipation of sense, which often occurs in oral communication and oral translation,Chernov, G.V., Inference and Anticipation in Simultaneous Interpreting, Amsterdam: John Benjamins, 2004. is one more proof that, in context and situation, a full verbal support is not always necessary for comprehension to take place. Clearly visible in oral translation, deverbalization is more difficult to observe in written translation because the original text does not disappear, as do the sounds of oral speech. The graphic signs remain on the page and seem to call for direct correspondences in the other language. Deverbalization, a natural feature of oral communication, would therefore seem to require an extra effort by translators. However, when graphic signs are immersed in context, translators interpret them directly into sense. This sense remains present as awareness while the signs fall into oblivion. This enables translators to discover in the target language modes of expression bearing little or no relation to the signs of the original language.Delisle,J., 1980/1988, Isra√´l, F., 1990, Plassard, F. 2007. See Publications. Regarding the reformulation phase, a strict distinction was made, in former translation studies, between literal and free translation, or literality and recreation. ITT based research, however, showed that translation is always a combination of word correspondences and sense equivalences. Initially, SeleskovitchSeleskovitch, D., 1975. See under Publications. noted the existence in interpretation (later also demonstrated for written translation) of two translating strategies: a translation by carefully controlled correspondences of a few linguistic elements between one language and the other, but also the creation in context of equivalences between segments of speeches or texts. No fully literal translation of a text will ever be possible, be it only due to the dissimilarity of languages. Nevertheless, correspondences are often necessary and the fact that correspondences and equivalences coexist in all translation products, whatever the type of discourse may be regarded as one of the universal laws of translational behavior. Taking into account the ‚Äòunderdeterminacy of language‚ÄôQuine, W., Word and Object, MIT Press, 1960, Searle, J., Expression and Meaning ‚Äì Studies in the Theory of Speech Acts, Cambridge University Press, 1979, Atlas, D. Logic, Meaning and Conversation ‚Äì Semantical Underdeterminacy, Implicature and their Interface, Oxford University Press, 2005. ITT refers to the ‚Äòsynecdochic nature‚Äô of language and discourse (a part for a whole). Explicit wording seldom makes sense unless supplemented by an implicit part consciously left unsaid by authors or speakers but understood by readers or listeners. The explicit layer of texts is a series of synecdoches. Linguistic formulation alone does not unlock the whole of sense, it only points to the whole.Grice, P. ‚ÄúLogic and Conversation‚Äù. Cole P. & J. L. Morgan, Syntax and Semantics, Vol. III Speech Acts. New York: Academic Press, 1975: 41-58. Eco, U. Lector in Fabula, Milano: Bompiani, 1979. Sperber, D. & D. Wilson., Relevance ‚Äì Communication and Cognition, Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1986. Since languages differ not only in their lexicon and grammar but also in the way natives speakers express their thoughts, the combination of explicit and implicit parts is not the same in any two languages even though they may designate the same whole. The very fact that language is underdetermined is one more element in support of deverbalization. It gives oral and written translators a large measure of freedom and creativity in their reformulation of authors‚Äô or speakers‚Äô intended meanings. ITT is not therefore a mere abstract construct. It is rooted in practice. Practice enriches theory, which in turn enlightens professional translators, both oral and written, who know what they are doing and why. Explaining the process of oral and written translation in simple terms, ITT appeals to practitioners and is particularly well suited as a pedagogical tool.The European Commission recognized the fact and commissioned Seleskovitch and Lederer to write P√©dagogie raisonn√©e de l‚Äôinterpr√©tation (1984/2002), translated into English under the title A Systematic Approach to Teaching Interpretation (1995). This work was designed to help adhering countries to improve their teaching of interpretation and translation. See also under Publications. Since its inception, ITT is the basis of instruction at ESIT, which has trained innumerable interpreters and translators who go on to apply its principles in their everyday work. ITT also attracts doctoral students from all over the world, whose research demonstrate its validity for all language pairs and all types of texts. ITT‚Äôs main objective is to study translation, but by doing so, it sheds light on the workings of language and communication. As a holistic model of translation, ITT covers the various stages of the translation process, including readers‚Äô expectations and needs. A number of other modelsSkopos Theory (Nord C. 1997), Attention Model (Gile D. 1995), Relevance Theory (Gutt E.A. 1991, Setton R. 1999). study the process from specific angles and add a few details to the theory. However, none of them invalidates the ITT model that, over time, has extended to literary and poetical texts,Isra√´l, F. 1990,1994,2002,2006, Henry, J. 2003, Roux-Faucard, G. 2008.

Foundation  A 16th century legend tells that an old icon of the Virgin, dating back to a previous period and later lost, had been found, nearly painted on the ground and covered with earth among the walls of the castle on the Bonifato; as a devout man wanted it to rise from the ground, he started to pray the Virgin Mary in order that she arose a little and so he could build an altar there. The following day the sacred image was at his desired height, and so the pious man had soon the altar built. The first document which speaks about a Church on this mountain, founded by three Carmelite friars, dates back to 1558 in a deed of the notary P. A. Balduccio. After the discovery of the miraculous icon, mount Bonifato started to be the destination of pilgrimages (called ‚ÄúHoly Journeys‚Äù) by the believers who helped the friars to build or, even better, to rebuild the Church of the Most Holy Lady of the Height in the same place of the recovery.Dialoghi Mediterranei, \\"Intorno al culto della Madonna dell‚ÄôAlto: appunti su un documento inedito\\"  Historical hints  Procession in honour of Our Lady of the Height (at about 1960). The building was about 17 metres long and 7 metres large, with its entrance towards east and the bell tower above it; inside there were two altars, one turned towards the entrance door, with Jesus‚Äô image, and the other towards south, with the icon of ‚ÄúOur Lady of the Height‚Äù. In 1583 the Church was already in a state of neglect, and in order to restore it, in 1643 the hermit Rosario from Palermo began to collect money among the believers, but later, abandoning this project, he moved to Palermo. After a miracle, they authorized the foundation of the congregation of Santa Maria dell'Alto (formed by noblemen, priests, and commoners who immediately undertook the restoration of the Church) governed by a statute approved in 1646 by the bishop of Mazara del ValloCarlo Cataldo, Accanto alle aquile: Il castello alcamese di Bonifato e la chiesa di S. Maria dell‚ÄôAlto, Palermo, Brotto, 1991. The members of the congregation met on Friday and went to the sanctuary to venerate the holy image, then they remained to meditate together with the Carmelites. On Saturday, the day dedicated to the cult of the Virgin Mary, they confessed, received Communion and got back to the town. In 1930, on the initiative of the priest Paolo Amato, the Rector of the sanctuary of that time, they founded a \\"Commission for the Church of the Most Holy Mary of the Height‚Äù, later a Congregation, which is still existing. According to the Statute, its scopes were: * collaborating, together with the Rector, on the religious services in the Church. * be responsible for the maintenance of the building, the adjoining premises and the road leading to the Church. * celebrating the feast of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary, on 8 September every year, with the solemnity given by the cash situation and the offerings of believers. * taking part to the Sacraments on Sundays and the festivities of Our Lord Jesus Christ and the Blessed Virgin Mary, do the Stations of the Cross along the road leading to the sanctuary, on the Saturdays preceding the feast of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary.Carlo Cataldo, La conchiglia di S.Giacomo p.183, Alcamo, ed. The festivity will be completed by the procession with the statue of Our Lady.  Description and works  The Church, which was restored in 1930 for the last time, is with one nave and three altars: the high altar, tha altar of Saint Joseph and that of the Most Holy Crucifix. Among the last modifications, there were a new altar and lectern, desoigned by the architect Vincenzo Settipani. Inside it there are the following works: *Wooden statue of Our Lady of the Height (1993), made by Giuseppe Ospedale (in the sacristy, donated by Pirrello Gaspare) *Wooden statue of Our lady of the Height (1950), made by Luigi Santifaller; on the high altar. *Painting of the Virgin Mary on a zinc sheet, made by Liborio Mirabile, restored in 1930 by the priest Francesco Alesi and worked over by Mariano Coppola in 1982. *Painting of Saint Joseph. *Painting of Saint Francis of Paola. *Painting of Our Lady of Paradise. *Crucifix in papier-mach√©. The original painting depicting Our Lady and the 1644 wooden statue got lost.

These \\"figurelle\\" were placed there in 1703; some years ago the Administration of the Congregation had the new wooden ones made. In the 16th century some girls, dressed like the Virgin Mary and with a black veil, went on pilgrimage as far as the top of the mountain to plead for the coming of rain, as the poet Sebastiano Bagolino says in one of his poems. On 2 November, the day of the commemoration of the Dead, they made a pilgrimage for their souls. The feast was accompanied with the use of torchs and bonfires (‚Äúthe blazes‚Äù, vampi in dialect) which represented a very old propitiatory tradition of fire which is a symbol of purification, like in many popular festivities held in Europe; the flame means also the death of the old sin and the light of the new man after he has received Baptism. In past times, along the streets of Alcamo and above all in via Santissimo Salvatore and Piazzetta Trinit√†, they prepared small altars, and in the evening they sang the litanies of Our Lady of the Height at the light of small oil lamps. This is one of these short prayers: Di lu munti cumpar√¨u Chista amabili Signura e la vitti sant'Elia ch'√® di l'autu Maria (That is: from the mount this lovely Lady appeared, and Saint Elijah saw her, because she is Mary of the Height). The bonfires (li vampati in dialect), scattered at the crossings on the eve, were moments of happiness for the young; nowadays they also make them in the beach of Alcamo Marina and in the countryside surrounding the town, but old traditions have nearly disappeared. Every year the religious events take place between August and September; after a triduum of preparation, the last Sunday of August the believers go, on foot, on a pilgrimage from the Church of the Holy Heart as far as the sanctuary. Then there is a Marian week, with songs, saying of the rosary and holy Masses in the sanctuary, and finally, on 8 September, the feast of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary, they take the statue of Our Lady in procession. After the procession, there is often a recital of chants and poems in dialect, to praise Our Lady of the Height.Erina Baldassano Cataldo, Itinerari in Sicilia - La Bella Alcamo - Religiosit√† e Tradizioni, pp. 56‚Äì57, Trapani, Cartograf, 1991. The parish of the Church of the Holy Heart and the Congregation of Maria Santissima dell‚ÄôAlto have contributed to the improvement of the sanctuary, that today has become a longed-for destination for many pilgrims and believers.

The incident occurred when the British East India Company was fighting the First Anglo- Burmese War (1824‚Äì1826) under the leadership of the governor-general of India William Amherst, 1st Earl Amherst. The mutiny had its roots in British insensitivity towards Indian cultural sentiments, combined with negligence and poor supply arrangements, which caused growing resentment amongst the sepoys of several regiments of the Bengal Native Infantry after a long march from Mathura to Barrackpore. The lack of transport for personal effects and cultural concerns about being transported by sea caused apprehension and when troops from the 47th Native Infantry appeared on parade, the troops refused to march towards Chittagong, unless their grievances were remedied. Attempts to resolve the dispute failed and dissent spread to elements of the 26th and 62nd Regiments. The Commander-in-Chief, India, General Sir Edward Paget, ordered the troops to lay down their arms before considering their requests for redress. When the sepoys refused, their camp was surrounded by loyal soldiers from the 26th and 62nd Regiments and two British regiments. After a final ultimatum, the camp was attacked with artillery and infantry and around 180 sepoys were killed, as were a number of civilian bystanders. In the aftermath, a number of mutineers were hanged and others sentenced to long periods of penal servitude. The 47th Regiment was disbanded and its Indian officers dismissed, while its European officers were transferred to other regiments. The incident was largely suppressed in the media, with only limited information being released to the public but there was Parliamentary criticism of the East India Company government for its heavy-handedness in dealing with the sepoys' grievances. Background=Prelude= During the First Anglo- Burmese War, in October 1824, the 26th, 47th and 62nd Regiments of the Bengal Native Infantry were ordered to march from Barrackpore, a military cantonment in Bengal near Calcutta, to Chittagong in preparation for entering Burmese territory. The regiments had just marched almost from Mathura to Barrackpore and were reluctant to undertake another long march, this time against the Burmese, an unknown enemy. Rumours of magical Burmese prowess spread amongst the Indian sepoys, affecting their morale particularly after the Burmese victory at Ramu. Moreover, these three regiments consisted mostly of high caste Hindus, who had reservations about crossing the sea due to the kala pani taboo. =Immediate causes= Apart from fear and fatigue, what disheartened the sepoys the most was the absence of carriage cattle. Each high caste soldier used his own brass cooking utensils, wrapped in a bundle that also included his bedding. Because of their weight, the bundles could not be carried by the soldiers in addition to their knapsacks, muskets and ammunition. At the time, bullocks were generally used to pull the carts carrying the bundles. For the march to Chittagong, no bullocks could be found, since almost all the available animals had already been purchased for the sea- borne expedition to Rangoon. The few bullocks that were available were of inferior quality and cost exorbitant rates beyond the means of the sepoys, who requested that the government should provide the bullocks or pay them double batta (the allowance paid when in hostile territory) to cover the cost of purchasing them. These requests were disregarded and the sepoys were instead advised to carry whatever they could in their knapsacks and to leave the rest behind. To resolve the situation, commanding officers offered a 4,000 rupee advance to each regiment. The sepoys turned down this offer as it still meant paying baggage charges out of their own pocket. The situation was escalated by threats from a Muslim Indian subedar major, that if they did not stop complaining about the bullocks, they would be sent by sea. Events of the rebellion General Sir Edward Paget ordered an armed assault on a non-violent protest ten minutes after an ultimatum was presented. The 26th Regiment was ordered to march first, followed by the 47th and then the 62nd Regiment. In a last moment change of orders, the 47th Regiment was asked to commence the march on 1 November 1824, followed by the other two regiments who were ordered to start within a week of the 47th Regiment's departure. A parade was held on 1 November, during which the soldiers of the 47th Native Infantry appeared without their knapsacks and refused to bring them even when ordered to do so. They again demanded their carriage bullocks or payment of double batta and refused to march without a redress of grievances. The commanding officer, General Dalzell, was unable to subdue the discontent and proceeded to Calcutta to consult the Commander-in-Chief, India, General Sir Edward Paget. The other two regiments were also affected and twenty Indian sepoys from the 26th BNI and 160 from the 62nd BNI defected to the refractory sepoys of the 47th Regiment. Under the leadership of Bindee Tiwari, the sepoys maintained order during the day and stayed on the parade ground all night, while a petition was sent to Paget, who arrived from Calcutta on hearing of the escalation. Sepoys presented their demands to Paget via an emissary and explained that their act was due to religious scruples and requested to be dismissed from service, if the demands were not met. Paget replied that legitimate demands would only be addressed after the sepoys laid down their arms. This promise of reconsideration was not enough for the sepoys to give up their position. Paget, an old school martinet of Royal Service, considered this refusal an act of armed mutiny. He summoned two regiments of European troops, the 47th (Lancashire) Regiment of Foot and the 1st (Royal) Regiment, as well as troops of the Governor General's bodyguard from Calcutta. He also brought horse artillery from nearby Dum Dum. On the morning of 2 November, the reinforcements and the loyal members of the 26th and 62nd Regiments moved into position. They secretly surrounded the sepoy camp ground and a final message was sent to the mutineers, demanding that they lay down arms before any discussion on grievances but it is said that only ten minutes were offered to make up their minds. The sepoys either hesitated or rejected the ultimatum and Paget ordered two cannons to fire on the rebels, followed by an attack from the rear by the secretly placed horse artillery. Surprised by this sudden assault, the sepoys tried to flee but the rest of the British regiments attacked from all directions. Some of the sepoys jumped into the Hooghly River to escape and drowned, others entered local households for shelter but the loyalists chased them in and killed them with bayonets. Many bystanders, including women and children who happened to be in the neighbourhood, were killed during the operation. Afterwards, it was found that the muskets of the Indian sepoys were not loaded. Stevenson concludes that this implies no violence was intended by the rebels. Casualties Of about killed during the attack, although the death toll is disputed. Bengal Hurkaru, a local semi- official newspaper, published a report in November 1824, stating that the number of deceased was a \\"perfect guess\\". In 1827, Joseph Hume, an opposition MP, reported on the floor of the British Parliament that the number was from the \\"facts that had reached him from India\\". In response Charles Williams- Wynn, a Tory MP, claimed on behalf of the government, that the number was no more Aftermath=Punishment of the mutineers= Most of the remaining mutineers were captured and on 2 November, eleven sepoys were identified as the ring leaders and received a swift trial, where they were sentenced to death by hanging. Six of these were from 47th BNI, four were from 62nd BNI and one was from 26th BNI, who were killed the same day in the parade ground. Around were sentenced to fourteen years' hard labour, in chains, on roads; numerous others were sentenced with lesser terms. On 4 November, by a general order issued from Fort William, the 47th Regiment was disbanded and its Indian officers disgraced, discharged and declared unworthy of the confidence of the government, as it was thought mutiny could not have occurred without their knowledge. All the British officers were transferred to a new 69th Regiment. On 9 November, Bindee was arrested nearby, and suffered the especially harsh punishment of being hung in chains on the next day. His body was left to rot for months in open public display. =Press censorship= Earl Amherst, Governor General of India, was harshly criticised by a British newspaper report. The news of the unrest in Barrackpore, especially concerning the use of violence to subdue a peaceful protest, was suppressed in public media in Calcutta, London and elsewhere. The colonial government maintained its silence except for a short official paragraph published in the Calcutta Gazette on 4 November, where the incident was largely trivialised, with no mention of casualties. Bengal Hurkaru, a local semi-official newspaper under the editorship of a British Deputy Judge-Advocate, also published a short report in November 1824. The report played down the incident and lacked basic details including the cause of the mutiny, stating that they were not allowed to publish such details. Apart from these two reports, common Indians and Britons were largely kept uninformed about the incident, although rumours circulated. =Later criticism in press= The Oriental Herald in London first published a story on the subject almost six months after the incident, calling it the \\"Barrackpore Massacre\\", based on a report by a British correspondent in Calcutta. The Oriental Herald severely criticised British officers for the indiscriminate slaughter, Paget in particular for resorting to violence to suppress a peaceful protest, and demanded increased pay for the sepoys as well the provision of transport for luggage. It also sought a consistent and truthful account of the incident from the government. The report was particularly harsh in its criticism of Amherst, whom it labelled an \\"evil genius\\", blaming him for the escalation. =Consequences= After the massacre, many sepoys deserted British service. A Court of Inquiry was set up to investigate the incident. All that is known about its report was that it agreed that the sepoys had justifiable grievances. Bengal units designated for 'General Service' were given all the concessions that the rebellious sepoys had originally demanded. The 1824 incident created an atmosphere of distrust across the native Indian regiments and irrevocably harmed relations between British officers and native Indian sepoys. No disciplinary measures were taken against Paget or any other officer of the army, contrary to expectations. Amherst came close to being recalled for mishandling the situation but ultimately retained his position. =Debate in British Parliament= On 22 March 1827, a parliamentary debate in the House of Commons discussed the Barrackpore Mutiny. Hume, a Radical MP from the opposition, described the incident to his colleagues, criticising the conduct of the military, and appealed for a fresh investigation to identify those responsible; he perceived that Amherst was showing a lack of will in finding the real culprits. He also alleged that the report of the Court of Inquiry was being suppressed, demanded that the full report be produced in Parliament, and appealed for the House to hear both sides of the dispute and come to a just conclusion.

The 24th Chief of Army Staff of the Indian Army, Major General V.K. Singh (2010‚Äì2012), wrote extensively about the 1824 Barrackpore mutiny. He reflects: The events of 1824 continued to haunt Britons and Indians for many years and many felt that it provided Indian sepoys the rationale to kill British officers in 1857. Memorial Outside view of Binda Baba Temple Bindee became a martyr and a fabled hero among the Indian sepoys especially after his death. To commemorate the incident, six months after Bindee's death, Indian sepoys and locals erected a temple near the site of his execution. Binda Baba temple as it is now known, still stands.

She is thought to be killed in June of 2017 by a US drone strike, but sources are unable to confirm. Early life Jones was born in Greenwich, south-east London. An only child, her parents divorced when she was a young child; her father took his own life shortly after when Jones was ten. Brought up as a Catholic, she participated in Christian youth groups while a teenager, leaving school at 16 and entering employment working for L‚ÄôOr√©al selling cosmetics. A former punk rock guitarist and singer active during the 1990s in an all-female band called Krunch, Jones is reported to have been living on welfare benefits (which she denied) in a council house in Chatham, Kent and to have used a food bank before her departure for Syria. Spending much time on the Internet, she became interested in witchcraft and alternative lifestyles. ISIS Jones converted to Islam and left her previous partner claiming, in social media exchanges with Sunday Times journalist Dipesh Gadher, that the Iraq War had converted her (around May 2013) to the ISIS cause. Together with Junaid Hussain, she recruited and propagandised for ISIS. Jones travelled to Syria with her younger son in late 2013 to join Hussain, originally from Birmingham, who soon became her husband. Hussain was killed by a U.S. drone strike on 25 August 2015, and was formerly in charge of recruiting new hackers to ISIS. After Hussain's death, Jones commented that her husband was killed by \\"the greatest enemy of Allah\\". He was \\"a good role model for my children\\", Jones told Dipesh Gadher. The following month, Jones was one of four Britons placed on the UN's most wanted list at the request of the British prime minister David Cameron. It was, believed to be the first time any country had placed its own nationals on a list of ISIS operatives. Responding on Twitter, Jones said she would continue to fight \\"England...until my last breath\\". Jones's activity online was consistent with her role as leader of the secret Anwar al-Awlaki battalion‚Äôs female wing. In this role, Jones was responsible for training all European female recruits, or muhajirat, in the use of weapons and tactics. These muhajirat were then trained and instructed to carry out suicide missions in the West, according to leaked ISIS documents. Despite some reports, according to Kim Sengupta in The Independent, there is no proof of her leading all-female groups of ISIS members into battle. According to the Counter Extremism Project (CEP), Jones used Twitter to propagandise for ISIS. She is believed to have recruited hundreds of British women to work for ISIS, and in 2016 called on female sympathisers in Britain to make terrorist strikes in London, Glasgow, and Wales during Ramadan. American court documents made available in spring 2017 linked Jones and her husband to at least a dozen ISIS plots, but many of these either did not take place or were stopped. She was involved in publishing online three lists of US military personnel intended as potential targets for jihadists. In fact, Jones even specifically targeted the lives of 100 soldiers. She posted the personal information of these soldiers for the world to see. In other tweets, Jones called out specific soldiers by making their names the subject. Included in this personal targeting was the Navy Seal Veteran who was involved in the killing of Osama Bin Laden. By this time, the American military reportedly considered her a \\"high priority\\" for assassination. Jones‚Äô most meaningful contribution to the organization is thought to be the influence she was able to garner on women globally to join ISIS, specifically on western woman. In fact, in her own words, Jones said she was \\"leading a battalion of jihadist women\\". Probable death and aftermath In October 2017, the Daily Mirror reported that Jones had been killed in an American drone strike in June 2017 along with her 12-year-old son JoJo. While the mother and son are presumed to have been killed in Raqqa while escaping the drone strike, this has not been confirmed because DNA evidence has not been recovered. The pair were believed to be on their way to Mayadin, predominantly ISIS filled. According to Shiraz Maher, Jones is the first woman to be directly targeted in an airstrike, and one of only two women considered at the time by the American state department as a foreign terrorist combatant. Jones had decided to raise her younger son, JoJo, as an ISIS child soldier. Her former partner in August 2016 said their son had participated in a video in which JoJo, along with four other boys, had shot five Kurdish hostages in the back of the head. Jones issued a statement saying it was not her son. Jones and her husband regularly used their son as a human shield to prevent being targeted by drone attacks. The legal case for JoJo's and his mother's killing is contested because his age means he would be classified as a \\"non- combatant\\". According to guidance from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Jones may not be considered a member of ISIS (she would be a legitimate target if she was), because she did not carry out a \\"continuous combat function\\". Amnesty International said the killing of Jones and her son was of \\"questionable legality\\". An older son, aged 20, remained in the UK. JoJo's reported death was disputed in November 2017 by Syrian sources. However, in January 2018, Dipesh Gadher of The Sunday Times wrote of an \\"informed source\\" who had told him \\"it‚Äôs 99.9% certain that they were both killed\\". A member of \\"The Beatles\\" terrorist group, Alexanda Kotey, said on ITV News in late May 2019 that Jones and her son were killed in a building which was shelled on 25 May 2017, a few days after the Manchester Arena bombing.
