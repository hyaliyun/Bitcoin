Viro tsässon was a Passover Day tsässon.Võrumaa24 History The chapel that once stood at this location was dedicated to the Transfiguration of our Lord, a holiday celebrated on August 6th in Hilläkeste, Palandõ and Viro villages. In 1994, the walls of the building were still standing, but the roof had already fallen in. In spring of 2000, Priit Laanoja cleared the place from decayed logs and only a stone cross that was in the tsässon was left on the premises. The Chapel According to the data from the dispatch office of Friedrich R. Kreutzwald’s Memorial Museum, Viro tsässon was a building of horizontal beams with quadrangular layout. The beams were manually hacked by an axe and the floor was made from beams hacked in half. The roof was made from shingles and had a cross on it. By 1974, all that was left was the icon room, the entrance- room had been torn down earlier. The dimensions of tsässon: length 3.6 metres, width 3.4 metres and height 2.85 metres. V. Talumees believed that the stone cross that was in the tsässon dates back to the founding of Petseri monastery (15th-16th centuries). The cross has letters written on it that are unreadable.

He travelled widely over the Caucasus region collecting and studying various different plant life. He is most known for Pteridophytes and Spermatophytes species. Biography Alexander Alfonsovich Grossheim (or Grossgeim) was born in Lichovka (also known as Lykhivka in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast). He was an expert on the flora of the Caucasus. After graduating from University of Moscow with a doctorate in 1912, he became the director of the Azerbaijan Institute of Botany. In 1919, he described Fritillaria grandiflora, which later re-classified as a subspecies of Fritillaria kotschyena and Fritiallaria tatianae. From 1929 he moved to the Tiflis (Tbilisi) Botanic Garden in Georgia. He still carried on plant collecting expeditions in the Caucasus. Between 1928 and 1934, he recorded up to 5767 plant species (out of the 6200 recorded species) in his volumes of Flora Kavaza (Flora of the Caucasus, 1928-1934). In 1939, he started a second volume with annotated maps.David G. Frodin In 1946, Grossheim was appointed curator of the Caucasian Herbarium at the Komarov Botanical Institute in Leningrad (Saint Petersburg), and also director of the Department of Plant Systematics and Morphology at St. Petersburg University. When he died in 1948, he was still working on the second edition of his Flora Kavkaza, which was continued by his colleague Andrej Fedorov. Losina-Losinskaya named Fritillaria grossheimiana in his honour, but this is now thought to be a synonym of Fritillaria crassifolia subsp. kurdica. The genus Grossheimia Sosn. & Takht.

The system consisted of two routes (numbered 1 and 2) which connected the city centre with Dalga Laka industrial estate in the southern part of the city. Trolleybuses did not operate in the historic part of the city centre. In November 2008 trolleybus service was shortened due to road construction works of the Kachitsa intersection. Service to the industrial estate was suspended and trolleybuses operated on a loop route within the inner city. In March 2009 expansion of the construction site created a gap in the overhead wiring which required the suspension of all trolleybus services. Initially announced as temporary, the closure became permanent. The overhead wires were dismantled in 2016. The system was served by a total of 15 vehicles from the type ZiU-682V built between 1987 and 1989. All 15 trolleybuses were scrapped in 2011. In the 1980s there was a project to connect Veliko Tarnovo's trolleybus system with the trolleybus system of neighbouring towns Gorna Oryahovitsa and Lyaskovets which was under construction at that time.

She considers it her mission to demystify female genitalia in Japan where, according to her, they are \\"overly hidden\\" in comparison to phallic imagery.  Background  On her website, the artist described how, growing up, she had never seen other women's genitalia, didn't know what they should look like, and was therefore concerned that her own vulva was abnormal. At first, when she began to use a mold of her vulva to create dioramas, she treated the idea light-heartedly.\\"I make art pieces with my vagina, which I would rather call Manko (MK). I thought it was just funny to decorate my vagina and make into a diorama, but I was very surprised to see how upset people get when they see my works or even hear me say the word Manko.\\" However, after receiving a lot of criticism and backlash, she began to use her art as a statement. She would like women to be able to speak about their bodies without shame, and believes that the vulva should be a \\"part of the body ... no different from arms or legs\\". She would like to make the vulva something that is \\"casual and pop\\", saying, \\"[The] vagina is treated like it's something underground and hidden, so I want to industrialize and mass-produce it.\\" Her pseudonym, Rokudenashiko, is a combination of rokudenashi (\\"reprobate\\", \\"bastard\\", \\"good-for-nothing\\", \\"ne'er-do-well\\") and the diminutive feminine suffix -ko (usually translated as \\"girl\\" or \\"little\\"). It therefore roughly translates to \\"little brat\\". Art Igarashi has made many vulva-themed works, including a chandelier, a remote control car, necklaces and iPhone cases. The small dioramas are part of series called \\"Decoman\\" (a play on the word manko, Japanese for \\"cunt\\"). Much of her art was confiscated during a police raid, but photographs document her work. Looking to make something larger, Igarashi considered making a door, and a car, before settling on a kayak, inspired by the connection between female sexuality and the sea. She made a kayak based on a 3D scan of her vulva. She paid for this project through a crowdfunding campaign, sending the 3-D data of the kayak to all donors who contributed over ¥3,000. Igarashi also created a cartoon character named Manko-chan (translated as Miss Pussy). Manko-chan has been made into manga, figurines, stuffed animals, and a full-size costume. = Books = * Rokudenashiko, What is Obscenity ? The Story of a Good for Nothing Artist and Her Pussy (Koyama Press, 2016), tr. from Japanese original by A. Ishii () Legal trouble In July 2014, Igarashi was arrested and spent 10 days in a Tokyo women's prison for the alleged violation of Japanese obscenity laws, for e-mailing the 3D scanner data of her vulva in March to people who supported the crowdfunding campaign to build the kayak. More than 21,000 people signed an online petition urging the government to free her. She was released a week later after having successfully appealed her detention. On 3 December 2014, Igarashi was arrested for suspicion of displaying an obscene object, along with Minori Watanabe (who uses the pseudonym of Minori Kitahara), a writer, feminist activist and sex shop owner. Watanabe was later released. On 24 December, Igarashi was indicted and planned on pleading not- guilty, according to her lawyer. She was charged with \\"obscenity display\\", \\"obscenity electromagnetic record\\", and \\"obscenity electromagnetic recording medium distribution\\". On 26 December 2014, she was released on bail. Her trial began 14 April 2015 in Tokyo District Court. On 8 May 2016, the court handed down its decision. She was found not guilty of the charges related to the kayak, on the grounds that the sculpture, with its bright color and decoration, \\"did not immediately suggest female anatomy\\", in the words of the BBC report. However, she was found guilty of the charges related to the 3D data, and was fined ¥400,000 (roughly US$3,500), about half what the prosecution had suggested was appropriate. If she had been found guilty then she would have faced up to two years in jail and fines up to ¥2.5 million. Her case drew international attention. For instance, The Daily Show host Jon Stewart noted that in Japan, female reproductive organs remain taboo while there is a festival dedicated to the penis. The documentary #Female Pleasure by Swiss director Barbara Miller accompanied Igarashi during the trial. The film is a portrait of five women committed to a self-determined female sexuality, including the artist. Personal life Igarashi married Mike Scott, the frontman of The Waterboys, in October 2016. Their first child, a son, was born on 2 February 2017.  Disputes  Many disputes about women's rights, artistic freedom, censorship, and double standards in Japan due to Igarashi's arrests . One is that Igarashi is exposing the absurdity of Japan's obscenity law as representations. For instance, male genitalia are shown at shrines and festivals (such as the Kanamara penis festival) as well as pornographic images of children in manga and anime are still at large. According to The Guardian, \\"How can it be OK for comics to publish underage pornography but illegal to invite people to 3D scan your vagina?\\" After the announcement of the verdict for her second arrest, more than 1,000 tweeted expressing anger and questioning the logic of the court. Igarashi says \\"The vagina has been long regarded as obscene while the penis is considered pop\\" . From The Guardian who quoted Watanabe, \\"Japan is still a society where those who try to express women’s sexuality are suppressed, while men’s sexuality is overly tolerated\\".

Having little education and never having taken an exam, he joined the British Navy. Whilst there, he took a drawing correspondence course and was eventually admitted to Walthamstow College of Art, entering the fashion department. Wedge describes hat design as being \\"like sculpture\\". Wedge then did a two-year course at the Royal College of Art.Interview with James Wedge, February 2006. Victoria & Albert Museum, 2014. Retrieved 15 July 2014. Hat designer At the first end of year show, he did all the hats and drew the attention of the designer Ronald Paterson, who asked him if we would like to do hats for his collections. As they were all couture hats, Wedge designed extreme creations to showcase his talents and garner publicity. Liberty of London offered him a free workshop if they could have first choice of what to sell in his shop, although he was allowed to sell the rest elsewhere. Working out of a small house at 4 Ganton Street starting in about 1962, his staff grew to seven people. He was also able to help his art school friends Sally Tuffin and Marion Foale start as designers. Top Gear and Countdown Together with Pat Booth, he set up the boutique Top Gear on the King's Road, London. He also set up Countdown, also on the King's Road, where the rents were low. Wedge preferred the area to Carnaby Street where he didn't appreciate the fashion. They bought their stock in very short runs from local craftwork suppliers. According to Wedge, Mick Jagger's famous white frock, worn at 1969's Stones in the Park free concert in London's Hyde Park came from Countdown. Influence Wedge helped Marion Foale and Sally Tuffin become established as designers and retailers. According to Tuffin, to make their clothes, they \\"worked on the billiards table in Jimmy Wedge's flat\\". According to Foale, Wedge had his offices in Ganton Street and told them about a place round the corner in Marlborough Court with a low rent. Soon, they needed more space, so Wedge found space for them above him, and when he moved out, they took over 4 Ganton Street in its entirety.Interview with Marion Foale and Sally Tuffin, April 2006. Victoria & Albert Museum, 2014. Retrieved 15 July 2014. Photography By 1970, Wedge and Booth both believed that the King's Road scene was over and Wedge moved into photography, as did Booth soon after. Wedge was already friendly with David Bailey and especially Terence Donovan, and was persuaded by Donovan's lifestyle - driving a Rolls-Royce, with a model on his arm - to change career in the late 1960s. Wedge had become friends with an actress who purchased her clothes from his Top Gear boutique, and she had bought her husband a camera that he did not want, so Wedge bought it from her.

Casualties reported include 24 dead and 160 injured. Early reports suggested a power surge or a terrorist attack to be the cause of the derailment, but both were soon dismissed. This accident was the deadliest ever recorded in the history of the Moscow metro system, and the second to occur due to a technical failure (after the 1982 Aviamotornaya escalator accident). Background interactive map) The Moscow Metro, being one of the busiest in the world and serving up to nine million passengers on a daily basis, covered of route and included 194 stations at the time of the derailment. Despite having a reputation for reliability, the system has been increasingly suffering from mismanagement, cost-cutting practices, poor maintenance and outages in recent years. According to several media reports, a Facebook user announced that two weeks prior to the disaster, he filed an official request to the head of the underground system reporting \\"problems with the tracks.\\" The user quoted from the reply received in his e-mail: \\"The tracks are maintained in conformity with the technical standards and tolerances. Problems with mechanical switches in the joints have not been detected, being that the size of the gaps correspond to the technical regulations.\\" Derailment An 81-740/741 series train, similar to that involved in the accident The derailment occurred away from the Park Pobedy station outbound towards the Slavyansky Bulvar station, near the railroad switch to a then-unused track for the western section of the Kalininskaya Line. The switch was installed a few weeks prior to the accident, as part of a construction project initiated in 2013 that was working to extend the Kalininskaya Line to the western part of Solntsevo District. Surviving passengers who were unable to cross the debris were evacuated through several construction drifts leading to the surface shaft. The derailment also caused a massive power outage on the line; another train, which was located in the tunnel at the time of accident some from Slavyansky Bulvar, was also stuck, and passengers had to be evacuated. There were no medical injuries reported from that train. Early reports cited a power surge as the cause of the accident, but this has not been confirmed and remains under investigation. Passengers on the train described cars striking one another, with most of the impact occurring at the front of the train. The first car, where all of the deaths reportedly occurred, had jackknifed in on itself, and the cars behind it piled up on each other. The final two cars remained on the tracks and were only slightly damaged. Victims There were 24 killed in the accident (22 initially, 2 in hospitals), and about 118 were hospitalized. Seventeen of the victims were Russian citizens, and the remaining victims included 2 citizens of Tajikistan, 2 citizens of China, and one person each from Ukraine, Moldova and Kyrgyzstan. About 42 people remained in \\"serious condition\\". Another 200 people were evacuated from the Metro; those with injuries were attended outside the station. Initial reports stated that an additional 20 passengers remained underground, trapped in one of the cars. The train operator, a 29-year-old man, survived the crash, but was badly injured and had to undergo cranial surgery. An accident witness reported to a news agency: A spokesperson for the transport commission indicated that all passengers were \\"evacuated from the affected stations by midday\\". Terrorist threat was suspected, but quickly dismissed in this case. In the early morning of 17 July, personnel finished clearing away the debris and reported another casualty. In total, 17 corpses were removed from the debris, with the remainder of the victims succumbing to critical injuries within 24 hours of rescue. The tunnel was reportedly ready for repairs and night time maintenance as of 1:00 am local time on 18 July and restored to full functionality around 6:00 am. Investigation On 15 July 2014, the Investigative Committee of Russia opened a criminal investigation of the accident, according to part 3 of Article 263.1 of the Criminal Code (violation of the requirements of transport safety). Supervising examination of the accident site, investigators interviewed witnesses and employees. , the Committee's official representative, said that several causes for the accident were being considered, but that all were technical, there being no connection with terrorist attacks. He stated that certain people would be investigated and suspects would be identified. On 16 July 2014, a senior track master and his assistant, who had worked on the installation of the new switch, were detained on a charge of negligence. According to investigators, they installed it incorrectly two months previously using a wire instead of special equipment to forcibly lock the switch, as it led to a yet incomplete tunnel.Two suspects detained in Moscow metro accident case Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation. This wire could have failed and gotten the switch stuck in an intermediate position, derailing the train. Unprofessional operation of the train was said to have been another contributing factor, as the previous train that had passed over the switch 3 to 4 minutes before the accident had been traveling at a lower speed, and thus had not derailed. On 22 July 2014, Ivan Besedin, chief executive of the Moscow Metro, was removed from office by Mayor Sergey Sobyanin. Besedin was replaced by former chief executive of the high speed railway branch of Russian Railways, Dmitry Pegov, in order to restore Muscovites' faith in the metro safety. Verdicts The first trial on the matter ended and the verdicts were announced on 9 November 2015. Track master assistant Yuri Gordov was sentenced to 6 years of imprisonment, track repair deputy director Aleksei Trofimov, senior track master Valeri Bashkatov and deputy director of the subcontractor company \\"Spetstekhrekonstruktsiya\\" Anatoli Kruglov each were sentenced to 5.5 years of imprisonment. There is a separate investigation involving six additional defendants that was still ongoing at the time of conclusion of the first trial.

He reigned from 1875 to 1903. Despite long lasting resistance his rule ended up being conquered by the Dutch colonial state (Dutch East Indies). Colonial invasion Tuanku Muhammad Da'ud was the son of Tuanku Zainul Abidin and the grandson of Sultan Alauddin Ibrahim Mansur Syah.Zainuddin (1961), pp. 421, 429. When his father and grandfather died in rapid succession in 1870, the throne went to a prince from another branch, Alauddin Mahmud Syah II. This was a period of strong colonial expansion in Southeast Asia. Dutch fear of involvement by some other foreign power in northern Sumatra led them to pursue an aggressive policy vis-à-vis the hitherto independent Aceh, which resulted in the outbreak of the Aceh War on 26 March 1873. During the Second Aceh Expedition in 1873-74, the capital Kutaraja was occupied by the colonial troops. Alauddin Mahmud Syah was evacuated by his retainers but died of cholera on 28 January 1874. Three days later the commanding general Jan van Swieten declared Aceh's inclusion in the Netherlands Indies state territories, believing the war had come to an end. However, the Dutch immediately met with continuing resistance from all strata of society.Missbach (2010), pp. 44-6. Symbolic resistance leader Sultan Muhammad Daud Syah after submission in Banda Aceh, 20 January 1903 After the death of Alauddin Mahmud Syah the fugative state administration was dominated by Tuanku Hasyim, Panglima Polem of the XXII Mukims, the Panglima of the XXVI Mukims, and Sri Setia Ulama. The first two were descendants of earlier sultans but not proper claimants to the throne. In their communication with the ulamas (religious leaders) and uleëbalangs (chiefs) they strongly appealed to the religious duty of fighting the \\"infidel\\" Dutch, combined with an emerging Acehnese patriotism. In conformity with the customary laws, the elite appointed Tuanku Muhammad Da'ud as the new sultan on 4 March 1875. His name on the throne was Sultan Alauddin Muhammad Da'ud Syah Johan Berdaulat. The enthronement ceremony took place in the mosque of Lam Teungoh in Aneuk Galong. This was an important step as it seemed to show that Aceh still had a central government. Tuanku Hasyim acted as mangkubumi (regent) for the young sultan who took up residence in Kota Dalam (Keumala Dalam) in the Pidië area. He was eventually declared of age in 1883.Alfian (1976), pp. 148-50. His principal wife was Tengku Gambang Gading, daughter of his kinsman Tuanku Abdulmajid; he was also married to Pocut Manyak Cot Murong and Tengku Jam Manikam. The further course of the war Meanwhile, the war continued unabated. The common enemy united many of the elite of the old capital, chiefs, religious leaders and other people in an unprecedented way. For long periods the Dutch-occupied area was restricted to 20 square kilometers around Kutaraja. Among the most important resistance fighters was Teungku Chik di Tiro who gained the sultan's trust and received a royal seal. After his death in 1891 the Acehnese attacks on the Dutch position decreased. In the 1890s the Dutch tried two ways to come to grips with resistance: either to co-opt local leaders, or to apply new and efficient anti-guerrilla tactics. These strategies slowly gave effect and the sultan and Panglima Polem had to move further towards the north-west coast of Aceh to avoid capture.Missbach (2010), pp. 46-9, 54. The role of the sultan The personal role of Alauddin Muhammad Da'ud Syah in the struggle has been debated. The well-known Dutch scholar Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje regarded him as a non-entity of little consequence for the conduct and outcome of the war: \\"The young sultan, gradually emerging from childhood, soon showed that he aspired to something very different from sharing the weal and woe of his country as leader of the contest against the Gompeuni [the Dutch]. True to the traditions of his house, he sought and still seeks diversion in lawful and unlawful love, drink, fiddling, fights of animals, gambling and the pursuit of elephant and deer.\\"Snouck Hurgronje (1906), Vol. I, p. 147. Later scholarship, on the other hand, has taken a more positive view of his contribution. The sultan was described as a cheerful and handsome man with a royal demeanour towards his chiefs, while at the same time being polite and attentive towards the people with whom he came in contact. He appealed to Russia to grant the sultanate protectorate status and aid it in repelling the Dutch East India Company. The Sultan's request was rejected, and Aceh was eventually conquered by the Dutch.https://www.rbth.com/arts/2017/05/03/when-hawaii-aceh-menorca- nearly-became-russian-territories-755464 At his court he kept some Dutch and Indonesian deserters from the colonial army who were trusted to undertake errands and even taught the sultan some Dutch songs.Alfian (1976), p. 150. It was still his distant kinsman Tuanku Hasyim who exerted most of the power at the court while serving as viceroy. As long as Tuanku Hasyim was alive there was no question of surrendering to the colonial troops. The sultan's cousin and father-in-law Tuanku Abdulmajid surrendered to the Dutch in 1887, but this did not have any effect on the devotion of the sultan and viceroy. The well- known resistance fighter Teuku Umar was appointed sea commander (amirul bahri) of the west coast by the sultan but made a deal with the Dutch in 1893 and began to actively fight the Acehnese troops. The sultan sent a letter to Teuku Umar accusing him of apostasy. This, together with other factors such as the influence of his wife Cut Nyak Dhien, caused Teuku Umar to return to the sultan's party after a short while.Alfian (1976), p. 154-5. Surrender Sultan Muhammad Daud Syah grave in Rawamangun, Jakarta. Tuanku Hasyim died in 1897 and Teuku Umar was killed in 1899. In the same year General J. B. van Heutsz attacked Pidië and forced the surrender of many leaders. After a bloody defeat at Batei Ilie in 1901, the sultan and Panglima Polem fled to the Gayo highlands where the Dutch troops had not yet set foot. Van Heutsz sent the ruthless Major Van Daalen after them with a Marechausse Corps. They were unable to capture the sultan, however.Rep (1996), p. 87. In 1902 the Dutch managed to capture the principal wife of the sultan, followed a month later by his second wife Cot Murong and one of his sons. Alauddin Muhammad Da'ud Syah was presented with an ultimatum: if he did not surrender within a month his family would be exiled from Aceh. The sultan finally gave in. He inquired to the Dutch authorities whether he would be exiled if he surrendered. This presented a dilemma for Van Heutsz who had previously agreed with his main political advisor Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje that the sultan should be ignored and that consequently no negotiations should take place with him. Van Heutsz nevertheless gave a grudgingly approving reply to the sultan's question: \\"Well, goddammit, what should I now answer to that?\\" (Ja, godverdomme, wat moet ik daar nou op antwoorden?). After instructing his principal chiefs to keep on fighting, the sultan met with the Dutch in the forest of Merasa Ië Leubeuë on 10 January 1903 and was taken to Kutaraja. Van Heutsz arranged for a highly publicized ceremony of surrender where a life- size photo of Queen Wilhelmina was displayed in the hall, and he received the sultan from a podium.Rep (1996), p. 88. Panglima Polem followed suit in September in the same year. Snouck Hurgronje was furious with Van Heutsz for disregarding his advice. However, these two surrenders broke much of the remaining resistance, although the Aceh War continued on a lower scale until about 1910-12. The Dutch provided the sultan with a comfortable house and a monthly allowance of 1,200 guilders. In 1907 it was revealed that the sultan had secretly helped plan attacks on Dutch positions. The colonial authorities therefore resolved to exile him to Java and then to Ambon Island.Alfian (1976), pp. 160-3. In 1918 he was allowed to settle in Meester Cornelis (Jatinegara) in Batavia. The ex-sultan died there on 6 February 1939 and is buried in Rawamangun. He left a son, Tuanku Raja Ibrahim, who died in 1982.

It was directed by Nitin Bose for New Theatres Calcutta Production. The film starred K. L. Saigal, Leela Desai, Najmul Hassan, Prithviraj Kapoor, Nemo and Jagdish Sethi. The music was composed by Pankaj Mullick and the lyrics were written by Arzu Lucknavi. Nitin Bose besides directing also wrote the story and wielded the camera for the film. The dialogue writer was Sudarshan. The story subject about tuberculosis was suggested as a propaganda film by Viceroy Lord Linlithgow and his wife, who were then the Chairman and Patron of King George’s Tuberculosis Fund. The film is about two friends who want to marry the same girl unknowingly till one of them discovers he has tuberculosis. He decides to sacrifice his love but ends up in a sanatorium where he is treated. Story Mohan (K. L. Saigal) and Gita (Leela Desai) are friends and discover they are in love. Gita visits Mohan at his house regularly and they also rendezvous at night by the lakeside where they listen to a tramp on his violin. Mohan is making plans on increasing his allowance while Gita is worried about his health. Mohan works at a radio station as a singer. His boss (Jagdish Sethi) at the radio station is rough and kind in turn. Mohan’s friend Dr. Kedar (Najmul Hassan) is also worried about his health and repeatedly suggests Mohan take a rest from work and the city for at least a year. He advises Mohan not to think of getting married till that time. Gita’s mother (Devbala) and Aunt (Manorama Sr.) have found a suitable boy Dr. Kedar, for Gita without her knowledge. They invite him for tea where he brings Mohan with him. Mohan realises the set-up and leaves the house asking Gita to meet him at their usual place. He tells Gita that it’s time for them to stop meeting and wait for some time. Gita is upset and refuses to let him complete his conversation. Mohan starts developing daily evening fevers and he tells Dr. Kedar over the phone, Kedar insists on taking care of him but Mohan refuses. Dr. Kedar visits Gita as they have planned to see a film together. However, Gita takes him to the rendezvous place where they are seen by Mohan. A distraught Mohan rushes from there not caring whether he lives or dies. He meets a doctor who is an assistant (Bikram Kapoor) at a sanatorium run by an old doctor (Prithviraj Kapoor). The doctor forces Mohan to come with him to the sanatorium. At the sanatorium after initial hesitation Mohan becomes interested in the working and finances of the hospital. The Chief says that they can’t forcibly treat TB patients but maybe in the near future it may be rendered compulsory and then maybe they can get help. But first they have to make the people aware of the problem. A radio station comes to their help to set up a connection from the sanatorium. Since Mohan was in the first stages of TB he starts improving and sings on the radio to make an appeal. The song is heard by Gita who has a nervous breakdown. Dr. Kedar sees this and understands about Gita and Mohan. He tells Gita’s mother that if she truly wants to help her daughter then she will try to understand her needs and see what it is that Gita really wants. On gaining consciousness Gita takes the car and speeds in it to the sanatorium. Kedar sees her and follows. Gita’s car meets with an accident outside the sanatorium. She is brought in unconscious and wounded. Mohan was planning to leave for a couple of days to attend what he thinks is the marriage of Kedar and Gita. The Chief who’s heard his story earlier stops him and takes him to where Gita is lying covered in bandages with Kedar by her side. Kedar happily points out Mohan to Gita. The Chief leaves them telling Mohan to make sure that Gita never drives rashly again. Mohan promises. Cast *K. L.

The overall games and transport concept were considered excellent, as many venues were already homologated by the FIS, and the competitions would have been staged in two main zones one an hour by road from the other, or just 40 minutes by train. The airport is located just 15 minutes away. Other issues rated favorably were: a single Olympic Village which would form part of an urban development project on the lakeside, excellent facilities planned for the media, and US$780 million budget guaranteed by the Swedish government. However, the evaluation report listed some problems that might have occurred. The ski jumps were planned to be constructed, but the amount of space reserved for seating would have to be reviewed, as the commission deemed it inadequate to cope with 40,000 spectators. Environmental impact assessment had not been carried out for several sport venues and the site chosen for bob and luge track was in a residential area, which might have caused problems with access and spectator capacity.

It consists of herbaceous perennials with brittle upright or drooping stems, found in dry areas of Mexico and the southern United States. Description Species of Mabrya are herbaceous perennials with fibrous roots. They have brittle stems, usually pendant and forming mats, although more upright in M. erecta. The stems branch and become woody at the base with age. Unlike related genera, such as Maurandya and Lophospermum, the leaf stalks (petioles) are straight and do not twine. The leaves are rounded or kidney shaped, generally with broad, somewhat rounded teeth. The flowers are borne individually on stalks (peduncles) that are usually horizontal or ascending. The sepals are joined at the base; where their margins become free, they curve back on themselves. Together the sepals form an urn-shaped calyx. The flowers consist of five petals joined at the base to form a tube. The free lobes of the petals are differentiated into two upper ones that curve backwards and three lower ones that either point forward or also curve backward. The flower tends to be whitish at the base and is then cream, yellow, pink, red or reddish violet. There are four fertile stamens, of two different lengths, and one rudimentary infertile stamen. The stamens and style are either held inside the flower or protrude. The stigma is forked. After fertilization, the two-chambered capsule contains tan or dark brown seeds. Taxonomy The genus Mabrya was created by Wayne J. Elisens in 1985 to separate out a number of species previously placed in the genus Maurandya. The type species is Mabrya acerifolia. The generic name honours Tom J. Mabry for his contributions to phytochemistry and chemotaxonomy, which Elisens says \\"have substantially increased our understanding of the North American flora.\\" Mabrya is placed in the tribe Antirrhineae. The drooping or upright habit of the brittle stems distinguishes Mabrya (together with Holmgrenanthe) from the closely related genera Lophospermum, Maurandya and Rhodochiton, which have longer, flexible stems and climb by means of twining leaf stalks (petioles). The ovary of Mabrya is bilocular (i.e. has two compartments) unlike the unilocular ovary of Holmgrenanthe. =Phylogeny= A number of molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that subtribe Maurandyinae, defined by Elisen to consist of the five North American genera Holmgrenanthe, Lophospermum, Mabrya, Maurandya and Rhodochiton, forms a monophyletic group, which is related to the Old World genera Cymbalaria and Asarina. Gehebrehiwet et al. suggested that the Maurandyinae could be expanded to include Cymbalaria and Asarina. Vargas et al. presented the following cladogram in 2013: Vargas et al. concluded that the Antirrhineae evolved in the Old World and subsequently colonized North America more than once, probably in the Miocene epoch (). One such colonization led to the evolution of the Maurandyinae (in Elisen's sense). =Species= , The Plant List accepts six species: * Mabrya acerifolia (Pennell) Elisens * Mabrya coccinea (I.M.Johnst.) Elisens * Mabrya erecta (Hemsl.) Elisens * Mabrya flaviflora (I.M.Johnst.) D.A.Sutton * Mabrya geniculata (B.L.Rob. & Fernald) Elisens * Mabrya rosei (Munz) Elisens Elisens treated Mabrya flaviflora as a subspecies of Mabrya geniculata; it was later raised to a full species by David A. Sutton. Distribution and habitat Distribution of Mabrya species All the species are found in very dry areas, typically in shaded cliffs or canyons. Mabrya acerifolia is native to the Sonoran Desert in a small area about across in south central Arizona. All the other species are only found in Mexico, in the Sonoran Desert (M. geniculata and M. flaviflora, the latter only in Baja California Norte), the Chihuahuan Desert (M. coccinea and M. erecta) and in the states of Jalisco and Zacatecas (M. rosei). Ecology Although observations of pollinators are limited, Elisens suggests that most Mabrya species are pollinated by hummingbirds; other possible pollinators are long-tongued bees. The nectar composition of most species resembles that of related species known to be hummingbird- pollinated, being high in sucrose and low in glucose compared to fructose.

He was a cousin and friend of Thomas Chalmers, the prominent Scottish minister. Through his business he was a friend and associate of the publisher Archibald Constable and, through Constable, an associate of Sir Walter Scott. Cowan owned and ran the huge Valleyfield paper-works in Penicuik in Midlothian. Life The grave of Alexander Cowan, Grange Cemetery Cowan was born at Valleyfield on the edge of Penicuik on the banks of the North Esk. He studied physics and chemistry in Edinburgh, and decided to improve the process of paper-making, setting up what was then one of the world's largest mills, which operated for 150 years. He married Elizabeth Hall, daughter of George Hall, a merchant in Crail, in Fife, in 1800. The couple had several sons, all involved in the family business. Their first child, Charles, was born in 1801 at their house at 12 Charlotte Street, the first of Cowan's eleven children, eight of whom survived to adulthood. Cowan moved his family to Edinburgh in 1811, which some accounts connect to the illness of his wife Elizabeth. By 1814, when their son John was born, they were living at 5 John Street, a house just off the Canongate, but not part of the Old Moray House as recorded in some records. Elizabeth died on 21 March 1822. In 1830 he married Helen Brodie. Soon after he opened a paper shop at 17 Princes Street in Edinburgh city centre. At the same time he moved a short distance, but to a far grander house, Moray House on the Canongate. He is known to have been a friend of the botanist Daniel Ellis during this period. His sons also rose to prominence. Charles Cowan and James Cowan became MPs representing Edinburgh, and Sir John Cowan was created a baronet in 1894. Cowan is buried in the Grange Cemetery in Edinburgh against the original west wall close to the monument to Andrew Usher. His grave is marked by a large monument, dwarfing even that of Usher. He is buried with his second wife. His first wife is buried in Penicuik. His family continued in the paper industry, but his main company of Cowan & Co. was taken over by David Chalmers in the late 19th century. Philanthropic works The Valleyfield Monument erected by Alexander Cowan Among Cowan's philanthropic acts was funding the reglazing of every window on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh, having been disturbed by the poverty he saw there. In 1797 he set up a public library in Penicuik, one of the first free libraries in Britain. During the Napoleonic Wars, Penicuik had three separate camps for French prisoners of war between 1803 and 1814. As a result, in 1810 the government commandeered Cowan's mills at Valleyfield for use as a prison for captured sailors and \\"kidnapped foreign civilians\\". The Cowan house was used as a prison hospital. During this time the buildings were expanded by the architect Robert Reid. Meanwhile Cowan continued paper-making on the River Esk at Melville Mill. Although the government had purchased his mills, he was able to renegotiate their purchase after the war, having retained the water supply rights which were critical to their operation as mills. Paper manufacture resumed in 1820. The two Robert Reid buildings were expanded and converted to residential use for the large Cowan family. It was named Valleyfield House. Afterwards, around 1830, Cowan commissioned Thomas Hamilton to design a memorial to the memory of the 309 prisoners who died there, erected on a mound near Valleyfield. The monument bears the inscription \\"All Men Are Brethren\\". In 1832 during the cholera epidemic in Edinburgh, Cowan is said to have sat with victims on the Canongate to comfort them. Through his agency the village was supplied with gas lighting from 1845 to 1877, Valleyfield Mills being one of the first large factories to have a gas supply (from 1830). In 1809, Cowan improved the existing water supply of Penicuik; afterward, by legacy, he further provided for the establishment of a new water supply which was effected in 1864 with water from the Sillerburn. In 1851 he set up a village museum in Penicuik within the mill complex. The contents were removed when the mill was taken over by the Reed Paper Group in 1976. Family Of Cowan's sons, Charles Cowan (1801–1889) was Member of Parliament for the city 1847-1852, Alexander Cowan (1804-1831), died young leaving a volume of poetry entitled the Remains of Alexander Cowan. Remains of Alexander Cowan: Consisting of His Verses and Extracts From His Correspondence and Journals, Thomas Constable 1839, James Cowan (1816-1896) served as Lord Provost of Edinburgh from 1872 to 1874, and as Member of Parliament for the city from 1874 to 1882, and his daughter Lucia Anne married the publisher Thomas Constable, son of Archibald Constable. Alexander’s great grandson and namesake Alexander Cowan FRSE (1863-1943) was a papermaker, as were most descendants, but also a noted amateur botanist, specialising in alpine plants. Another great grandson, Robert Craig Cowan (1865-1937) was also a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. The Cowan Institute The Cowan Institute, Penicuik His will left monies to Penicuik sufficient to build the Cowan Institute (later Penicuik Town Hall) in his memory. This was not organised until 1893 to a design by Archibald Campbell Douglas, the husband of Cowan's great grand-daughter, based on Old Moray House and the Canongate Tolbooth.

The number of participants was reported at 500–700, but according to the Ghanaian physician Edward Na, who participated in the events, there were at most 150 protesters. The ambassador of Ghana in the Soviet Union John Banks Elliott requested a militsiya protection of the Ghanaian embassy. This was the first recorded political protest on Red Square since the late 1920s. Background Edmund Assare-Addo was a 29-year-old student of the Kalinin Medical Institute. His body was found in a stretch of wasteland along a country road leading to the Moscow Ring Road. African students alleged that he was knifed by a Soviet man because Assare-Addo courted a Russian girl. The African students based their allegation on the unlikelihood of a student venturing into that remote place. The Soviet authorities stated that Assare-Addo froze to death in a snow while being drunk. According to the autopsy, performed by Soviet medics with two advanced medical students from Ghana as observers, the death was \\"an effect of cold in a state of alcohol-induced stupor\\". No signs of physical trauma were found, with the possible exception of a small scar on the neck. Discussing the incident with Soviet officials, Elliot indicated the Western embassies in Moscow (\\"the U.S., England, France, the FRG, or even Holland\\") as the probable instigators of the incident. Elliot went so far as to suggest that students who \\"behaved poorly\\" and \\"skipped class\\" should be expelled from the Soviet Union. Before the students' march to the Red Square Elliott alleged that the students broke into the Ghanaian embassy and damaged furniture and pictures. Protest The protesters were African students studying in Soviet universities and institutes. Having assembled on the morning of 18 December 1963, they wrote a memorandum to present to Soviet authorities. The protesters carried placards with slogans \\"Moscow – center of discrimination\\", \\"Stop killing Africans!\\" and \\"Moscow, a second Alabama\\", while shouting in English, Russian, and French. The protesters marched to the Spasskiye Gates of the Kremlin, where they posed for photographs and gave interviews to the Western correspondents. The Soviet TASS news agency responded with a statement: \\"It is to be regretted that the meetings of the Ghanaian students which began in connection with their claims to the embassy of their country resulted in the disturbance of public order in Moscow streets. It is quite natural that this is resented by the Russian people\\". On 20 December, the students returned to classes and militsiya ceased the protection of the Ghanaian embassy.

It is a province-aided museum which receives support from the Government of the Western Cape Province. History Sendinggestig c. 1830s The South African Sendinggestig Museum is housed in the oldest indigenous mission church in the country built by local Christians. In 1801, the Board of Directors of the South African Society for the Advancement of Christ's Kingdom acquired a property in Long Street, Cape Town, for 50,000 guilders. The existing buildings were demolished and the Sendinggestig built. It was inaugurated on 15 March 1804 by Rev. J.P. Sеrumer of the Dutch Reformed Church's Groote Kerk, Cape Town congregation. The Sendinggestig was not originally used for worship services. Instead people went there for prayer meetings, Bible studies or other religious and literacy classes. For this reason it was not called a church, but a “gestig” or “oefeninghuis” which is the Dutch equivalent of an American “meeting house”. Twenty years later it did become a fully-fledged church. This congregation included the poor, Khoekhoen or Khoikhoi and Slaves who converted to Christianity. =Building= Restoration in progress c. 1978 The museum building is architecturally unique as it was South Africa's first building in the form of a basilica with an Apsis. All its windows are small scale replicas of this floor plan. It has the only surviving example of a steeply pitched lime-concrete roof - a form of construction developed at the Cape specifically for flat roofs. Its façade features Corinthian pilasters carrying a moulded Cornice and a Gable with a circular ventilator and four Urns. By the 1970s the building was in a dilapidated state and required major restoration work to both its exterior and interior. During the winter of 1977 storms caused more damage and part of its northern wall collapsed. Restoration work began in 1978. The restoration team was able to reproduce the building's 1830s Facade according to a contemporary print by Frederick Willem de Wet. The historical interior of the church was also faithfully reproduced, including replicas of the wall-paintings discovered during the restoration process. =Slaves and the Sendinggestig= 220x220px Since its construction the South African Gestig was closely linked to slaves. Between 1801 and 1804 slaves and free-blacks demolished the existing house on the property and cleared the site. They built the walls with stones from the Vlaeberg quarry and bricks they made. Some assisted the carpenters working on the building while others painted its walls with lime wash made with slave-labour. The front steps and floor were made from Robben Island slate. The roof used to be water-proofed with Whale oil. Celebrating the Emancipation of the Slaves in 1838 After the Sendinggestig opened its doors in March 1804 slaves were encouraged to attend prayer meetings there. However, these prayer meetings could not be held at the same time as church services or inconvenience slave-owners. From early 1813 “heathen” children, including slave children, were taught to read and write there on Wednesdays and Fridays. From July 1813 adult slaves could come to an evening school at the Sendinggestig after finishing their day’s work and if their owners allowed it. In 1818 the South African Mission Society was granted some land in Somerset Road to use as burial ground for converted slaves. Slaves that were buried there received a funeral service and dignified burial. Before this most slaves were buried in unmarked graves in Cape Town’s pauper burial sites. The Emancipation of Slaves in the British Empire, which was implemented at the Cape in 1838, caused an influx of people to Cape Town in search of work, and this led to the growth of the Sendinggestig. =History of the SA Gestig Congregation= Members of the Congregation c. 1975 Slave-owners weren’t keen to have their slaves baptised as Christian converts could not be sold. Mostly freed slaves were therefore baptised and could then become members of the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NGK). This led to the directors of SA Mission Society establishing their own congregation. It was called the SA Gesticht congregation of the SA Missionary Society. In 1820 Jacobus Henricus Beck became its first minister. On 24 December 1820 the first baptism was held at the Sendinggestig. Domingo, slave of Mr Hammes, Job, slave of Mr Stronck, Arend, slave of the widow Pauelsen and Durenda, slave of the widow Stegman, became the first members of the congregation. The Church Choir and Brass Band c. 1916 In 1831 the stable-building behind the church was converted into a small double-storeyed home for the church's caretaker. The congregation began using the store next to the church as a school in 1839. This school would operate until 1917. The building was also used as a venue for the congregation's church bazaars. In 1895 the school was moved to the second storey and different businesses rented the ground floor as extra income for the congregation. During the 1930s it served as the office of the African People's Organisation. By 1901 the SA Gestig congregation had 1 153 members. The congregation had a brass band and choir. Its members actively participated in a variety of associations including the Christian Sisters Association (\\"Christelijke Susterbond\\"), the Christian Young Daughters Association (\\"Christelijke Jongdogtersbond\\"), the Children's Association (\\"Kinderbond\\") and Youth Brigade (\\"Jeugbrigade\\"). The Final Church Service at the Sendinggestig in August 1975 From 1922 a well-known member of congregation, Anna Tempo (or Sister Nannie as she was commonly known), worked with women and girls living on Cape Town's streets. She established \\"Nannie Girls' Rescue Home\\" as a shelter for them. During the 1930s the SA Gestig church became the spiritual home for domestic workers who came to Cape Town from different rural areas. In 1937 the SA Gestig congregation became part of the Dutch Reformed Mission Church and was supported by the South African Missionary Society until its dissolution in 1983. By 1954 only 520 members remained as people moved away to the suburbs to find work and due to urban racial segregation. Distance and economic circumstances made it difficult for members of the congregation to keep attending church in Cape Town. By the end of the 1960s the buildings fell into disrepair, there were misunderstandings between the church council and directors of the SA Mission Society and uncertainty about the Group Areas Act. The church, old school and care-taker's home were all sold to the Metropolitan Hotel in 1971 with the provision that the congregation could use the church for another 5 years. Sendinggestig Museum Interior The SA Gestig congregation had to find a suitable piece of land for building a church in a “Coloured Group Area”. Until their new church was completed in Belhar the congregation shared Cape Town's St Stephens Church from 1975-1978. A special memorial service was held on 31 August 1975, during which the congregation bid farewell to their original church in Long Street. The new church in Belhar was inaugurated in 1978. This would become the site where the Belhar Confession was produced. The Museum The South African Sendinggestig Museum (also known as the Slave Church), is a church museum located in Long Street, Cape Town, South Africa. During the 1970s The S.A. Sendinggestig Museum was established as a result of an interest group advocating saving both the building and preserving the legacy of the Christian Missionaries in the then Cape Colony (Dutch). Reverend Van der Merwe Married the February Couple at the Sendinggestig in 1958 The building was therefore bought for the purpose of establishing a museum, funded by the then Provincial Administration of the Cape of Good Hope. Additional funding for this project was raised by the Simon van der Stel Foundation, a local heritage conservation body, and members of the public. The SA Sendinggestig Museum opened its doors in March 1979.  Function and Themes  The theme of the museum is Christian missionaries and the impact the missionaries had on slaves and the indigenous people of South Africa. Exhibitions at the museum also carry themes about the history of the South African Gestig Congregation, the history of the museum building and Christian mission work and mission stations.  Other Activities  Youth Event Hosted at the Museum The former South Africa Gestig churchgoers, their families and museum staff members work together to ensure that the museum's content becomes more representative. In addition to this the museum hosts events aimed at the Youth and, via different communities promote social inclusion and cohesion.

El programa del CCCB was a television programme based around the activities organized by the Centre de Cultura Contemporània de Barcelona with the aim of creating a documentary essay. It was co-produced by the CCCB and RTVE and was broadcast monthly on La 2 from 2010 to 2015. The first programme aired in October 2010. Nowadays it is broadcasting weekly in its YouTube channel, keeping its original aim and opening itself to new collaborations with universities, cinema schools and external filmmakers.  Format and style  Editing archive material and interviews as a leading thread, it experiments with television formats. The programmes invite criticism and reflection while remaining enjoyable and dynamic, introducing irony with a hint of transgression of discourse and editing. The idea of hosting different opinions about issues and the absence of a narrator mean that more questions than answers are raised. Rather than a cultural agenda of the CCCB, this is a space for creation that is more or less independent of the activities that take place at the centre.  Directors and collaborators  The programme direction varies with each episode. The most regular directors to date are Andrés Hispano and Félix Pérez-Hita, previously directors of Boing Boing Buddha (BTV) and Baixa Fidelitat (XTVL). However, other collaborators have also played this role, including Juan Insua, Judit Carrera, Elisabet Goula, Jorge Luis Marzo, Arturo “Fito” Rodríguez, Ingrid Guardiola and Antonio Monegal. Each programme contains contributions by different collaborators.

His father bought five-acres of land in Mandatory Palestine in 1934 in response to the emergence of Nazi Germany and the growth of Antisemitism. The family drew up plans to flee to Palestine in 1938 following the Anschluss of Austria. Asher Ben-Natan fled Austria first. He boarded a Panamanian-registered ship in Piraeus, Greece, from which he sailed to Palestine. The ship dropped the passengers off at Tantura, where he swam to the beach.

The film tells a story of how a couple experiencing troubles in their marriage had their situation worsened when a cursed homosexual friend visits them. The film is in two parts. The first part tells a story of how a previously promiscuous husband (Charles) became the love interest of his obsessive homosexual friend (Alex). Further, it establish that despite him refusing the advances of his gay friend, Alex persisted and eventually raped his friend. The second part of the film explored what led to the homosexuality.  Plot  Charles (John Dumelo) and Whitney (Tonto Dike) are a young couple with kids. However, their marriage is blurred by the frequent extra-marital affairs by Charles. After being caught in the act with his secretary, Whitney decided to call it quit. Despite conflicting advice from her friends, Flora (Halima Abubakar) and Rina, she eventually accepted an apology from her husband for the utmost time. As a way of rejuvenating their marriage, Charles and Whitney decided to go on a vacation. At the hotel, they walked into one of Charles past lovers, which got Whitney irritated. Charles encounted his friend from University of Ibadan, Alex (Muna Obiekwe) who resolved the issue after some personal conversation with Whitney. After the vacation, Alex took Charles out for lunch and he began discussing with Charles on the benefits of being gay or bi as a man and countered the religious sentiment of Charles on homosexuality. He ended the conversation by opening up to him that he's attracted to men. He continued making sexual advances towards Charles, who got uncomfortable by the provocative text, calls and touch. When it became clear that Charles wouldn't reciprocate his advances, Alex tricked Charles into believing he will remain just a friend and got him to attend his birthday party, where Alex drugged and raped him.

Marinova quarry is mining and crushing construction dolomite. The area contains mostly Upper Devonian series clastic rocks. Carbonate rocks in south- east Estonia and carbonate rock outcrops are very rare in that area. The outcrops can be seen in Mõniste parish on the bank outcrops of Peetri River and on a small bench north of Meremäe village. The rock outcrops from the same formation are situated in Meremäe rural municipality, in the old limestone quarry of Tiirhanna and Marinova dolostone quarry. According to the geological studies of Marinova mineral deposit, the upper half of the roughly ten metre thick dolostone deposit of Pskov formation is heavily crushed and karstified. The dolostone bed mined in the quarry is up to ten metres thick, half of which is above groundwater level, half of it below. The groundwater is not pumped out of the quarry and the rock below groundwater is mined by underwater explosion. The dolostone above groundwater level is characterised by strong crushing and the crumbling of the upper part of the deposit. Dolostone settled below groundwater level is less crushed.Eesti maavarad There are karst caves roughly one metre high and wide in the limestone deposit. In the southern end of the quarry, one can observe many local bends in the walls of the quarry, which can be associated with the sag of rock layers above the karst caves. The nearby Belka River valley has aided the water running between the cracked rocks and therefore, the formation of extensive karst phenomena. There are numerous springs on the west slope of the valley that feed from the water traversing Marinova quarry dolostones. At the same time, it is not quite certain as to why the upper part of dolostones is that much cracked in the Marinova quarry area. The tectonic processes could have had a crushing influence on the open dolostones in the Marinova quarry.digira.ee References Category:Dolomite formations Category:Karst caves Category:Landforms of Võru County Category:Meremäe Parish Category:Mining in Estonia ","title":"Marinova dolostone quarry"},{"id":"43305647","text":"Isabel Tisdall (née Gallegos, 19 November 1911 – 27 July 2007) was a British- based textile designer, who influenced domestic and commercial interior design through Tamesa Fabrics, which she founded in 1964, and via her work with Edinburgh Weavers from the mid 1950s. Prior to that, she had a successful career as a fashion stylist, including a period as fashion editor of Vogue. Early life and career The daughter of a British mother and Spanish artist father, Isabel Gallegos was born and educated in Rome. Her career began in the late 1930s as a stylist at Elizabeth Arden's London salon and she was then headhunted to work at Vogue, which she did throughout the war. In 1941, she married Hans Tisdall (born Hans Aufseeser), a textile designer and German émigré who had been working in Britain since the 1930s. During her tenure at Vogue, Tisdall is said to have spotted the talent of photographer Norman Parkinson, also championing the photojournalism of Lee Miller and becoming a friend and supporter of Cecil Beaton. She spent some time at Harper's magazine in London, before returning to UK Vogue as fashion editor. Move into textiles In the mid 1950s, Alastair Morton of Edinburgh Weavers asked for Tisdall's help in rebranding the company. This she did over the succeeding seven years by producing striking publicity brochures and recruiting a series of notable designers, including sculptors Elisabeth Frink and Marino Marini, abstract painters William Scott and Keith Vaughan and op art pioneer Victor Vasarely. =Foundation of Tamesa Fabrics= Tisdall founded Tamesa Fabrics in 1964, enlisting Marianne Straub – then combining a role at Warner & Sons of Braintree with teaching at Central School of Art and Design – to design most of the woven fabrics alongside Frank Davies. While prints were included (many designed by her husband Hans Tisdall), the core focus was on texture. Initially operating from a tiny showroom near Sloane Square and later moving to a customised showroom in World's End, Tisdall had spotted a niche since most woven fabrics at that time were being imported. With the initial collection offered in natural and restrained colours and in fabrics such as silk, cotton, wool and rayon, she designed the range specifically to appeal to the contract and commercial market. Fabrics were woven by Warner & Sons and Tamesa had the flexibility to create short runs, custom die to specific briefs and add fireproofing and other protective coatings to fabric. A 1968 article in Design, the Design Council's journal, said: \\"For years, interest in textiles has been concentrated on printed designs. The work of Tamesa Fabrics has changed all that, giving woven fabrics a standing\\". In Twentieth Century Pattern Design, Lesley Jackson notes that Tamesa: \\"made a point of offering an alternative to the prevailing Pop styles\\". The company's work was quickly championed by architects, with the first major order coming from Howard Kenton and further orders from the Design Research Unit, an influential consultancy headed by Milner Gray and Misha Black. Tamesa focused on commercial work, with early projects including fabrics for Queen Elizabeth Hall, the British Embassy in Paris, the QE2 and BEA's Trident aircraft. Fabric commissions also came from the new universities, including University of York and University of East Anglia. Overseas sales were strong, including a notably large order of of jacquard fabric for a Jordanian youth and sports organisation. Tisdall began including the work of furniture designers, including John Makepeace, in her showroom, also exclusively importing Korean warp printed silks. By 1968, she had begun some manufacturing in Europe (this was to avoid Common Market tariffs in place in the 1960s), and in 1976, she established a branch of Tamesa in Brussels. Tisdall continued working with Tamesa Fabrics until the age of 74, selling the company to Osborne & Little in 1985.

History Piusa Ancient Valley Holiday Complex is situated in the former place of Väiko-Härma mill. Väiko-Härma mill was established by Aleksander Laanberg (later changed to Laanemäe through Estonianization) around the 1930s, he attained the building site on the right bank of the river. He made a contract with Voldemar Vider, the owner of the left bank to use the bank, by paying 20 poods of rye a year. The mill had two sets of stones. One set of stones was able to grind 300-400 kilos of dry grains in an hour. Besides milling, the following services were provided: spalting - that kept the roofs in the neighbourhood in order, a circular saw made it able to manufacture shingles and fence rails, a planer was used for making smaller woodwork. The mill lake had pikes, perches, burbots, roaches, brown trouts and crayfish in it. In 1963, the mill belonged to “Võidu” sovkhoz, the miller was Kusta Klaas, who, as a knowledgeable expert, fixed up the mill. The mill ran until 1972. In 1946, a new house was built near the mill (the current holiday house), where Laanemäe family lived until 1961. After that the building was empty.puhkemaja.ee Today After the farm had been inherited and given away several times, it eventually made it to Laanemäe’s son Koit.

Terrace Herbert S. Terrace (born 29 November 1936) is a Professor of Psychology and Psychiatry at Columbia University. His work covers a broad set of research interests that include behaviorism, animal cognition, ape language and the evolution of language. He is the author of Nim (1979) and Why Chimpanzees Can't Learn Language and Only Humans Can (2019). Terrace has made important contributions to comparative psychology, many of which have important implications for human psychology. These include discrimination learning, ape language, the evolution of language, and animal cognition.  Background  = Early life = Terrace was born and raised in Brooklyn as the youngest child of two Polish immigrants. He attended Stuyvesant High School in New York. His interest in science was instilled by an older sister, Dr. Dorothy Krieger, who won a Lasker Award for her research in endocrinology. = Education = Terrace obtained a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology (1957) and a Master of Arts in Experimental Psychology (1958) from Cornell University, where he was a Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation Fellow (1957–1958). His mentor during graduate studies was Julian Hochberg. He obtained his PhD in Psychology (1961) from Harvard University, where his mentor was B. F. Skinner. At Harvard, he was a USPHS Pre-Doctoral Fellow (1959–1961)  Contributions to psychological theory  = Discrimination Learning = Learning by trial and error is a basic feature of conditioning theory. For his doctoral dissertation, Terrace showed that it was possible to train a discrimination without any errors. He did this with pigeons who learned to discriminate two narrowly spaced stimuli by starting with a large distance between the discriminative stimuli that was gradually reduced. When a discrimination is trained with errors, subjects exhibit frustration. Such aversive effects are absent when a discrimination is trained without errors. Skinner cited a similar difference in the case of the teaching machine, a device he invented to train human subjects to learn different types of technical material. The teaching machine introduces a new topic with simple questions that are gradually made more difficult. Subjects who learn with few or no errors do not exhibit the frustration they would have experienced had they learned by trial and error. = Ape Language and The Evolution of Language = Terrace joined other leading behaviorists challenging Noam Chomsky's theory that only humans can learn language and grammar. With Project Nim, he attempted to teach a chimpanzee (Nim Chimpsky), to learn American Sign Language (ASL). Sign language was used because of the physical limitations of a chimpanzee's vocal apparatus. Nim’s vocabulary grew steadily and he began to combine signs. However, analyses of videotapes of Nim signing with his teachers showed that most of his signs were cued by a teacher’s prompts. Terrace concluded that the only reason Nim (and other chimpanzees) signed was to obtain rewards. Were it not for his teacher, Nim would try to grab a reward directly. When that failed, Nim's only alternative was to sign. Anticipating his signing, Nim's teachers unwittingly made one or more appropriate signs, about a quarter of a second before he signed. Terrace also showed that prompting explained the signing of other chimpanzees who were trained to use ASL. Because chimpanzees only signed to obtain rewards, their signing was, by definition, limited to the imperative function of words. That differs fundamentally from its declarative function, which is to name objects conversationally. Imperatives are a miniscule portion of human vocabulary. If human communication were limited to imperatives, language would have never evolved. Initially, Terrace hoped that combinations of a chimpanzee’s signs would provide evidence that it could create a sentence. What Project Nim showed, however, is that a chimpanzee cannot even use signs declaratively. Until a chimpanzee can learn words, he concluded that it’s pointless to ask if it can create a sentence. The negative results of Project Nim posed two questions: why cannot a chimpanzee learn language, words in particular, and which of our ancestors was the first species to use words? To answer the first question, Terrace cited recent discoveries by developmental psychologists who showed that, infants experience two non-verbal relations with their caretakers, intersubjectivity and joint attention before they learn to name objects. He argued that the absence of those precursors in chimpanzees is the best explanation for their failure to learn words. To answer the second question, Terrace integrated hypotheses by an anthropologist and a linguist who suggested that the caloric requirements of Homo erectus’ large brain was the motivation for their invention of words. Meat was the most efficient way to get those calories. Because Homo erectus could not hunt, they had to scavenge large animals. That required a group effort, in which a scout had to inform members of his group about the location of a dead animal they could not see. Because it required displaced reference, such communication was assumed to be the occasion for the first use words. Although Project Nim confirmed Chomsky’s view that language is uniquely human, it showed that the use of grammar was not sufficient to distinguish language from animal communication. The use of words, specifically, the ability to name objects, was also necessary. Chomsky argued that grammar was the result of a recent mutation and that the origin of words remained a mystery. Terrace argued that language originated with words, which are as different from the signals that animals use to communicate as words are from grammar. Unlike Chomsky, who argued that language was the result of a mutation, Terrace argued that words could be explained by natural selection. = Animal Cognition = Although chimpanzees cannot learn language, there is evidence that their behavior, and that of other animals, is more intelligent than behavior that could result from conditioning. Since Descartes, it has been generally accepted that animals cannot think because they do not have language. To explain intelligent behavior in animals without language and without the principles of conditioning, Terrace argued that it is necessary to show that they can represent objects, that is, solve a problem in the absence of external cues that can guide their behavior.  Serial Learning  The simultaneous training paradigm differs from the traditional successive training paradigm in which subjects execute a sequence by responding to individual stimuli, which appear successively as, for example, learning which way to turn at successive choice points in a maze. When learning a sequence by the simultaneous training paradigm, monkeys were shown an array of photographs on a touch-sensitive video display. On each trial, the position of the photographs varied randomly. As a result, subjects could not rely on its physical location as an external cue for determining to which photograph it should respond first, second, and so on. Instead, they had to memorize the order of each photograph. Because the simultaneous training paradigm requires the subject to represent each item’s ordinal position, it provides an opportunity to study animal cognition. In the early 80s, Terrace helped organize an international conference on animal cognition at Columbia University that discussed the simultaneous training paradigm and other instances in which animals are able to represent stimuli. Since then, animal cognition has become a dominant area in comparative cognition. In 1985, Terrace began a primate cognition laboratory in which he studied how monkeys use representations in various serial learning tasks, for example, to respond in the correct order to ascending and descending series of numerically defined stimuli, to acquire serial expertise [the ability to become progressively better at learning arbitrary sequences] and to imitate another monkey’s sequential performance.  Metacognition  Terrace also studied a monkey's ability to think about its own behavior, that is, its ability to engage in metacognition. In humans, metacognition is assessed by asking subjects how certain they are about their knowledge of a particular topic, for example, how well they did on an exam. To assess metacognition in monkeys, Terrace devised a task in which the monkeys had to place a “bet” that was commensurate with their confidence in the accuracy of a response on a cognitive task. Following each response, monkeys learned to select a “high confidence” symbol if their response was correct and a “low confidence” symbol after an error. They did so correctly even when the appearance of the confidence symbols was delayed for as much as 5 sec after a trial ended. This was the first demonstration that a monkey could think about its behavior.

In 1794, the town appropriated funds to build a bridge near the mill of Jabez Rockwell and John Prentiss. In 1874, the town appropriated $1,000 to replace that structure; the present bridge was presumably built soon afterward. It remained in service on the Chester Turnpike until 1955.

An Algol- like eclipsing binary, the star system varies between apparent magnitudes 7.09 and 9.08 in just over 778 days (2 years 48 days), which is generally too faint to be seen with the unaided eye. This is mainly due to the system being an eclipsing binary (that is, one star passing in front of the other star and resulting in a change in brightness). The eclipse itself dims the star by two magnitudes and lasts around 104 days. Dutch astronomer Willem Jacob Luyten noted this star to be variable in 1935. Minima were retrospectively identified in old photographic plates from 1913 and 1919, and then observed by Howarth in 1936. Initially thought to be an R Coronae Borealis variable, its true nature as an eclipsing binary became clear in the 1940s. The primary component is a yellow supergiant, whose spectral type has been calculated as either F5Iab/b or F4Ib. It is intrinsically variable, varying in brightness by 0.02 magnitude. It has pulsations of two periods, 92.5 days and 64.8 days in length. It has been classified as a UU Herculis variable—a class of yellow supergiant with semiregular variability. These stars are thought to have affinities with Cepheid variables and lie near the instability strip on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram. The secondary was identified as an M-type star from TiO (titanium oxide) absorption bands visible during the eclipses. The BL Telescopii system lies outside the galactic plane and has a high space velocity; it is a runaway star.

It is a nearly- intact example of a late-Georgian early-Federal vernacular house, dating to the time of the construction of the \\"Fourth New Hampshire Turnpike\\", a major early highway through this region of central New Hampshire whose route is followed here by Route 4A. The house was long used as a tavern, and one of its early owners was Daniel Noyes, a proprietor of the Turnpike. Meetings of the Turnpike's owners are known to have taken place here. A later owner, Nathaniel Stickney, was also a stagecoach driver on the route. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. The tavern is located north of the village center of Springfield, on the west side of NH 4A. It is set at an angle to the road, which has been realigned since the tavern was built. It is a large 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. Brick chimneys rise through the front roof face. The main facade is five bays wide, with sash windows arranged symmetrically around the center entrance. The entrance is simply framed, with a transom window and slightly flared lintel. The interior has had only modest alterations, most notably the movement of a wall on the ground floor to increase the size of the room that originally housed the kitchen. Many original fixtures and finishes survive on both the first and second floors.

Springloops was also the name of the company behind the service until it rebranded to 84kids in May 2013. Springloops can be used both from the command line and through a web-based graphical interface shared with BamBam!, Chime and Anchor apps from 84kids. Springloops offers two kinds of paid plans: Personal, with 3-6GB of disk space and 10-25 repositories, and Business, with 12-60GB of space and 50 to unlimited repositories and a range of extra features. The service also provides a free plan for teachers available upon direct request via email (presumably with no limits on the account), as well as a free plan with 1 repository and 100MB of space. All plans start with a 14-day free trial. History Springloops launched in late 2006 as an SVN version control and deploy and was gradually growing into a full-scale project management application. v2.0 was released in June 2009 with new interface and features: tasks, time tracking, wiki module and Git support. On May 5, 2013, the service was upgraded to v3.0 and received a heavy graphical overhaul. The core features were extracted into four separate apps (probably for marketing reasons): BamBam! (tasks), Chime (time tracking), Anchor (wiki) and Springloops which retained its original allocation of source & deploy tool. The apps can be used separately or integrated within one account, depending on user needs and profile. The software’s account settings also mention Turbine, described “discussions and note-taking for teams.” It’s been greyed out and labeled “Coming soon” since the division, however. Post- upgrade controversy The v3.0 upgrade spawned a wide range of reactions, especially due to drastic changes in UI and UX. In September 2013 the company released a major update which was a direct response to the feedback from users. The team wrote: If we were to describe the changes in one word, it would be usability. We collected all feedback we’ve received from you since the redesign in May, analyzed it and introduced tons of UI improvements all around the system. It looks better, works better and certainly feels better to work with. Integrations Pre-v3.0 iterations of Springloops allowed integration with Basecamp Classic project management software. The current version does not allow any third parties in favor of the other apps by 84kids that altogether form one integrated project management platform for web and software developers. At the moment Springloops does not provide an open API that could be used for custom-made integrations, although the company states that works on API have commenced and are currently in progress. Users can, however, configure web hooks to send data and trigger events on designated URLs.

The death sentences concerned 11 people who allegedly attempted to assassinate Moroccan King Hassan II. Soviet authorities complied with the embassy's request to ignore extraterritoriality and remove the students by force, but later ignored the Moroccan ambassador's demand to punish the students. Protest The students forced their way into the embassy, which was then located on Moscow's Gorki Street (now Tverskaya Street), and occupied a wing of the building. The protesters carried placards demanding the immediate release of the convicted men. They said they would stay until 10 a.m. 19 March combining sit-in with a hunger strike. In the evening five officials from the Soviet Ministry of Education tried to persuade the students to abandon the demands. To the chagrin of authorities in Morocco, the embassy eventually asked the Soviet government to ignore extraterritoriality and storm the building to remove the students by force. Soviet authorities complied with the request. However, later, when the Moroccan ambassador asked that the students lose their stipends and be expelled from the Soviet Union, the Soviet government quietly shifted all the stipends to public organizations’ accounts, and replied that it had no jurisdiction over these organizations’ scholarships.

An Enterprise Cognitive System makes a new class of complex decision support problems computable, where the business context is ambiguous, multi-faceted, and fast-evolving, and what to do in such a situation is usually assessed today by the business user. An ECS is designed to synthesize a business context and link it to the desired outcome. It recommends evidence-based actions to help the end-user achieve the desired outcome. It does so by finding past situations similar to the current situation, and extracting the repeated actions that best influence the desired outcome. While general- purpose cognitive systems can be used for different outputs, prescriptive, suggestive, instructive, or simply entertaining, an enterprise cognitive system is focused on action, not insight, to help in assessing what to do in a complex situation. Key characteristics ECS have to be: # Adaptive: They must learn as information changes, and as goals and requirements evolve. They must resolve ambiguity and tolerate unpredictability. They must be engineered to feed on dynamic data in real time, or near real time. In the Enterprise, near-real time learning from data requires an agile information federation approach to ingest incremental data updates as they occur, and an unsupervised learning approach to ensure that new best practice is leveraged across the organization in a timely manner. # Interactive: They must interact easily with users so that those users can define their needs comfortably. They may also interact with other processors, devices, and Cloud services, as well as with people. In the Enterprise, interactions are controlled via existing workflows and UIs. Therefore, embedding best practices directly into these existing interfaces, in the context of a specific step, is critical to ensure maximum end-user adoption. # Iterative and stateful: They must aid in defining a problem by asking questions or finding additional source input if a problem statement is ambiguous or incomplete. They must “remember” previous interactions in a process and return information that is suitable for the specific application at that point in time. In the Enterprise, business context is often structured by a business process, and therefore sufficiently data-rich to make relevant recommendations without significant iterations from the end-user. A stateful memory of overall interactions across communication channels is critical for understanding of context, as a static profile will not capture intent and outcome potential the way behavior does. # Contextual: They must understand, identify, and extract contextual elements such as meaning, syntax, time, location, appropriate domain, regulations, user’s profile, process, task and goal. They may draw on multiple sources of information, including both structured and unstructured digital information, as well as sensory inputs (visual, gestural, auditory, or sensor-provided). In the Enterprise, Context is fragmented and must be aggregated across data types, sources, and locations. In most business environments, such data is captured in existing enterprise information systems, and the effort is linked to quickly source and unify such information. It is rare to have to directly process sensor, audio or visual data in real-time as direct input into the enterprise cognitive system. Instead, these data types are captured by Enterprise Applications and pre-processed into a binary or text format prior to consumption by the System.

Biography Hideo Saito was born May 23, 1902 in Akashicho, Chūō, Tokyo, the second child of Hidesaburo Saito, an English-language researcher. Since 1906, Saito was raised in Ichibanchō (then Gobanchō), Chiyoda, Tokyo. When he was twelve, he became interested in music. The first instrument he played was the mandolin. At the age of 16, Saito started playing the cello under the tutelage of a musician in Imperial Household Ministry. After attending the Gyosei Junior High School, Saito entered Sophia University. In 1922, however, he left university to study music in Germany. On his way there, he was accompanied by then-famous composer and conductor Prince Hidemaro Konoye who was the younger brother of pre-war Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe. After spending six months in Berlin, Saito moved to Leipzig to study cello with Professor Julius Klengel at the University of Music and Theatre Leipzig. In 1927, Saito returned to Japan and was appointed principal cellist of the New Symphony Orchestra. He also appeared as a soloist. In 1930, he returned to Germany for more studies, this time studying with Emanuel Feuermann at the Musikhochschule in Berlin. After two years of intensive study, Saito returned to Japan and resumed his work as principal cellist of the New Symphony Orchestra. In September 1936, Joseph Rosenstock was appointed permanent conductor of the New Symphony Orchestra. This appointment was to have quite an impact on Saito's musical life. He later confessed that he had learned so many things from Rosenstock. During that period, he was an active solo and ensemble player and was on his way to establishing a conducting career. In 1941, he left the New Symphony Orchestra to devote himself entirely to conducting. He took a conducting position with several professional orchestras. In 1948, with Motonari Iguchi, Takeo Ito, and Hidekazu Yoshida, all of whom were representative figures of Japanese musical circles, Hideo Saito founded the Music School for Children, starting with classrooms they rented from Tokyo Kasei Gakuin School (a girls' finishing school) in Kudan, Chiyoda, Tokyo. They realized the necessity to provide the graduates with high school level of music studies. Kasei Gakuin, which had always been cooperative with Saito and his fellow teachers until then, became unable to be as generous in assigning more space for their proposed music high school. They had to find another existing school which would agree to add a music course for students aged 15 to 18. Their requests had been turned down one after the other until negotiations with Toho Girls' High School in Sengawa, Chōfu, Tokyo. The High School, however, had been established for girls, while what Saito was planning was a co-ed school. But the teachers and parents of the High School were strongly against the idea of admitting boys. Despite this negative atmosphere, the enthusiasm of Saito and the other musicians were gradually gaining supporters until a co-ed music course finally opened at Toho Girls' High School in 1952. And then the next year, the Music School for Children joined the Sengawa campus. Three years had elapsed since the opening of the high school music course, and the same problem as they had faced three years before was happening again. The founders of the music course simply thought they would be able to pass their graduates to existing music colleges. The students and their parents, however, were not satisfied. And that is how, Toho Gakuen Junior College of Music (two-year college) started in 1955. Saito became a professor of the College and chairman of its String and Conducting Departments. From 1958 to 1960, while President Motonari Iguchi was on a trip abroad, he was appointed Acting President of the College. In 1961, Toho Gakuen School of Music was established finally as a four-year college for further musical education. Saito took the Toho Children's Orchestra on tour in 1964 to America and, in a later time, to the U.S.S.R. and to Europe. In 1974, despite his declining health, he had been preparing the orchestra for another major tour. It was just before its scheduled departure when Saito died.

Fittja gård is a former manor, coaching inn and station for post riders in Fittja, Botkyrka Municipality, Stockholm County, east-central Sweden. Fittja Värdshus, attached to it, was one of the largest travellers' hostels in Sweden during the 17th and 18th centuries. From 1660 to 1916 the Tingsrätt (district court) for the Svartlösa Hundred was located on the estate, and the present Fittja gård dates to 1812. According to the Stockholm County Museum, the buildings are well-preserved and valued as a cultural heritage. Fittja gård is the headquarters of a mångkulturellt centrum (multicultural centre) founded in 1987. History Fittja gård is first mentioned in a letter of tenancy dated to 1299,Lilja (2011), p. 1. and the village of Fittja was settled in the Middle Ages. During the Protestant Reformation, the estate was confiscated; its land was worked by local farmers until 1631, when Erik van der Linde (owner of the nearby Lindhovens gård on Lake Aspen) took possession. =Inn, postal station and court location= Map of Fittja gård, 1664 In 1633, a new road was begun to replace the ancient Göta highway between Stockholm and Helsingborg: Södertäljevägen, later known as Riksväg 1\\\\. It was completed in 1669 with a bridge at the head of Lake Alby at Fittja Point; Fittja gård was then on the main highway, a day's drive—1 Uppland miles, or —by horse and cart from Stockholm. A coaching inn was established; travellers made their first change of horses here on their journey south from Stockholm, and royal permission was obtained to serve food and drink. The first innkeeper was Gustaf Mattsson, a Stockholm alderman who set up a dining establishment in 1663 in a building constructed at his own expense. The hostel opened in 1666, with 20 horses for travellers (although many complaints of worn-out and otherwise unsatisfactory horses are recorded).Lilja (2011), p. 2. In 1667 Fittja gård also became a station for post riders, with six riders and twelve horses in their own stable. The establishment also included a farm, a distillery and a large brickworks. The Tingsrätt for the Svartlösa Hundred moved to Fittja gård, remaining there until 1916. Map of Fittja gård in 1780 During the 18th century the estate changed ownership a number of times, and a new main house was built in mid-century. The 1780s estate extended from Mälaren in the north to Alby gård in the south, and from Fittja Point and Lake Alby in the east to Slagsta gård in the west. From 1778 to 1787 its owner was financier Johan Liljencrantz, one of the largest landowners in the socken and lord of Sturehov Manor and the seat farm of Norsborg. In 1787, the northern section with the brickworks became part of Slagsta. Fittja gård, one of the largest inns in Sweden, was frequented by many travellers. Among those who changed horses or spent the night there were Kings Charles XII and Oscar I and Carl Linnaeus, who described \\"wait[ing] a long time for horses\\" at Fittja in 1741. King Gustav III and his court also stayed at Fittja, arriving by barge from Drottningholm Palace. Carl Michael Bellman wrote about life at the inn.Lilja (2011), p. 4. =Jacob Schmidt ownership= In 1809, merchant Jacob Schmidt became the owner of the estate and inn. He improved the facilities, building the present buildings and a large barn (later known as Fittja loge) which held about 40 cows and several horses until World War II. After the estate stopped keeping livestock, the barn was a popular locale for dances and parties.Lilja (2011), p. 12. Schmidt moved the mid-18th-century main house about to the northeast, where it is now known as Ängsbyggningen (the Meadow Building). The longtime residence of a tenant farmer, it is presently a private home. The main house was replaced by an 1812 two-storey Empire style house, with two flanking wing buildings and a stable forming the sides of a courtyard. The east wing housed a courtroom, jail, guardhouse and restaurant and the west wing a post office, brewery, bakery and guest rooms. The highway ran just south of the main building, through the courtyard. Soon afterwards steamboat service began, largely supplanting coach travel since it was safer and more comfortable. Schmidt's money ran out in 1815, and he was forced to sell the estate at auction. Crown Prince Oscar (later Oscar I of Sweden) wrote in his journal in 1841 that although Fittja \\"[shone] amongst the other estate inns like the North Star in the firmament, it [was] now ... quiet and deserted there\\".Lilja (2011), p. 6. =Carlsson family ownership= The 18th-century main house, Ängsbyggningen, in 1910 Main-house interior during the 1960s The estate then changed hands several times. In 1859 it was sold to Lars Magnus Carlsson, a wealthy farmer and Riksdag member. Although the estate's liquor licence was revoked in 1873 because of drunkenness and fighting, the inn continued in operation (with some interruptions) until 1972. A new brickworks, opened during the 1860s on Fittja Point, operated until 1964. Agriculture and brickmaking were now the estate's main sources of income. Carlsson became one of the largest farmers in the Mälaren Valley; in addition to Fittja, he owned the Glömsta, Norsborg, Hallunda and Flemingsberg estates. Carlsson died in 1899 and was succeeded by his son, Hjalmar. However, the younger Carlsson was less interested in farming; he spent more time hunting and fishing, and the estate was now managed by a tenant farmer. In 1900 Carlsson married Elise Kärger, a German girl he met at a gathering at Alby Manor (near Fittja gård), in Berlin. They did not move to Fittja until 1903, and the inn was now a destination for daytrippers. Carlsson sold the brickyard in 1914 and the gravel pit in 1924. During the 1920s the estate became known for its fruit production, with vegetables and fruit (especially raspberries) grown along the road extending north of the estate and sold in Stockholm. However, in the early 1970s the land was built upon as north Botkyrka was developed. =Ragnar Sellberg and municipal ownership= Aerial view of Fittja gård in 1967; in the foreground are the now-demolished stables. Carlsson died in 1950, and his widow was allowed to continue living there until her death in 1974.Lilja (2011), p. 10 In 1955, after his estate was settled, Fittja gård was bought by businessman Ragnar Sellberg. Although at first Sellberg invested a great deal of money to develop a garden city centred on the estate, he was unable to realise his vision and lost interest. He let the estate fall into decay, and in 1967 sold the main buildings to the Stockholm Municipality and the outlying land to builder Ernst Ehn. AB Ehn and Company and the architectural firm Höjer and Ljungqvist then developed much of modern Botkyrka. After the last tenants left in 1983, the buildings were renovated; the flanking buildings became a daycare centre, and the main house a People's House.Lilja (2011), p. 11. Current use New exhibition building, on the site of the stables Fittja gård 2012 Since 1987, the buildings have been used as a mångkulturellt centrum (multicultural centre): a research centre focusing on the branch of anthropology dealing with the scientific description of individual cultures. It is a museum for the historical study of Swedish migration-related events, with one of Sweden's largest libraries in the field. In May 2014, the first UNESCO Local Centre for Collaboration in northern Europe was established in the main building. The remaining stretch of Värdshusvägen east of the buildings is now a pedestrian and bicycle path. Notes References *Lilja, Carl (2011). En kort historia om Fittja gård.

Mohamud also indicated that the federal government would arrange a state funeral service in the capital for Ismail. Additionally, Ahmed announced that a five-member ministerial committee led by Religious Affairs Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Ridwan Hirsi Mohamed was established to investigate the circumstances of Ismail's sudden death. Senior Somali police officials subsequently flew Ismail's body out to Nairobi for an autopsy by high-level experts. Government officials indicated that the mysterious and rapid nature of the General's illness suggested that he was possibly poisoned. As part of their ongoing investigations, the police interrogated a restaurant owner whose establishment Ismail had visited the day before his death. They also arrested all of the medical personnel that were on duty during the General's hospitalization, including a physician and a nurse who had treated him.

The USAF also realigned the 9th Reconnaissance Wing and the 55th Wing under the new NAF. It was headquartered at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. Its primary mission was to provide intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) products, applications, capabilities and resources, to include cyber and geospatial forces and expertise. Additionally, it is the service cryptologic component (SCC) responsible to the National Security Agency and Central Security Service for Air Force cryptographic activities. The 25th AF was originally activated as the United States Air Force Security Service on 20 October 1948, at Arlington Hall, Washington, D.C., with a mission of cryptology and communications security. The 25th AF was last commanded by Major General Timothy D. Haugh.https://www.af.mil/About- Us/Biographies/Display/Article/1286007/brigadier-general-timothy-d-haugh/ On 11 October 2019, the 25th AF was merged with the 24th AF to form a reactivated 16th Air Force. Overview The organization organizes, trains, equips and presents assigned forces and capabilities to conduct intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance for combatant commanders and the nation. It also implements and oversees the execution of Air Force policies intended to expand ISR capabilities. The organization comprises over 30,000 people at about 65 locations worldwide. On 14 July 2014, the Secretary and Chief of Staff of the Air Force announced that the Air Force ISR Agency would be reorganized into the Twenty-Fifth Air Force, a numbered air force assigned to Air Combat Command, on 1 October 2014. The redesignation took place on 29 September 2014 at Joint Base San Antonio. Units =Assigned units= Five active duty wings and one center are assigned to the Twenty-Fifth Air Force.

The service was headquartered at Arlington Hall, a former girls school and the headquarters of the United States Army's Signals Intelligence Service (SIS) cryptography effort during World War II. The USAFSS was tasked with the cryptology and communications security missions of the newly formed United States Air Force. The USAFSS moved to Brooks Air Force Base, in San Antonio, Texas, in April 1949, and then to \\"Security Hill\\" at nearby Kelly Air Force Base in August 1953. During the Korean War, the USAFSS personnel provided United Nations Command units with intelligence on the movements of major Korean People's Army forces from Manchuria to Wonsan. USAFSS personnel received Korean Language training at Yale University, and flew on the Douglas C-47 Skytrain to relay communications to allied ground forces on the Korean Peninsula. During the early days of the Cold War, USAFSS crews flew missions on several aircraft converted for intelligence missions, including the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, the Lockheed C-130A-II Dreamboat,http://www.7406suppron.com/history/c130aii.asp and the Strategic Air Command's Boeing RB-50 Superfortress and Boeing RC-135. The USAFSS established communications stations in Germany, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Scotland, and later installed AN/FLR-9 \\"Elephant Cage\\" radar sites in Alaska, England, Italy, Japan, the Philippines, and Turkey. The USAFSS became involved in the Vietnam War when the Pacific Air Forces asked it to establish an Air Force Special Security Office at Tan Son Nhut Airport near Saigon in 1961. By the following year, a USAFSS squadron and three subordinate detachments were operating in Vietnam and Thailand, and USAFSS personnel supported College Eye threat warning operations. USAFSS crews also flew on Douglas EC-47 Skytrain missions to search for aircrew shot down in North Vietnam; RC-130BII Hercules Airborne Communications Reconnaissance Program (ACRP) SIGINT platforms launched out of Thailand and Da Nang Air Base, Viet Nam; and, commencing in 1967, SAC RC-135s deployed to and operating out of Kadena Air Base, Okinawa. =Electronic Security Command= On 1 August 1979, the Air Force redesignated the USAFSS as the Electronic Security Command (ESC), reflecting the organization's additional mission of improving the Air Force's use of electronic warfare technology in combat. In 1985, the Air Force tasked ESC with computer security, in addition to its intelligence and electronic warfare missions. ESC provided intelligence support to the United States invasion of Panama in 1989 and were among the first U.S. military personnel to arrive in Saudi Arabia for the Gulf War. During that conflict, ESC personnel operated at three different locations in Saudi Arabia and Turkey. =Air Force Intelligence Command= On 1 October 1991, the Air Force redesignated ESC as the Air Force Intelligence Command (AFIC) and consolidated Air Force intelligence functions and resources into a single command. AFIC merged ESC with the Air Force Foreign Technology Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, the Air Special Activities Center at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, and elements of the Air Force Intelligence Agency, Washington, D.C. With the combined missions, AFIC was tasked with intelligence, security, electronic combat, foreign technology, and treaty monitoring. =Air Intelligence Agency= The organization was redesignated again when it became the Air Intelligence Agency on 1 October 1993. During the 1990s, AIA personnel deployed to support NATO operations during the Bosnian War and Kosovo War, and as part of Operations Southern Watch and Northern Watch in Southwest Asia. In February 2001, the Air Force assigned AIA to Air Combat Command, where it provided support to combat operations in the War on Terror, the War in Afghanistan, and the Iraq War. =Air Force ISR Agency= In August 2006, General T. Michael Moseley, the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, directed that the Air Force intelligence efforts stress intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities. AIA was eventually redesignated the Air Force ISR Agency (AFISRA) on 8 June 2007. The organization change included transforming AFISRA into a field operating agency and reassigning it from Air Combat Command to Headquarters Air Force. With the change, AFISRA reported to the Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance. Beginning in 2009, AFISRA personnel deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan to support MC-12W as part of Project Liberty. =Lineage= * Established as United States Air Force Security Service on 20 October 1948 : Organized as a major command on 26 October 1948 : Redesignated: Electronic Security Command on 1 August 1979 : Redesignated: Air Force Intelligence Command on 1 October 1991 : Redesignated: Air Intelligence Agency on 1 October 1993 : Redesignated: Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Agency on 8 June 2007 : Redesignated: Twenty-Fifth Air Force on 1 October 2014 * Inactivated on 11 October 2019 =Assignments= * United States Air Force, 26 October 1948 * Air Combat Command, 1 February 2001 * United States Air Force, 8 June 2007 * Air Combat Command, 1 October 2014 =Components= Wings * 6900th Security Wing, Landsberg AB, Germany, 1 August 1954 – UnknownAbstract, Oral History Interview with Lt.

Early life Teodorescu was born in Bucharest, Romania, but came to Sweden as a child in 1989 and was raised in Lund. She attended the Sture Academy, a training programme for young people run by Timbro and named after Sture Eskilsson. Career After completing her legal training, she worked as an intern in the Brussels office of Svenskt Näringsliv and then became a communication strategist for the newspaper. She has also been an editorial writer for newspapers including Barometern in Oskarshamn and Gotlands Allehanda. In 2009, she founded a women's network called En plats i himlen för kvinnor som hjälper varandra (a place in heaven for women who help each other). Teodorescu \\"has made herself known as a provocative and fearless liberal debater\\". She has criticised gender quotas on corporate boards and advocated a policy of equality based on individualism rather than collectivism. She has also written on integration and education. In February 2014 she attracted much attention by calling in a debate on the Sveriges Radio channel 1 programme P1 Debatt for a clear definition of the term \\"racism\\" and questioning whether racism in Sweden was structural. She also argued that it was time for a more nuanced, less dogmatic and polarising debate on the issue. During the Almedalen week in June and July 2014 Ali Esbati refused to shake hands with Teodorescu after a live broadcast debate between the two, this after a discussion about racism in Sweden. After the debate both Teodorescu and Esbati received criticism for not considering each other's opinions. In a subsequent opinion piece in Svenska Dagbladet, Teodorescu complained about what she saw as the lenient treatment of the Green Party by the press.

The film, which depicts the 1915 Armenian Genocide by the Ottoman Empire from the point of view of Armenian survivor Mardiganian, who plays herself in the film,Review, synopsis and link to watch the film: survives in an incomplete form. A surviving part of the film Plot According to a contemporary New York Times article, the first half of the film shows \\"Armenia as it was before Turkish and German devastation, and led up to the deportation of priests and thousands of families into the desert. One of the concluding scenes showed young Armenian women flogged for their refusal to enter Turkish harems and depicted the Turkish slave markets.\\"Ravished Armenia in Film (Feb. 15, 1919) The story was adapted for the screen by Henry Leyford Gates, who also wrote the book. Production The Selig production, which used several thousand Armenian residents of southern California as extras, was filmed in 1918-1919 near Newhall, California. During a scene in which Mardiganian was escaping from a harem by jumping from one roof to another she fell and broke her ankle. The production, however, continued with Mardiganian being carried to each set for her scenes. The film shows young Armenian girls being \\"crucified\\" by being nailed to crosses. However, almost 70 years later Mardiganian revealed to film historian Anthony Slide that the scene was inaccurate and went on to describe what was actually an impalement. She stated that \\"The Turks didn't make their crosses like that. The Turks made little pointed crosses. They took the clothes off the girls. They made them bend down, and after raping them, they made them sit on the pointed wood, through the vagina. That's the way they killed – the Turks. Americans have made it a more civilized way. They can't show such terrible things.\\" H.L. Gates later ghostwrote a 20-part newspaper series for \\"Queen of the Artists' Studios\\" Audrey Munson in which he described the filming of the crucifixion scene in the California desert and said that one of the 12 artist's models employed for the scene died several days later from influenza as a result of the exposure during filming. He named the dead woman as Corinne Gray. Distribution The initial New York performance of the silent film took place on February 16, 1919, in the ballroom of the Plaza Hotel, with society leaders, Mrs. Oliver Harriman and Mrs. George W. Vanderbilt, serving as co-hostesses on behalf of the American Committee for Armenian and Syrian Relief.Balakian, Peter (2003). The Burning Tigris: The Armenian Genocide and America's Response. New York: HarperCollins, p. 313. To raise funds for relief, the film was shown in several American cities at an admission price of $10 per person at a time when the typical American theater charged an admission of $0.25 to $0.35. Later, when the film went into general distribution, ads described it as the \\"$10 per seat picture.\\"Magazine ad for film, April 26, 1919, Moving Picture World, p. 486, magazine ad, May 31, 1919, Moving Picture World, pp. 1296-97, and Minneapolis, Minnesota, Lyric Theater ad, reprinted in July 5, 1919, Motion Picture News, p. 318. The film was first screened in London under the title Auction of Souls and in 1920 was shown twice daily for three weeks at the Royal Albert Hall to obtain support for the protection of national minorities. This showing of the film, which contains depictions of the flogging of women and their nude crucifixion, was authorized with cuts to five scenes that had been agreed to by the film producers without the film's formal submission to the British Board of Film Censors, which never certified the film for general viewing in the United Kingdom. The film was released in Paris on December 11, 1919, Salle Gaveau. It was sponsored by the dukess of Rohan.http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k76533147/f3.item Reception Because of the film's subject matter, distributors often scheduled limited showings of the film to community leaders prior to releasing it to local theaters. Still, in some states there were attempts to ban or censor the film. For example, after the Pennsylvania State Board of Censors banned the film, the distributors sued and overturned the state agency decision in court. In reversing the Board's ban, the decision of the judge stated: > The court finds it a fact and a question of law that there is nothing in the > scenes which make them sacrilegious, obscene, indecent or immoral, or such > nature as to tend to debase or corrupt morals. Viewing the picture as a > whole, the court finds as a fact that it is educational in nature. It is not > only a vivid portrayal of the story Ravished Armenia, but it is also a > picture of conditions as they existed in Armenia a few months ago. Mardiganian felt she had been cheated out of her $7000 fee for the film and received only $195. She sued her legal guardian Eleanor Brown Gates, the novelist wife of the screenwriter Henry Leyford Gates. She won $5,000. Film restoration (2009) A restored and edited 24-minute segment of the historic motion picture (originally composed of 9 reels, i.e. approximately 90 minutes) was released in 2009 by the Armenian Genocide Resource Center of Northern California. It is based on a rare surviving reel of film edited in Soviet Armenia. It includes a music score, an introduction, 125 subtitles, and a slideshow of several black-white production stills.

Designated a pilot program, Workshops for Careers in the Arts was created in June 1968 by Peggy Cooper Cafritz and Mike Malone as a means toward the establishment of a public high school for the arts in Washington, D.C.. There were three departments in the school program at the start of its formation. They were in Drama/Theatre, Dance, and Visual Arts/Painting. These departments serviced qualified area students after their normal home school day, on weekends during the academic year, and full time during the summer months. Roughly ninety (90) students were enrolled during the inaugural years. Funding eventually became increasingly available as lobbying, grants, enrollment, contributions, and stellar reputations regarding the program significantly increased. Students were accepted on the basis of recommendations from area Principals, Teachers, Parents, interviews, and auditions. Talented students who could not otherwise afford such training were given top priority. Workshops for Careers in the Arts enrolled and had diverse students from all over the Washington Metropolitan region. No student was required to pay a tuition. Upon leaving the program, the students were encouraged to continue their career training. Workshops for Careers in the Arts students began to achieve collegiate full scholarships and receive contracts toward higher education. The George Washington University, The Washington School of Ballet, The North Carolina School of the Arts, The Juilliard School and Howard University were some of the very first illustrious institutions to receive Workshops for Careers in the Arts graduates. Some graduates had opportunities to start professional careers in their field soon after their departure from the program. Workshops for Careers in the Arts showed the need for and the results of specialized vocational training in the arts. As more successful Workshops for Careers in the Arts years past, which included the need for an additional space location on Georgia Avenue at Morton Street, N.W., the Washington community made this opportunity available to their young people on a much broader scale. In the process during 1974, the Duke Ellington High School at Western High School in Washington, D.C. was born. The goal was achieved. Duke Ellington School of the Arts was established as an accredited four (4) year public high school curriculum, combining arts and academics in the Nation's Capital.

It is an important component of the legal creation of properties. A cadastral surveyor must apply both the spatial-measurement principles of general surveying and legal principles such as respect of neighboring titles. Duties and role of a cadastral surveyor Cadastral surveyors in Alaska One of the primary roles of the land surveyor is to determine the boundary of real property on the ground. That boundary has already been established and described in legal documents and official plans and maps prepared by attorneys, engineers, and other land surveyors. The corners of the property will either have been monumented by a prior surveyor, or monumented by the surveyor hired to perform a survey of a new boundary which has been agreed upon by adjoining land owners. =Principles of cadastral surveying= A common use of a survey is to determine a legal property boundary. The first stage in such a survey, known as a resurvey, is to obtain copies of the deed description and all other available documents from the owner. The deed description is that of the deed and not a tax statement or other incomplete document. The surveyor should then obtain copies of deed descriptions and maps of the adjoining properties, any records from the municipality or county, utility maps, and any records of surveys. Depending on which region the survey is located in, some or most of this information may not be available or even exist. Whether the information exists or not, a thorough search should be conducted so that no records are overlooked. Copies of deeds usually can be located in the government recorder's office, and maps or plats can usually be found at the recorder or surveyor's office. These arrangements will vary state-to-state and survey-system-to-survey system, so some familiarity may be needed. When all the records are assembled, the surveyor examines the documents for errors, such as closure errors. When a metes and bounds description is involved, the seniority of the deeds must be determined. The title abstract usually gives the order of seniority for the deeds related to the tract being surveyed and should be used if available. After this data is gathered and analyzed the field survey may commence. The initial survey operations should be concentrated on locating monuments. In urban regions, monuments should be sought initially; but in the absence of monuments, property corners marked by iron pins, metal survey markers, iron pipes, and other features possibly establishing a line of possession should be located. When the approximate positions for the boundaries of the property have been located, a traverse is run around the property. While the control traverse is being run, ties should be measured and all details relevant to the boundaries should be acquired. This includes but is not limited to locating the property corners, monuments, fences, hedge rows, walls, walks, and all buildings on the lot. The surveyor then takes this collected data and compares it to the records which were received. When a solution is reached, the chosen property corners (those that best fit all the data) are coordinated, and ties by direction and distance are computed from the nearest traverse point. Once this has been established the features on the lot can be drawn, dimensions can be shown from these features to the boundary line, and a map or plat is prepared for the client.Anderson, J., & Mikhail, E. (1998). Surveying: Theory and practice. (7th ed., p. 1011). McGraw-Hill. =Monuments= F. V. Hayden's map of Yellowstone National Park, 1871. His surveys were a significant basis for establishing the park in 1872. A cotton spindle spike in Tel Aviv pavement, used as a marker for public area cadastral surveying. Monuments are categorized into two groups which are known as natural and artificial. Natural monuments are things such as trees, large stones, and other substantial, naturally occurring objects that were in place before the survey was made. An artificial monument is anything within the regulations which marks the property boundary—having been placed by landowners, surveyors, engineers, or others. They may be referred to as iron pins or pipes, stakes, trees, concrete monuments, or whatever the surveyor decides to use at the time, within the regulations for the area. The courts have held that natural monuments take precedence over artificial monuments, because they are more certain in identification and less likely to be disturbed.Brown, C., Wilson, D., & Robillard, W. (2003). Brown's boundary control and legal principles. (5th ed., p. 30). Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Over time, construction and maintenance of roads and many other human acts, along with acts of nature such as earthquakes, movement of water, and tectonic shift can obliterate or damage the monumented locations of land boundaries. The land surveyor is often compelled to consider other evidence such as fence locations, wood lines, monuments on neighboring properties, and people's recollections. This other evidence is known as extrinsic evidence and is a fairly common principle. Extrinsic evidence is defined as evidence outside the writings, in this case evidence outside of the deed. Extrinsic evidence is held to be of equal value to evidence from another source.Richards, D., & Hermansen, K. (1995). \\"Use of extrinsic evidence to aid interpretation of deeds.\\" Journal of Surveying Engineering, (121), 178. Today's land surveyor sets monuments at actual physical points on the ground that define angle points of boundary lines dividing neighboring land parcels. These monuments are most often inch or inch iron rebar rods or pipes placed at 18 inches minimum depth, but they vary from state by state. The more recent rods or pipes may have an affixed plastic cap over the top bearing the responsible surveyor's name and license number. Older monuments may exist such as old pipes, gun barrels, axles, mounds of stone, whiskey bottles, or even wooden stakes. In addition to rods and pipes, surveyors might use 4 inch × 4 inch concrete posts at the corners of large parcels or anywhere which requires greater stability (e.g. beach sand). They place the posts three feet deep. In locations where there is asphalt or concrete, it is common to place nails or aluminum-alloy caps to re-establish boundary corners. Marks are meant to be durable, stable, and as \\"permanent\\" as possible. The aim is to provide sufficient marks so that some of them will remain for future re-establishment of boundaries. The material and marking used for monuments placed to mark boundary corners are often subject to state laws. Many states have laws that protect existing monuments and may apply civil penalties if the markers are disturbed or destroyed. =The art of land surveying= Many properties have considerable problems with regard to improper bounding or miscalculations in past surveys, titles, easements, and wildlife crossings. Also, many properties are created from multiple divisions of a larger piece over the course of years, and with every additional division the risk of miscalculation increases. The result can be abutting properties not coinciding with adjacent parcels, resulting in hiatuses (gaps) and overlaps. Many times a surveyor must solve a puzzle using pieces that do not exactly fit together. In these cases, the solution is based upon the surveyor's research and interpretation, along with established procedures for resolving discrepancies. This is essentially a process of continual error correction and update, where official recordation documents countermand the previous and sometime erroneous survey documents recorded by older monuments and older survey methods.

Al-Jabouri now holds the position of president of Iraqi Parliament starting from 2014. Al-Jabouri is a Sunni Arab from Muqdadiya, Diyala Governorate who obtained a doctorate in law in 2001. He worked as a law professor at Nahrain University in Baghdad. He was originally a member of the Iraqi Islamic Party. He was elected to the Council of Representatives of Iraq in December 2005 for the Iraqi Accord Front list and he became deputy head of parliament's legal committee. Two of his brothers, Fuad and Ahmed al-Jabouri, were killed in an attack in 2007 in Muqdadiya. He stood in Diyala in the March 2010 general election but the Iraqi Accord Front failed to have any MPs elected from that province. However, he defected to the Iraqiya list and was nominated to parliament in December 2010 as a replacement MP. He headed the parliament's Human Rights Committee, where he accused the government of Nouri al Maliki of torturing detainees. In 2011, the Iraqi newspaper Al-Sabah al-Jadid quoted sources saying an arrest warrant had been issued for him on charges of terrorism. The al Sabah newspaper reported at the same time that the Higher Judicial Council had asked the parliament to lift his immunity. In March 2014 he was targeted by a roadside bomb which killed two of his bodyguards. He was elected in the 2014 general election on the \\"Diyala is Our Identity Coalition\\", a predominantly Sunni Arab list which won 5 out of 14 seats and is part of a wider alliance with the Muttahidoon party of former speaker Osama al-Nujaifi. His election was initially approved by the Independent High Electoral Commission on the grounds that they had \\"serious crime cases\\" pending against him. However, he was acquitted by the Federal Supreme Court and allowed to take his seat. After the election he was selected by the Sunni Arab MPs as their candidate for the speakership, following the Muhassasah convention adopted in Iraq whereby the speaker is always a Sunni Arab, the Prime Minister always a Shi'ite Arab and the President a Kurd. Al-Jabouri won 194 votes, a majority of the 328 MPs as required under the constitution.

Career Trilliums Adams mostly used pastel and water color, and painted landscapes, flowers and still life. She also used oil at times. In 1896 the Woman's Art Association of Canada (WAAC) decided to commission a Canadian State Dinner Service to be painted on china by members of the association. The artists included Lily Osman Adams, Alice Egan (1872–1972) and Phoebe Amelia Watson (1858–1947). Adams painted eighteen plates with underwater designs as part of the service. Adams exhibited at the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts from 1904 to 1936. Her work was shown at the Canadian National Exhibition in 1907, and at the Ontario Society of Artists from 1903 to 1920.

It is run by the Society for the Betterment of Education, a local voluntary group. Students are prepared for the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) and the Indian School Certificate (ISC).  History  The Society for the Betterment of Education was formed by a group of educationists and administrators on 4 September 1974 with the help of Sri Dipak Ghosh I.A.S, the then District Magistrate of Midnapore, to impart better education to the school going children of Midnapore Town and to establish institutions for this purpose. This group felt that children should be able to feel at home anywhere in India during their student life and also later in their working life. For this reason, they decided to set up a school where education would be imparted through the medium of English. Vidyasagar Shishu Niketan was established in January 1975 with preparatory and kindergarten classes only, under the guidance of Miss S. Mukherjee, Honorary Secretary and Principal. Since 1975, the school grew up by one class each year until 1983. The School from its very inception depended solely on the tuition and other fees collected from its students. Governance Vidyasagar Shishu Niketan is managed by a Governing Body, appointed by the Society for the Betterment of Education. This Society and its members take interest in the business of the school without any remuneration whatsoever. The Society is under the direct supervision of the District Magistrate and the School Governing Body is constituted by the Society. The School is permanently affiliated to the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations. Educational provision The School is now run in four sections: Pre-school section (Lower & Upper prep. & K.G. Classes); Primary school section (classes I to IV); High school section (Classes V to X); Higher Secondary (XI & XII). Thirteen batches of students have already taken the final ICSE examination quite successfully. Three batches of ISC have appeared quite successfully. As mentioned on his LinkedIn biography, author and columnist Souhardya De is presently undergoing his studies at the institution. He had appeared for the ICSE batch 2020.

Don't Go To College Having been homeschooled himself and then exposed to a university-education, Morehouse noticed the disparity in skills taught and skills demanded by the professional world, as well as the frustration faced by students who expected a job upon graduation. This led Morehouse to believe that most of the perceived value of a college degree comes from its value as a signaling mechanism, showing employers that a candidate is superior to those without the signal. Employers told Morehouse that a lack of work experience was the primary reason they did not hire candidates with college degrees. Morehouse founded Praxis in 2013 as an alternative signal for employers and students, combining traditional educational components with work experience. Description Praxis places participants with business partners to work 30 hours per week as an employee (as opposed to a traditional intern).Alister & Paine Seven Questions with the Guy Who's Disrupting Education Participants then complete 10 hours per week's worth of coursework designed by professors contracted with Praxis.

History  St. Andrew's Church, a part of the Anglican Diocese of Belize, has played an influential role in San Ignacio's rich history. Its mission and ministry have always been located in the downtown area of San Ignacio, with its first house of worship founded on Far West Street. The first priest was the Rev'd C.G. MacArthur, serving from 1905 until 1907. In 1907 a vibrant young Belizean by the name of William Robert Hope took over leadership as deacon. Mr. Hope went on to become Canon William Hope, rector of San Ignacio, and the first ordained Belizean priest in the Diocese of Belize. He faithfully served St. Andrew's parish from 1907 until 1918. With a land donation from Mr. John O. Waight, the church and congregation moved to its present location on Burns Avenue in 1918, and Canon Hope was called to serve another church in Gales Point. The congregation of St. Andrew's worshipped in temporary quarters, until a beautiful wooden sanctuary was finally completed near year's end 1925 and consecrated by the bishop on Sunday, February 28, 1926. The Rev'd Arnold Stackhouse was priest- in-charge at the time. This church became known as the second St. Andrew's Church. A rectory was soon built in front of the church, and an already existing school building (on the grounds of where the church's community centre now stands) would receive renovations. On Easter Monday, April 13, 1998, the second St. Andrew's Church was demolished, due to irreparable damage by termites. A new concrete sanctuary was built between April 27 and November 7, 1998. The enormous task of fundraising began in 1995 under the talented leadership of English priest, the Rev'd Ian Hutchinson Cervantes (1994–1997), and it continued with another equally talented and devoted English priest, the Rev'd Mark Rogers from 1997 (1997–2000). The beautiful sanctuary was designed by Bimco and constructed by Mr. Marcus Chen. It was dedicated on November 8, 1998, by the Right Rev'd Sylvester Romero Palma, then bishop of Belize.  Worship  Throughout the church's physical changes the altar has remained as the original centerpiece for worship. Canon Hope was instrumental in procuring a donation from England of three beautifully carved panels for the altar. The altar itself was constructed as a gift by Mr. James Massiah for the church's consecration in 1926. The three carved panels display both grapevines (representing communion wine and the blood of Christ) and sheaves of wheat (communion bread and the body of Christ). St. Andrew's has a long list of distinguished service from priests. However, in most instances, a priest has not served longer than three to four years (notable exceptions being Canon Leroy Flowers, who with his family served St. Andrew's from 1980–1986, and the Rev'd Juan B. Marentes, who served St. Andrew's from 2009-2014). Thus, while priests have come and gone, the congregation and its lay leadership have brought the church into the 21st century. St. Andrew's is currently served by the Right Rev'd Philip Wright, bishop of Belize, and Rev'd David B. Alenskis, priest-in-charge and missionary in connecion with SAMS-USA.

From Akbarnama. Section 309 of the Indian Penal Code criminalises attempted suicide as well as suicide assistance. Section 309 states: : Whoever attempts to commit suicide and does any act towards the commission of such offence, shall be punished with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year or with fine, or with both. Although section 309 is still in effect, the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 (enacted July 2018) has restricted its application. The relevant provision of the new act states: : Notwithstanding anything contained in section 309 of the Indian Penal Code, any person who attempts to commit suicide shall be presumed, unless proved otherwise, to have severe stress and shall not be tried and punished under the said Code. Path to repeal In the 1996 Gian Kaur vs State of Punjab,, the appellant failed to convince the five judge bench that section 309 violated article 21 of the Constitution of India. A bill to strike the section was subsequently introduced in parliament, but failed to pass. On 7 March 2011, the Supreme Court recommended that Parliament consider deleting section 309 from the statute. On 10 December 2014, in response to a question by Vivek Gupta in the Rajya Sabha on decriminalisation of suicide, the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Haribhai Chaudhary replied that \\"it has been decided to delete Section 309 of IPC from the Statute book.\\" On 24 February 2015, the Minister of State in the Ministry of Home Affairs, Haribhai Parathibhai Chaudhary, said that a proposal to delete Section 309 from the Indian Penal Code had been sent to the Legislative Department of the Ministry of Law and Justice for drawing up a draft Amendment Bill. Restriction by other acts of parliament Section 309 of the Indian Penal Code was set to be limited in effect by the Mental Health Care bill, first introduced to the Rajya Sabha on 19 August 2013. Section 115 of the bill initially stipulated that \\"Notwithstanding anything contained in section 309 of the Indian Penal Code, any person who attempts to commit suicide shall be presumed, unless proved otherwise, to be suffering from mental illness at the time of attempting suicide and shall not be liable to punishment under the said section.\\" The bill also stipulated that the Government would have a duty to provide medical care to persons that attempted suicide. The bill was referred by the Rajya Sabha to a standing committee on 18 September 2013, which submitted a report on 20 November 2013. In its report, the standing committee expressed three concerns on article 124: firstly, that the presumption of mental illness would subject persons to 'mental health treatment', secondly, concerns about the consequences on Section 306 of the Penal Code, which concerns abetment to suicide, and thirdly, concerns regarding the \\"institutionalization in silencing victims of domestic violence.\\" In response, the Ministry proposed amendments which would change the language of this provision to one concerning the \\"presumption of severe stress in case of attempt to commit suicide\\". The Committee accepted this recommendation, noting that there was still ambiguity regarding the stage at which this presumption would operate. The bill was voted upon and passed by the Rajya Sabha on 8 August 2016,Attempt to suicide no more an offence in India, Available at Learning the Law. and passed by the Lok Sabha on 27 March 2017. The bill was subsequently enacted in July 2018 as the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017.

Having a low-frequency vibrator gives a \\"rumbling\\" sensation, rather than a buzzy sensation. Low-frequency vibrations also carry through the body better, accessing parts of the clitoris that other vibrators do not reach.

The song tells of a mother exhorting her soldier son to remember to say his nightly prayers, while the singer comforts the mother with the thought that the soldier's actions are all the prayer he needs, saying \\"He serves his maker when he serves his country's needs.\\" The song compares the bullets of war to the beads on the rosary, and the soldier's ultimate death is concluded as \\"a soldier's rosary\\". Analysis In Born in the U.S.A.: The Myth of American Popular Music from Colonial Times, Timothy Sheurer argues that \\"A Soldier's Rosary\\" perpetuates the American myth of divine destiny, that the American ideal serves a higher purpose.

The New York Yankees selected Webb in the tenth round of the 2013 Major League Baseball draft. He made his MLB debut in 2017 for the Yankees and has also played for the Milwaukee Brewers and San Diego Padres. Webb played college baseball for the University of South Carolina. Career =Amateur career= Webb attended Northampton High School in Eastville, Virginia. After graduating from high school, Webb enrolled at the University of South Carolina, where he played college baseball for the South Carolina Gamecocks baseball team. He was a member of the 2010 and 2011 College World Series championship teams. In 2012, his junior year, Webb pitched to a 6–1 win–loss record and a 1.56 earned run average (ERA), and recorded 58 strikeouts in innings pitched. Before his senior year, the National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association named Webb a second-team preseason All-American. Serving as the Gamecocks' closer, Webb recorded 17 saves in the 2013 season, and was named a third-team All-American by Collegiate Baseball and a second-team All-Southeastern Conference pitcher after the season. He finished his Gamecocks' career with a 2.34 ERA and the record for games pitched (110). =New York Yankees= The New York Yankees selected Webb in the tenth round, with the 314th overall selection, of the 2013 Major League Baseball draft. The Yankees assigned him to the Staten Island Yankees of the Class A-Short Season New York–Penn League after he signed, but promoted him to the Charleston RiverDogs of the Class A South Atlantic League two weeks later. Over relief innings, he went 3-1 with a 3.31 ERA. Webb began the 2014 season with the Tampa Yankees of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League, and was promoted to the Trenton Thunder of the Class AA Eastern League in May, with whom he was named an Eastern League All-Star. Webb was promoted to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders of the Class AAA International League following the All-Star break. For the season, Webb went 3–6 with a 3.80 ERA and 12 saves and 94 strikeouts in 48 games and innings pitched. Webb received a non-roster invitation to spring training with the Yankees in 2015, and opened the season with Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. Due to a tendon injury, he only pitched 38 innings during the season (going 2-3 with a 2.84 ERA), and the Yankees assigned Webb to the Arizona Fall League after the regular season. In 2016, he pitched for Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, going 4-3 with a 3.59 ERA over innings pitched out of the bullpen. On December 8, 2016, the Pittsburgh Pirates selected Webb from the Yankees in the Rule 5 draft. He competed for a role with the Pirates during spring training, but did not make the 25-man roster and was returned to the Yankees before the regular season. Webb began the 2017 season with Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. The Yankees promoted Webb to the major leagues on June 22, 2017, and he made his MLB debut on June 24. He made seven relief appearances for the Yankees, pitching to a 4.50 ERA while striking out five and walking four in six innings. =Milwaukee Brewers and San Diego Padres= On July 13, 2017, the Yankees traded Webb to the Milwaukee Brewers for Garrett Cooper.

It is known from a single fossil specimen representing the species Changyuraptor yangi, which was discovered from Early Cretaceous (125 million year old) deposits in Liaoning Province, China. C. yangi belongs to the group of dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaurs called the Microraptoria. At the time of its discovery, C. yangi was the largest four-winged dinosaur known and among the largest Mesozoic flying paravians, volant true birds seldom approaching its size.Nicholas R. Longrich; David M. Martill; Brian Andres (2018). \\"Late Maastrichtian pterosaurs from North Africa and mass extinction of Pterosauria at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary\\". PLOS Biology. 16 (3): e2001663. Description Analysis of the fossil at the University of Cape Town, South Africa reveals that the specimen was a fully grown adult, approximately long and estimated to weigh , roughly the size of a turkey. These dimensions make Changyuraptor the largest four-winged microraptorine known, exceeding previously known specimens in size by at least 60%. Like other microraptorines, Changyuraptor had feathers all over its body, including forelimbs and hindlimbs, which gives the appearance of having two pairs of wings. The presence of long feathers on all four limbs also suggests that these dinosaurs could fly. The dinosaur's tail is long and feathered, with end feathers up to long, equalling approximately 30% of the length of the animal's skeleton. This length exceeds the previous record length of for feathers from non-avian dinosaurs. The elongated tail feathers are thought to have helped provide softer and safer landings. They could have controlled pitch, a feature useful for a heavier animal, that would have attained a faster gliding speed. While elongated feathers on the hindlimbs were present in many early birds, such as Archaeopteryx, the morphology of microraptorines suggests a different aerodynamic model from that of modern birds, which have characteristically bald legs and exhibit stable flight using two wings only. Changyuraptor is thought to have existed alongside a variety of predatory and herbivorous dinosaurs of the Jehol Biota, including Yutyrannus, in moist temperate forest, primarily vegetated by ginkgos and conifers, with hot, dry summers and frosty winters. Discovery The fossil, holotype HG B016, was discovered by farmers near Xijianchang in the Early Cretaceous fossil deposits, the Yixian Formation, of the Jehol Biota, located in the Liaoning province of China. From 2012 it was studied by an international team of scientists led by Dr. Luis Chiappe, Director of the Dinosaur Institute Department at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. The holotype consists of a rather complete skeleton with skull, compressed on a plate and counterplate. It shows extensive remains of the integument in the form of pennaceous feathers. In 2014, the specimen was described as the new genus and species Changyuraptor yangi. The generic name of the dinosaur combines the Chinese words for \\"long feather\\", 長羽 (cháng yǔ), with Latin raptor (\\"robber\\", \\"seizer\\"). The specific name honours researcher Professor Yang Yandong. The Jehol Biota are found in the richest fossil beds for feathered dinosaurs in the world which have yielded notable species such as Yutyrannus huali, a feathered tyrannosauroid with a length of and the largest feathered dinosaur known to date. In 2003 Microraptor, a raven-sized dinosaur, approximately in weight, was the first of the microraptorines to be discovered. It shared with species such as Anchiornis and Xiaotingia large feathered limbs and elongated bony tails with long tail feathers. These features caused experts to hypothesize that miniaturisation was an essential evolutionary step to enable flight. Changyuraptor's larger size and weight contradicts that hypothesis. Changyuraptor is also the second four-winged dinosaur to be discovered after Microraptor. Changyuraptor and other microraptorines add to the evidence that dinosaurs had evolved a host of morphological features and behaviours such as feathers, hollow bones, nesting behaviour, and possibly flight, before they evolved in birds.

The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background An appropriations bill is a bill that appropriates (gives to, sets aside for) money to specific federal government departments, agencies, and programs. The money provides funding for operations, personnel, equipment, and activities. Regular appropriations bills are passed annually, with the funding they provide covering one fiscal year. The fiscal year is the accounting period of the federal government, which runs from October 1 to September 30 of the following year. The Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2015 is an example of a regular appropriations bill. Appropriations bills are one part of a larger United States budget and spending process. They are preceded in that process by the president's budget proposal, congressional budget resolutions, and the 302(b) allocation. The U.S. Constitution (Article I, section 9, clause 7) states that \\"No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law...\\" This is what gives Congress the power to make these appropriations. The President, however, still has the power to veto appropriations bills. The Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2015 falls under the jurisdiction of the United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government. The bill covers appropriations for the United States Department of the Treasury, as we all as the United States federal courts, the Executive Office of the President of the United States, and Washington, D.C.. The House and Senate currently consider appropriations bills simultaneously, although originally the House went first. The House Committee on Appropriations usually reports the appropriations bills in May and June and the Senate in June. Any differences between appropriations bills passed by the House and the Senate are resolved in the fall. In 2013, Congress was unable to pass all twelve appropriations bills (for fiscal year 2014) before October 1, 2013 when the new fiscal year. This led to the United States federal government shutdown of 2013. The shutdown lasted for 16 days. Finally, late in the evening of October 16, 2013, Congress passed the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014, and the President signed it shortly after midnight on October 17, ending the government shutdown and suspending the debt limit until February 7, 2014. In reaction to this situation, House Committee on Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers has stated that his goal is to pass all twelve regular appropriations bills for 2015 before Congress has a recess in August because he wants to avoid a similar situation. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2015 has multiple parts. The Department of the Treasury Appropriations Act, 2015 would make appropriations for FY2015 for the United States Department of the Treasury. The Executive Office of the President Appropriations Act, 2015 would make appropriations for FY2015 for the Executive Office of the President. The Judiciary Appropriations Act, 2015 would make appropriations for FY2015 for the United States Supreme Court and other federal courts and related offices. The District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 2015 would make appropriations for FY2015 for the District of Columbia. The bill would make appropriations for FY2015 for: (1) the Administrative Conference of the United States, (2) the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), (3) the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), (4) the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), (5) the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), (6) the Federal Election Commission (FEC), (7) the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA), (8) the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), (9) the General Services Administration (GSA), (10) the Merit Systems Protection Board, (11) the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), (12) the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), (13) the Office of Government Ethics, (14) the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), (15) the Office of Special Counsel, (16) the Postal Regulatory Commission, (17) the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, (18) the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, (19) the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), (20) the Selective Service System, (21) the Small Business Administration (SBA), (22) the United States Postal Service (USPS), and (23) the United States Tax Court. The bill would specify certain uses and limits or prohibitions against the use of funds appropriated by this Act. =Amendments= The House accepted in a voice vote an amendment offered by Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) to reduce funding for the Internal Revenue Service by $353 million. Procedural history The Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2015 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on July 2, 2014 by Rep. Ander Crenshaw (R-FL). It was reported as an original measure by the United States House Committee on Appropriations. The House began debating the bill on July 14, 2014, when it was brought to the House floor under an open rule, meaning that unlimited amendments were allowed. It passed the House 228-195 on July 17. http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll427.xml Debate and discussion Rep. Gosar, whose amendment cut some of the IRS' funding, said that it was \\"a modest reduction\\" and that \\"this agency has shown contempt for the American taxpayer.\\" Rep. José E.

Initially, bespoke portfolios referenced in most synthetic CDOs were static, meaning that the list of reference securities would change only because of default, because of a succession event, or because of the disappearance of a reference security or its issuer. From 2004 onwards, managed transactions were also issued. Managed bespoke portfolios are those where a third party investment manager is appointed to select the bespoke portfolio but also to buy and sell the underlying reference securities to exploit trading opportunities or avoid credit losses. A synthetic CDO can be structured as a swap between an investor and an arranger, in which case the investor does not need to fund the purchase of the synthetic CDO notes. The majority of bespoke portfolio linked CDOs, however, are embedded into credit-linked notes that are purchased by the investor. Market size The overall volume of CDOs on bespoke portfolios rose rapidly in the early 2000s. In 1999, synthetic CDO issuance in total was less than $10 billion. 2005 issuance of bespoke portfolio tranches was cited by Rajan, McDermott and Roy as $294 billion.The Structured Credit Handbook. Arvind Rajan, Glen McDermott, Ratul Roy. John Wiley & Sons Inc. - Chichester, 2007. p. 6 CDO tranches linked to bespoke portfolios continued to trade after the financial crisis of 2007–08 but in considerably reduced amounts.\\"Crossing Barriers\\". European Credit Views, 9 June 2010. Credit Suisse. Cited advantages As mentioned above, the key advantage to investors was that it allowed them to specify the reference securities in the bespoke portfolio as well as the tranche's attachment and detachment points and other characteristics. A report from the Banque de France stated that: \\"this avoids some of the dangers of traditional CDO structures, such as the risks of moral hazard or adverse selection in the choice of the names in the portfolio ...\\".The CDO market; Functioning and implications in terms of financial stability. Oliver Cousseran and Imene Rahmouni. Banque de France Financial Stability Review, No. 6. June 2005 p. 48 Also, arrangers like CDOs on bespoke portfolios because they are relatively easy to set up. Traditional CDOs take three to six months to arrange and typically cost $2 to $4 million in legal, rating and marketing costs, whereas single tranches on bespoke portfolios can be arranged in four to six weeks and upfront costs are typically less than $500,000. Criticisms Because CDOs linked to bespoke portfolios are, by their nature, only held by one or a very small number of investors, there is no liquid market where they can be bought, sold or valued. Therefore, these CDOs are valued using mathematical models that performed poorly both before and during the financial crisis.Slices of Risk: How a Formula Ignited Market That Burned Some Big Investors. Mark Whitehouse. Wall Street Journal. Sept. 12, 2005.Pricing and Hedging Synthetic CDO Tranche Spread Risks. Michael Sherris and Jie Ding. UNSW Australian School of Business Research Paper No. 2009ACTL04. March 16, 2009 Subsequently banking industry regulators have pointed out concerns applicable to CDO tranches on bespoke portfolios that exceed even the regulators' concerns about index-based tranches (which are referred to as \\"standardized products\\" in regulatory literature). The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's Regulatory Consistency Assessment Programme tested banks' internal models to identify the factors \\"contribut[ing] to the observed variability in trading book RWAs\\". \\"Bespoke products\\" were found to \\"exhibit much larger variability than standardised products\\" with respect to value at risk dispersion.Regulatory Consistency Assessment Programme (RCAP) – Second report on risk-weighted assets for market risk in the trading book. Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. December 2013 A key reason for this was the correlation characteristics of bespoke portfolios, which by their nature were unique to the specific portfolio and inherently unobservable in the markets. Brigo, Pallavicini and Torresetti summed up the problem in their 2010 book as follows: \\"Bespoke corporate pools have no data from which to infer default \\"correlation\\" and dubious mapping methods are used.\\"Credit Models and the Crisis: A journey into CDOs, Copulas, Correlations and Dynamic Models. Damiano Brigo, Andrea Pallavicini, Roberto Torresetti. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. - Chichester, 2010. Preface p. iii One result of this was that hedge funds specializing in credit correlation were able to arbitrage tranches among dealers, buying protection from one dealer and almost immediately selling it at a profit to another dealer.Feldstein Who Speared Whale Ready to Unwind Derivatives. Anthony Effinger and Mary Childs. Bloomberg. Jan 8, 2013. The hedge funds would do this by specifying their own bespoke portfolio and asking 5 to 10 dealers to quote bids and offers on tranches on the portfolio, usually allowing the dealers only a few hours to quote. Often both dealers would report a first-day profit on the trade. Part of the problem lies in calibrating tranches on a bespoke portfolio to observable data generated from credit index tranche prices. Matching a bespoke portfolio to a credit index can be extremely subjective. Rajan, McDermott and Roy discussed the problem and its possible solution: \\"... we have no insight into the value of a tranche that spans, for example, part of two index attachment points ... by being able to relate [correlation] skews across a range of portfolios through their risk characteristics and maturities, one can price and hedge customized tranches of bespoke portfolios.\\"The Structured Credit Handbook. Arvind Rajan, Glen McDermott, Ratul Roy. John Wiley & Sons Inc.- Chichester, 2007. p. 213 However, it is extremely difficult to obtain certainty as to the correlation skew appropriate to a given bespoke portfolio. The aforementioned 2005 Banque de France report pointed out that CDO tranche issuance referencing bespoke portfolios \\"may have a major impact on credit spreads due to their leverage\\". Because CDO tranches on bespoke portfolios could have very narrow spreads between their attachment and detachment points – far less than the 3% to 5% thickness on index tranche products – they could be far more leveraged, meaning that a small movement in credit default swap spreads could cause a very large change in the value of CDO tranches linked to bespoke portfolios. This in turn meant that changes in observed correlations on index tranches caused very large scale buying of CDS protection by swaps dealers during the financial crisis, increasing instability and illiquidity.

The building, which is the headquarters of Devon County Council, is a Grade II* listed building. History Sculpture of a female figure by Barbara Pearson entitled \\"Loving Care\\" Following the implementation of the Local Government Act 1888, which established county councils in every county, it became necessary to find a meeting place for Devon County Council. The administration of justice had been conducted from Rougemont Castle and county leaders decided that the administration of the county should also be conducted from new offices established within the castle in 1895 and that meetings of the county council should be held in a courtroom there. This arrangement continued until the mid 20th century when county leaders decided that they needed dedicated facilities: a site was selected in the grounds of Bellair House, a mansion rebuilt around 1700 by the merchant John Vowler, and an adjoining early Victorian house, known as Coaver. The foundation stone for the new building was laid on 16 October 1958. It was designed by Donald McMorran in the neo-classical style and was officially opened on 14 July 1964. The design involved a three-storey main frontage facing a large expanse of parkland with Bellair House forming the left hand wing and a new block forming the right hand wing; the central section of the main frontage featured three segmental archways leading to an inner courtyard. Internally, the principal room was the council chamber, which was located on the north east side of the inner courtyard; a substantial clock tower was erected above it. The Victorian house, Coaver, was also converted into the complex, as a social club for council staff. An annexe to the east of the main building, to meet the ever increasing accommodation needs of the county council, was completed in 1984. A sculpture of a female figure by Barbara Pearson entitled \\"Loving Care\\" was erected outside Bellair House to commemorate the centenary of Devon County Council in 1988. Queen Elizabeth II, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, attended a reception in the building, as part of a tour of the county to celebrate her Golden Jubilee, on 1 May 2002. Works of art inside the building include watercolour paintings by Hugh Gurney depicting Odam Bridge and the River Mole near Meethe in Devon.

The oldest portion of this house, now a portion of the elongated ell attached to the main block, was built c. 1767 by Nathaniel Merrill, one of the early settlers of Fryeburg after its land was granted to Joseph Frye in 1762. It was sold in 1799 to James Osgood, the son of another early settler. Stephen and Mary (Osgood) Chase inherited this property in 1824, and moved the main block of the house across the street to its present location, and attached the older house to it. The exterior of this house was Federal in styling, although its interior is now Greek Revival in character.National Register nomination for Squire Chase House; available by request from the National Park Service The property was acquired in 1854 by David R. Hastings, who extended the main block's eaves, adding the brackets and cupola of the then-fashionable Italianate style. In 1908 the house was purchased Hattie Pike, a descendant of James Osgood, and was reported in 1979 to still be in the Pike family. The main block of the house connected via the ell to a 19th-century barn. A single-story porch extends across the south side of the house, and another extends across much of the eastern face of the ell.

He served as the head coach of the Sheboygan Red Skins, a team that played in the National Basketball League (NBL) and later the National Basketball Association (NBA), from 1939 to 1942. In 1940–41, the Red Skins made it to the NBL Finals before losing the series 3 games to 0 to the Oshkosh All-Stars. Zummach lived to become a centenarian and died when he was 101 years old. Playing career Zummach was born and raised in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and was a standout multi-sport athlete at Marquette University High School. He enrolled at Marquette University in 1929 but did not play basketball, his strongest sport, as a freshman. In fact, he had never planned to play in college, but when he became eligible to compete in 1930–31 as a sophomore, the team needed bodies and Zummach was given the opportunity to play. New head coach Bill Chandler did not play him in the first four games of the season, but Zummach played the final three quarters in a game against the University of Wisconsin—Marquette's rival—and helped the team to a 16–14 upset win. From then on he became part of the regular rotation, and prior to his junior season in 1931–32 he was given an athletic scholarship to remain on the team. After his junior season in which Marquette finished 11–8, the team had a breakthrough year in Zummach's senior season. He anchored a defense that propelled the Golden Eagles to a 14–3 record, including wins over Notre Dame, Michigan State, Detroit, and Indiana. Although Zummach did not score much, his intangible skills greatly contributed to the team's success. Marquette's men's basketball team registered eight straight losing seasons prior to Zummach and head coach Chandler's arrival, and in their first three seasons together led the Golden Eagles to consecutive winning seasons. Coaching career Frank Zummach enrolled at the Marquette University Law School in 1933 after finishing his undergraduate studies the year before. Coach Chandler insisted that Zummach become an assistant coach, and thus in 1933–34 he became Marquette's first-ever paid assistant men's basketball coach. He stayed as an assistant through the 1938–39 season. Other than the 1939–40 season, Zummach played for or coached Marquette basketball throughout the entire 1930s, one which saw the program have a 63% overall win percentage. On September 6, 1939, Zummach was officially appointed as the new head coach of the Sheboygan Red Skins, then of the NBL. At the time, the NBL was considered the premier professional basketball league in the country. He moved his law firm to Sheboygan, Wisconsin, and took over a franchise that had struggled to an 11–17 record the year before. In his first season as coach, the Red Skins tied the Oshkosh All-Stars for first place in the Western Division. They went on to lose to the All-Stars in the Western Division championship series two games to one. The next year, Sheboygan advanced to the championship series, again against Oshkosh, but lost in the NBL Finals three games to zero. In 1941–42, Zummach's final year as head coach, the Red Skins mustered just a 10–14 record. After the season, Zummach stepped down as coach \\"because of a dispute with business manager Carl Roth over Roth's insistence on paying rookie Kenny Buehler a greater salary than veterans Eddie Dancker, Rube Lautenschlager and Kenny Suesens,\\" according to The Oregonian sports writer Brian Gaynor. The Red Skins, under the direction of new head coach Carl Roth, won the NBL championship in 1942–43. Later life After coaching the Red Skins, Zummach concentrated on his legal career as one of the partners at Wolters & Zummach.

Built c. 1809, this frame house is a good vernacular example of Federal architecture, but is most notable for the murals painted on the walls of one of its bedrooms by Rufus Porter and Jonathan Poor, noted itinerant painters of the 19th century. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The Barrows-Steadman House is a 2-1/2 story timber-frame structure, resting on a fieldstone foundation. It is sheathed in clapboard siding, and has a gable roof pierced by two large internal chimneys. Its main facade, facing Main Street to the northwest, is five bays wide, with a center entry flanked by sidelight windows and Doric pilasters and topped by a fanlight and entablature. The secondary entry is on the southwest side, facing Stuart Street, and is centered on a three-bay facade. The house's southwestern gable features a round-arch window and paired brackets, later Italianate additions. An ell, built c. 1910, extends to the rear (along Stuart Street). It has two doorways in its four bays. The house was built c. 1809, and has been owned by members of the Barrows family since 1820. The house's most notable feature is a room in which murals were drawn in 1830 by the itinerant artist (among many other professions he engaged in) Rufus Porter and Jonathan Poor. This mural is a landscape work, featuring richly colored trees, and is extremely well preserved.National Register nomination for Barrows- Steadman Homestead; available by request from the National Park Service See also *Deacon Hutchins House, another Oxford County house with Porter murals *National Register of Historic Places listings in Oxford County, Maine References Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Maine Category:Federal architecture in Maine Category:Houses completed in 1809 Category:Houses in Oxford County, Maine Category:Fryeburg, Maine Category:National Register of Historic Places in Oxford County, Maine Category:Historic district contributing properties in Maine ","title":"Barrows-Steadman Homestead"},{"id":"43308678","title":"List of animated feature films of 1971"},{"id":"43308699","text":"Action Jackson: Original Soundtrack Album is the official soundtrack album for the 1988 film Action Jackson starring Carl Weathers, Vanity, Craig T.

McCurdy Marine History of the Pacific Northwest, Superior Publishing (1966), at pages 207 and 344. The steamer was launched on March 26, 1912, at 7:00 a.m. No formal launching ceremony was held, due to uncertainty of when during the day the launch would occur.Coos Bay Times, March 27, 1913, page 4, col. 2.Rainbow had been built for Captain Charles E. Edwards (1853-1921) , of Allegany, Oregon.Full name and date of birth for Charles E. Edwards derived from Marshfield Sun, January 1901, Special edition, digitalized at cooshistory.com. Residence at Allegany, Oregon.Another source gives the first owner as the Coos River Transportation Company. Newell, ed., McCurdy Marine History, at page 344, but this appears to be incorrect, as Rogers and Smith, who were principles of the company, did not acquire Rainbow until about October, 1913. See \\"Rainbow Will Be Sold Soon\\", Coos Bay Times, October 13, 1913. At the time of the launch, Rainbow had no engines, and to install the engines and otherwise prepare the vessel for service, was estimated, at the time of launch, to take about three weeks. Captain Edwards had been in charge of another vessel, the Alert, which he had taken out of service to allow him time to complete the Rainbow. Rainbow however was not completed so quickly, it being reported on May 3, 1912 that the vessel was \\"rapidly nearing completion.\\"Coos Bay Times, May 3, 1913, page 2, col. 3.

Total required crew was shown as only two. The steamer was reported to have been \\"built specially for the auto travel so that the part of the journey on water could be made as quickly as possible.\\" Freight was carried on the lower deck, which also included a men's cabin. A women's cabin was on the upper deck, and, when the steamer was placed in service, Captain Edwards intended to establish a restaurant on board. Placed into service On May 29, 1912, it was announced that Rainbow would be placed in service on June 1, 1912, on the run from Marshfield to Allegany.\\"New Steamer Aids Industrial and Pleasure Traffic on Coos River\\", Sunday Oregonian, June 30, 1912, page 13, col. 2.Coos Bay Times, May 29, 1912, page 2, col. 4. The steamer's initial planned use was to take passengers from Marshfield up the Coos River to Allegany, Oregon, where they could take an automobile route to Drain. The automobile route had been established just the year before and was claimed to be the quickest way to reach the main rail line. Rainbow also transported livestock.\\"Falls Into Bay\\", Coos Bay Times, September 3, page 3, col. 4. On the afternoon of September 3, 1912, a cow broke loose on board and fell into Coos Bay. The crew rescued the animal unharmed with the aid of one of the steamer's boat davits.  Sunk by snag  On March 17, 1913, while running on the route between Marshfield and Allegany on the north fork of the Coos River, 'near the head of navigation Rainbow hit a snag and sank.\\"Coos River Steamer Sinks\\", Rogue River Courier, March 21, 1913, page 3, col. 5. According to one report, the water was shallow, so that the passengers were able to wait on the vessel's upper deck until they could be taken off by a gasoline launch. The extent of the damage could not be immediately determined. According to another report, the accident occurred near Ox Head on the north Coos River, when Capt. Herman Edwards was at the vessel's wheel.\\"Snag Damages the Rainbow -- Capt. Edwards' Launch Sunk on North Coos River by Accident Yesterday\\", Coos Bay Times, March 18, 1913, page 1, col. 2. The boat hit the snag a little below Ox Head but did not begin taking on water until a little further on, when the steamer grounded on a bank in shallow water. Four or five passengers were on board, and all were evacuated safely in small boats. The damage turned out not to be too severe. Planned expansion of auto route In May 1913, plans were announced to establish, within a few weeks thereafter, an automobile service route from Allegany to Loon Lake.\\"Plan Service\\", Coos Bay Times, May 29, 1913, page 3, col. 4. Rainbow, under Captain Edwards, was to make the water connection on this route, from Allegany to Marshfield. On June 5, 1913, Rainbow carried a large crowd of passengers into Marshfield for the commencement ceremony at Marshfield High School.\\"Brought Crowd\\", Coos Bay Times, June 6, 1913, page 5, col. 4. In June, 1913, relief service for Rainbow was performed by the launch Telephone.Coos Bay Times, June 19, 1913, page 1, col. 4. As of September 6, 1913, Rainbow was under the command of Capt. Herman Edwards and making tourist excursions on Sundays.\\"Excursion to Life Station\\", Coos Bay Times, September 6, 1913, page 5, col. 4. Rainbow was employed on an excursion to the life- saving station on Sunday, September 7, 1913, departing from a dock at the rear of the Pioneer Hardware store at 8 a.m., with round-trip fare of 50 cents. Machinery accident on board On the evening of September 10, 1913, George Overst, then aged 20, who was serving as a fireman on the Rainbow was seriously injured when his clothing caught around a rotating shaft in the vessel's machinery.\\"Close Call in Engine Room\\", Coos Bay Times, 9/11/1913, page 1, col. 4. He could have been killed except that at just that moment the sternwheeler was coming in to the dock at Marshfield, and the engines were reversed, unwinding Overst's clothing and permitting him to free himself. Overst had only been in Coos Bay a few months and was originally from Sherwood, Oregon. Sale and transfer to south fork Coos River On September 26, 1913, Rainbow was advertised as making a connection to a new \\"auto stage\\" route that ran from Marshfield to Drain, Oregon via Allegany, Scottburg, and thereafter to Portland.Coos Bay Times, September 26, 1913, page 3, col 1. Rainbow boarded passengers every morning at 8:00 a.m. for this route, the fare for which was $11 as far as Drain. The traffic on the water-overland route from Marshfield to Drain via the water connection at Allegany did not prove to be great enough for Rainbow to sustain a profit.\\"Rainbow Will Be Sold Soon -- New Boat to Be Bought for South Coos River Service -- Alert to be Overhauled, Coos Bay Times, October 13, 1913, page 8, col. 3. In October, 1913, Captain Edwards made arrangements for the transfer of Rainbow to Herbert H. Rogers and E. George Smith, who intended to place the vessel on the south fork of the Coos River, the demand for steamer services was rising. It was considered likely that the Express, which had been on the south river run, would be transferred to the north fork, at least until the overhaul of Alert could be completed. The transaction was expected to be effective on about November 1, 1913, when it was estimated that an overhaul of Alert could be completed.\\"Boat changes', Coos Bay Times, October 25, 1913, page 5, col. 2.In addition to his ownership interest in Rainbow, Herbert H. Smith may have had a poultry business, as he advertised himself as wanting to acquire two turkey hens for breeding. Coos Bay Times, December 6, 1915, page 3, col. 3. On January 20, 1914, Capt. A.G. Smith was reported to be in command of Rainbow.Coos Bay Times, January 20, 1914, page 5, col. 4. On February 28, 1914, Rainbow was hauled out at the Kruse and Banks shipyard in North Bend, Oregon for repainting and maintenance.Coos Bay Times, Feb. 28, 1914, page 5, col. 4. As of February 25, 1915, Rainbow was providing service to and from Marshfield on the south fork of the Coos River.Coos Bay Times, February 25, 1915, page 2, col. 5. The vessel departed from the head of navigation on the south fork every morning at 7:00 a.m. en route to Marshfield, and then left Marshfield at 2:00 p.m. daily going back upriver. Rainbow was then run in concert with the launch Express, which left Marshfield daily at 8:00 a.m, ran up the south fork of the Coos River, where it departed from the head of navigation at 3:15 pm and returned to Marshfield. The concern of Rogers & Smith were then the proprietors of both Rainbow and Express. On June 8, 1915, a steam pipe broke on Rainbow, and the vessel lost power.\\"Waterfront News\\", Coos Bay Times, June 9, 1915, page 1, col. 7. As a result, when an anchor failed to hold, the steamer drifted ashore onto a flat. Rainbow was brought off later without damage, and the anchor was recovered. George Smith, who by then had been captain of the Rainbow for four years, sold his interest in the Coos River Transportation Company to S.C. Rogers.Morning Oregonian, November 2, 1917, page 16, col. 4. The place of George Smith as captain was taken by Thomas Smith.

Larger steamer on the left is the Alert.Timmen, Fritz, Blow for the Landing -- A Hundred Years of Steam Navigation on the Waters of the West, Caxton, 1973, at page 200, showing an identical steamer on the Marshfield waterfront and identifying it as Alert. In March 1921, a case was heard before the Coos County Circuit Court in which L.A. Blanc, owner of the Coos Bay Creamery, sued the Coos River Transportation Company for $19,000, claiming that sparks from the steamer Rainbow landed on the roof of the creamery, resulting in a fire which destroyed the structure and a large amount of cheese which had been stored inside.\\"Juries Waste Four Days -- Fail to Agree in Three Cases Upsets Court Calendar\\", \\"Morning Oregonian, March 9, 1921, page 6, col. 1.

The allegations, filed against the company as well as S.C. Rogers and Herbert Rogers, were that in the previous year, in June 1919, the creamery, which had been located on the Coos River about 1.5 miles from Marshfield, was found to be on fire a short time after the Rainbow passed, causing total destruction of the creamery and loss of a large amount of cheese and butter. The creamery burned on June 16, 1919.\\"Coos Bay Creamery Burns\\", Morning Oregonian, June 17, 1919, page 9, col. 4. Some diary stocks were salvaged from the fire, and at least some of the loss was believed to be covered by insurance. Disposition Rainbow was scrapped in 1923.

Updated guidelines for cholesterol management were established in 2013 by the American Heart Association (AHA) and American College of Cardiology (ACC).

Circulation. 2002; 106(25):3143-3421. The main Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes components include: :* Less than 7 percent of your daily calories from saturated fat :* Less than 200 mg a day of cholesterol :* 25–35 percent of daily calories from total fat :* Weight reduction if overweight with only enough calories to reach or maintain a healthy weight :* At least 30 minutes of a moderate intensity physical activity, such as brisk walking, on most, and preferably all, days of the week. After six weeks, The National Cholesterol Education Program recommends checking the LDL cholesterol response to the changes; if the LDL cholesterol goal has not been achieved, other therapeutic options for LDL lowering can be implemented. These include: 2 grams per day of plant stanols or sterols and 10–25 grams per day of soluble fiber. Macronutrient Distribution of the TLC Diet The Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes macronutrient profile includes: :* Total fat: 25–35% of total calories :* Saturated fat: Less than 7% of total calories :* Polyunsaturated fat: Up to 10% of total calories :* Monounsaturated fat: Up to 20% of total calories :* Carbohydrate: 50–60% of total calories :* Dietary fiber: 20–30 grams per day :* Protein: Approximately 15% of total calories :* Cholesterol: Less than 200 mg/day  Research Findings  The recommendations for cholesterol management through lifestyle changes from the National Cholesterol Education Program have evolved over time based on data from epidemiological observations, animal studies, and clinical trials. Animal models have demonstrated a direct relationship between LDL cholesterol and atherosclerosis. Animals consuming diets high in saturated fat and cholesterol develop LDL cholesterol elevation and atherosclerosis. Nicolosi RJ. Dietary fat saturation effects on low- density lipoprotein concentrations and metabolism in various animal models. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1997; 65: 1617S–1627S.

Lipoproteins, nutrition, aging and atherosclerosis. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1995; 61: 726S–740S. One randomized crossover study completed at Tufts University and New England Medical Center looked at the Therapeutic Lifestyle Change diet relative to a typical Western diet. Thirty-six participants with moderately elevated cholesterol levels participated in two 32-day phases where the subjects consumed their normal dietary patterns or the experimental diet consistent with the NCEP recommendations. This diet provided 30% calories from fat, 7% calories from saturated fat, and 75 mg cholesterol per 1,000 calories. Relative to the Western diet, the TLC diet resulted in 11% lower LDL cholesterol.

Additional studies have looked at the benefits of plant stanols and sterols on lowering LDL cholesterol. One randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial assessed the lipid-altering efficacy of a softgel capsule providing esterified plan stanols/sterols in 28 subjects with primary hypercholesterolemia.

Participants followed the TLC diet for 5 weeks followed by 6 weeks of either the sterol/stanol capsule or a placebo before crossing over to the other product for 6 weeks while continuing the TLC diet. Results indicated that incorporating sterols/stanols into the TLC diet produced positive changes in LDL cholesterol by 9.2%, total cholesterol by 7.4%, and triglycerides by 9.1%. A following study replicated this original study design, supporting the efficacy of 1.8 grams/day of esterified plant sterols/stanols in adjunct with the TLC diet to reduce lipid levels in participants with hypercholesterolemia.

In 1989 he used this pioneering method to successfully treat the first premature infant with severe RDS. Verder is a significant researcher within the field of paediatrics, with more than 50 publications and over 500 citations. Biography Verder received his medical degree from Copenhagen University in 1968 and went on to specialise in paediatrics in 1978, concentrating on prenatal determination of lung maturity and prevention of RDS (Infant Respiratory Distress Syndrome). In 1980 he was awarded his medical doctorate from Copenhagen University for his thesis on “Prenatal determination of lung maturity and prevention of RDS”. Career In 1972 Verder began his associated professorship at Copenhagen University where he went on to become a Professor of Paediatrics and Neonatology. In 1989, at Holbaek Hospital, Verder was the first physician to successfully combine nasal CPAP and surfactant to treat an infant with severe RDS (28 weeks). This unique method was later named INSURE by Mats Blennow et al. The full method was first published in 1992 along with the first documentation of infants treated with surfactant via a small diameter tube. Egbert Herting has since described this method as ‘Less Invasive Surfactant Administration (LISA)’. In addition surfactant administration via a laryngeal mask was described for the first time in 1992. The introduction of CPAP in the treatment of RDS more than halved the mortality rate of RDS – reducing mortality from an estimated 50% to 20%. CPAP, when combined with the use of surfactant (INSURE), halved the mortality rate once again, lowering it to approximately 10%. Early treatment of premature infants with RDS using the nasal CPAP and surfactant (INSURE) method is today considered the Global Gold standard of care. Alongside his clinical achievements, Verder has also been actively involved in improving childcare and in 1975 he took the position of consultant for “Glostrup Observation Home” an institution for observation and treatment of neglected infants and toddlers. In 1998 Verder began working with Professor Bo Sun at Fudan University, Shanghai, to improve neonatal care across China. As a part of this initiative he has visited more than 50 hospitals across 25 provinces and given lectures on the prevention and treatment of RDS, nutrition of pre- term and newborn infants and mother child attachment. Alongside his contributions to Copenhagen University and his work in China, Verder also took the position of Co-chairman at Save the Children Denmark from 1990 to 1993. In this position, together with secretary-general Kristian Sørensen and lawyer Hanne Jensbo from Save the Children Denmark, he spearheaded the opening of Romanian orphanages after the fall of Ceaucescu in 1989. Verder was also involved in several initiatives, which supported the Romanian healthcare system. In 2011 Verder became a member of the steering committee of “The Family Center” directed by Dr. May Olofsson, Hvidovre University Hospital, Copenhagen. An organisation that treats infants and mothers suffering from sequelae, caused by alcohol and drug addiction during pregnancy. The INSURE Method Verder is the inventor and pioneer of the INSURE method, a very effective approach to managing preterm neonates with respiratory distress. The method itself has been shown to successfully decrease the use of mechanical ventilation and lower the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Since its inception in 1989 the INSURE method has been academically cited in more than 500 papers. The first randomised study on the INSURE method was published in 1994 and a second randomised study in infants less than 30 weeks gestation was published by the group in 1999. In the last 15 years Verder has worked with lung maturity diagnostics on gastric aspirates obtained at birth. By combining this diagnostic method with INSURE, Verder has worked to further improve the clinical outcome of RDS. The lung maturity tests used have been the microbubble test, lamellar body counts (LBC) and measurements of lecithin- sphingomyelin ratio (L/S) with chemometrics, involving a collaboration with Agnar Höskuldsson.

It stars Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Walton Goggins, Demián Bichir, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, and Bruce Dern as eight strangers who seek refuge from a blizzard in a stagecoach stopover some time after the American Civil War. Tarantino announced The Hateful Eight in November 2013. He conceived it as a novel and sequel to his previous film Django Unchained (2012) before deciding to make it a standalone film. After the script leaked in January 2014, he canceled the film and instead directed a live reading at the United Artists Theater in Los Angeles, before reconsidering and resuming progress on the project. Filming began on December 8, 2014, near Telluride, Colorado. The original score was Italian composer Ennio Morricone's first and only for a Tarantino film, his first complete Western score in 34 years, and his first for a high-profile Hollywood production since Brian De Palma's Mission to Mars in 2000. Distributed by The Weinstein Company in the United States, The Hateful Eight was released on December 25, 2015, in a limited roadshow release on 70 mm film, before expanding wide theatrically on December 30, 2015. It received positive reviews from critics, particularly for the performances of the cast and Morricone's score. It grossed $155.8 million. Budget estimations include from $44 million from Box Office Mojo, $54 million from the Hollywood Reporter, to $62 million from Variety. For his work on the score, Morricone won his first Academy Award for Best Original Score, as well as the Golden Globe. The film also earned Oscar nominations for Best Supporting Actress (Leigh) and Best Cinematography (Robert Richardson). On April 25, 2019, the film was released as a re-edited four-episode miniseries on Netflix with the subtitle Extended Version. The Hateful Eight is Tarantino's final film to have the involvement of The Weinstein Company, as he ended his working relationship with the company following allegations of sexual abuse against Harvey Weinstein in October 2017. Plot In 1877, bounty hunter and Civil War veteran Major Marquis Warren is transporting three dead bounties to Red Rock, Wyoming. He hitches a ride on a stagecoach driven by O.B.; aboard is bounty hunter John Ruth, handcuffed to fugitive Daisy Domergue, whom Ruth is escorting to Red Rock to be hanged. Ruth and Warren are acquaintances, having bonded over Warren's personal letter from Abraham Lincoln. Former Lost-Causer militiaman Chris Mannix, traveling to Red Rock as the town's new sheriff, persuades Ruth and Warren to let him on the stagecoach. Warren and Ruth form an alliance to protect each other's bounties. The group seeks refuge from a blizzard at Minnie's Haberdashery, a stagecoach lodge with a broken lock on the front door. They are greeted by Bob, a Mexican, who says the owner, Minnie, is away visiting her mother, raising Warren's suspicions. The other lodgers are Oswaldo Mobray, Red Rock's new hangman; Joe Gage, a cowboy returning home to visit his mother; and Sanford Smithers, a former Confederate general traveling to lay his son to rest. Suspicious, Ruth disarms all but Warren, who inadvertently kicks a jellybean on the floor and notices one of Minnie's jellybean jars is missing. Mannix surmises that Warren's Lincoln letter is a forgery, and Warren, who is black, acknowledges that the false letter buys him leeway with whites, outraging Ruth. Warren leaves a gun next to Smithers and provokes him by explaining that he tortured, raped, and murdered Smithers' son. When Smithers reaches for the gun, Warren shoots him in revenge for Smithers' executions of black prisoners of war at the Battle of Baton Rouge. During the confrontation, someone poisons the brewing coffee. Ruth and O.B. drink it, killing O.B. The dying Ruth attacks Daisy, who kills him with his own gun. Warren disarms Daisy, leaving her shackled to Ruth's corpse, and holds the others at gunpoint. He is joined by Mannix, whom Warren trusts because he nearly drank the poisoned coffee. Discovering that the chair usually occupied by frequent lodger Sweet Dave is stained with blood and claiming that Minnie hates Mexicans and would never leave the Haberdashery in one's care, Warren deduces that Bob is an impostor who killed the lodge owners and executes him. When Warren threatens to execute Daisy, Gage admits that he poisoned the coffee. A man hiding in the cellar shoots Warren from below. Mobray draws a concealed gun and shoots Mannix, who returns fire, mortally wounding Mobray. Hours earlier, Bob, Mobray, Gage, and Daisy's brother Jody arrive at the lodge. They murder Minnie and five bystanders, leaving only Smithers. Jody tells Smithers that they plan to ambush Ruth to rescue Daisy, and will spare Smithers if he keeps quiet. During the murders, a jar of jellybeans is shattered, and the lock on the front door is destroyed. The bandits dispose of the bodies, hide the evidence, and conceal guns around the lodge. As Ruth's stagecoach arrives, Jody hides in the cellar. In the present, Mannix and Warren, both seriously wounded, hold Daisy, Gage, and the dying Mobray at gunpoint. When they threaten to kill Daisy, Jody surrenders and is immediately executed by Warren. Daisy claims that fifteen of her brother's men are waiting in Red Rock to kill Mannix and ransack the town; if Mannix kills Warren and allows her to escape, the gang will spare him and let him claim the bounties of the deceased except her brother. As Daisy and Mobray taunt Warren, Warren shoots them both, killing Mobray. Gage draws a hidden revolver, but is shot dead by Mannix and Warren. Warren tries to shoot Daisy, but is out of bullets. Mannix calls Daisy's bluff and rejects her offer, but faints from blood loss. Daisy hacks off Ruth's handcuffed arm and frees herself. As she reaches for Gage's gun, Mannix regains consciousness and shoots her. Warren persuades Mannix to hang Daisy from the rafters in honor of Ruth. Afterward, as the two men lie dying, Mannix reads aloud Warren's forged Lincoln letter, complimenting its detail. Cast * Samuel L.

Production In November 2013, writer-director Quentin Tarantino said he was working on another Western. He initially attempted the story as a novel, a sequel to his film Django Unchained titled Django in White Hell, but realized that the Django character did not fit the story. On January 12, 2014, the title was announced as The Hateful Eight. The film was inspired by the 1960s Western TV series Bonanza, The Virginian and The High Chaparral. Tarantino said: The Hateful Eight Live Reading at the Ace Hotel Los Angeles, as part of LACMA's Live Read series, on April 19, 2014 Production would most likely have begun in mid 2014, but after the script leaked online in January 2014, Tarantino considered publishing it as a novel instead. He said he had given the script to a few trusted colleagues, including Bruce Dern, Tim Roth, and Michael Madsen. This version of the script featured a different ending in which Warren and Mannix attempt to kill Gage in revenge by forcing him to drink the poisoned coffee, sparking a firefight in which every character is killed. Tarantino described his vision for the character of Daisy Domergue as a \\"Susan Atkins of the Wild West\\". On April 19, 2014, Tarantino directed a live reading of the leaked script at the United Artists Theater in the Ace Hotel Los Angeles. The event was organized by the Film Independent at Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) as part of the Live Read series and introduced by Elvis Mitchell. Tarantino explained that they would read the first draft of the script, and he added that he was writing two new drafts with a different ending. The actors who joined Tarantino included Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Amber Tamblyn, James Parks, Walton Goggins, Zoë Bell, James Remar, Dana Gourrier, Dern, Roth and Madsen. =Casting= On September 23, 2014, it was revealed that Viggo Mortensen was in discussion with Tarantino for a role in the film. On October 9, 2014, Jennifer Jason Leigh was added to the cast to play Daisy Domergue. On November 5, 2014, it was announced that Channing Tatum was eyeing a major role in the film. Later the same day, The Weinstein Company confirmed the cast in a press release, which would include Samuel L. Jackson, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Kurt Russell, Tim Roth, Demián Bichir, Walton Goggins, Michael Madsen, and Bruce Dern. Tatum's casting was also confirmed. Later on January 23, 2015, TWC announced an ensemble cast of supporting members, including James Parks, Dana Gourrier, Zoë Bell, Gene Jones, Keith Jefferson, Lee Horsley, Craig Stark, and Belinda Owino. In the earlier public reading of the first script, the role of Daisy Domergue had been read by Amber Tamblyn, and the role of Bob, a Frenchman rather than a Mexican, was read by Denis Ménochet; at the reading, the role of Jody was read by James Remar. Regarding the cast, Tarantino has said, \\"This is a movie where [bigger movie stars] wouldn't work. It needs to be an ensemble where nobody is more important than anybody else.\\" =Filming= On September 26, 2014, the state of Colorado had signed to fund the film's production with $5 million, and the complete film would be shot in Southwest Colorado. A 900-acre ranch was leased to the production for the filming. There was a meeting on October 16, and the county's planning commission issued a permit for the construction of a temporary set. Principal photography began on December 8, 2014, in Colorado on the Schmid Ranch near Telluride. The film's special make-up effects were created by Greg Nicotero, known for his work on the AMC series The Walking Dead.  Antique guitar incident  The guitar destroyed by Russell's character was not a prop but an antique 1870s Martin guitar lent by the Martin Guitar Museum. According to sound producer Mark Ulano, the guitar was supposed to have been switched with a copy to be destroyed, but this was not communicated to Russell; everyone on the set was \\"pretty freaked out\\" at the guitar's destruction, and Leigh's reaction was genuine, though \\"Tarantino was in a corner of the room with a funny curl on his lips, because he got something out of it with the performance.\\" Museum director Dick Boak said that the museum was not told that the script included a scene that called for a guitar being smashed, and determined that it was irreparable. The insurance remunerated the purchase value of the guitar. As a result of the incident, the museum no longer lends props to film productions. =Cinematography= Cinematographer Robert Richardson, who also worked with Tarantino on Kill Bill, Inglourious Basterds, and Django Unchained, filmed The Hateful Eight on 65 mm film, using three modern 65mm camera models: the Arriflex 765 and the Studio 65 and the 65 HS from Panavision. The film was transferred to 70 mm film for projection using Ultra Panavision 70 and Kodak Vision 3 film stocks: 5219, 5207, 5213 and 5203. Until the release of Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk two years later, it was the widest release in 70 mm film since Ron Howard's Far and Away in 1992. The film uses Panavision anamorphic lenses with an aspect ratio of 2.76:1, a very widescreen image that was used on some films in the 1950s and 1960s. The filmmakers also avoided any use of a digital intermediate in the 70mm roadshow release, which was color-timed photochemically by FotoKem, and the dailies were screened in 70mm. The wide digital release and a handful of 35mm prints were struck from a digital intermediate, done by Yvan Lucas at Shed/Santa Monica. =Post-production= Tarantino edited two versions of the film, one for the roadshow version and the other for general release. The roadshow version runs for three hours and two minutes, including six minutes of extra footage plus an overture and intermission, and has alternate takes of some scenes. Tarantino created two versions as he felt some of the footage he shot for 70mm would not play well on smaller screens. Classifications from the British Board of Film Classification confirm that the time difference between the Roadshow (187 minutes) and the DCP (167 minutes) releases is 20 minutes. Music Tarantino announced at the 2015 Comic-Con that Ennio Morricone would compose the score for The Hateful Eight; it is the first Western scored by Morricone in 34 years, since Buddy Goes West, and Tarantino's first film to use an original score. Tarantino had previously used Morricone's music in Kill Bill, Death Proof, Inglourious Basterds, and Django Unchained, and Morricone also wrote an original song, \\"Ancora Qui\\", for the latter. Morricone had previously made statements that he would \\"never work\\" with Tarantino after Django Unchained, but ultimately changed his mind and agreed to score The Hateful Eight. According to Variety, Morricone composed the score without even seeing the film. The soundtrack was announced on November 19, 2015, for a December 18 release from Decca Records. Ennio Morricone composed 50 minutes of original music for The Hateful Eight. In addition to Morricone's original score, the soundtrack includes dialogue excerpts from the film, \\"Apple Blossom\\" by The White Stripes from their De Stijl album, \\"Now You're All Alone\\" by David Hess from The Last House on the Left and \\"There Won't Be Many Coming Home\\" by Roy Orbison from The Fastest Guitar Alive. Tarantino confirmed that the film would use three unused tracks from Morricone's original soundtrack for the 1982 John Carpenter film The Thing—\\"Eternity\\", \\"Bestiality\\", and \\"Despair\\"—as Morricone was pressed for time while creating the score. The final film also uses Morricone's \\"Regan's Theme\\" from the 1977 John Boorman film Exorcist II: The Heretic. Morricone's score won several awards including a special award from New York Film Critics Circle. The score won a Golden Globe for Best Original Score. It also took the 2016 Academy Award for Best Motion Picture Score, Morricone's first after several career nominations. The acoustic song played by Leigh's character Domergue on a Martin guitar is the traditional Australian folk ballad \\"Jim Jones at Botany Bay\\", which dates from the early 19th century and was first published by Charles McAlister in 1907.Charles MacAlister, Old Pioneering Days in the Sunny South (1907), \\"Jim Jones at Botany Bay\\" (1 text) The rendition in the film includes lines which were not in MacAlister's version.Ron Edwards, The Big Book of Australian Folk Song The film's trailer used Welshly Arms' cover of \\"Hold On, I'm Coming\\", although this is not used in the film itself. The soundtrack was released under the Third Man Records label, which is operated by musician Jack White. Release The cast and director of The Hateful Eight at the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con to promote the film. On September 3, 2014, The Weinstein Company (TWC) acquired the worldwide distribution rights to the film for a fall 2015 release. TWC would sell the film worldwide, but Tarantino asked to personally approve the global distributors for the film. In preparation for its release, Tarantino arranged for approximately 100 theaters worldwide to be retrofitted with anamorphic equipped 70 mm film projectors, in order to display the film as he intended. The film was released on December 25, 2015, as a roadshow presentation in 70 mm film format theaters. The film was initially scheduled to be released in digital theaters on January 8, 2016. On December 14, The Hollywood Reporter announced that the film would see wide release on December 31, 2015, while still screening the 70 mm version. The release date was moved to December 30, 2015, to meet demand. On July 11, 2015, Tarantino and the cast of the film appeared at San Diego Comic-Con to promote the film. In the UK, where the film was distributed by Entertainment Film Distributors, the sole 70mm print in the country opened at the Odeon Leicester Square on January 8 in a roadshow presentation, with the digital general release version opening the same day at other cinemas, except Cineworld, who refused to book the film after failing to reach an agreement to show the 70mm print. On March 15, 2016, The Hateful Eight was released in the United States on Digital HD, and on Blu-ray and DVD on March 29, 2016. On December 20, 2015, screener copies of The Hateful Eight and numerous other Oscar contenders, including Carol, The Revenant, Brooklyn, Creed, and Straight Outta Compton, were uploaded to many websites. The FBI linked the case to co-CEO Andrew Kosove of Alcon Entertainment. Kosove responded that he had \\"never seen this DVD\\", and that \\"it never touched his hands.\\" In April 2019, the streaming service Netflix released an extended miniseries version of the film, split into four episodes. Reception =Box office= The Hateful Eight grossed $54.1 million in the U.S. and Canada, and $101.6 million in other countries, for worldwide gross of $155.8 million. The film opened in the US with a limited release on December 25, 2015, and over the weekend grossed $4.9 million from 100 theaters ($46,107 per screen), finishing 10th at the box office. It had its wide release on December 30, grossing $3.5 million on its first day. The film went on to gross $15.7 million in its opening weekend, finishing third at the box office behind Star Wars: The Force Awakens ($90.2 million) and Daddy's Home ($29.2 million). =Critical reception and analysis= On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 75% based on 332 reviews and an average rating of 7.36/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"The Hateful Eight offers another well- aimed round from Quentin Tarantino's signature blend of action, humor, and over-the-top violence—all while demonstrating an even stronger grip on his filmmaking craft.\\" On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 68 out of 100 based on 51 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B\\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported audiences gave it a 42% \\"definite recommend\\". James Berardinelli wrote that The Hateful Eight \\"is a high-wire thriller, full of masterfully executed twists, captivating dialogue, and a wildly entertaining narrative that gallops along at a pace to make three hours evaporate in an instant. Best film of the year? Yes.\\" Telegraph critic Robbie Collin wrote: \\"The Hateful Eight is a parlour-room epic, an entire nation in a single room, a film steeped in its own filminess but at the same time vital, riveting and real. Only Tarantino can do this, and he’s done it again.\\" The Guardian critic Peter Bradshaw gave the film five out of five, and wrote that it was \\"intimate yet somehow weirdly colossal, once again releasing [Tarantino's] own kind of unwholesome crazy-funny-violent nitrous oxide into the cinema auditorium for us all to inhale ... \\"Thriller\\" is a generic label which has lost its force. But The Hateful Eight thrills.\\" A.V. Club critic Ignatiy Vishnevetsky gave the film a grade of A- and wrote that \\"with a script that could easily be a stage play, The Hateful Eight is about as close as this pastiche artist is likely to get to the classical tradition.\\" In contrast, Owen Gleiberman of the BBC said, \\"I'm not alone in thinking that it's Tarantino's worst film – a sluggish, unimaginative dud, brimming with venom but not much cleverness.\\" Donald Clarke, writing in The Irish Times, wrote, \\"What a shame the piece is so lacking in character and narrative coherence. What a shame so much of it is so gosh-darn boring.\\" A. O. Scott in The New York Times said, \\"Some of the film's ugliness...seems dumb and ill-considered, as if Mr. Tarantino's intellectual ambition and his storytelling discipline had failed him at the same time.\\" Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter praised the film's production design, idiosyncratic dialogue, and \\"lip- smackingly delicious\\" performances, but felt the film was overlong and that Morricone's score was put to too limited use. Scholars Florian Zitzelsberger and Sarah E. Beyvers observe that the film follows Aristotle's unities: \\"Tarantino’s film meticulously adheres to the classical unities of a tragedy, which had been seen as a necessity for the audience’s immersion for a long time: The Hateful Eight follows only one plot (unity of action), it is limited to a time period of 24 hours (unity of time).\\" https://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1482&=&context;=ijcs&=&sei- redir;=1& Revisionist Spectacle? Theatrical Remediation in Alejandro G. In ̃a ́rritu’s Birdman and Quentin Tarantino’s The Hateful Eight Hollis Robbins argues that The Hateful Eight is a panoramic Western chamber drama: \\"Tarantino’s eighth film demands to be seen not as a revisionist but a newly visioned western, using the mythmaker’s tools to offer a panoramic vision of racial sovereignty undone by random violence.\\" Robbins, Hollis. “U.S. History in 70 MM: The Hateful Eight (2015). Directed by Quentin Tarantino.” The Journal of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era, vol. 15, no. 3, 2016, pp. 368-370 =Top ten lists= The Hateful Eight was listed on many critics' top ten movies of the year lists. * 1st – James Berardinelli, Reelviews * 2nd – Scott Feinberg, The Hollywood Reporter * 2nd – Peter Sobczynski, RogerEbert.com * 3rd – Amy Nicholson, L.A.

I have to call a murder a murder, and I have to call the murderers the murderers.\\" Tarantino's comments received national media attention and several police groups in the United States pledged to boycott The Hateful Eight and his other films. New York City Police Benevolent Association president Patrick J. Lynch said: \\"With nearly one million law enforcement officers in this country who have families and friends who support them, the impact that police have economically on a product or project is immense. The law enforcement boycott of cop-hater Quentin Tarantino's movie is one demonstration of that economic power.\\" Tarantino responded that he was not a \\"cop hater\\" and would not be intimidated by the calls for a boycott. Richard Johnson of the New York Post called The Hateful Eight a \\"box-office disaster, and the police officers who boycotted the movie are taking credit\\". However, Forbes rebutted this claim in an article titled \\"No, Police Boycotts Against Quentin Tarantino didn't cause Hateful Eight to Flop\\", writing that the film, while not as commercially successful as some of Tarantino's other films, was not a \\"box-office disaster\\" and cast doubt on claims that a boycott had a strong effect on sales. = Race issues = Tarantino told GQ that race issues were part of his creative process and were inescapable, saying: \\"I wasn’t trying to bend over backwards in any way, shape, or form to make it socially relevant. But once I finished the script, that’s when all the social relevancy started.\\" He told The Telegraph he wrote The Hateful Eight to reflect America's fraught racial history, with the splitting of the cabin into northern and southern sides and a speech about the perils of \\"frontier justice\\". A. O. Scott of The New York Times observed that the film rejects the Western genre's tradition of ignoring America's racial history, but felt its handling of race issues was \\"dumb and ill-considered\\", and wrote: \\"Tarantino doesn’t make films that are 'about race' so much as he tries to burrow into the bowels of American racism with his camera and his pen. There is no way to do that and stay clean.\\" =Sex issues= Some critics expressed unease at the treatment of the Daisy Domergue character, who is the subject of repeated physical and verbal abuse and finally hanged in a sequence which, according to Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com, \\"lingers on Daisy's death with near- pornographic fascination\\". A.O. Scott felt the film \\"mutates from an exploration of racial animus into an orgy of elaborately justified misogyny\\". Laura Bogart regarded the treatment of Daisy as a \\"betrayal\\" of the positive female characters in previous Tarantino films such as Kill Bill. Juliette Peers wrote that \\"compared to the stunning twists and inversions of norms that Tarantino's other works offer when presenting female characters, The Hateful Eight's sexual politics seem bleakly conservative. Daisy is feisty and highly intelligent, yet the plotline is arbitrarily stacked against her.\\" Conversely, Courtney Bissonette of Bust praised Tarantino's history of female characters and wrote of Daisy's treatment: \\"This is equality, man, and it’s more feminist to think that a criminal is getting treated the same despite her sex. They don't treat her like a fairy princess because she is a woman, they treat her like a killer because she is a killer.\\" Sophie Besl of Bitch Flicks argued that Daisy received no special treatment as a woman, is never sexually objectified, and has agency over her own actions (including killing her captor). She defended the hanging scene as in the filmic tradition of villains \\"getting what's coming to [them]\\", and that equivalent scenes with male villains in previous Tarantino films raised no objections. However, Matthew Stogdon felt that as Daisy's crimes are not explained, her status as a criminal deserving execution is not established, breaking the narrative rule of \\"show, don't tell\\". Walton Goggins described the lynching as symbolic of a positive step to erase racism: \\"I see it as very uplifting, as very hopeful, and as a big step in the right direction, as a celebration, as a changing of one heart and one mind.\\" However, Sasha Stone, writing for Awards Daily, felt it was implausible for Daisy to \\"represent, somehow, all of the evil of the South, all of the racism, all of the injustice. She's a tiny thing. There is no point in the film, or maybe one just barely, when Daisy inflicts any violence upon anyone – and by then it could be argued that she is only desperately trying to defend herself. She is handcuffed to Kurt Russell, needing his permission to speak and eat, and then punched brutally in the face whenever she says anything.\\" Tarantino intended the violence against Daisy to be shocking and wanted the audience's allegiances to shift during the story. He said: \\"Violence is hanging over every one of those characters like a cloak of night. So I'm not going to go, 'OK, that's the case for seven of the characters, but because one is a woman, I have to treat her differently.' I'm not going to do that.\\" =Accolades= Stage adaptation In early 2016, Tarantino announced that he plans to adapt The Hateful Eight as a stage play. He planned to start writing the stage play as soon as the award season wraps up, with intentions to direct it as well. As of October 2020, the stage adaptation has not been released.

Cochrane was born on 20 June 1874 and was the eldest son of Vice Admiral Basil E. Cochrane. His family had a tradition of naval service and among them was the similarly-named Archibald Cochrane (1783–1829). Educated at Woodcote House in Windlesham, Surrey and then at Eastman's Royal Naval Academy, Stubbington House School and HMS Britannia, Cochrane joined the Royal Navy in 1888 and went to sea in 1890. He was promoted to Sub-Lieutenant in 1894 and to Lieutenant in 1896. While holding that rank and stationed on HMS Anson in 1897, he was given charge of an operation involving a landing on Crete. In February 1900, he was posted to the pre-dreadnought battleship HMS Ocean, which was stationed at the Mediterranean Fleet for its first commission. Cochrane then became Flag Lieutenant to Vice-Admiral Sir H. Grenfell in the Mediterranean Squadron and in 1906 took command of HMS Speedwell in the Home Fleet. He was promoted to Commander in 1908 and was commanding HMS Alacrity in China at the start of World War I. He took command of HMS Empress of Russia, an armed Canadian Pacific steamships liner, during 1914–15 and then was posted to the Aegean Squadron in command of HMS Sentinel until June 1916. Staying with that squadron, which formed part of the Eastern Mediterranean Fleet, he commanded HMS Skirmisher until September 1918. He was promoted to Captain in that year. Following the war, Cochrane stayed in the navy, completing 41 years of service before retiring in 1929. He was promoted to Rear-Admiral in his final year of service, during which he also acted as ADC to George V. He had married Maye, only daughter of Colonel A. de V. Brooke, in 1904 and the couple had four daughters. He died at his home in Windlesham on 15 July 1952. Cochrane was invested as a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1918 and was also honoured with appointment to the Order of the Redeemer of Greece and as a Chevalier de la Légion d’honneur.

Plot Maud Schoenberg (Isabelle Huppert) suffers a cerebral hemorrhage that leaves her paralysed on one half of her body. After a year of intense therapy Maud, a director, begins to work on a new project. After seeing an interview with a con-man, Vilko Piran (Kool Shen), she immediately asks him to star as the lead in her film, about a lower-class man who falls in love with a famous actress, eventually beating her to death. Vilko accepts but insists that he see Maud as much as possible before filming begins.

Soon after, she gave him €25,000 to write a screenplay titled La vie amoureuse de Christophe Rocancourt (The Love Life of Christophe Rocancourt), and over the next year and a half, would give him loans totalling an additional €678,000.

She worked in painted ceramics, watercolor and oils. She was the sister of Homer Watson, the well-known landscape artist, and devoted much of her life to promoting her brother's work, including her role as the curator of the Homer Watson Art Gallery at Doon. Life Phoebe Amelia Watson was born on 1 June 1858 in the village of Doon, now part of the city of Kitchener, Ontario. Her parents, Ransford Watson (1824–1861) and Susannah Mohr, had married on 3 October 1852. They owned a mill. Phoebe Amelia Watson belonged to the Christadelphians. Her brother was Homer Watson (1855–1936), who became a celebrated artist. She left school while she was in her teens to help support her widowed mother and her siblings so her brother could devote himself to his art. It was said that \\"Miss Watson throughout her life has preferred rather than to put forward her own undoubted attainments, to base her chief claim to fame on her relationship with the painter of Doon, who from her childhood days loomed on her horizon a genius.\\" Watson painted china, and also painted landscapes and portraits in watercolor and oil. In 1896, the Women's Art Association of Canada (WAAC) decided to commission a Canadian State Dinner Service to be painted on china by members of the association. The chosen artists included Watson, Lily Osman Adams (1865–1945) and Alice Egan. Watson painted twelve of the soup plates. Among Watson's portraits are six of mayors of Waterloo, Ontario, and two of Queen Victoria. Her work was exhibited by the Ontario Society of Artists and the Women's Art Association of Canada. Watson moved into her brother Homer's house after his wife Roxanna died in 1918. She became a curator of the Homer Watson Art Gallery in Doon, and held this post until her death on 22 October 1947. She never married. She was buried in the Kinzie Cemetery, Kitchener. As of 2004, the Homer Watson house was an art school and a small gallery with four rooms that feature the work of Homer Watson and other artists.

The provision of services to companies affiliated to it (more than 8,000) targets the industrial, social and economic growth of Rio de Janeiro state.  History  FIRJAN was founded in 1975, but its history dates back to earlier decades. In December 1941, the Industrial Unions Federation in Federal District (FSIDF) had to adapt itself to new provisions of the corporate system of Estado Novo regime, and was renamed Industry Federation of Rio de Janeiro (FIRJ), keeping the goal of bringing together unions of the industrial group. At that time, Rio was the capital of Brazil. Over the next thirty years, the name would change three more times: the first change was in 1958 for Industry Federation of the Federal District (FIDF). Then in 1960, when the federal capital was moved to Brasilia and a new federative unit was created, it became Industry Federation of the State of Guanabara (FIEGA). And finally, in 1975 - when the Federation of Industries of the State of Guanabara (FIEGA) merged with the Industry Federation of the State of Rio de Janeiro (FIERJ) - the new entity was renamed Industry Federation of the State of Rio de Janeiro (FIRJAN), a name that is maintained until today. The FIRJAN System only came to be implanted in 1994, gathering FIRJAN, CIRJ and related entities SESI Rio, SENAI Rio and IEL Rio. 600px  Operation  FIRJAN develops actions in the economic/business field and is a source for both matters of the State of Rio de Janeiro and national issues. It develops and promotes regional projects in a joint effort by companies, government bodies and various institutions, for example, the Metropolitan Arc, that will withdraw from the streets about 35 thousand vehicles per day, according to the federation's predictions, avoiding another R$29 bi loss for the city of Rio de Janeiro, as happened in 2013; It also promotes regional representations, through which companies in Rio de Janeiro state act in an integrated manner on several projects with access to relevant information (such as the damage caused by bureaucracy to the profile of broadband in the country) and make their actions known; and Corporate social responsibility, which consists in supporting social politics through partnerships.

Early life and education Paul Whitener was born on September 9, 1911 in Lincoln County, and grew up in Hickory, North Carolina.Fleeting Moments: Paul W. Whitener. N.d. Artist File. Hickory Museum of Art, Hickory, NC. He attended Duke University on a football scholarship. As a journalism student, his artistic endeavors were limited to the occasional cartoon for the university newspaper. When a number of sports- related injuries brought his college career to an end in 1935, Whitener began to more seriously explore his interest in art. After leaving the university, Whitener took a job with a state transportation agency in the mountain resort of Little Switzerland, North Carolina. Here, he met an art student, Mildred “Mickey” McKinney, who became his wife in August 1936. Further encouraged by Mickey, Whitener enrolled in the Ringling Summer School of Art, an art school based in Sarasota, Florida and held annually in Little Switzerland. He studied with artist and Florida instructor Donald Blake, traveling frequently to the mountains of North Carolina to paint. Whitener was also introduced to New York artist Frank Stanley Herring during this time. Herring’s own artistic pursuits had brought him to the mountains of North Carolina, but he agreed to give instruction to Whitener. Hickory Museum of Art In 1940, the Whiteners met New York painter Wilford S. Conrow at an art exhibition in Asheville, North Carolina. For the next fourteen years, Paul Whitener studied with Conrow during the artist’s summer stay in North Carolina. Conrow supported and encouraged Whitener’s long-time interest in the establishment of a museum of art in Hickory, and, during these years of study, plans for the Hickory Museum of Art were drawn. Whitener sought to develop an institution that would promote American art and of that of North Carolina’s Piedmont region. In 1943, Whitener, with the help of his wife and local industrialist A. Alex Shuford, Jr., succeeded in assembling an art association in Hickory. In November, the Association held their first exhibition in a vacant office building, and in February 1944, the Hickory Museum of Art was formally dedicated.Chronology of The Hickory Museum of Art.

In 1955, Whitener was left paralyzed on his right side after surgery could not fully remove a brain tumor. Through declining health, Whitener taught himself to paint again with his left hand.

Whitener died in Hickory in 1959 at the age of 48, leaving his position at the Hickory Museum of Art to his wife, Mickey Whitener Coe.

Held over the weekend of July 11, 2014, in Schaumburg, Illinois, the inaugural convention quickly became infamous for allegations of mismanagement and corruption among organizers, an alleged abrupt demand by the hotel for an upfront payment of cash for use of its facilities, and celebrity guests being forced to drop out of the convention after they were informed by the hotel that they would be responsible for paying for their rooms. A small ball pit placed in one of the halls became a meme after organizers offered attendees, along with raffle and concert tickets, an \\"extra hour\\" in it as reimbursement for a canceled panel. Organizers for DashCon initially stated that they were going to hold a second DashCon in 2015 despite the issues faced by the inaugural edition, but officially announced via a Tumblr post in September 2014 that DashCon LLP was going to be dissolved and all its assets liquidated, meaning that they were not going to hold a second convention. The post also denied claims that a similarly themed convention, Emoti-Con, was a re-branded DashCon.  Concept  DashCon was originally announced in mid-2013 under the name Tumbl-Con USA, as a convention catered to users of the blogging platform Tumblr, and was touted as the \\"largest gathering of Tumblr users to date\\". The convention was to focus on works that have developed significant followings among Tumblr users, such as Doctor Who, Sherlock, Supernatural and the podcast Welcome to Night Vale. The convention raised money through ticket pre-orders, along with a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo. Prior to the start of the convention, the name of the event was changed to DashCon (alluding to the site's dashboard feed) to indicate that it was not officially associated with Tumblr. Convention Overhead view of the Renaissance Schaumburg Convention Center Hotel, where the convention was held The convention was organized by DashCon LLP, a Hudson, Ohio-based limited liability partnership owned by Megan Eli and Roxanne Schwieterman. DashCon was held from July 11 to 13, 2014, at the Renaissance Schaumburg Convention Center Hotel. Among the guests originally scheduled to attend were actor Doug Jones, webcomic artist Noelle Stevenson, and the cast of Welcome to Night Vale. On the evening of July 11 – the first night of DashCon – early reports began to surface from attendees that events occurring at the convention were poorly planned and attended, a vendor had left due to poor sales, and minors had been admitted into 18+ rated panels. The convention itself also began to experience unexpected financial difficulties: a DashCon staff member claimed that the staff of the Renaissance purportedly informed them that they would need to pay $20,000 upfront for the use of the facilities, or shut the convention down. DashCon organizers claimed to have verbally negotiated to pay the venue gradually throughout the convention using ticket sales, rather than issuing an upfront payment despite their contract suggesting otherwise. At 9:00 p.m. CT, as a result of this unexpected development, the DashCon organizers began to publicly solicit donations among a crowd of around 1,000 attendees (itself much lower than the original estimate of 3,000 to 7,000 attendees), and online via PayPal, to cover costs, with a goal of collecting at least $17,000 by 10:00 p.m. to prevent the convention from being shut down. Organizers speculated that the abrupt change in plans was because the hotel's management \\"[did not] like the people at the con\\". Attendees were seen performing a three-fingered salute from The Hunger Games, chanting lines from High School Musical, and singing Queen's \\"We Are the Champions\\" and \\"Do You Hear the People Sing?\\" from Les Misérables. While organizers managed to raise the necessary funds, the incident raised suspicion among attendees over the possibility of the crowdfunding drive being a scam (which included disputes over the authenticity of an image of the bill, printed on hotel stationery, which was released by a staff member), or being further proof of the alleged mismanagement and corruption. Several guests – including Noelle Stevenson (who had to moderate her own panel because the scheduled moderator was absent), the Baker Street Babes (who produced an all-female Sherlock Holmes podcast), and the Welcome to Night Vale cast – were also informed by the hotel that they would be responsible for paying for their own rooms, despite previously being told that the rooms would be paid for by the convention itself. Stevenson would ultimately join the WTNV cast for the night in accommodations obtained via Airbnb. The appearance by the Welcome to Night Vale cast was ultimately canceled; organizers reimbursed those who had purchased tickets for the panel with tickets to a raffle of various autographed collectibles, admission to a concert with the Chicago-based Doctor Who-inspired rock band Time Crash, and an \\"extra hour with the ball pit\\".  Reception and aftermath  The ball pit – roughly the size of a kiddie pool, in an otherwise empty concession hall – and the notion of an \\"extra hour\\" in it, quickly became a meme among attendees and other Tumblr users, inspiring parodies. Users envisioned other large quantities of items that could have been purchased with the $17,000, and a video game developer created Dashcon Simulator 2014, a comedic simulation of the convention's ball pit. Convention guest Mark Oshiro explained that the ball pit was \\"not a point of interest, it wasn't something a single soul talked about, and it was just a quirky thing that existed\\", and that \\"in order to support the idea that DashCon was a full, 100 percent disaster, every single detail was used to paint the con and the people at it as horrific failures of humanity\\". In the aftermath of the convention, a staff member of the hotel stated that the facility did enjoy their presence, while DashCon's staff promised to provide a more thorough explanation of what had occurred. The Baker Street Babes reported that the hotel payment issue was, according to organizers, a mistake. Stevenson, whose hotel payment had not yet been resolved, defended criticism of DashCon by other users, arguing that they were unfamiliar with what typically occurs at a convention in the first place. Near the end and after the convention had finished, suspicion rose that the event was a cash grab by the convention organizers. It was noted that when organizers were asked to pay the remaining $20,000 to continue the convention, it was claimed that only $3,000 had been accrued by then. During the donation drive, third-party sources and testimonies claim that around $750 was collected onsite, with the remainder made in electronic transactions. A leaked payment statement, however, listed $11,750 had been paid in cash, causing observers to accuse convention organizers of pocketing a substantial amount of the donations, though organizers denied this claim. Emoti-Con In September 2014, The Daily Dot published an article where they reported on concerns that DashCon had renamed/rebranded itself Emoti-Con. The writer noted that the two conventions were nearly identical in their themes, that Emoti-Con was to be held in the same venue that the second DashCon was to be hosted at, the Emoti- Con website contained much of the same text as the DashCon website, and that it was being organized by one of the co-creators of DashCon. DashCon later denied that the two cons were the same via a post on their official Tumblr account, where they stated that while Emoti-Con was being organized by two of the three owners of DashCon, the two events are otherwise unrelated to one another. They also stated that Emoti-Con would be \\"functioning under a very different infrastructure than DashCon did, with a more experienced and well- rounded staff\\". Emoti-Con was later canceled, with their official Tumblr account citing \\"personal, financial, and safety\\" issues.

The ballroom and tavern areas were part of the initial structure, with the kitchen and back bar sections being added in 1976. Euclid Beach Park, a well-known amusement park that operated between 1894 and 1969, was located at the north end of E. 156th Street, less than a half mile north of the building. The term \\"Beachland\\" became slang for the North Collinwood neighborhood around the time, and the venue was named as an homage to the era.

Cordsen lives in New York City. Cordsen in Essex, CT studio, 2015  Education  Cyanotype Photogram at Florence Griswold Museum, 2016 She received a BA in the history of art and East Asian Studies from Washington and Lee University (founded 1749) where she was the first woman in the university's history to receive an undergraduate degree. Cordsen has an MPP from Georgetown University and studied Chinese and Japanese Art History at Harvard University and photography at the International Center of Photography. In the late 1980s Kate Cordsen worked for Ford Models. She walked the runway and did print advertisements for many fashion designers including the Japanese avant-garde artists Rei Kawakubo, Issey Miyake and Yohji Yamamoto. Cordsen credits this time as a model as both the beginning of her education in photography and as formative in understanding Japanese aesthetics.  Work  Cyanotype 28\\"X84\\"on paper, 2014, Harvard University Known for large format landscapes, Cordsen produces ethereal and ambiguous images that evoke ideas of fragmented memories and temporality. Her landscapes are, at first glance, simply meditative, but reveal impassioned and dramatic depths upon second and third looks. She often combines 19th century chemical methods with traditional film and digital technologies. Kate Cordsen's landscapes are a hybrid study of both photography and painting. The final result is that her pieces possess a certain aesthetic that seems attainable only through the act of painting. From 2015, Cordsen has worked exclusively in cyanotype and gum bichromate, two of the earliest forms of photography. In a departure from her ethereal, magical realist landscapes, she is creating monumental abstract photograms that invoke the works of early modernists Harry Holtzman, Piet Mondrian and Laszlo Moholy-Nagy. Using primarily found objects, she composes her large-format photogram photographs through a demanding process that requires both physical, painterly dynamism, and chemical precision. Kate Cordsen's work explores the tension between chance, accident, and control.

Career Abbott began his coaching career after graduating from McGill in 1964. He coached briefly for a small college in Alberta before moving to take an assistant coaching position at St. Lawrence. In 1969 Abbott was offered the top job at Rensselaer, taking over from Garry Kearns, and after a poor first season, returned the Engineers to winning ways with 16- and 17-win seasons, making the ECAC tournament in consecutive seasons. Abbott received his big break in 1972 when Jack Kelley stepped away from Boston University to pursue a professional coaching career and Abbott was given the job to replace him. The Terriers were coming off back-to-back National Championships and didn't take much of a step backwards with their new bench boss, finishing the season at a 22-6-1 mark, but after the season the NCAA forced BU to forfeit 11 wins due to ineligible players. While that decision meant little in and of itself as the Terriers had already finished their season, the team and Abbott in particular were placed under heightened scrutiny by the NCAA. Early in the following season, two players (Peter Marzo and Bill Buckton) were ruled to be professional athletes by having accepted money to play amateur hockey, a violation of NCAA regulations. While federal court judge Joseph L. Tauro later reinstated the players, the damage had been done. After a 4-2 start, Abbott was fired by BU and replaced by his assistant, Jack Parker. After the season Abbott returned to his undergraduate alma mater, Alberta, and assumed head coaching duties until he was offered a third NCAA job, this time by St. Lawrence. The Saints had been slipping in the standings and were looking for someone to return them to their earlier glory but bringing Abbott back to Canton didn't work out as expected. In three seasons Abbott posted a record of 28-59-2, finishing well out of the conference playoffs each year. Things began to look up at the beginning of his fourth campaign as the Saints won their first three contests, but everything went south after as they dropped eight straight matches. The final straw was a 12-3 trouncing by Clarkson on December 1 after which Abbott stepped down as head coach. Head coaching record References: ^BU forfeited 11 wins after the 1972-73 season due to an ineligible player. Record without forfeits is 22-6-1 (13-4-1 ECAC). †BU fired Abbott on December 21, 1973. Jack Parker finished the season.

The song is a parody of the 2013 single \\"Blurred Lines\\" by Robin Thicke, featuring Pharrell Williams and T.I. The song spoofs misuse of proper English grammar and usage, reflecting Yankovic's own rigor for proper syntax and semantics. Yankovic chose a topic that would be distinct from those used in many pre-existing parodies, and that would avoid the misogyny issues that had arisen from the source material. \\"Word Crimes\\" received favorable reviews from contemporary music critics, with some describing it as a highlight of Mandatory Fun. The song's music video utilizes kinetic typography, and was compared to the earlier educational Schoolhouse Rock! musical cartoons. The song peaked at number 39 on the Billboard Hot 100, granting Yankovic his fourth Top 40 hit, making him only the third artist in history (alongside Michael Jackson and Madonna) to have a top 40 hit in every decade since the 1980s. Composition alt=Robin Thicke wearing sunglasses and holding a microphone. The subject matter in \\"Word Crimes\\" was an extension of Yankovic's policy of writing \\"left-of-center\\" parodies, especially considering the number of parodies that surface on YouTube. Yankovic had surveyed his online competition and was disappointed that many parodies revolved around rape (due to the original song's controversy). To differentiate his version, he opted to make the parody about grammar; \\"I don't think anybody, to this point, had done a 'Blurred Lines' parody about proper use of grammar,\\" he told NPR. Yankovic has considered himself a \\"grammar nerd\\", having previously posted photos and video clips to social media sites pointing out grammatical errors in everyday signs, and considered \\"Word Crimes\\" his opportunity to put this into song form. He considered the song to be both humorously critical of those that have poor grammar, as well as those that are obsessive about grammar, and compared it to how his previous song \\"Don't Download This Song\\" was double-edged by poking fun at both those who illegally downloaded music and overprotective labels trying to prevent that. \\"Word Crimes\\" mocks online commenters and their neglect of standard English grammar. In the song, Yankovic spoofs those who use numbers in place of letters, which he criticizes as only acceptable if they are children, or Prince (referring to successful Prince songs with numbers in their title, such as \\"I Would Die 4 U\\"). He also lampoons people who use the word literally to describe non-literal situations. The song highlights other common prescriptions: Yankovic mentions the usage of less versus fewer, and the use of \\"to whom\\" as opposed to \\"to who\\". Spelling is also brought up, as he states that there is no \\"x\\" in the word espresso (n.b. expresso). Regarding punctuation, he comments on the use of \\"it's\\" as a possessive instead of the correct \\"its,\\" and the optional use of the Oxford comma. Yankovic also mentions the common confusion between \\"doing good\\", \\"doing good deeds\\", and \\"doing well\\". Also mentioned in the song is the idiom \\"I couldn't care less\\" being commonly corrupted as \\"I could care less\\". Yankovic noted that he deliberately added a split infinitive in the lyrics to see if listeners would notice.Marceau, Aloin (July 16, 2014). \\"'Weird Al Yankovic' Explains the Internet to Fox's Stuart Varney\\". Retrieved on July 25, 2014. The line \\"Try your best to not drool\\" appears at the end of the song.Um, There’s A Mistake In Al Yankovic's Grammar-Themed 'Blurred Lines' Parody. crushable.com. Retrieved on July 20, 2014. Contrary to common misconception, split infinitives are not forbidden by English grammar rules. After \\"Word Crimes\\" was released, Thicke and Pharrell were sued by the estate of Marvin Gaye for plagiarizing too much of Gaye's music from \\"Got to Give It Up\\" within \\"Blurred Lines\\". The estate won their case, which besides monetary damages, required that Gaye be credited on \\"Blurred Lines\\". As a result, Yankovic also had to add Gaye's credit to \\"Word Crimes\\". However, according to Yankovic, he has not had to pay any additional royalties to Gaye's estate from this, believing that whatever he would have had to pay was already covered in the royalty split he had given to Thicke and Pharrell for his parody. Music video The video incorporates a re-creation of the Merriam-Webster logo. The song's music video, a lyric video, was released on the same day of the album's release, the second in a series of eight consecutive video releases. The video is a kinetic typography video created by Jarrett Heather, which plays on the song's theme of proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation. MTV News considered it a spoof on the increasing popularity of lyric videos, calling it \\"a pretty incredible piece of animation\\". Heather had previously gained fame in producing a similar typography video for Jonathan Coulton's song \\"Shop Vac\\". The \\"Shop Vac\\" video, Heather's first major public production, had caught Yankovic's attention, and the musician sent Heather an email about creating a similar video for \\"Word Crimes\\" around November 2013. The video started production in January 2014 after Yankovic sent the final lyrics to Heather, and took about 500 hours of work in Heather's off-hours to assemble using the Adobe Systems suite of products. Heather and Yankovic coordinated nearly daily in the early stages of the video, with Heather presenting initial sketches and storyboards for the artist's approval. Initial designs of the video were based on the \\"Blurred Lines\\" video, using the color scheme and font style, and expanding it to a full color bible to provide contrast during the video. Most of the drawn animations in the video were created by Heather; the child's drawing at the lyric \\"unless you're seven\\" was done by Heather's son, Ethan. The video was completed by April 1. The video spoofs a number of facets of the original \\"Blurred Lines\\" video, such as the large hashtags in the original that appear seemingly at random, dancing letters and punctuation symbols on an off-white background, and ends with the phrase \\"'Weird Al' Yankovic has a big dictionary\\" spelled in balloon letters. The video also is filled with Easter eggs that appear quickly onscreen during lyrics. The graphic for the title phrase is modeled after the Merriam-Webster dictionary logo.Hadsall, Joe. All the hidden secrets in \\"Weird Al's\\" \\"Word Crimes\\" video. joplinglobe.com. Retrieved on July 20, 2014. During the line \\"You're a lost cause,\\" a poster for ABC's Lost appears, with the sentence \\"Learn your ABC's, doofus\\" using the ABC logo. The number 27, which frequently appears in previous works by Yankovic, appears throughout the video. An illustration on a college notebook cover includes Pac-Man and the character Trogdor the Burninator from the Homestar Runner animated web series. The graphic for the lyric \\"irony is not coincidence(meaning there is not a real situation at ironic term)\\" pokes fun at Alanis Morissette's use of the word \\"ironic\\", noting that \\"rain on [one's] wedding day\\" is merely coincidence, whereas a better example of irony would be a fire truck being destroyed by fire. The video also includes cameos by Doge and the Microsoft Office Assistant \\"Clippit\\" (also known as \\"Clippy\\"), and references to the Sacramento-based offices of the California Department of Food and Agriculture where Heather is employed. Reception Critically, The A.V. Club called the song \\"a modern-day 'Conjunction Junction'\\", writing: \\"The song combines cheeky grammar lessons with a lamentation for society's diminished writing skills.\\" CNN made a similar comparison, believing the song \\"could follow in the grand tradition of Schoolhouse Rock!\\". Rolling Stone wrote that \\"The schoolhouse R&B; of 'Word Crimes' is clever enough to win over the harshest critics of Robin Thicke's 'Blurred Lines.'\\" ABC News characterized the parody as \\"spot-on\\". Billboard called the song the album's best, writing that \\"[a] more satirical, cynical parodist could have taken this in a million super-searing directions, but Al isn't interested in commenting on Thicke's alleged misogyny.\\" The work has received some negative attention from linguists and educators, who view the prescriptivism celebrated in the song as scientifically ill-informed, arbitrary, and encouraging of unnecessary and damaging social distinctions. Mignon Fogarty of the podcast \\"Grammar Girl's Quick and Dirty Tips for Better Writing\\" considered that the video, which has a high likelihood of being used in educational settings, speaks down to those with poor grammar, criticizing \\"the call to feel superior and to put other people down for writing errors\\". Shortly after the song was released, Yankovic stated that he had been unaware that the word spastic used in the song is \\"considered a highly offensive slur by some people\\", particularly in the United Kingdom, and apologized for its presence in his lyrics. Commercial performance \\"Word Crimes\\" debuted at number 39 on the Billboard Hot 100 for the week ending August 2, 2014, making it Yankovic's fourth Top 40 hit (following \\"Eat It\\" in 1984, \\"Smells Like Nirvana\\" in 1992, and \\"White & Nerdy\\" in 2006, which peaked at numbers 12, 35, and 9, respectively). It made him only the third artist in popular music history to have at least one Top 40 single in every decade since the 1980s, alongside previous parody targets Madonna and Michael Jackson. Also that same week, the track debuted on the top on the Comedy Digital Songs chart.

Digelius Music is a record shop and internet retailer located in Viiskulma, Helsinki, Finland. It has been functioning in more or less the same place since 1971. Officially its business is \\"retail of music and video recordings.\\" There are several record shops in the same or neighbouring blocks.  History of the record store  Digelius Music had its beginnings in 1971. At that time, the future CEO of the record store, Emu Lehtinen was working in another record shop in Helsinki, Tunnelin levy. Lehtinen together with record importer Pertti Lehto and co-employee Tiina Ruolanne got the idea of founding their own record store. Digelius Electronics Finland, known for its owner, inventor Erkki Kurenniemi, invested in some of the shares as well. Kurenniemi had founded Digelius Electronics Finland together with Peter Frisk, with the aim of producing electronic instruments. They were known e.g. for the Dimi synthesizer. Digelius Music had a successful start, but then Tiina Ruolanto moved to Sweden, and Digelius Electronics Finland went bankrupt. Now Juhani \\"Juntsa\\" Aalto came to the rescue and bought have of the shares of the record store. The shop was now owned by Lehtinen, Aalto, and three minor shareholders. Aalto's shares were later inherited by his sister. Now the name Digelius only survives in the name of this record shop. The word Digelius is an amalgam of the words digital and Sibelius. Digelius Music was originally located on a street called Laivurinrinne, at the Viiskulma corner, in the same space which is now occupied by the record store Eronen. One morning in the 1990s, Lehtinen noticed that the sports store at the corner of Laivurinrinne and Fredrikinkatu had disappeared. Having thought about this for one night, he went into a bank and took a sizable loan. Since then Digelius Music has existed at this corner, the heart of the Viiskulma corner.  Digelius Music today  The house on the corner of Fredrikinkatu and Laivurinrinne, entrance to Digelius Music in the foreground. It has been said that Digelius is one of the best known record stores in Finland. In the early days, all kinds of popular music was sold in the store, but since the 1980s, it has concentrated in jazz, jazz fusion, folk music and world music. It is also said that Digelius Music is an information center for jazz and world music, an in addition to this, it is occasionally a concert space and even a tourist attraction. One person writes about the store in the internet with the following words: This writer tested the expertise of the store by asking about Azerbaidjani jazz. Soon the bearded man working in the store brought to him a pile of records to listen to. And he even seemed to enjoy this \\"inquiry that was goddam difficult.” In addition to selling records, live jazz can be heard in Digelius Music on occasion. These are usually record launch events. For example, in 2014, the pianist Iiro Rantala has had such a concert at Digelius. In 2012 Digelius Music was awarded the Varjo-Yrjö ('Shadow Yrjö') award. In the 1980s, Digelius also published records, at least those of Hasse Walli's Afro-Line.  Well known employees  The best known person working in Digelius was Ilkka \\"Emu\\" Lehtinen, who is also the CEO of the record shop. In 2011, the Finnish Jazz Musicians' Association gave him the award \\"Jazz Digger of the Year\\". This award is given to a jazz listener, who \\"shows genuine and lasting interest in jazz music and represents a decent and open-minded community spirit\\". In addition, it was said that Lehtinen has acted as an encompassing and encouraging flag bearer for jazz music and as a person who brings musicians and their audiences together. The nickname \\"Emu\\" comes from Lehtinen's hobby, birdwatching. Another important employee in the past was Phillip Page, an ex-patriate Texan, who worked at Digelius Music from 1987 on. He concentrated in providing the store with encompassing selections in world music, while Lehtinen's turf was jazz. In the early 1990s Page began to work as manager for various Finnish folk and world music acts, such as the JPP, Maria Kalaniemi and Värttinä. Nowadays he works as the manager for Kimmo Pohjonen.

After graduating, he received a recommendation from Nikolai Gogol that enabled him to attend the Imperial Academy of Arts in St.Petersburg from 1840 to 1846, where he studied under Karl Bryullov. In 1841 Bryullov, together with Vasily Zhukovsky, succeeded in obtaining Gorbunov's freedom. Upon his graduation from the Academy in 1846, he was granted the rights of a \\"неклассного художника\\" (Free Artist), which enabled him to set up his own studio. In 1851, his portrait of Alexei Markov earned him the title of Academician. He would eventually produce portraits of virtually every well- known literary figure in Russia (including a series of lithograph portraits commissioned by Alexander Herzen), as well as Tsars Alexander II and Alexander III. From 1851 to 1888 he was a teacher at the Smolny Institute. He later painted icons and frescoes at the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour and several other churches in St.Petersburg.

In 1540 the prebends and minster were suppressed but an act of Parliament in 1543 re-established the college and church collegiate of Southwell. Under an Act of King Edward VI, the prebendaries were given pensions and their estates sold. The minster continued as the parish church on the petitions of the parishioners. By an Act of Philip and Mary in 1557, the minster and its prebends were restored.Notts Villages. W. E Doubleday, as published in The Nottinghamshire Guardian.

The changes could have been made by anyone using a computer on the U.S. Capitol complex's computer network, including both staff of U.S. elected representatives and senators as well as visitors such as journalists, constituents, tourists, and lobbyists. Previous to this, the best information about what congressional staff were editing was found in the articles \\"United States Congressional staff edits to Wikipedia\\" and \\"Wikipedia:Congressional staffer edits\\", which are manually updated. CongressEdits has been called a watchdog by NBC News. Twitter suspended the account in October 2018.  History  CongressEdits was written by and was run by Ed Summers, who was inspired by a friend's tweet about Parliament WikiEdits, which performs the same function for the staffers of Parliament of the United Kingdom. It has since been credited for inspiring additional bots for Australia, Canada, South Africa, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Israel, Chile, Italy and Greece. Summers wrote that his \\"hope for @congressedits wasn't to expose inanity, or belittle our elected officials.\\" He emphasized that he did not see edits to such articles as Step Up 3D, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, or Horse head mask as \\"something to make fun of,\\" and points to \\"substantial edits like changing a Congressperson's party affiliation from Democrat to Independent.\\" Ultimately, he wanted to see Congressional staffers log into Wikipedia, identifying themselves to use their knowledge of the issues and history to help make Wikipedia better. Tweets since November 6, 2017 included screenshots of the specific changes made to the article.  Source code  The code for the bot itself is open-source software, and can be configured to watch for anonymous edits from any IP ranges or individual IP addresses. Controversy On July 25, 2014, Wikipedia's co-founder Jimmy Wales told the BBC that the @congressedits Twitter feed may have been counterproductive. Referring to a Wikipedia administrator's 10-day editing block, imposed on July 24 against a shared address within the range assigned to the U.S House of Representatives, for disruptive editing, Wales said, \\"There is a belief from some of the [Wikipedia] community that it only provoked someone—some prankster there in the office—to have an audience now for the pranks, and actually encouraged them rather than discouraged them.\\" CongressEdits was credited with bringing to light edits to Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture by a United States Senate shared address on December 9 and 10, 2014, which removed the phrase \\"(a euphemism for torture)\\", with revision notes of \\"removing bias\\"; however, these edits were soon reverted. In 2017, the bot revealed many instances of disruptive edits by apparent Congressional interns, ranging from commentary on pop culture to inserting unsourced and controversial information about living people to direct communication with followers of the account. In September and early October 2018, during the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court appointment hearings, Republican senators were doxxed by Congressional IP editors who inserted home addresses and phone numbers into Wikipedia articles; the private information was tweeted to the bot's approximately 65,000 followers before it was scrubbed from the articles. Following additional doxxing by Congressional IP editors, Twitter suspended the account. A Democratic staffer named Jackson Cosko was arrested and eventually convicted for the doxxing.

In 2009 it was estimated that members of the Gülen movement ran schools that serve more than 2 million students, many with full scholarships.Behind Turkey's Witch Hunt Estimates of the number of schools and educational institutions varied widely, with about 300 schools in Turkey and over 1,000 schools worldwide.Turkish Islamic preacher - threat or benefactor? Prior to the 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt, there were many Gülen schools in Turkey. The schools were all subsequently banned by law, as were other Gülen schools in countries with large Turkish populations. Despite Turkey's official request, The United States has not extradited Gülen. So-called \\"Gülen\\" schools in the United States, in that they provide solely secular education to children mostly from low-income households, receive federal financial support.https://www.theeagle.com/news/national/trump-explored-cutting-grants- for-schools-tied-to-erdogan- foe/article_f0b68570-dae2-5619-b09d-9f0ce0a32d4d.html Curriculum The curricula of the schools vary from country to country. They generally follow a secular mixture of Turkish and local curricula. =Language instruction= Gülen schools promote education in the local languages where they are located, including the controversial use of Kurdish in Turkey. In many countries instruction is in English. However, all of the schools outside of Turkey offer Turkish as either a mandatory or elective foreign language. =Science and mathematics= Gülen schools heavily emphasize instruction in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). =Islamic component= Gülen schools are not for Muslims alone, and in Turkey \\"the general curriculum for the network's schools prescribes one hour of religious instruction per week, while in many countries the schools do not offer any religious instruction at all. With the exception of a few Imam-Hatip schools abroad, these institutions can thus hardly be considered Islamic schools in the strict sense.\\" The greatest majority of the teachers are drawn from members of the Gülen network, who reportedly encourage students in the direction of greater piety. A 2008 article in the New York Times said that in Pakistan \\"they encourage Islam in their dormitories, where teachers set examples in lifestyle and prayer\\", and described the Turkish schools as offering a gentler approach to Islam that could help reduce the influence of extremism. School organization Schools established by the Gülen movement are usually private or semi-private schools founded by the members of the movement who are inspired by the Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen. In addition there are many American charter schools founded or managed by members of Gülen movement. =Private schools= In 2009, it was estimated that members of the Gülen movement run schools that serve more than 2 million students. Estimates of the number of schools and educational institutions vary widely, from about 300 schools in Turkey to over 1,000 schools worldwide. There are Gülen schools in countries with large Turkish populations, such as the United States, Germany, and Canada. Gülen schools in non-Turkish Muslim countries provide families an alternative to madrasa education. Evaluations of private Gülen Movement schools Gülen Movement Schools have received both praise and criticism. The achievements of these schools are often highlighted in publications or websites managed by the Gülen movement. For example, Somali Higher Education and Culture Minister Duale Mohamed Adem praised the contributions of the schools to the Somali people. Foluso Oluwole Adeshida, Nigeria’s deputy ambassador to Ankara, praised the 16 schools in his country. Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif praised the 23 PakTurk International Schools and Colleges in his country. The 17 Gulen-inspired schools in Australia rank highly in comparisons to other schools in terms of academic results and retention rates. Two American professors at the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia and Temple University wrote that \\"these schools have consistently promoted good learning and citizenship, and the Hizmet movement is to date an evidently admirable civil society organization to build bridges between religious communities and to provide direct service on behalf of the common good\\". Participants in the movement have also founded private universities. Other commentators disagree with these assessments and are suspicious of the anti-integrative potential of Gulen-movement schools. In 2008, the Dutch government investigated the movement's activities in the Netherlands. Following the investigation, the Dutch government, concluding that the Gülen schools did indeed promote \\"anti-integrative behavior,\\" reduced their public funding. This decision was overturned in 2010 and funding was restored after an investigation by the Dutch intelligence organization AIVD and an assigned academician Martin van Bruinessen which resulted in findings that Gulen movement schools did not represent a threat to Dutch society. In April 2009, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty published a piece about the Gülen schools in Central Asia stating the \\"Turkish educational institutions have come under increasing scrutiny ... Governments as well as many scholars and journalists suspect that the schools have more than just education on their agendas ...\\" The article quoted Hakan Yavuz, a Turkish professor of political science at the University of Utah, as calling the Gülen movement: In April 2010, Trend News Agency published a piece about the Gülen schools in Georgia. Excerpt: \\"The Georgian Labor Party protested the opening of Turkish schools in Georgia. The party's Political Secretary Giorgi Gugava called the mass opening of Turkish schools in Georgia, \\"the dominance of Turkey in the Georgian educational system,\\" and noted that these schools aim to spread Turkish culture and fundamentalist religious ideas…Gugava said the process is headed by Turkish religious leader Fetullah Gülen, whose activities are banned in his motherland…\\" In other sources, the schools in Central Asia have been described as supporting a philosophy based on Turkish nationalism rather than on Islam. =American charter schools founded and/or managed by Hizmet members= Gulen followers have been active in founding approximately 120 charter schools in 25 states. Although there is no formal networking of all the schools, collectively they form one of the largest collections of charter schools in America.\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/07/education/07charter.html Evaluations =Academic achievement= Many charter schools founded or managed by members of the Gulen movement emphasize instruction in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The achievements of students in these fields are often highlighted on school websites. The Kenilworth Science and Technology Charter School in East Baton Rouge Parish Louisiana, has posted impressive gains in academic performance which resulted in a renewal of its charter.http://www.kenilworthst.org/press/10-31-2013-Kenilworth%20earns%20double- digit%20growth%20in%20state%20scoring.pdf Member schools of the Concept Schools network of charter schools have won numerous designations such as Blue Ribbon School designations, mention in U.S. News & World Report Best High Schools, Ohio State Department of Education designations as \\"Excellent\\" and \\"Schools of Progress.\\" Students from Concept Schools have won numerous awards and honors such as acceptance at the Intel International Science Fair and the International Environmental Project Olympiad in Azerbaijan. Teams from Concept Schools have won awards in Chess tournaments and regional Robotics competitions.http://www.conceptschools.info/the-success/#.U_5xX_ldXDY In the 2012=2014 the Beehive Science and Technology Academy, a 6-12 school, student achievement according to the Utah State Report Card was above the state average in the 2012-2013 school year and achieved a \\"B\\" rating,http://www.beehiveacademy.org/v2/attachments/article/77/UCAS%202012-2013%20report.pdfhttp://www.beehiveacademy.org/v2/attachments/article/77/BSTA- Grading%20Schools%20Report%202013.pdf and scored above the Utah mean in the 8th grade writing assessmenthttp://www.beehiveacademy.org/v2/attachments/article/77/BSTA%20DWA%20School%20summary%202013.pdf =Criticisms of management= There are many allegations about money- laundering, kickbacks, investigations, and raids concerning charter schools founded or operated by Gulen followers. The FBI has investigated Concept Schools, which operate 16 Horizon Science Academies across Ohio, on the suspicion that they illegally used taxpayer money to pay immigration and legal fees for people they never even employed, an Ohio ABC affiliate discovered. The FBI's suspicion was confirmed by state auditors. Concept Schools repaid the fees for their Cleveland and Toledo schools shortly before the ABC story broke, but it's unclear whether they have repaid—or can repay—the fees for their other schools.Supra note, Berlinski 2012 In December 2013, the FBI raided another Gülen-linked charter school, Kenilworth Science and Technology Charter School, located in Louisiana. The investigation, initially for tax- related purposes, led to the discovery of a business link between the school and Harmony Public Schools, another Gülen-linked charter school district based in Texas that makes up the state's largest charter operator. Two schools, located in Texas, have been accused of sending school funds—which are supplied by the government—to Gülen-inspired organizations. Last year, The New York Times reported that the some schools were funneling some $50 million in public funds to a network of Turkish construction companies, among them the Gülen- related Atlas Texas Construction and Trading. The schools had hired Atlas to do construction, the paper said, though other bidders claimed in lawsuits that they had submitted more economical bids. Folwell Dunbar, an official at the Louisiana Department of Education, has accused Atlas's vice president, Inci Akpinar, of offering him a $25,000 bribe to keep mum about troubling conditions at the Abramson Science and Technology School in New Orleans. Dunbar sent a memo to department colleagues, the Times-Picayune reported, noting that \\"Akpinar flattered him with 'a number of compliments' before getting to the point: 'I have twenty-five thousand dollars to fix this problem: twenty thousand for you and five for me.' \\" Abramson is operated by the Pelican Foundation, which is linked to the Gülen-inspired Cosmos Foundation in Texas—which runs the two Texas schools. One of the Cosmos Foundation's school systems, Harmony Public Schools, was subject to a compliance review by the United States Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights, examining whether the system was compliant with Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act (prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (prohibiting discrimination on the basis of disability in education programs operated by recipients of federal financial assistance), and Title II of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act (prohibiting discrimination on the basis of disability by public entities). The OCR's investigation found that although HPS's admissions policies, procedures, and information provided to prospective students and their parents were prima facie non-discriminatory, the school systems' enrolments of disabled students and English-language learners were significantly lower than for public school districts covering the same geographical areas. In late 2014 the investigation was closed after HPS submitted proposals to resolve the issues identified by the OCR. Utah's Beehive Science and Technology Academy was $337,000 in debt, according to a financial probe by the Utah Schools Charter Board. The Deseret News tried to figure out where all this taxpayer money had gone. \\"In a time of teacher layoffs, Beehive has recruited a high percentage of teachers from overseas, mainly Turkey,\\" the newspaper reported. \\"Many of these teachers had little or no teaching experience before they came to the United States. Some of them are still not certified to teach in Utah. The school spent more than $53,000 on immigration fees for foreigners in five years. During the same time, administrators spent less than $100,000 on textbooks, according to state records.\\" Reports have also claimed that the school board was almost entirely Turkish. A reporter for the magazine In These Times noted in 2010 that the Chicago Math and Science Academy obscured its relationship to Gülen. Furthermore, the school board was strikingly similar to Beehive's: In August 2016 former head of the American Federation of Teachers' Strategic Campaign Department Gene Bruskin wrote an article for AlterNet arguing that the Gülen movement's charter school network \\"severely tested\\" the American model of a secular state, due to what he sees as the missionary nature of the Gülen movement and the way the Gülen schools often played down their links to the movement. He also asserted that publicly available teacher rosters and labour condition applications for the Turkish teachers frequently employed in the Gülen schools illustrated that American teachers employed by the schools were often paid less than their Turkish counterparts. Activities =Turkish Language Olympiads= The Gülen movement runs the International Turkish Language Olympiads (), an annual competition in the Turkish language. Students who have learned Turkish from over a hundred countries compete in different titles such as: grammar, oral skills, writing essays, reciting poems, singing songs, theatre, general culture etc. References  External links  * Unofficial Gulen Schools webpage Category:Islam in Turkey fr:Fethullah_Gülen#Éducation ","title":"Gülen movement schools"},{"id":"43309905","text":"Debarun Pal (born 14 February 1987) is an Indian Film Director and Film Editor.

The company was formed in 1901 when the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad combined the Larchmont Horse Railway Company with the Port Chester Street Railroad Company. The Larchmont Horse Railway Company was founded in 1888 by the Larchmont Manor Company to construct a line from the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad Larchmont train station to its development 1.2 miles from town. The line was rebuilt for electric operation and extended to Harrison in 1901. The Port Chester Street Railroad opened in 1898 serving Port Chester, New York. The trolley line was soon extended west through Rye to Harrison in 1901. The two companies were merged that summer to form the New York and Stamford Railway. Trackage rights over the Westchester Electric Railroad were obtained for access to New Rochelle. In 1905, the NY&S; was leased to NYNH&H; subsidiary Consolidated Railway (of Connecticut), which in turn controlled the Greenwich Tramway Company via stock transfer effective December 29, 1904, and outright purchase of property and franchises on September 19, 1905. The Greenwich Tramway Through operations form New Rochelle to Stamford commenced soon after. The Consolidated Railway was leased by the Connecticut Company on May 31, 1907. In the 1920s, management of the streetcar line was transferred to the New York, Westchester and Boston Railway, another subsidiary of the New Haven. Routes were realigned to provide feeder service to NYW&B; stations. The County Transportation Company was formed as a subsidiary of NY&S; in 1925 to replace some streetcar lines with bus operation. All streetcar lines had been replaced with buses by the end of 1927. In 1928, the NYW&B; acquired control of Soundview Transportation Company, which served bus routes in White Plains. County Transportation Company operated Soundview's routes under agreement, and continued to do so until it was sold off by the New Haven in 1948. Sometime after the NYW&B; declared bankruptcy, control of the New York and Stamford and County Transportation was returned to the New Haven. County Transportation Company was sold off to private interests in 1957, and its operations were absorbed by Westchester County's Bee-Line Bus System in 1978.

The 2007 Rother District Council election took place on 3 May 2007 to elect members of Rother District Council in East Sussex, England. The whole council was up for election and the Conservative party stayed in overall control of the council. Background At the last election in 2003 the Conservatives retained control of the council with 25 councillors, while the Liberal Democrats had 8, Labour had 3 and there were 2 independents. However, by the time of the 2007 election the Liberal Democrat group had been reduced to 6 councillors, while 2 of the 3 Labour councillors, Helen and Keith Bridger, had left the Labour party in December 2006 and stood at the election as independents. Meanwhile, the Conservative leader of the council Graham Gubby stood down at the election. Election result The Conservatives increased their majority on the council after making a net gain of 2 seats to have 28 of the 38 councillors. The Conservatives narrowly defeated Liberal Democrat councillor John Kemp in Crowhurst by 2 votes after 3 recounts, while also taking out the only Labour councillor Samuel Souster in Rye. This meant Rother was one of more than 10 councils in which Labour lost their last presence on the council in the 2007 local elections. The Liberal Democrats also gained 2 seats to have 8 councillors, after defeating Conservative councillors in Bexhill St Michael's and Battle Town ward. Meanwhile, the independents were reduced from 5 to 2 councillors, with Keith and Helen Bridger being defeated in Bexhill Sidley, while Eric Armstrong lost in Bexhill Old Town. Following the election Conservative Carl Maynard became the new leader of the council.

The lower reservoir was formed with the creation of the Xilongchi Lower Dam. The Xilongchi Upper Reservoir is located high atop a mountain above the northeast side of the lower reservoir. Both reservoirs are located between the confluence of the Hutuo and Qingshui Rivers.

The first phase is scheduled to open in 2021. The tramway will start in Tarup in the north-western part of Odense, travel via the central train station, University of Southern Denmark, and the new hospital reaching its final destination in Hjallese in the southernmost part of town. The first line will consist of of tracks and will have 26 stations. Expected number of passengers is 34,000 daily. The total budget is 3.3 billion Danish krone (2017 numbers). The tramway is financed by the Odense Municipality, the Danish State, and the Region of Southern Denmark. The planned second line consists of of tracks with a budget of 1.9 billion Danish krone. The City Council has decided to work towards establishing a second line. However, there is no construction regulation or co-financing from the Danish state at the moment (August 2018).  The political process  The tramway in Odense was suggested for the first time in 2008 by the former and late mayor Jan Boye. Since then Odense Municipality and the Region of Southern Denmark have been working on the project, which was unanimously backed up by the city council. A formal agreement between the State, the Region of Southern Denmark and Odense Municipality dated 23 June 2014, constituted the official declaration of financial support to the tramway project by the State and the Region. On 5 February 2015, the construction regulation \\"Law on Odense Letbane\\" was approved by the Danish parliament, Folketinget, after which it was possible to form a construction company Odense Letbane P/S to implement the project. Planning In August 2012, the competition for the design and visualization consultancy for the Odense Tramway was won by a team consisting of Niras, PLH Architects, Atelier Villes & Paysages and MBD Design. The team will create a design coherence of the tramway line's first stage of and be responsible for its integration of the light rail in the existing urban environment. In March 2015, Parsons Brinckerhoff won the contract for project management, and strategic and economic advice. COWI was selected as technical advisor.  Construction  All utilities (pipes, cables i.e.) were moved before the actual construction work commenced. These works lasted from April 2015 until December 2017. To make space for the tramway, it is necessary to relocate the roads, bike lanes, and pavements. The tramway needs eight meters width for the tramway tracks. The work commenced in August 2017 and construction of new roads, bike lanes, and pavements continues until spring 2019. This work is carried out by the three Danish contractors Arkil, M.J. Eriksson, and Barslund. The next phase is the track work where the contractors establish the tracks with foundations, drainage, and cables. The Spanish company COMSA is the contractor for this part of the project, collaborating with their sub- contractors Munck (Denmark), EFACEC (Portugal) and IDOM (Spain). Last part of the project is the test and trial run of the tramway. This will be carried out during 2019 and 2020 by the assigned operator which is also in charge of maintenance. The contract for operation and maintenance is expected to be closed by the end of 2018.Anker Boye fræsede den første asfalt for Odense Letbane The Swiss-German tram company Stadler Pankow delivers 16 trams of the model Variobahn for the Odense Tramway project.STADLER SECURES CONTRACT IN DENMARK - ODENSE LETBANE ORDERS 16 TRAMS  Operation  According to the current schedule, the tram will run daily from 05:00 until 24:00 on weekdays and until 01:00 during weekends. During working hours, the tram will run every 7.5 minutes and during evening it will run every 15 minutes. Runtime from the two terminals will be 42 minutes. The first tram was delivered in February 2020 and the line is due to open in Autumn 2021. Criticism There has been some criticism about the project, due to high costsDyrere end forventet pris på letbane lander i den tunge ende.

It would open up some training programs to teachers pursuing their master's degrees, not just teachers who had already earned one. It was introduced and passed in the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background \\"STEM\\" is an acronym referring to the academic disciplines of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42642.pdf The term is typically used in the US when addressing education policy and curriculum choices in schools from k-12 through college to improve competitiveness in technology development. It has implications for workforce development, national security concerns and immigration policy. In the United States, the acronym began to be used in education and immigration debates in initiatives to begin to address the perceived lack of qualified candidates for high-tech jobs. It also addresses concern that the subjects are often taught in isolation, instead of as an integrated curriculum. Maintaining a citizenry that is well versed in the STEM fields is a key portion of the public education agenda of the United States. Provisions of the bill There are three major components of the bill. First, the bill would expand the definition of \\"STEM education\\" to include education in the field of computer science. This definition is used by NASA, the National Science Foundation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the United States Department of Energy in their programs. This would \\"ensure federal grants and programs related to STEM education include computer science education.\\" Second, the bill would confirm the importance of STEM education outside of school. A final provision of the bill would make \\"classroom teachers with bachelor’s degrees in STEM fields who are pursuing master’s degrees eligible for NSF-administered Master Teaching Fellowships in exchange for a four-year commitment to teach in high-need school districts.\\" Procedural history The STEM Education Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on July 8, 2014 by Rep. Lamar Smith (R, TX-21). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology. On July 14, 2014, the House voted to pass the bill in a voice vote. Debate and discussion The IEEE-USA supported the bill, with President Gary Blank saying that \\"IEEE-USA strongly supports federal, state and local efforts to improve K-12 science, technology, engineering and math education, particularly programs that increase student interest and engagement in engineering and computer science.\\" Rep. Elizabeth Esty (D-CT), who co-sponsored the bill, said that \\"STEM education is critical to preparing our students for high-demand careers in engineering, manufacturing, and information technology.\\" According to Esty, she frequently hears from \\"manufactures and small business owners that it's increasingly difficult to find workers with the right skill sets to fill the jobs in demand.\\" Rep. Smith, who introduced the bill, said that \\"we have to capture and hold the desire of our nation's youth to study science and engineering so they will want to pursue these careers. A health and viable STEM workforce, literate in all STEM subjects including computer science, is critical to American industries. We must work to ensure that students continue to go into these fields so that their ideas can lead to a more innovative and prosperous America.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *STEM fields References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 5031 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 5031 *GovTrack.us H.R. 5031 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 5031 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 5031 Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress Category:Education policy in the United States Category:Science education in the United States ","title":"STEM Education Act of 2014"},{"id":"43310212","text":"Duqmaq (, also spelled Dukmak or Doqmaq) is a Syrian village located in the Ziyarah Subdistrict of the al-Suqaylabiyah District in Hama Governorate.

Poppe designed the Sunbeam S7 and S8 motorcycles based on the BMW R75 designs that were acquired by BSA (together with the full rights to the Sunbeam brand) at the end of World War II. Built in Redditch, the engine layout was an unusual in-line 500 cc twin with a shaft drive to the rear wheel. Motorcars At Gordon, Poppe designed a three-wheeled two-seater with a single front wheel. The single-cylinder, 197 cc, Villiers engine was mounted next to the driver (RHD), outside of the body with an external chain- drive to one rear wheel. Access to the interior was via a single door.

The series follows the lives of two men from their twenties to thirties who live in a flat in Croydon, London. Mark Corrigan (Mitchell), who has steady employment for most of the series, and his lodger, Jeremy \\"Jez\\" Usbourne (Webb), an unemployed would-be musician, are the main characters of the show. It was shown on Channel 4 from 2003 to 2015. Major characters Characters appear in all series unless otherwise specified. =Mark Corrigan= Mark Corrigan (portrayed by David Mitchell) is the frugal, introverted owner of the flat (in Apollo House) which he shares with Jeremy. Mark is responsible and intelligent but also socially awkward and despondent. He had a miserable upbringing, and is terrified of his father, who is angry and hostile. He is a graduate in Business Studies from the fictional Dartmouth University, where he met Jeremy. He passed 7 GCSEs, and he has a love of history, especially ancient history—which he originally wanted to study at university, before being pressured by his parents into reading business studies instead. He often makes references to history - including Nazi Germany and The Second World War - in relation to events that happen in his day-to-day life. Mark is aware of Jeremy's intellectual inferiority, but often looks to him for social guidance. He is plagued by paranoia as to how others perceive him, and by doubts over whether his actions are normal. He often simply endures activities that others around him enjoy. For the first five series, he is a loan manager at JLB Credit. After JLB closes, Mark works variously as a waiter at a Mexican restaurant, bathroom equipment salesman, and finally again as a loan manager at a bank (but is sacked in the series finale). Mark's infatuation with Sophie and his relationship with her (which is his first) is a major storyline of the first four series. Following their disastrous wedding and separation immediately afterwards, he pursues a series of other women during series 5, wondering whether each could be \\"the one\\". After a one-night stand with Sophie following their breakup, she becomes pregnant and later gives birth to Mark's son. Mark's only other relationship is with Dobby, whom he meets at JLB shortly after splitting from Sophie. Like with Sophie, Mark gradually succeeds in getting closer to Dobby and ultimately entering a relationship with her, but Dobby leaves him at the end of series 8 for a job in New York. She returns in series 9 with an American boyfriend, a new look and a more upbeat attitude, and Mark becomes less attracted to her as a result. In the final series - 9 - he has a fling with April, whom he knew briefly years earlier, whom is now unhappily married to a middle-aged man, Angus. Mark tries to poach her, but fails in the show's finale when he allows Jeremy and Super Hans to kidnap Angus and hold him captive in their flat, which she discovers. =Jeremy Usbourne= Jeremy 'Jez' Usbourne (portrayed by Robert Webb) is a \\"work-shy freeloader\\" who lives in the spare room of Mark's flat. He is cowardly, childish, selfish and arrogant, but considers himself to be immensely talented and attractive. He is quite extroverted, but can sometimes come across as vindictive and cold. Jez displays a readiness to engage in actions that are detrimental to his friends for his own gain, including once poisoning Mark to prevent him from appearing during a party. Jez attended Dartmouth with Mark and graduated with a degree in nursing. Jez was a nurse for a while, but quit because he was 'disgusted at having to help people'. He also receives financial support from his mother, despite maintaining an estranged relationship with her. For most of the series, he pursues a musical career with his friend Super Hans, in a band with no consistent name, despite having little musical talent or skill. In later series he claims to become a \\"life coach\\", despite having no ability to do that either. As well as being lazy, Jez is financially reckless, he never opens his bank statements, and has apparently spent a 'nest-egg' given to him by his mother. He is unaware of how bank loans work, he expresses irritation at the effort taken to travel to the job centre once a week to claim unemployment benefit, and despite Mark's protestations, bizarrely claims that inheriting £20,000 from a great aunt will make him a \\"millionaire\\". Neither the threat or the reality of becoming destitute encourages Jeremy to try and earn money and pay his own way. Jeremy has regularly tried to create his own wikipedia entry. Jez is free-spirited, popular with women in the short-term, and enjoys recreational drugs as well as casual sex, although he has several emotionally attached relationships. His first major love interest during the series is Nancy, whom he marries in order to allow her to stay in the UK; she leaves him after he admits to having sex with Toni. He later has a fling with Big Suze, whom he split from shortly before the series began. She angrily leaves him when he tries to persuade her to have sex with Johnson for money. During series 6, he has a relationship with Elena, during which he discovers that she is in a long-term lesbian relationship with Gail; he later reveals the affair to Gail. In series 7 he has a fling with Zahra, who lives with her partner Ben. After Zahra and Ben separate, Jez resumes his relationship with her, but she leaves him after he attempts to have sex with Super Hans's girlfriend. In series 9, he enters a same-sex relationship with Joe - who is over a decade younger than him. Jez pretends to be a year younger than he is, which leads to Joe leaving him at his 40th birthday party, in the finale. =Super Hans= Portrayed by Matt King, Jeremy's bandmate and friend, ’Super’ Hans is an untrustworthy selfish fantasist who very frequently uses recreational drugs. His real name is Simon (as revealed during his wedding to Molly in series 9) and he apparently works offshore \\"on the rigs\\" as inadvertently mentioned during series two. He experiences a crack cocaine addiction in the second series, remarking \\"that crack is really morish\\", later referenced again in the final episode of the third series and in the seventh series. Hans' contentious opinions often contradict Jeremy's ideas. His relationship with Mark is tolerant - although the two have very little in common, Hans seems less concerned by Mark's social awkwardness than others, and even expresses sincere and unprompted appreciation of Mark's character and friendship on the evening before Hans' wedding, while Mark is often surprisingly forgiving of Hans' eccentric and destructive behaviour. He works in a recording studio in the first series. At the end of series five he joins a religious cult that is similar to Scientology. During the finale of the sixth series he says that he is father to eight-year-old twins who have an opaque connection to the German language. In series six, he says that he is barred from entering some EU countries. He is of constant surprise to the others, including in the last episode of the seventh series in which he has apparently found the love of his life, a previously unseen young East Asian woman, Yoko, who speaks no English, but a tiny bit of German. In the final series he marries a woman called Molly. Because of her hatred for Jeremy, Hans asks Mark to be his best man at their wedding. However, she leaves Hans after he kidnaps Angus in an attempt to help Mark. At the wedding, it is revealed that Hans's real name is Simon, and two young boys are present who seem to be the aforementioned twins. At the end of the series, he decides to go to Macedonia and open a moped rental shop. Russell Brand originally auditioned for the part. Hans was inspired by the character Danny from the film Withnail and I. =Alan Johnson= Alan Johnson (portrayed by Paterson Joseph) is a senior loan manager at JLB. Usually referred to and addressed simply as \\"Johnson\\", he becomes friends with Mark after meeting him at work. During series 2, he becomes Mark's boss. His approach to life in general and business in particular is basically an aggressive, social Darwinian apology of the survival of the fittest and borderline fascistic, as seen in his eulogy for Gerrard in series 8. Although a confident, suave and intelligent businessman and apparently a pillar of the community, he was previously an alcoholic for 15 years. Mark continues to get on well with Johnson despite some misunderstandings, and Johnson is one of the few people who takes Mark's side after the breakdown of his marriage to Sophie. Johnson and Jez dislike each other from the start, even more so after Big Suze leaves Jez for him. During series 6, after the termination of the UK JLB operation, he lives in a council house with Suze, referred to by Mark as his \\"recession residence\\" and shows signs of insanity due to his fall from power. He swindles Mark out of £2000 by attempting to make him an executive in a new consultancy agency. In the final episode of series 7, he throws away his sobriety during a new year party. He drives an E39 520i BMW, but later on during the show is seen being driven in an E65 7 series BMW. =Sophie Chapman= (series 1–7, guest series 9) Portrayed by Olivia Colman, Sophie is a colleague and love interest for both Mark and Jeff. She is initially in a relationship with Jeff, but leaves him and starts a relationship with Mark. She marries him, then immediately separates from him. Her family live in the countryside, and she begins drinking heavily and taking drugs. She is less friendly with, or respected by, their boss Johnson than Mark is. Dobby and Johnson are the only people in the office to take Mark's side after their disastrous wedding. At the start of series 6, she discovers that she is pregnant with Mark, Jez, or Jeff's child. By the end, a DNA test proves that Mark is the father. In the first episode of series 7, their son is born. Despite his greatest efforts, Sophie is let down throughout series 6 and 7 by Mark concerning his responsibilities as a father, including unintentionally missing the christening of his son and therefore losing his rights to name his own baby as punishment. Sophie is mentioned - but does not appear - in series 8. She returns in series 9 for one episode where she offers Mark the chance to live with her and their son at her grandmother's cottage, which she had gained after her death. Mark initially agrees for baby Ian's sake, but changes his mind in favour of pursuing April. =Jeff Heaney= Portrayed by Neil Fitzmaurice. Jeff is a colleague of Mark and Sophie's at JLB and an intimidating, manly bully from Merseyside. He repeatedly clashes verbally and occasionally physically with Mark, not least for the attentions of Sophie, who chooses Jeff but leaves him after he kisses another woman. In the later series, as Mark and Sophie's relationship takes its course, he is frequently seen mocking Mark. After their relationship falls apart, Jeff appears to gradually get close to Sophie again. Mark's anger over this peaks when Sophie even considers naming their child 'Geoff'. However, Sophie sees no connection between this name and that of Mark's rival, instead claiming that she takes it from her uncle. In series 7, he becomes the baby's godfather when Mark and Jez both fail to turn up on time, and it appears that Jeff and Sophie are back in a relationship by the end of the series, which is a major torment to Mark, who constantly believes that his son will think Jeff is his father. Jeff confirms they are back together when he comes to Mark's house to collect the baby in series 8. Jeff returns in the very last episode in series 9, no longer with Sophie but once again working for Alan when Mark is fired from his new job. =Dobby= (Series 5–9) Portrayed by Isy Suttie. Dobby works in the IT department of JLB and is a self-described misfit, much like Mark. She tells Mark that her real name is Debbie, but everyone calls her Dobby. She has many interests that are similar to those of Mark, including MMORPGs. Mark meets her in series 5 episode 2 in the office canteen and quickly develops strong feelings for her, as does Mark's colleague Gerard soon after. Despite an at- times difficult relationship, by the end of series 7, Mark invites her to move in with him. Mark spends series 8 encouraging Dobby to move into his flat, while Jez falls in love with her. While Dobby wants to go interrailing across Europe with Mark, he decides the best way to keep her is to ask her to marry him in the Quantocks, as he did with Sophie in series 3. However, an altercation with Jeremy results in Dobby walking off to go to New York. In series 9, Dobby returns and meets Mark and the two are friendly towards each other. Just as Mark finally gets over his infatuation with her, he is beaten up by her boyfriend Gregory after he discovers that Mark has been stalking her online for months. =Big Suze= (played by Sophie Winkleman, series 3–7) Big Suze lived with Jez in a flat (which he nostalgically refers to as the \\"love shack\\") for around a year and a half, prior to the start of the first series of the show. She is occasionally mentioned from series 1 but does not make an appearance until her introduction as a major supporting character in the third series. Suze is posh and is an actress, but between roles works as a waitress in a café. Jez is desperate to get back together with her, and although they reunite briefly, she later leaves him for Alan Johnson. Her nickname comes from her being tall. Her appearance in the third series was intended for Nancy, but Rachel Blanchard was unavailable. During series 6, her relationship with Johnson is troubled, leading to their breakup in series 7, and her throwing a separate New Year's Eve party, resulting in Johnson relapsing into drinking alcohol. Minor characters =April Danecroft= (Series 2 & 9) Portrayed by Catherine Shepherd. A Dartmouth University student and shoe salesgirl who has the magical combination of beauty and low self-esteem. Mark pretends to be doing the same course as her at Dartmouth in order to meet her there. He fails in his attempt to have casual sex with her. She returns in series 9 as a successful historian and is unhappily married to boring middle- aged historian Angus. She has a fling with Mark. =Gerard Matthew= (played by Jim Howick, series 4–8) Was Mark's colleague at JLB, and later, his rival for Dobby's affections. He has health problems which sometimes result in a need for a tube up his nose, and has similar interests to Dobby - including MMORPGs and live action roleplay. Mark considers himself socially superior to him. In series 7, he and Mark form The Dobby Club, an organisation of two who are committed to breaking Dobby up from her boyfriend Simon, deciding that the matter of which of them gets to date her if they succeed can be resolved afterwards. They would readily betray each other if it meant getting what he wanted. Gerrard dies of flu in the first episode of series 8. =Gail Huggins= (Series 6–8) Portrayed by Emily Bruni. Elena's long-term girlfriend, a member of Mensa and a musician. She manages a Mexican restaurant, hiring Mark until she fires him shortly after in series 7. In series 8, she campaigns to be chairman of the freehold committee in Apollo House. =Simon= (Series 7–8) Portrayed by Mathew Baynton. Dobby's boyfriend until they break up. Through series 8, Simon tries to get Dobby back after she reveals she is going to move in with Mark. =Ian Chapman= (played by Paul Clayton, series 4–7) Sophie's homophobic, ultra-conservative father who lives with his wife and son in the countryside. He dislikes Mark, but most of the time silently resents him, rather than trying to break Sophie and Mark up. After Mark impregnates Sophie, he tries to persuade Mark to get back together with Sophie. Mark and Sophie's baby is named after him. =Zahra= (played by Camilla Marie Beeput, series 7) A young woman whom Jez meets in a hospital waiting room while her partner Ben is in a coma. Ben regains consciousness and later employs Jez, in a role which Jez uses as a means to try to get close to, and eventually seduce, Zahra. She is interested in many refined subjects that are beyond Jez, such as foreign-language films and classic literature, including Frankenstein, which he pretends to know about and be interested in as a means to impress her. Jez and Zahra eventually have a fling, unbeknownst to Ben. When Ben and Zahra later break up, Zahra asks Jez to move in with her. She dumps him before he is able to accept her offer, because she finds out that he attempted to cheat on her. =Elena= (played by Vera Filatova, series 6) Elena is a European immigrant who lives in the same block of flats as Mark and Jez. She works part-time as a legal secretary in human rights law and deals marijuana on the side. She has a sexual attraction towards fathers, is bisexual, and in a long-term relationship with Gail. She hides the relationship from him at the start of her fling with Jez, which goes on to become a secret affair. She likes spelt bread as she is wheat intolerant. =Nancy= (played by Rachel Blanchard, series 2 & 4) Arriving in England from the US where she had a conservative upbringing, Nancy is hedonistic and carefree. Her attitude towards love and relationships is affected by her upbringing and her Christian beliefs clashing with her personality and desires, leading her to send her boyfriend Jez very mixed messages, from having adventurous, frequent sex to abstaining completely. She marries him to stay in the UK, but does not reciprocate his love for her. =Toni= (played by Elizabeth Marmur, series 1–2) The next-door neighbour of Mark and Jez, and an object of their affections throughout the first series of the show. She separates from her husband Tony (John Hodgkinson) in series 1, but the couple reunite during series 2, although they still argue. Her father died when she was three and she appears to be seeking a father figure. During her childhood she regularly went skiing. She has two sisters; one with cancer, and a half- sister. She is headstrong and liberal, and engages in casual sex with Jez on a few occasions. In series 1 episode 2, she engages in pyramid selling, but at the end of series 2 she is working as a supervisor in a call centre. =Robert Grayson= (Series 8) Portrayed by Dan Tetsell. Mark's new boss, for whom Super Hans also works selling bathroom supplies. Despite Mark accidentally introducing himself as Robert Grayson due to nerves in the job interview, Mark wins the job but is then constantly shunned in favour of Super Hans, whose sales techniques he appears to favour. =Sarah Corrigan= (Series 3, 6–8 ) Portrayed by Eliza L. Bennett. Mark's sister, a solicitor who aids Mark in regard to custody rights over his son. She first appears having split up with her husband. Jez quickly seduces her, much to Mark's chagrin which worsens when he has sex with her the same night they meet. Jez finishes with her very soon after he finds out Suze is single, but she continues to show a sexual interest in him every time she appears. Although Jez tries to avoid her, he briefly moves in with her and her son Joshy in series 8, when he agrees to move out of Mark's flat but realises that he has nowhere to go. =Megan= (Series 9) Portrayed by Cariad Lloyd. A barmaid whom Jez meets during Super Hans' stag night. He gives her life coaching to help her pursue her dream job as an artist. Jez has an affair with her boyfriend Joe, and also ends up having sex with her behind his back. By coincidence, the two discover the other's cheating with Jez at the same time. Megan agrees to have a \\"threeism\\" with the two men based on a set of guidelines, but a dispute on who gets to be with who on which day results in Joe leaving Megan for Jez. Despite her anger towards Jez, Megan attends his 40th birthday, where she reunites with Joe after Jez breaks up with him. =Joe= (Series 9) Portrayed by Bart Edwards. Megan's boyfriend. Jez has sex with him on an impulse, which results in an ongoing relationship between the two. Jez also has sex with Megan, but chooses Joe over her. His older age prevents him from keeping up with Joe, and Jez pretends to be a year younger than he actually is when Jez's 40th birthday approaches. Joe buys him some tickets to spend a whole week raving together, but Jez declines, so Joe returns to Megan. =Big Mad Andy= (Series 3, 8) Portrayed by Liam Noble. An emotionally volatile handyman whom Jez manages to befriend after Andy is tasked with repairing a bathroom door destroyed by Super Hans. Jez attempts to 'life coach' Andy in a futile and self-serving effort to treat Andy's patently urgent mental health problems. Andy is a heavy drinker who punches people when intoxicated in order to provoke a fight and have his own thoughts \\"punched out of him\\". =Jerry= (Series 9) Portrayed by Tim Key. Mark's colleague who moves in to Jeremy's old room. Although mild- mannered, cheerful, and ostensibly sharing a lot of Mark's more cultured interests (books, history), Jerry proves an irritant, and Mark wishes to return to his more low-brow domestic arrangement with Jeremy.

It was written by Simon Cluett. Premise A black ops sniper, Sam Blake (Martin Kemp) is blackmailed by a psychotic terrorist known only as \\"Jericho\\" into killing six seemingly unrelated people in six hours. If he fails, if he misses a target, if he goes to the police or is caught, the death toll will be far higher.

Hicks *Bartley Burke as Agent Cole *George McCluskey as PC Flynn *Mike Firth as Passerby Reception The film received largely negative reviews. Matt Glasby of Total Film stated that 'Neil Jones threadbare Brit thriller short-changes all comers, particularly lead Martin Kemp, who plays a government hitman blackmailed into going rogue, and co-stars Nick Moran and Patrick Bergin, who add some undeserved class'. Allie Gemmill stated that Age of Kill is 'ultimately another poorly-acted, poorly- constructed film that will only disappoint viewers who are hungry for a good action film'. Mark Kermode stated that the film 'will disappoint even the most undiscerning viewer'. In Stuart Boyland's view 'all but the staunchest fans of the cockney-tough-guy, sub-standard sub-genre of action thrillers should probably steer clear' of the film. In contrast, Eoin Friel stated that 'Age of Kill is another winner for Richwater films with a great cast, fast pace and some decent action'. Ivo Bochenski also gave the film a favourable review, stating that it was 'an enjoyable modern day spy thriller with an intriguing cast of East End faces'. Mike Haberfelner stated that the film is 'full of action and the plot moves forward at a very steady pace - but that said it's anything but a one-dimensional action flick, its plot is complex and multi- layered, twists and turns and is full of surprises, it leads us into a grey area rather than presenting us with the typical good vs evil dichotomy, and it features a bunch of interesting, colourful characters'. In Paul Heath's view 'for a low-budget, though high-octane, British action film with surprisingly big production values, Age Of Kill is a film that won’t overly delight the critics, but is perfect for that post-pub visit on a Friday night to slap on with your mates'.

As part of the wuxia genre of Chinese martial arts and chivalry, in Swordsman, the player takes the role of a wandering hero and experiences the hero’s rise to glory amongst one of ten schools of martial arts, the quest to avenge the hero’s destroyed village, and the opportunity to adventure with great heroes around the world. Gameplay Swordsman gameplay has a focus on action-oriented combat that is less focused on stats and more on player skill. Players can excel through character mobility, aerial combat, twitch reflexes, dodging, and dynamic combat styles inspired by martial arts. Zones dynamically transform as a result of player actions and the actions of player guilds. As players move through the main story, the environment may change based on their decisions. Towns will be destroyed or saved, new NPCs and quest givers will appear, and secret rooms will be revealed. Players can see the effects of their decisions reflected in the balance between good and evil in each zone. Martial Arts Schools Players are able to choose from one of 11 different schools of combat including Shaolin, Wu-tang, Five Venoms, Splendor, Infinity, Sun and Moon Cult, Zephyr, House Tong, Harmony, E'mei, Falconer and the newly released class Grace. Each school representing a different class also consists of different skill sets and usage in different weapons which expands on personal preferences and uniqueness for any player.

The line was operated with enclosed \\"dummy\\" steam locomotives so as not to frighten horses as they operated along city streets. The railroad was leased by the Rochester and Irondequoit Railroad in 1893, which in turn built its own electric streetcar line along St. Paul Boulevard to the Summerville lakeside community in Irondequoit. The electric line only operated in the summer months, and connected to a ferry boat that transported passengers across the Genesee River to Charlotte. The opening of the Stutson Street Bridge in 1927 forced the termination of ferry service, and the railroads entered receivership soon after. Control by New York State Railways The Rochester and Suburban Railway was chartered in 1900 and purchased the Rochester and Irondequoit Railroad at a foreclosure sale, and then merged the Rochester and Lake Ontario Railway. The former R&LO; line was rebuilt and electrified and year-round service to Summerville began in 1905. That same year, the railroad was leased to the Rochester Railway Company, which in turn was acquired by New York State Railways in 1909. The Sea Breeze line was closed in 1936, and the Summerville line followed a year later.

Both the Bobcaygeon and Verulam Formations are composed of bioclastic wackestones, grainstones, and packstones interbedded with calcareous shales and siltstones. The Verulam contains more shale than the underlying Bobcaygeon Formation. Several hardgrounds have been documented in detail from the upper Bobcaygeon and lower Verulam. The paleoenvironments in which the Bobcaygeon and Verulam Formations were deposited have been interpreted as a proximal carbonate shelf that ranged in depth and proximity from shoal to shallow shelf in the Bobcaygeon and from deep shelf to shoal or shallow shelf in the Verulam Formation.Carden Quarry at Fossilworks.org  Fossil content  The Verulam Formation and the underlying Bobcaygeon Formation have provided many fossils.

Route description  The route begins at PTH 2 west of Wawanesa, and terminates at PR 340 in the village. The route is paved for its entire length.  History  The current PR 344 was originally a small connector spur of what was a much longer north-south provincial road. In the early 1990s, the Manitoba government decommissioned a number of provincial secondary roads and returned the maintenance of these roads back to the rural municipalities. All of the original PR 344 other than the current route was included in this decommissioning. Prior to this, PR 344 started at PTH 23 near Dunrea. From this point, it traveled north for , meeting PTH 2 about one kilometre west of the current southbound terminus for PR 340, where it would continue north through Wawanesa. After leaving Wawanesa, PR 344 continued north for , meeting eastbound PR 451 and westbound PR 453 as well as making two lengthy east-west jaunts before entering Brandon in the far southeastern corner of the city. Once within Brandon's city limits, PR 344 originally followed 17th Street East to Victoria Avenue East. The highway turned west on to Victoria Avenue and terminated at a junction with PTH 1A at 1st Street. In 1968, PR 344 was rerouted along Richmond Avenue for to its northbound terminus with PTH 10 at 18th Street. After the decommissioning of the original route, PR 340 was rerouted onto the former section of the highway between Treesbank and Wawanesa. As well, PR 453, which originally terminated eastbound at PR 344, was extended from its old terminus to PR 340 near Treesbank using the previous PR 344 route past Rounthwaite. The section of the former PR 344 between PTH 23 and PTH 2 and between PR 453 and Brandon are now municipal roads. The original length of PR 344 was .
