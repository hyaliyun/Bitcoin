Takesaki studied at Tohoku University, earning a bachelor's degree in 1956, a master's degree in 1958 and a doctorate in 1965. Beginning in 1958 he was a research assistant at the Tokyo Institute of Technology and from 1965 to 1968 he was an associate professor at Tohoku University. From 1968 to 1969 he was a visiting associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1970, he became a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. He was also a visiting professor at Aix-Marseille University (1973–74) and Bielefeld University (1975–76). He is known for the Tomita–Takesaki theory, which is about modular automorphisms of von Neumann algebras. This theory was initially developed by Minoru Tomita until 1967, but his work was published only partially (in Japanese) and was quite difficult to understand, drawing little notice, before being presented by Takesaki in 1970 in a book.For more on this, see also M.

The album was released on November 4, 2008 under Delicious Vinyl. The beats were created from 1995 to 1998 during Jay Dee's tenure with Delicious Vinyl. The album's release was supported by two singles – \\"We Here\\" and \\"Sounds Like Love\\" featuring Debi Nova. Recording sessions for the album took place at Yancey Boys Studio in Los Angeles in 2008. Stones Throw Records released a digital instrumental version of the album in 2009. Background The album's title is a tribute to the family name, and also because the album overall was produced by instrumentals composed by the older brother, while the vocals where provided by the younger brother. In the wake of Dilla's death, the unused tracks were given to Illa J by Delicious Vinyl's founder, Michael \\"Mike Floss\\" Ross. \\"From '95 through '98 Jay Dee was my go-to guy for hot beats and remixes. He was always making beats, always. So there was a select amount of tracks that he composed for me during that time, only they never got used. When I finally met Illa J [in 2007], I gave him a CD containing those unreleased beats,\\" said Michael Ross. Critical reception Upon its release, Yancey Boys was met with generally favorable reviews from music critics. AllMusic's David Jeffries gave the album three out of five stars, saying: \\"To his credit, his heavy workload includes putting the finishing touches on these lost tracks and figuring out how to pay tribute to his older brother while pimping his own potential. His solution is so understated and mellow that Yancey Boys ends up an interesting release for the Dilla faithful instead of Illa J's grand entrance.\\" Adam Thomas of HipHopDX also gave the album a three out of five, saying: \\"Yancey Boys is no classic. However, it's an enjoyable ride that is filled with some great J Dilla production. Illa isn't the most talented, but he does show glimpses of potential in and around the album, which was truly been billed more around his brother than him from the start. The only problem is that in the future, he won't have his older brother to have his back in times of musical trouble. Even so, it's an earnest and sincere attempt from Illa to pay respect to his brother through one of the things that connected them, and in these times, that should mean enough.\\" Pitchfork Media reviewer Tom Breihan gave the album 6.3 out of ten, saying: \\"Thanks to his brother's beyond-the-grave contributions, he himself is the most disposable part of his own debut album. Luckily for him, it probably won't be too hard to find another hour's worth of unused Dilla tracks when it comes time to record the follow-up.\\" Dave Heaton of PopMatters gave the album a seven out of ten, saying: \\"Dilla's music has that elemental quality, like it's air or water, a manifestation of nature. That's true whether it's an instrumental project like Donuts or a supporting track for a rapper. Illa J seems to understand that about Dilla's music. He keeps Yancey Boys in that same natural/mystical space, carrying on his brother's spirit while making a strong, if not explosive, mark as his own artist.\\" XLR8R's Eric K. Arnold gave the album a seven out of ten, saying: \\"Yancey Boys isn't overly inundated with features, making it a true family affair as well as a delight for head- nodders.\\" KevinNottingham.com gave the album a 75 out of 100, saying: \\"Whether it was on purpose or not, Illa J's presence takes the backseat on this album, and Dilla's legacy of work shines through. The periodic off-beat bars and the mediocre rhymes proves that Illa J is far from a polished lyricist, however, Illa understands how to complement Dilla's work in such a way that it highlights every beat, break and soulfulness within the production. Whether Yancey Boys purpose is to engage the listener to the sounds of neo-soul or to highlight J Dilla's endless talent, this release is an effortless listen, and ultimately an album worth giving a chance.\\" Track listing All tracks produced by Jay Dee (aka J Dilla) except \\"Mr. Shakes\\", which is a skit performed by Affion Crockett; all tracks co-produced by Illa J and Mike Floss.

Analyse algébrique is a seminal textbook in infinitesimal calculus published by Augustin-Louis Cauchy in 1821. The article follows the translation by Bradley and Sandifer in describing its contents. Introduction On page 1 of the Introduction, Cauchy writes: \\"In speaking of the continuity of functions, I could not dispense with a treatment of the principal properties of infinitely small quantities, properties which serve as the foundation of the infinitesimal calculus.\\" The translators comment in a footnote: \\"It is interesting that Cauchy does not also mention limits here.\\" Cauchy continues: \\"As for the methods, I have sought to give them all the rigor which one demands from geometry, so that one need never rely on arguments drawn from the generality of algebra.\\" Preliminaries On page 6, Cauchy first discusses variable quantities and then introduces the limit notion in the following terms: \\"When the values successively attributed to a particular variable indefinitely approach a fixed value in such a way as to end up by differing from it by as little as we wish, this fixed value is called the limit of all the other values.\\" On page 7, Cauchy defines an infinitesimal as follows: \\"When the successive numerical values of such a variable decrease indefinitely, in such a way as to fall below any given number, this variable becomes what we call infinitesimal, or an infinitely small quantity.\\" Cauchy adds: \\"A variable of this kind has zero as its limit.\\" On page 10, Bradley and Sandifer confuse the versed cosine with the coversed sine. Cauchy originally defined the sinus versus (versine) as siv(θ) = 1− cos(θ) and the cosinus versus (what is now also known as coversine) as cosiv(θ) = 1− sin(θ). In the translation, however, the cosinus versus (and cosiv) are incorrectly associated with the versed cosine (what is now also known as vercosine) rather than the coversed sine. The notation :lim is introduced on page 12. The translators observe in a footnote: \\"The notation “Lim.” for limit was first used by Simon Antoine Jean L'Huilier (1750–1840) in [L’Huilier 1787, p. 31]. Cauchy wrote this as “lim.” in [Cauchy 1821, p. 13]. The period had disappeared by [Cauchy 1897, p. 26].\\" Chapter 2 This chapter has the long title \\"On infinitely small and infinitely large quantities, and on the continuity of functions. Singular values of functions in various particular cases.\\" On page 21, Cauchy writes: \\"We say that a variable quantity becomes infinitely small when its numerical value decreases indefinitely in such a way as to converge towards the limit zero.\\" On the same page, we find the only explicit example of such a variable to be found in Cauchy, namely :\\\\frac{1}{4}, \\\\frac{1}{3},\\\\frac{1}{6}, \\\\frac{1}{5}, \\\\frac{1}{8}, \\\\frac{1}{7}, \\\\ldots On page 22, Cauchy starts the discussion of orders of magnitude of infinitesimals as follows: \\"Let \\\\alpha be an infinitely small quantity, that is a variable whose numerical value decreases indefinitely. When the various integer powers of \\\\alpha, namely :\\\\alpha, \\\\alpha^2, \\\\alpha^3, \\\\ldots enter into the same calculation, these various powers are called, respectively, infinitely small of the first, the second, the third order, etc. Cauchy notes that \\"the general form of infinitely small quantities of order n (where n represents an integer number) will be :k\\\\alpha^n\\\\quad{} or at least {}\\\\quad k\\\\alpha^n(1\\\\pm \\\\varepsilon). On pages 23-25, Cauchy presents eight theorems on properties of infinitesimals of various orders. Section 2.2 This section is entitled \\"Continuity of functions\\". Cauchy writes: \\"If, beginning with a value of x contained between these limits, we add to the variable x an infinitely small increment \\\\alpha, the function itself is incremented by the difference :f(x+\\\\alpha)-f(x)\\" and states that :\\"the function f(x) is a continuous function of x between the assigned limits if, for each value of x between these limits, the numerical value of the difference f(x+\\\\alpha)-f(x) decreases indefinitely with the numerical value of \\\\alpha.\\" Cauchy goes on to provide an italicized definition of continuity in the following terms: :\\"the function f(x) is continuous with respect to x between the given limits if, between these limits, an infinitely small increment in the variable always produces an infinitely small increment in the function itself.\\" On page 32 Cauchy states the intermediate value theorem. Sum theorem In Theorem I in section 6.1 (page 90 in the translation by Bradley and Sandifer), Cauchy presents the sum theorem in the following terms. When the various terms of series (1) are functions of the same variable x, continuous with respect to this variable in the neighborhood of a particular value for which the series converges, the sum s of the series is also a continuous function of x in the neighborhood of this particular value. Here the series (1) appears on page 86: (1) u_0, u_1, u_2, \\\\ldots, u_n, u_{n+1},\\\\ldots Bibliography * * Free version at archive.org * * Category:Mathematics of infinitesimals Category:Calculus Category:History of calculus Category:Mathematics textbooks ","title":"Cours d'Analyse"},{"id":"41007674","text":"Michel Michaud (born 1946) is a French chef who brought French cuisine to Denmark in 1971.

Power looms Edmund Cartwright bought and patented a power loom in 1785, and it was this loom that was adopted by the nascent cotton industry in England. The silk loom made by Jacques Vaucanson in 1745 operated on the same principles but wasn't developed further. The invention of the flying shuttle by John Kay was critical to the development of a commercially successful power loom. Cartwright's loom was impractical but the ideas behind it were developed by numerous inventors in the Manchester area of England. Cartwright's loom was little used; he established a powerloom factory at Doncaster in 1787 which closed after few years. Grimshaw's factory at Manchester, which opened in 1790 and contained twenty four Cartwright looms, was burnt down by protesting hand loom weavers. It is speculated that Cartwright's failure was due to the loom's wooden frame and crude construction, Cartwright's inexperience in business, and the lack of an adequate method to prepare the warp. To prepare the loom, the warp threads needed to be strengthened by applying a wet size (a process called dressing) and then wound onto a beam or roller that fitted on the back of the loom (a process called warping or beaming). These processes were time-consuming; if dressing took place on the loom, the loom had to remain idle until the threads dried. Because of this, the economics of weaving still favoured the handloom weaver. It was William Radcliffe, also of Stockport, who introduced the dressing frame in 1803. Horrock's loom William Horrocks secured several patents to improve the loom. The Horrocks loom, introduced in 1803, featured an improved method of taking up the cloth onto the beam once it was woven. It had a metal frame, and was described as neat and compact so hundreds could be at work in a single room. As the warp was now dressed away from the loom, the Horrocks loom could be run continuously, being stopped only to piece broken threads and to replenish the weft in the shuttle. In the vicinity of Stockport, approximately two thousand looms were in use by 1818, and by 1821 there were 32 factories containing 5732 looms. According to a 1830 report to the British House of Commons, by 1820 there were an estimated 14,150 power looms in both England and Scotland; that number increased to 55,500 by 1829. However, these counts were outnumbered 4 to 1 by the number of handlooms. Official figures (The Factories Inspectors' count) were first compiled in 1835 and they showed 108,189 power looms used for cotton, 1713 for silk, 2330 for wool and 2846 for worsted, but not all of these would have been Horrocks looms; the 1830 Roberts Loom (based on 1822 patents) had become more popular.

Early life Fatma Pesend Hanım was born on 13 February 1876 in Achba Mansion, Horhor, Istanbul. Born as Fatma Kadriye Achba, she was a member of Abkhazian princely family Anchabadze. Her father was Prince Ahmed Sami Bey (1839 – 1915), the son of Prince Ahmed Bey and Patıma Hanım Eşba. Her mother was Princess Fatıma Hanım Mamleeva (1844 – 1923), the daughter of Tatar prince Ismail Bey Mamleeva. She had an elder sister Princess Ayşe Mahizer Hanım (1871 – 1948), and a younger brother Prince Şükrü Bey (1878 – 1940). Fatma was a painter by avocation. She also had learned French, and Italian. She had a penchant for horse riding, and rode the family's Arabian horses. She had a broad knowledge of culture, and loved to read books. Marriage Fatma's father Sami Bey was in service to Sultan Abdulaziz's eldest son Şehzade Yusuf Izzeddin, and later to Abdul Hamid's eldest son Şehzade Mehmed Selim. One day in 1896 Abdul Hamid happened to see her, when the latter came along with her mother and elder sister to Yıldız Palace on an invitation of Prince Selim's mother, Bedrifelek Kadın. Abdul Hamid acquired about her, and came to know about her from his son Selim. Abdul Hamid asked her hand in marriage from her father. He consented to Abdul Hamid's proposal, and the marriage took place on 20 July 1896 at the Yıldız Palace. She was given the name \\"Fatma Pesend\\", and the title of \\"Fourth Fortunate\\". On 10 June 1897, a year after the marriage, she gave birth to her only child, Hatice Sultan, who lived only eight months. Hatice's early death in 1898 prompted Abdul Hamid to order the construction of a modern hospital in Istanbul exclusively for the treatment of children and pregnant women. The construction of the hospital started on 12 May 1898 and completed on 5 June 1899. It was called \\"Hamidiye Etfal Hastahane-i Âlisi\\", and was completely Abdul Hamid's creation and totally under his supervision. Ayşe Sultan, her step daughter, notes in her memoirs that whenever Dilber Cenan Hanım, Abdul Hamid's wetnurse, visited the palace, she would stay as a guest in Fatma Pesend's household. On 27 April 1909, Abdul Hamid was deposed, and sent into exile in Thessaloniki. Fatma Pesend was closed to Abdul Hamid, and so accompanied him to exile. However, in 1910, a year later, she returned to Istanbul. After Thessaloniki fell to Greece in 1912, Abdul Hamid also returned to Istanbul, and settled in the Beylerbeyi Palace, where he died in 1918. Last years and death At the exile of the imperial family in March 1924, Fatma Pesend remained in Istanbul. She died in her villa at Vaniköy, in April 1928 at the age of fifty-two, and was buried at Karacaahmet Cemetery at Üsküdar.

There are many organizations in Kenya made to protect the rights of Deaf Kenyans and promote progress in deaf education. The state of Kenyan deaf education is constantly changing and improving. Deaf Sign Language Use in Kenya=Kenyan Sign Language Kenyan Sign Language (KSL) is the used by the deaf community of Kenya, the population of which is estimated to be 600,000. With a population of around 340,000 speakers (based on a 2007 consensus), KSL acts as the primary mode of communication for over half of the deaf population. There are two known dialects- Kisumu in western Kenya and Mombasa in eastern Kenya. Like other sign languages, KSL evolved largely through the social interactions of the deaf. Vocabulary is enriched and constantly changing through the movement of unique signs originating in remote areas to other schools or communities. These regional differences can create dialects, just as in oral languages. Kenya, being a culturally diverse country, has around 42 ethnic groups and their local sign languages provided the basis for KSL and allow for its continued diversification. The first dictionary for an African Sign Language was written in Kenya in 1988 by Rothenborg-Jensen and Yego on Kenyan Sign Language. =Kenyan Sign Language Family= KSL may has connections to American Sign Language (ASL) and British Sign Language (BSL), and the manual alphabet is largely (omit) based on that of the American Sign Language, though the British one was used previously and still used in a Mombasa school. KSL has been largely influenced by ASL since the inception of formal education. Many Kenyan schools for the deaf were founded by churches such as the Presbyterian Church of East Africa and Catholic Church and were later influenced by deaf leaders such as Prof. Michael Ndurumo, who advocated the use of sign language and the manual alphabet, as well as many interpreters and volunteers associated with them. The origin of many of the interpreter training programmes were influences by organizations associated with ASL-use, such as the Peace Corps in the foundation of the Kenyan Sign Language Interpreters Association (KSLIA). The KSL used to teach in schools may not be considered authentic KSL due to the substantial amount of ASL influence. Kenyan Sign Language is the basis for Somali Sign Language. This is due to the fact that the first school for the deaf in Somalia along with its three teachers came from Annalena Tonelli’s Kenyan school for the deaf in Wajir. Though KSL is largely unrelated to other languages, but has similarities with Ugandan and Tanzanian sign languages. Nonetheless, Ugandan and Tanzanian deaf cannot often understand KSL very well. However, many deaf Ugandans know KSL due to the fact that they often travel to Kenya for secondary education. Legal Recognition Kenya's official languages are English and Kiswahili, though KSLI is making efforts to give Kenyan Sign Language and Braille official status as well. While not Kenya's official languages, Braille and KSL are mentioned in the 2009 Constitution, Article 7, in which it is stated that the State will protect these two Kenyan languages along with Kenya's indigenous languages.Constitution (2009) Art. 7 [National, official and other languages] KSL Use in Kenya The government of Kenya uses Kenya Signed English, which is parallel to American Signed Exact English, in which the sign language does not have its own grammar and follows English grammar. Kenya Signed English is also used in all schools under the Kenya Institute of Education. KSL, on the other hand, is backed by the University of Nairobi. It is used at Nyangoma and Mumias, both of which are primary schools for the deaf in western Kenya. There is a noted negativity towards KSL on behalf of special education teachers. Some schools are known to use other sign languages, including a Mombasa school uses British Sign Language. A more in-depth look into the use of KSL and SEE in Kenyan schools is presented in the next section. Kenyan Educational Structure and the Incorporation of Deaf Education In Kenya, deaf education makes up part of the ministry of education under the special education division. The Educational Assessment and Resource Services (EARS) also plays a role in assisting deaf education opportunities. It hosts an Educational Assessment and Resource Centre (EARC) in every Kenyan district. Before a deaf child is entered into a school, he is assessed at his local EARC. History of Deaf Education in KenyaEstablishment of Deaf Schools and the Use of KSL= Historically, many changes have been made to the policies in Kenya regarding language of instruction in deaf schools. Starting in the 1800s, missionaries from Europe began establishing schools for the deaf. However, these schools catered to the wealthier population and excluded poor families from the specialized education. At the time, there was a strong emphasis on the oral communication, lip reading, speech therapy, and hearing aids. For quite a while, some publications and speakers have attributed and linked establishment of schools for the deaf in Kenya to Dr. Andrew Jackson Foster. Dr. Foster did not establish any schools or churches for the deaf in Kenya. Dr. Foster's work was mainly concentrated in West Africa. In Kenya, Schools for the deaf were started by religious bodies, both Christian and Muslim.. The first school for the deaf in Kenya was Aga Khan in Mombasa started in 1958. Mumias School for the Deaf and Nyangoma School for the deaf were both established by the Catholic church in 1961, followed by Kambui School for the Deaf which was started by the Presbyterian Church of East Africa (PCEA) in 1963. There then followed a number of schools established by churches, these included Tumu Tumu School for the Deaf in 1970 established by the PCEA, the Methodist Church also started Kaaga School for the Deaf, and the Anglican Church started Maseno School for the Deaf. Another school for the deaf - Kapsabet School for the Deaf was started by the African Inland Church.Ndurumo. Michael M. (1993) Exceptional Children: Developmental Consequences and Intervention. Longman All these were pioneer schools by their respective churches long before Andrew Foster visited Kenya for the first time in the 1980s while on transit to Nigeria. Moreover, schools for the deaf in Kenya started using sign language when it was introduced to schools by Prof Michael Ndurumo in the early 1980s. Other important facts to note are that the Kenya Society for Deaf Children (KSDC) was registered in 1958. Indeed, Prof Michael Ndurumo who later became instrumental in deaf education in Kenya was one of KSDC's first students at Dagoreti Children's Centre in 1961 to 1963. Other pioneer deaf students in Kenya include Santina Mwarania, Rosemary Aloo, Scholastica Majuma, Solomon Kayia, Florence Baseke (from Uganda), and Elkana Kimutai who were among the first batch of students at Mumias School for the Deaf; and Mr. Patrick Hagoi, Rev Daniel Njihia, and Rev Joseph Ondiek who were among the first students at Nyangoma School for the Deaf. Most of there pioneer students would later become very influential leaders of the deaf in many spheres of life in Kenya. Simultaneous communication, or sign supported speech, started to be used in 1986 and is still present. Simultaneous communication (SimCom) involves using both oral and manual coded languages- in this case English and Signed Exact English. While in theory this method is effective, in practice it can become very confusing. Nonetheless, it is claimed that this communication mode has resulted in academic progress. One of the first instances of deaf education that used sign language as opposed to the oral method of the missionary schools starts with the inception of the Kenya Society for Deaf Children (KSDC) in 1958, which went on to build the first two schools made specifically for the deaf- Nyangoma and Mumias. Both primary schools were built in west Kenya by 1961. Secondary schools were built as the number of students attending has drastically increased. According to KSDC's statistics, 1,710 students attended schools for the deaf in 1982, and by 2001 there were 6,000 students. There were reported 23 deaf schools were built from 1960-1980. However, even accounting for the impressive movement, it is estimated that around 30% of all deaf children in Kenya still do not go to school. Prof. Michael Ndurumo is a deaf Kenyan educated in the United States who advocated the use of SEE in 1985 while working for the Kenya Institute of Education (KIE). He was a supporter of the use of sign language in classrooms. This led to the Ministry of Education's formation of Machakos School for the Deaf where Ndurumo incorporated the ASL manual alphabet and the total communication method. Total communication is a mixture of oralism and manualism, and incorporates the use of the individual's specific vocabulary, sign language, fingerspelling, speech and lip reading, manually coded language and other forms of communication to teach at an individual level for students. A 1988 study conducted by the Ministry of Education showed that using total communication as a teaching method enabled faster learning and was more effective for cognitive growth when incorporated at earlier ages than later ages. After this study, the Kenyan government promoted the use of sign language and, more specifically, SEE alongside total communication in deaf schools and classrooms. The Structure of Deaf Education in KenyaLanguage Instruction Policy= As one of Kenya's two official languages, high importance is placed on English in the Kenyan school system. Since the Gachathi Report took effect in 1976 and reformed Kenya's school system, all Kenyan schools teach Kenyan school children to read and write English from pre-school until Standard 3. Starting in Standard 4, students are taught solely in English, with the exception of Kiswahili classes or other language classes. All national examinations in Kenya are written and conducted in English. These examinations are instrumental to students’ futures, as they determine what class level the student will be placed in, acceptance into college programmes, and even obtaining jobs. The only accommodations provided for deaf students is a 30-minute extension during their exam. Kenyan universities do not provide interpreters for their deaf students. Due to the heavy emphasis placed on English skills, efforts to maximise deaf students’ exposure to English have ensued in the hopes that it will better prepare them for their examinations and subsequently ensure better futures and job opportunities. This centrality of English in Kenya is one major motive behind the implementation of inclusive education in Kenyan schools. =English Language in the Kenyan School System and its Effects on the Use of KSL= Schoolchildren must become proficient in English because of the emphasis on it in Kenyan education and examinations, meaning thorough knowledge of English grammar is essential. Since Kenyan Sign Language holds its own grammar, deaf students taught in KSL are considered to be at a disadvantage. As an attempt to incorporate more exposure to English into deaf education, aid these students to become proficient in English grammar, and make learning to read and write in English more feasible, suggestions have been made to enforce the use of Signed Exact English. Signed Exact English (SEE) uses the sentence structure of English with the visual signs of sign language. It is a manually coded language, also called a signed oral language, and thus is not a “natural language” due to the fact that it did not evolve naturally within a human population and instead was assembled by merging aspects of oral and sign languages. Signed Exact English is not considered its own language since it does not have a distinct grammatical structure; it is instead considered a manual sign system. SEE, however, does not take into account many subtle aspects of sign language, such as changes in facial expressions that affect meaning. Use of SEE can also stunt the development and use of KSL. Studies of SimComm and sign bilingualism show that the use of both oral communication and manually coded communication improves comprehension and understanding but can stunt the teacher's linguistic complexity, making their language use simpler. When asked, many students preferred learning through KSL instead of SEE (or ASL) and stated that using both sign language and speech together was confusing. However, teachers are not as proficient in KSL. Kiswahili is a compulsory subject in Kenyan schools, yet due to low results from deaf students there has been thought to replace it with teaching KSL, with the Kenya Society for Deaf Children (KSDC) on the forefront of the proposal. In fact, KSL is now an option for deaf students in some schools, though there is a lack of textbooks to facilitate the teaching of KSL as a subject. Various Strategies in Deaf Education Historically, many students, especially those with special needs such as the deaf, have been excluded from schools, particularly in developing countries. However, there are now multiple approaches to deaf education that are present in Kenya as well as the rest of the world. There is considerable controversy surrounding which may be considered the best course of action, as they all have positive and negative aspects. Some of these strategies are: *Inclusion, in which deaf (and other special needs students) learn alongside hearing students. The structure of the class and the mode of teaching change to accommodate the special needs students. *Integration, in which deaf students learn alongside hearing students. While similar to inclusion, special education kids are taught to adapt to the class rather than changing the structure of the class as a whole. *Mainstreaming, in which deaf students learn with hearing students for part of the day, depending on their academic level, but part of the day is spent in special education classes. This allows for individualized attention along with social interaction with mainstream students. *Segregation, in which special needs students are taught separately from other students, or in entirely separate special schools. =Integration and Inclusive Education in KenyaIntegration in Kenyan Schools The instigation of integration into the Kenyan education system can be traced back to Britain due to the fact that most Kenyan developers of special education were trained in Britain, where integration was endorsed in 1981. Upon their return, policies were set into motion regarding the assimilation of deaf and other special education students into mainstream schools- though these students were still given particular attention. Because of the emphasis on normalization, deaf students were taught speech development, often compromising their exposure to other subjects. Despite the years that integration had been incorporated in the educational system, the rate of academic improvement has yet to reach expectations. There is a general negativity and disregard to the policy structures along with a lack of enforcement. Thus, the current suggestion to better deaf education is to embrace inclusive education. The Rise of Inclusive Education Though the concept of inclusive education is not very new, its implementation by Kenyan educators is. Strategies toward inclusion started when the University of Cambridge Faculty of Education, Kenyatta University, and the Kenyan Ministry of Education Science and Technology's special education section initiated a link programme in 2001 dedicated to educational inclusion. This initiated a widespread effort to promote inclusion in the country's deaf schools in hopes that it would better prepare deaf students for the English- based Kenyan educational and examination systems. Presently, the Kenyan government is incorporating inclusion into the policy of its educational system. Projections show that there will be a minimum of one special needs teacher in every institution by 2015. The United Kingdom’s Cheshire International is supporting western Kenya’s Oriang Inclusive Project- the only inclusive programme for public schools. The Project currently manages five regular schools. Assessments of academic improvement on behalf of the Project are yet to ensue. Controversies Surrounding Inclusive Education Inclusion is one of the many methods to approaching the education of deaf and hard-of-hearing students throughout the world and is considered by many the best approach. However, due to the linguistic barrier, the inclusion of students with hearing impairments into mainstream schools can have a significant negative effect on academic achievement if proper support and special attention is not sufficiently provided. The approach of inclusive education rejects the use of special schools or the separation of special needs students from the main student body. Since special schools are designed specifically to target the needs of a specific group of students, denying the separation of these students can sacrifice the quality of the education that’s needed to support certain students and keep them on track with the educational system. Additionally, merging these students with their mainstream counterparts can put them at considerable disadvantage when it comes to the competing for these facilities as well as the attention and guidance of their instructors. Imposing inclusive education in developing countries such as Kenya ignores how issues such as insufficient funding, inadequate teacher training, large numbers of students in classrooms, and inflexible school systems may affect the effectiveness of these students’ education. Studies show that parents of deaf students prefer to send their children to special schools under the assumption that they will receive better, specialized education, interact with other hearing-impaired students, and use a common language. =Lack of Educators= Deaf education teachers all hold either a (1) Diploma in Special Needs Education received from the Kenya Institute of Special Education (KISE) or (2) Degree in Special Needs Education received from Kenyatta or Maseno University. Because of the shortage in qualified teachers, some do not hold either of these qualifications. These teachers are trained in general education but generally have no received special education training. Kenyan Sign Language Organizations Both the KSLIA and the KNAD are dedicated to protecting Deaf rights and education in Kenya. Kenyan Sign Language Interpreters Association The Kenyan Sign Language Interpreters Association (KSLIA) is an organisation that supports the creation and advancement of interpreter training and certification programmes. The KSLIA Official Blog envisions a “three-pronged approach” that includes the three C's: #Certification of members #Continuing education for the practicing interpreters #Conflict resolution through enforcement of the Code of Ethics =Formation of the KSLIA= The Peace Corps programme had a strong need for trained interpreters for the pre-service training programme. The interpreters were needed to allow Deaf volunteers communication with the instructors. When it was evident that trained interpreters in Kenya were scarce, the Peace Corps supported a couple interpreters from the United States to work with local interpreters to be able to provide better future interpreter services to Deaf volunteers. There was a strong group of Deaf volunteers in 1999 who actively supported the allocation of funds to strengthen support for local interpreters. A one-week-long workshop was funded as a result of these volunteers’ lobbying. 15 interpreters attended the workshop which was held in September 2000. Kenyan interpreters were encouraged to start an association during this week-long workshop. The association was to be responsible for: #Becoming a way for interpreters to socially interact #Enforcing a mutually agreed-upon code of ethics and correcting interpreters #Acting as a medium for progress through peer education For the following couple of months, assemblies were held to form a constitution and code of ethics, and a list of trained interpreters throughout the country was created. This one-week programme is accredited with instigating what the “Kenyan Interpreter community” came to know as the Navisha Declaration. The Kenyan Sign Language Association adopted the Navisha Declaration's objectives as its own once it became officially registered under the Societies Act in December 2000. =Navisha Declaration= The KSLI blog states the Navisha Declaration to be: : We the Kenyan Interpreters practicing in various fields agree to: :: a) To secure official recognition by the Government of Interpreters profession ::b) Encourage and promote initiatives in improving the standards of SL interpreting and interpreter training and pay scale of interpreters depending with their level and skills of interpretation through certification. ::c) Cooperation with other recognized bodies concerned in the welfare of the deaf and in provision of Interpreters throughout the world. ::d) Awareness creation on Deafness and SL. Interpreters through publication of information materials ::e) To collect and raise funds for the achievement of goals and objectives through membership fee, subscription, contribution, gifts or donations, commissions and payments, fund raising whether in money or otherwise from both members and non-members. ::f) To maintain and administer a register of S.L Interpreters in Kenya.” Kenyan National Association of the Deaf (KNAD) The Kenyan National Association of the Deaf is a Kenyan national non- governmental organisation that was founded and is run by Deaf Kenyans. KNAD was formed in 1987 through the Societies Act. KNAD cooperates with international NGOs and the Kenyan government regarding issues about deaf Kenyans. KNAD promotes human rights for the deaf and strives to offer research and training in sign language and sign language interpreting. It is also a member of the World Federation of the Deaf. Important Figures in Kenyan Deaf Education=Annalena Tonelli Annalena Tonelli was a Roman Catholic volunteer who worked in eastern Africa for a significant portion of her life. Tonelli is known for building special schools of many sorts. She built a school for the deaf in 1980 in Wajir, a Somali-Kenyan town in the northeastern part of Kenya. The school was known for using KSL. Tonelli was awarded the Nansen Refugee Award in 2003 and died shortly after by assassination. In Tonelli's honour, three graduates from Wajir built the Annalena School for the Deaf in Borama, Somali. It was the first school for the deaf ever to be built in Somalia. It was in this school that Somali Sign Language began. Beatrice Anunda and the Demolition of the Humble Hearts School Beatrice Anunda established the Humble Hearts School in Kenya in September 2003. It used both KSL and English, making it the first bilingual deaf school in Kenya. Anunda learned KSL from the KSL Research Project of the University of Nairobi. Recently, the Kenyan Piping Company bulldozed the school, though the government claimed it was an accident due to construction of a pipe that was going through the city. No compensation was paid, but temporary classrooms were made until the Humble Hearts School was rebuilt through the help of philanthropists and volunteers, including an NGO called Angel Covers.

This was first confronted in New Zealand in 1961. Habit and Habitat The species breeds in littoral rock and brackish pools just above the tide line and remains close to their breeding habitats. Additionally, most adult females have been known and tested to be autogenous which allows females to lay their first batch of eggs before taking or ingesting a blood meal. Their autogenous capacities can however be greatly altered by the conditions that surround them in their environment, such as temperature. The percentage of autogenous females from the same breeding pool can vary from 40% in the summer to 85% in the winter due to temperature swings and slower development. There are anautogenous populations of Aedes australis in Tasmania and South Australia, meaning those mosquitoes have to consume blood to reproduce. Ae. australis are almost exclusively anautogenous in eastern New Zealand. In addition, humans are the most common source of blood for A. australis in those regions. The eggs of this species are rhomboidal in both ventral and dorsal view.

He did not produce a lot of poetry, but the small amount of poetry he produced showed great quality. He published twenty poems in a book titled La flauta de ónix, and six other poems were published posthumously. The group is called \\"decapitada\\", or decapitated, because all its members committed suicide at a young age. Biography Borja was born in Quito in 1892, a direct descendant of the third Duke of Gandía. His father, Luis Felipe Borja Perez, sent him to Paris to treat a disease in his eye when he was just entering adolescence.The Autobiographical Dictionary of Ecuador - Arturo Borja Perez Borja quickly mastered the French language. Soon he began to read the Symbolist poets, especially Baudelaire and Verlaine. His favorite verses were from Mallarmé, Samain, Baudelaire, Rimbaud, etc. With respect to his relationship with the other poets of the Decapitated Generation, he was great friends of Humberto Fierro and Ernesto Noboa y Caamaño, with whom he had considerable correspondence during his life. Although he never met Medardo Ángel Silva in person, he professed a great admiration for him and dedicated to him the poem, \\"El árbol del bien y del mal\\" (The Tree of Good and Evil). Borja married Carmen Rosa Sánchez Destruge on October 15, 1912. He dedicated the poems “Por el camino de las quimeras” and “En el blanco cementerio” to Carmen. In a few years, the happiness he felt as a youth dissipated and he developed a desperate melancholy which was evident in his poems. He longed for death, and committed suicide in Quito on November 13, 1912 when he was only 20 years old. He died of a morphine overdose. The Decapitated Generation The \\"Generación decapitada\\" (Decapitated Generation) was a literary group formed by four young Ecuadorian poets in the first decades of the 20th century. Two men from Guayaquil, Medardo Ángel Silva and Ernesto Noboa y Caamaño, and two men from Quito, Arturo Borja and Humberto Fierro, were the precursors of modernismo in Ecuador. These four writers were greatly influenced by the modernist movement of Rubén Darío and by 19th-century French romantic poetry. They read this poetry in its original language, by authors including Baudelaire, Hugo, Rimbaud, and Verlaine. This group is called \\"decapitada\\" because all of them committed suicide at a young age. Though they knew each other and dedicated poems to each other, they never met together to create a true literary group. The term \\"generación decapitada\\" originated in the middle of the 20th century, when Ecuadorian journalists and historians decided to name them, noting similarities in the authors' poetry. The Song “Para mí tu recuerdo” His poem \\"Para mí tu recuerdo\\" (For Me Your Memory) was made into a pasillo song by composer Miguel Ángel Casares Viteri, and sung by vocalists such as Carlota Jaramillo and Bolívar “El Pollo” Ortiz.

The system was first noted as a tropical depression on September 16, 2013, while it was located within the South China Sea to the south east of Hanoi in Vietnam. Over the next two days the system gradually developed further, before it was reported by the Vietnamese National Centre for Hydro Meteorological Forecasting that the system had developed into their eighth tropical storm of 2013. However, other meteorological agencies did not report that the system had developed into a tropical storm. In Vietnam, flooding triggered by the storm killed at least seven people and 5,000 homes were damaged or destroyed. Severe flooding took place in neighboring Laos where at least 10,000 structures were damaged and losses reached $61 million (United States dollars). Meteorological history On September 16, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the Vietnamese National Centre for Hydro Meteorological Forecasting (VNCHMF) reported that a tropical depression had developed within an area of low to moderate vertical windshear, about to the southeast of Hà Nội, Vietnam. Over the next two days the depression gradually developed further as it moved westwards, before the VNCHMF reported during September 17, that the system had developed into their eighth tropical storm of the season. Later that day as vertical windshear over the system decreased slightly, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. During the next day after the depressions low level circulation center had started to consolidate, the JTWC initiated advisories and designated the system as Tropical Depression 18W. During that day the system moved westwards along the southern edge of the subtropical ridge of high pressure, before the JTWC issued its final warning on the system later that day after the depression had made landfall on Vietnam, near the port city of Da Nang. Over the next couple of days the system continued to move westwards and moved through Vietnam, Laos and Thailand, before it was last noted on September 21 over the Thai province of Phetchabun. Impact=Vietnam On September 17, one of the deputy prime ministers of Vietnam Hoàng Trung Hải, asked the Central Committee for Flood and Storm Control and the National Committee for Search and Rescue, to be prepared for the system impacting Vietnam. He also asked local authorities and border guards to call on vessels, between Quang Binh and Phu Yen provinces to take shelter and evacuate people in vulnerable areas to higher places.

Located between the Gilmerton and Danderhall areas, The Drum is south-east of the city centre. The Drum was the seat of the Lords Somerville from the later Middle Ages, who built a 16th- century house on the estate. This was replaced in the 1720s with a classical house by William Adam. Sold by Lord Somerville in the early 19th century, the house remains in private hands. History In the Middle Ages the area was part of a royal hunting forest named Drumselch, which extended north to Holyroodhouse. The lands were held by the Herring family until the 14th century, when Sir Walter de Somerville of Linton and Carnwath (d.1380) married Geilles, daughter of Sir John Herring of Gilmerton. By this marriage Sir Walter acquired half of the Gilmerton estate, including the lands of Drum.Somerville, vol.1, p.130 Sir Walter's grandson Thomas (d.1434) was created Lord Somerville by King James I, and The Drum remained in Sir Walter's family until 1800. During the 16th century a dispute arose between the Lords Somerville and another branch of the family over the possession of Gilmerton and The Drum. This was resolved in 1578 after several years of legal debate, in favour of Hugh Somerville, 7th Lord Somerville (1547–1597).Somerville, vol.1, pp.442–458 Subsequently, Lord Somerville re-established himself at The Drum, and in 1584 he commissioned the mason-architect John Mylne to build a new house. The project was advised by Somerville's kinsman Robert, Lord Seton, and the house was built between June 1584 and October 1585. It was damaged by fire some years later, and again in 1629, but was rebuilt each time. It was described by the 11th Lord Somerville in 1679: In 1726 James Somerville, 13th Lord Somerville (1698–1765), commissioned the present house at The Drum from the architect William Adam. The new house incorporates the ground floor of the 16th-century mansion in its west wing. A matching east wing was planned but never built. The pediment over the entrance bears the arms of Lord Somerville and his first wife, while over the fireplace inside the Somerville arms are shown with those of his second wife, indicating the date of the interior as after 1736. The Palladian design of the façade has been criticised for its \\"slightly muddled use of classical elements\\", with a central Venetian window and rusticated pilasters on the first floor apparently unsupported by any similar structure on the ground floor. The interior is decorated with \\"magnificent stucco work\\". The curved double stair leading to the main entrance was added in 1782. William Adam also laid out new parks around the house, including avenues focused on several buildings and monuments, few of which survive. From 1756 the Edinburgh Mercat Cross was located at The Drum, following its removal from the High Street, until its restoration in 1866. A replica is now located by the stables. The estate was broken up in the early years of the 19th century, with the house purchased in 1862 by John More Nisbett, who also purchased much of the original grounds. His second son Hamilton More Nisbett (1868–1955) trained as an architect under John Kinross, and inherited The Drum on his older brother's death in 1939. His architectural practice was afterwards based at The Drum, and he published a history of the house. The Drum is still owned and occupied by the More Nisbett family. The Drum is a category A listed building. The parks are included on the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland, the national listing of significant gardens, and are described as a \\"good example of William Adam's formal style of landscape design carried out in the 1700s with the structure still relatively intact today\\".

Background=Historical Factors Karachi is a cosmopolitan city and biggest city of Pakistan having a population more than 20 million, consisting of many ethnic communities. The city's demographics play an important role in its politics. Ethnic politics have resulted in sporadic violence throughout Karachi's history, often leading to bloody conflicts. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, Muslim immigrants from areas constituting modern-day India migrated in large numbers to the newly created Muslim nation of Pakistan and became settled in Karachi, the historical capital of the Sindh province. These migrants had educated, middle-class to upper-class backgrounds and came from cultured families; they came to be known as Muhajir people (Muhajir meaning \\"immigrant\\"). They dominated much of Karachi's businesses, something which was feared and resented by many of the province's native Sindhi people and radical Sindhi nationalists. After the breakaway of East Pakistan in 1971 and the formation of Bangladesh, Pakistan accepted a large number of Biharis (known as \\"Stranded Pakistanis\\") loyal to the country, trapped in Bangladesh and offered them citizenship. The Bihari migrants assimilated into the diverse Urdu-speaking Muhajir population. Some Bengalis in Pakistan also stayed behind. The Pashtuns (Pakhtuns or Pathans), originally from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, FATA and northern Balochistan, are now the city's second largest ethnic group in Karachi after Muhajirs. With as high as 7 million by some estimates, the city of Karachi in Pakistan has the largest concentration of urban Pashtun population in the world, including 50,000 registered Afghan refugees in the city. As per current demographic ratio Pashtuns are about 25% of Karachi's population. Karachi's status as a regional industrial centre attracted migrants from other parts of Pakistan as well, including Punjab, Balochistan and Pashtun migrants from the frontier regions. Added to this were Iranians, Arabs, Central Asians as well as thousands of Afghan refugees who came to Karachi, initially displaced by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan; some of the Afghan and Pashtun migration brought along conservative tribal culture, further intensifying ethnic and sectarian violence and also giving rise to mob culture.Karachi – Daily Sun. Daily-sun.com. Retrieved on 2015-11-23. =Ethnic Differences= There are several ethnic groups in Lyari including Sindhis, Kashmiris, Seraikis, Pakhtuns, Balochis, Memons, Bohras Ismailis, etc. The ethnic mix has resulted in political parties being affiliated with specific communities. Examples are; *Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) was founded for the political interests of the Muhajir people. *Pakistan People's Party (PPP) is popular among Sindhis & Balochis and Lyari in particular was (PPP) stronghold. =Religious & Sectarian Differences= Sectarian parties and Sunni-Shia conflict have also led to violence in this district with many wanted terrorists hiding out in Lyari. Operations in 2012 Lyari had long been a stronghold of Pakistan Peoples' Party (PPP). The PPP took under its wing a well known gangster named Abdul-Rehman Baloch, alias Rehman Dakait, to keep the Lyari vote bank in check by not allowing other parties access to Lyari. In exchange Rehman Dakait would be allowed a free rein to extort local businesses, smuggle drugs, arms and ammunition. This agreement was the brainchild of Zulfiqar Mirza and then President Asif Ali Zardari who placed Rehman Dakait as the leader of a newly formed Peoples' Aman Committee in 2008 to look after the affairs of Lyari and to regulate crime in his territory. He brought down petty crime and became a local hero. Despite his enhanced reputation he went on his own crime spree unchecked and became the undisputed crime boss in Lyari. He soon fell out with the PPP, by 2009 he was a wanted man and was killed in a police encounter in August 2009. The Peoples' Aman Committee was then taken over by his first cousin and partner in crime Uzair Jan Baloch. Uzair was an ardent enemy of MQM and after several targeted killings came under pressure from the PPP to disband. Despite being officially defunct, the organization continued to function de facto on the ground. The government finally issued a notification on October 11, 2011 which banned the Peoples' Aman Committee under Clause (11/B) of Anti-terrorism Act 1997.Peoples Aman Committee Banned. Thenews.com.pk.

Additionally, the ministry directed law enforcement agencies to monitor the activities of the committee.Ban on Peoples Aman Committee Notified . Samaa.tv (October 11, 2011). Retrieved on 2012-05-04. Uzair Jan Baloch had become a serious liability for PPP. A member of his gang, Saqib alias Sakhi, was killed in police encounter on April 1, 2012. Uzair Jan and many of his colleagues were also booked by the police for the murder of a policeman. Rival gangs began to kill his men. Uzair Jan felt betrayed and blamed the current activism against him on the PPP politicians of Lyari such as Malik Mohammad Khan along with National Assembly member from Lyari Nabeel Gabol and MPA Saleem Hingoro. Uzair Jan Baloch on April 26, 2012 assassinated Malik Mohammad Khan while he was leading a procession of party activists against the conviction of Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani by the Supreme Court in a contempt case. The Interior Minister Rehman Malik after conferring with the President and other PPP members decided to start an operation to seize and destroy the Lyari gangs. The Lyari operation commenced on April 27, 2012. Uzair's house was raided, with the criminal eluding capture.

Early on police and local authorities made progress, however stiff resistance caused high casualties on all sides, resulting in a 48-hour suspension on May 4, 2012. The Inspector General (IG) of Sindh police Mushtaq Shah addressed a press conference at Central Police Office in Karachi stating that the Lyari operation was in its final stages and that the Taliban along with other criminals were involved in Lyari clashes. However, there was no way to corroborate this information. The operations of 2012 were abruptly halted when Nawaz Sharif intervened, to cash in on the conflict between the rivals and win the votes of people of Lyari. Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz's Sindh leader Raja Saeed met with Uzair Baloch, and also expressed solidarity with the people of Lyari. The 2012 operations were a predominantly a police led operation but only succeeded in arresting a minority of gangsters. Operations in 2013 In 2013 operations were conducted under the new Federal Government of Pakistan Muslim League (N) after Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif visited Karachi and devised a strategy to curb violence. With the provincial government of PPP on board, the prime minister gave a go-ahead to Pakistan Rangers to conduct raids and arrest criminals. The targeted operation began on September 7, 2013 and since then more than a thousand suspects have been arrested. The Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan recently declared the first phase of the operation a success.

In 1919 Fierro published his first book titled “El laúd en el valle” (The lute in the valley), his second book \\"Velada palatina\\" (Evening palate) was published 20 years after his death in 1949. The Decapitated Generation The \\"Generación decapitada\\" (Decapitated Generation) was a literary group formed by four young Ecuadorian poets in the first decades of the 20th century. Two men from Guayaquil, Medardo Ángel Silva and Ernesto Noboa y Caamaño, and two men from Quito, Arturo Borja and Humberto Fierro, were the precursors of modernismo in Ecuador. These four writers were greatly influenced by the modernist movement of Rubén Darío and by 19th-century French romantic poetry. They all read this poetry in the original language, by authors including Baudelaire, Hugo, Rimbaud, and Verlaine. This group is called \\"decapitada\\", or decapitated, because all of them committed suicide at a young age. Though they knew each other and dedicated poems to each other, they never met together to create a true literary group.

It is the world's highest underwater waterfall, with water falling almost 3,505 metres (11,500 feet). It is formed by the density difference of the water masses either side of the Denmark Strait, the eastern side being colder than the western. Due to this difference, when the two masses meet along the top ridge of the strait, the colder, denser water flows downwards and underneath the warmer, less dense water. It is thought that the Denmark Strait cataract has a flow rate exceeding 175 million cubic feet (5.0 million cubic meters) per second, making it 350 times as voluminous as the extinct Guaíra Falls on the border of Brazil and Paraguay, which was once thought to be the most voluminous waterfall on Earth, and which itself was 12 times more voluminous than Victoria Falls.

The game is part of the ScienceAtHome umbrella project, developed by AU Ideas Center for Community Driven Research (CODER). CODER aims to merge theoretical and experimental quantum research with online community efforts to explore the potential for online citizen science in this otherwise highly specialized field. The objective of the game is to complete challenges that are simulations of logical operations in a quantum computer. The team behind the game are building a scalable quantum computer with a processor consisting of 300 atoms. Logical operations are performed by moving the atoms with optical tweezers. Moving atoms in a controlled way is a difficult task because the atom becomes excited and the atomic wave function delocalises. Approaching the presumed quantum speed limit is a huge challenge for quantum algorithms and the task that Quantum Moves players are asked to tackle. How gameplay helps ScienceAtHome build a quantum computer In Quantum Moves, the atomic wave function is represented as a sloshy liquid in an energy potential well created by the optical tweezers. Players control the depth and the horizontal location of the well, simulating the path on the optical tweezers. The wave function reacts to changes in the potential function as dictated by the Schrödinger equation leading to sloshing seen by the players. Players are asked to move the well without sloshing the atomic wave function too much. A path created by a player maps one-to-one to a solution of the Schrödinger equation. Top results of the game play are then used to provide guidance into the algorithm’s search space, resulting in solutions superior to those found by the algorithm alone. In 2012, the first version of the game was developed in the programming language MATLAB and tested in several high schools across Denmark. The feedback was positive, but there were many technical issues that made the interaction in the game cumbersome. In the summer of 2012, the game was translated into Java and the first version of Quantum Moves was released. Since then, Quantum Moves has been built in Unity multi-platform development engine and released in the App Store and Google Play for use in touch screen devices. , Quantum Moves had been played over 8 million times by more than 200,000 players worldwide. In April 2016, the journal Nature published an article “Exploring the quantum speed limit with computer games”, detailing the analysis of one of the levels in Quantum Moves called BringHomeWater, and showing that players excel at solving the corresponding atomic transport problem. This article was retracted in July 2020 because the authors made a sign error in their implementation of the benchmarked optimization algorithm. It was shown by Dries Sels that \\"a simple stochastic local optimization method finds near-optimal solutions which outperform all players\\". In other words, the 200 000 players were all beaten by the stochastic optimization method.

He served during the Boxer Rebellion (1899–1901) and World War I (1914–1918). It was on his suggestion that the Coastwatchers organisation was established in 1919. The coastwatchers played an important role during World War II. Early years Chapman James Clare was the son of James Coughron Clare, a merchant ship master. He was born on his father's ship Matilda Wattenbach on 23 June 1853 in the Bay of Biscay. His father became a lieutenant in the Royal Naval Reserve. Clare was educated in private schools in England at Cheshunt and Edmonton. When Clare was fifteen he joined Smith, Fleming & Co. of London as a merchant marine apprentice, and worked on sailing ships for the next five years. In 1873 Clare became mate on a steamer of the Royal Mail Line of Belgium. From 1875 until 1880 he worked on steamers of Apcar & Company of Calcutta, engaged in the opium trade between Calcutta and Hong Kong. Clare resigned from Apcar & Company in 1880 and moved to South Australia. On 15 June 1880 he joined the Marine Board. In 1884 he was put in command of Governor Musgrave, a steamer engaged in maintenance of coastal lighthouses and navigation aids. On 5 April 1885 Clare married Ellen Minnie Cotgrave. They had three children, two boys and one girl. Naval officer HMCS Protector in 1900 HMCS Protector in 1901 Clare spent some time in the South Australian naval reserve, then on 1 December 1886 was appointed lieutenant-commander in the South Australian Naval Forces. Until 1900 he nominally remained master of Governor Musgrave but spent much of this time in the cruiser HMCS Protector training reserves and performing other duties. In May 1900 Clare was appointed commander, transferred to the Protector. In July 1900 Clare succeeded Captain William Rooke Creswell as naval commandant on the Protector. Creswell became Commandant of the Queensland Naval Forces. Later that year the Australian government offered to lend the Protector to assist British forces engaged in suppressing the Boxer Rebellion (1899–1901). For reasons of protocol, Clare agree to serve as second in command under Creswell, a former Royal Navy officer. The Australian government did not accede to the British demand that the ship be manned by a British crew. Clare was appointed captain in December 1900. From 1901 he was the second most senior officer in the Commonwealth Naval Forces. In 1901 Clare was one of seven judges of designs for a new Federal Australian Flag. They selected the winner from 32,823 submissions. In 1905 he was listed as Captain of the Protector, Commandant and Superintendent of Life Saving Services. He continued to command the Protector in home waters until 1910. The Royal Australian Navy was established in 1911. Clare was made district naval officer in Western Australia. During World War I (1914–1918) Clare's command convoyed Australian troops to Europe. Clare became a member of the Western Australian Coal Board in 1917. While the Empire of Japan was an Allied country at the time, on 20 November 1917, a battery at Fremantle Harbour fired a shell as the Japanese cruiser Yahagi. The shell fell within of Yahagi. Clare, as commander of the Western Australian Naval District attempted to explain the incident, but was the situation became politicised for several reasons. While Japanese forces had earlier captured the German colony of Tsingtao, and the Imperial Japanese Navy had frequently escorted Australian and other Allied vessels in the Pacific, Indian Ocean and Mediterranean theatres, as well as performing patrol duties, some Allied governments, including that of Australia, maintained an official ban on immigration by people of non-European descent, under racially discriminatory laws; in theory, all Japanese citizens were affected by these laws. In addition, Allied governments had blocked Japanese offers to join front-line combat operations in other parts of the world. Furthermore, politicians and the press in Allied countries down-played the Japanese contribution. Admiral Kazuyoshi Yamaji, who had ejected Clare's explanation, eventually received a full apology. After the war, Clare was district naval officer of South Australia until his retirement in July 1919. In 1919 Clare proposed the coastwatchers organisation, a volunteer force of government employees that watched for suspicious shipping or aircraft movements along the north coast of Australia. His proposal was accepted and extended to cover the Soloman Islands and Papua New Guinea. The organisation was to play an important role during World War II (1939–1945). Later years Clare lived in retirement from 1919 onward at Glenelg, Adelaide, where he died on 28 September 1940 at the age of 87. Clare was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 1902 Coronation Honours list on 26 June 1902 for his services during the Boxer Rebellion. He was awarded the Japanese Order of the Rising Sun for his work with the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War I.

History The Low Parks Museum first opened on 3 November 1967 as the Hamilton District Museum, and is housed within two historic buildings, both closely linked to the history of Hamilton and its Dukes throughout the years. The Museum is located next to the site of Hamilton Palace, demolished in 1927, and the history of the buildings is directly linked to the palace. The former Palace Riding School The first of these buildings, now known as Portland, was designed by the architect James Smith and built in 1696 as the private home of David Crawford, secretary and lawyer to Anne Hamilton, 3rd Duchess of Hamilton, and was sited near the foot of the 'Hietoun' close to the precincts of Hamilton Palace. It is believed to be the oldest surviving building in Hamilton. To the rear of the building is an assembly room and fives court, added after the 8th Duke bought the house in 1784. The house subsequently became a coaching inn on the London to Glasgow road, until the road was realigned in the 19th century. From 1835 the inn became the Duke of Hamilton's estate offices. The building was then purchased by Hamilton Burgh Council in 1964 and subsequently made into the museum that now stands today. The second building is the former Palace Riding School, built in 1837 by Alexander Hamilton, 10th Duke of Hamilton, to designs by William Burn to replace the stables court within the Hamilton Palace complex. The Riding School building became the regimental museum of the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) in 1983. A refurbishment project in 1993 added new linking buildings and an entrance to the combined museums, which are category A listed for their national importance. Exhibits=Cameronians Museum Soldiers of the 26th (Cameronian) Regiment in 1866 The main collection on show in the museum is that of the former British Army Regiment, the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles). The Cameronians were formed on 14 May 1689, with their name being in memory of Richard Cameron, \\"The Lion of The Covenant\\", a Scottish preacher who died at the Battle of Airds Moss in 1680. The Cameronians still hold the distinction of being the only regiment in the British military to have a religious origin, with their initial recruits all being Covenanters. In 1881 the 26th (Cameronian) Regiment and the 90th Perthshire Light Infantry amalgamated to form the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles). The Cameronians were the only rifle regiment in Scotland and featured in many campaigns over their almost 300 years in military service. The Cameronians are an important part of South Lanarkshire history with the regiment being based in the county for most of their history. Rounds of cuts in the military eventually resulted in the regiment being disbanded, instead of losing its identity through an amalgamation, on 14 May 1968, bringing to an end 279 years of military history. The museum's Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) collection features many exhibits on the history of the regiment. A number of the regiment's flags and banners are on display, such as the Bluidy Banner, which Covenanting forces carried at the Battle of Bothwell Bridge in 1679. The museum also contains over 1,000 medals and awards earned by soldiers and officers from the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles), including seven Victoria Crosses. Hamilton Palace One of the most well-known displays in the Museum tells the story of one of the nation's lost treasures – Hamilton Palace. The Palace was the primary residence of the Hamilton family from at least 1591 until 1919, and was the largest non-royal residence in Britain. However, as a result of mining decline, it was demolished in the 1920s—one of the largest ever losses to Scottish national heritage. Many items from within the palace are on display, such as a large floor-to-ceiling mirror. The museum also contains many images of the Palace prior to its demolition in 1927. Coal mining Another of the museum's displays is based on coal mining. Before the late 19th century coal mining had not fully developed as an industry in Hamilton, but due to the mining boom in 1874 the prominence of coal mining in the area grew: there were 22 collieries in just the Hamilton Parish. The display in the museum looks at this period in South Lanarkshire's coal mining history and also holds a small exhibit on the Blantyre Mining Disaster of 1877 where 207 miners were killed in a firedamp explosion. This disaster is still Scotland's most fatal mining disaster to date. Agriculture Previous to the industrial revolution the primary occupation of almost all of the residents of South Lanarkshire was in agriculture. The museum's agricultural display focuses on the most famous piece of farm life in the area – the Clydesdale Horse.Hamilton District Libraries and Museum dept. (1978) Transport and farm equipment in Hamilton District Museum Weaving A very important industry in the history of Lanarkshire was weaving, and there was a weavers' loom in every cottage in every town and village throughout the area. One of the original weaving looms can be seen in the museum's Textile gallery. This gallery also holds information on the story of Hamilton's peculiar lacemaking industry, which was introduced in by Duchess Elizabeth in 1752. Ducal Buildings This displays information on the history of the remaining ducal buildings in the town, including those on the museum site—Portland, the Palace Riding School, and Hamilton Mausoleum. The exhibit on the ducal buildings describes the history of these nationally important buildings and the people who built and used them. Early Settlement in South Lanarkshire Alexander, 10th Duke of Hamilton, the subject of the exhibit 'At Home with the Duke and Duchess' One of the most unusual and interesting objects in the Museum is a 4,000-year-old Bronze Age burial. Found during sand quarrying operations at Ferniegair in the 1930s, this well-preserved skeleton represents one of the very early residents of South Lanarkshire. Previous Exhibitions The museum has held numerous temporary exhibitions. A robot exhibition in 2013 featured robotic characters from film and television, such as R2-D2 from Star Wars, the NS-5 robot from I, Robot, and a full size RoboCop costume.

Dutton Juvenile) The Smile (2008) is one of Donna Jo Napoli's young adult novels. With \\"spot-on flair for infusing history with coolness\\", Napoli details a slice of the life of Monna Elisabetta, better known as Mona Lisa. While the story is fictional, some important historical figures enter the plot: Leonardo da Vinci and members of the famous Medici family are among the few. Set in Renaissance Florence, the story follows Elisabetta as she journeys to reach the moment of da Vinci's painting, detailing the secret behind her infamous smile. Plot As a budding only daughter of a wealthy silk merchant in Renaissance Italy, Elisabetta finds herself on the brink of an inevitable arranged marriage. In the interest of conflict, Elisabetta longs for love rather than an arrangement. When she attends the funeral of one of Florence's most powerful men, Lorenzo de' Medici, she finds hope for that love. Leonardo da Vinci meets young Elisabetta at Lorenzo's funeral and declares that one day, when she is ready, he will paint her. It is Leonardo who introduces her to the son of Lorenzo, Giuliano de Medici. Giuliano nicknames her \\"Mona Lisa\\" and is responsible for bringing out her infamous smile. Through brief encounters with Giuliano, Elisabetta falls in love; but when tragedy strikes her family resulting in the death of her mother and her father's speedy remarriage, she finds herself arranged to be married to the new wife's brother-in-law. She must choose between love and duty, and learns that happy moments can be born out of the ruined ash of unfortunate circumstances. Main characters * Monna Elisabetta – is the protagonist of the tale. The story depicts her transformation into the woman with the mysterious smile and many secrets painted by Leonardo da Vinci. In the beginning of the novel Elisabetta acts as a noble young lady should: planning parties and preparing for marriage. However, right from the first line the reader learns that Elisabetta does not always do as she is expected. She enjoys spending time in the woods, but knows that times like that will not last after she enters society as a young woman ready to seek a husband. After her mother dies she becomes a hard worker dedicated to her family. She learns that sacrifices must be made for the greater good. * Giuliano de Medici – is a member of the Medici family, a historically prevalent family in Florence during the time of the Renaissance. After being introduced by Leonardo da Vinci himself, he falls in love with Elisabetta. Chaos surrounds Florence, pulling the lovers apart, sending Giuliano into exile and Elisabetta onto the path of an arranged marriage. His influence over her transforms her sense of noble Renaissance woman into something passionate, creating the smile captured by Leonardo. * Mamma – Elisabetta's mother had a great impact on her life. Her sudden death becomes the driving force for many of Elisabetta's actions in response to how a Florence woman should act. * Papa – Elisabetta's father remarries soon after her mother's death causing turmoil between the two characters. He arranges Elisabetta's marriage later in the novel. * Caterina – becomes Elisabetta's stepmother. She is nineteen years old when she becomes betrothed to Papa, near Elisabetta's age, thirteen. An estranged relationship ensues at first, but soon the girls accept their new family ties. When her sister passes away, it opens up the idea for an arranged marriage between Elisabetta and Caterina's brother-in-law. * Francesco – is brother-in-law of Caterina and eventual betrothed of Elisabetta. Francesco is twice widowed by childbirth, despite that he has one son: Barolomeo. * Bartolomeo – is the young son of Francesco. Elisabetta's love for him causes Francesco to take notice of her and request her as his wife. * Leonardo da Vinci – While he is not part of the overall plot of the novel, he is the reason for its creation. The last scene of the book depicts the conclusion of his painting, which the reader knows will become one of the most popular paintings in the world. Inspirations and History The Medici Family' The House of Medici came to power in the 13th Century. Cosimo de' Medici's rise to power is credited for bringing the Renaissance to Florence through support of the arts and humanities. Although there is much history of the ruling family, Napoli does not touch on much of it. Giuliano relays to Elisabetta that he must flee, however, history has much more to say on the matter. Piero de Medici, the head of the family at the time of the novel, met with Charles VIII of France to negotiate for Florence without informing the signoria, or the Florentine government. He agreed for the French to take possession of several castles that would aid them in their conflict with Naples, a recent ally of Florence. When the signoria found out about Piero's personal diplomacy, they called a mob to ransack the Medici Palace, causing Piero and his two brothers, Giuliano being one of them, to flee. This information added tension of Napoli's story and Giuliano's disappearance gave cause to her half-smile. The Mona Lisa The Smile refers to the woman depicted in Leonardo da Vinci's painting. Several questions surround the mysterious painting, focusing most pointedly at the debate over who the true muse was or whether she was merely an invention of da Vinci's imagination. Napoli took the most proposed muse, Lisa Gherardini and her known husband, Francesco del Giocondo, and created a story for them based on life in Florence in the late 15th Century to early 16th Century. Although it is unknown who the sitter truly was, it is known for fact that the painting was created in Florence, Italy between the years 1503-1506. In August, 2013, Researchers opened a tomb in Florence they believe may hold the remains of Lisa Gheradini. By comparing the DNA from the remains in the tomb with those of her son, the researchers hope to solidify her remains as Lisa Gheradini before creating a reconstruction of her face based on the skeletal remains. The centuries-old question may finally be close to an answer. It is the mystery that surrounds the identity of the Mona Lisa that gave rise to the creation of Napoli's novel.

This bid was cancelled on October 1, 2014, after the parliamentary caucus of the Conservative Party had voted to decline the application for funding. Already, the Progress Party, Centre Party and Socialist Left Party were opposed to the bid. Thus, it was no longer possible to get a parliamentary majority for a state guarantee. The IOC selected Beijing as the host city for the 2022 Winter Olympics from the two remaining bids at the 128th IOC Session in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on July 31, 2015. Background Holmenkollbakken, Oslo The Norwegian Olympic Committee (governed by the identical board of the Norwegian Confederation of Sports) originally planned a bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics. Three cities announced interest: Tromsø, Trondheim and Oslo. After assessing the plans and a technical evaluation, the NOC board voted 7-6 in favor of Tromsø. However, 30 September 2008 an external revision demonstrated the games would cost far more than originally suggested, the total public net cost being estimated at 19,1 billions NOK. This prompted the Norwegian Olympic Committee to withdraw the bid 6 October 2008, citing inter alia responsibility to avoid unwarranted public spending. The decision caused strong negative reactions. Then board member and later president, Børre Rognlien, recognized in 2014 that citing responsibility of public spending was unwise. In January 2010, Gerhard Heiberg, IOC member from Norway, announced that the IOC would welcome a bid from Norway to host the Winter Olympic Games. Lillehammer, host of the 1994 Winter Olympics, and the area Stavanger-Bergen-Voss were considered contenders. Tromsø also showed interest. However, Oslo was selected without much public deliberation in October 2011 after the seven major winter sports organizations decided to back the capital. There were negative reactions from several supporters of the Tromsø 2018 bid. MP Anne Marit Bjørnflaten suggested that Tromsø 2018 was cancelled not due to timing or costs, but geography. On 9 June 2012, the annual assembly of the Norwegian Confederation of Sports voted in favor of the Oslo 2022 bid with a majority of 142-15. Oslo City Council decided to hold a local public referendum on whether or not the city would move forward with the bid. This was held in Oslo on 9 September 2013. The bid was supported by a majority of 55%. Around the same time, the Socialist Left decided not to back the bid, the first political party to adopt a position on a national level.  Application for state funding and financial guarantee  The pivotal issue in pushing the bid forward was obtaining state funding and an unlimited state financial guarantee, as required by the Olympic Charter. 19 June 2013, the Norwegian Olympic Committee and Oslo had put forward their application for funding and guarantee to the Ministry of Culture (Norway). Eventually the cabinet would have to present the issue to the Norwegian parliament, Storting, as the constitution gives the parliament power of the budget. The application for state funding was put through a legally required quality assurance review. DNV GL conducted the assessment. On December 20, 2013 they presented their conclusion in which they concluded that the bid was without significant weaknesses, and that the public net costs would probably end on 21,7 billion NOK, and with 85% certainty below 25,8 billion NOK. The next step following the review of DNV GL was to have the Ministry of Culture forward the application to the parliament. Before this was executed, the bid had been withdrawn.  Applicant city phase  12 November 2013, Oslo sent their formal letter to be an \\"applicant city\\" in the bidding for the 2022 games. Oslo was joined by five other cities: Beijing, Almaty, Stockholm, Kraków and Lviv. However, Stockholm dropped out of the race two months later due to lack of local political support. Børre Rognlien had originally stated that the Norwegian Olympic Committee required public support of 60% of the population to move forward with the bid. This was also presented as a requirement from IOC. However, building public support proved hard. Just prior to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, support was lagging at 38%. Despite being a success in medals, the Sochi games was a further hit for the Oslo bid. Controversies around IOC reprimanding the Norwegian cross country skiers for wearing mourning bands, as well as general criticism concerning costs and other issues made support drop even further. Shortly after Sochi, a poll suggested that support had dropped to 32,6%. 9 March 2014, former leader of the Norwegian Confederation of Sports, Hans B. Skaset, explained how the Olympic Charter secured IOC control of the event, while leaving the financial risk with the host city. The minister of culture, Thorhild Widvey, responded by declaring that the Norwegian government would reserve itself against the relevant provisions of the Olympic Charter. Oslo sent the candidate application file March 14. The Norwegian minister of culture, Thorhild Widvey, did not - as IOC require - provide a full guarantee of respecting the Olympic Charter. Instead, Widvey wrote that their guarantee should \\"not be understood to mean that the Government has agreed to comply with all provisions of the Olympic Charter\\". However, this was withdrawn by the end of April after a short exchange of letters with the IOC, who rejected such a reservation. 4 May 2014, the Progress Party (junior coalition partner in government) voted no to provide a state financial guarantee for the Olympic bid at their annual conference. Prime Minister Erna Solberg declared the following day that this did not affect the governments assessment of whether or not to support the bid. In response to the decision of the Progress Party, Thorhild Widvey went public with her support of the bid 15 May 2014. By summer, two other applicant cities (Kraków and Lviv) had withdrawn their bids, leaving Oslo, Beijing and Almaty as the only applicant cities.  Candidate city phase and withdrawal of bid  Oslo, Beijing and Almaty were accepted as Candidate Cities by the IOC on July 7, 2014. The IOC's working group report gave Oslo the highest technical ratings of the three cities. The Norwegian capital led in eight of the 14 categories and was tied with Beijing in three. With pollings in June 2014 running as low as 29% and 24%, the requirement of 60% support, which Børre Rognlien had previously set, was retracted. During the summer, the bid was able to gain backing from key public figures: the leader of the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions, Gerd Kristiansen, as well as the leader of the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise, Kristin Skogen Lund, both went public with their support of the bid. Oslo 2022 was also supported by the Norwegian Young Conservatives. However, the youth divisions of the other seven major political parties opposed the bid. Thorhild Widvey had not informed the public that the reservation towards the Olympic Charter had been withdrawn, but this became known at the beginning of August, causing considerable adverse reactions. On 4 September 2014, in an attempt to drum up support both in public and in parliament, Oslo 2022 presented a cheaper option for hosting the Games, which would reduce the net cost to the public purse from 21,7 billion NOK to 17,4 billion NOK. However, Oslo 2022 were still standing by their original proposal and recommendations. As an alleged strategic move to establish a \\"yes\\" vote in the caucus of the Conservative Party, to facilitate the cabinet in supporting the bid, the caucus elected to discuss the bid in early October, prior to the cabinet taking a position. According to several media sources, the parliamentary caucus had a solid majority in favor of the bid at this point. However, in the last couple of days leading up to the deliberation in the Conservative Party, there was a series of negative developments for the bid, including: the Centre Party saying \\"no\\" through a grass root vote; a poll showing that even within the Norwegian Confederation of Sports, the majority of members opposed the bid; and an external revision which clarified that the revised cheaper budget was unrealistic. The most damaging development was the public scrutiny of the IOC's 7000 pages of requirements. An exposé by the Norwegian tabloid Verdens Gang allegedly revealed extravagant hospitality demands made by the IOC. They included a cocktail reception with the royal family with drinks paid for by them or the organizing committee, the provision of road lanes exclusively for use by IOC members, and priority treatment at airports and hotels being used by IOC members. Several commentators pointed out that such demands were unheard of in a western democracy, while Slate described them as being \\"diva-like\\". The discussions of the caucus were held in private, after which the parliamentary leader Trond Helleland explained that the caucus was divided roughly down the middle. The conclusion of the caucus was that this was not an adequate basis for moving forward with the bid, hence their recommendation to the cabinet was to reject the application for a state guarantee and state funding. Various members of the Conservative Party cited lack of public support and enthusiasm, high costs and unreasonable IOC demands as the main reasons for the caucus' negative decision. The conclusion meant that a majority of the members of parliament were now opposed to the bid, leading Oslo 2022 to withdraw its application for state funding and financial guarantee. No single party had supported the bid at the national level, but the Labour Party (Norway), Liberal Party (Norway) and Christian Democratic Party (Norway) remained undecided throughout the process.  Aftermath  Immediately following the bid withdrawal, IOC released a statement on Oslo 2022 calling it a \\"missed opportunity\\" for Norway. The statement also included strong criticism of the bid leadership and government, claiming that \\"neither a senior member of the bid team nor a government official\\" attended a meeting held by IOC to clarify important issues concerning the games. IOC claimed \\"senior politicians in Norway appear not to have been properly briefed on the process and were left to take their decisions on the basis of half-truths and factual inaccuracies\\". Bid chair Stian Berger Røsland rejected these claims, calling IOC \\"arrogant\\". Thorhild Widvey dubbed the IOC claims as \\"very sensational\\", stating that the IOCs claims were not genuine. \\"We have not been invited to a meeting\\", Widvey added. Conservative MP Svein Harberg, a prominent supporter of the bid, commented the attack from IOC stating \\"I was quite shocked about this at first (...) I was angry when I looked at it. But now I realize that it just shows we made the right decision.\\" The Oslo City Council was presented with an evaluation of the bid process December 2014. CEO of Oslo 2022, Eli Grimsby, presented the evaluation with the main conclusion that the distance between the spirit of the Norwegian people and the olympic movement was too large. Grimsby further stated that the major challenges were in connection with the Host City Contract, which she labelled unbalanced, and as putting too much a burden on the host city. The Norwegian Confederation of Sports also initiated an evaluation on its own. The results were presented 25 March 2015. The evaluation concluded among other things that the bid suffered from poor communication, bad organization, and lack of support on the grass root level of the sporting confederation.  Technical details of the bid = Financial details  In the application for state funding and financial guarantee, Oslo 2022 calculated gross total costs at 33,7 billion NOK. The external quality control review increased the estimate to up to 35,1 billion NOK with 50% certainty, and up to 41,0 billion NOK with 85% certainty. Those numbers may not accurately reflect what would have been the final number. Generally, the Norwegian quality control system have shown a bias at underestimating costs. In addition, a study at Saïd Business School showed that the Olympics had a 100 percent consistency of cost overruns in the period 1960-2012, with the average cost overrun in real terms at 179%. In the period 1999-2012, the average cost overrun is lower, in real terms at 47%. The 21,7 billion net cost was based on 7 700 million NOK in income, and a total of 29 360 million NOK in public expenditure. The public expenditure included an organizational budget for the organizational committee of 17 510 million NOK, of which 2 800 million NOK was costs of renting the olympic village, media center and media village. 5 070 million NOK were budgeted spent on construction investment. 2 050 million NOK were budgeted in non-organization committee operational costs. 1 330 million NOK were budgeted to cover wage increases, while 3 420 million NOK were set aside to cover uncertainty of cost overruns. DNV GL also conducted a socio-economical assessment, concluding that for the economy overall the games overall led to a negative net result of 15 890 million NOK in monetary terms. Of the positive non-monetary effects, enjoyable events and the predicted nationwide enthusiasm was considered the most significant. Non-monetary effects aside, the games would leave a legacy with a socio-economical worth of 2,45 billion NOK. This included mainly sporting venues (1 100 million NOK), infrastructure improvement (510 million NOK) and investment in security equipment (660 million NOK). Aside from the legacy, the difference between the public net cost of 21,7 billion NOK and the overall negative net result of 15,89 billion NOK consisted mainly of discounting the future cost to present value (3 930 million NOK) and positive effects for the tourism industry valued at 1 780 million NOK. The review considered the socio-economic costs of tax financing the event to 3 000 million NOK. The effects for the tourism industry were contested in the public debate, as research gives little support of a correlation between hosting the olympics and increased tourism.Olympic Games Impact (OGI) Study for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games: Post Games Report (23 October 2013), University of British Columbia, Olympic Games Impact (OGI) Study In the socio- economical assessment, the quality control review removed an alleged 4,9 billion NOK in positive effects of improved health in the population, finding no basis for the claim that hosting the olympics increases physical activity in the population.  Venues  The Oslo 2022 proposal included existing venues around Oslo itself, with a goal of hosting as many events as possible, including snow events, within Oslo's city limits. Certain Alpine events would be held in Lillehammer, which had hosted the 1994 Winter Olympics. Several new venues would also be constructed, and Valle Hovin would be renovated into an indoor arena.Games in the City The following is the list of proposed venues for both the \\"Oslo Zone\\" and \\"Lillehammer Zone\\".Venues ;Oslo Area * Wyllerløypa – snowboarding * Grefsenkollen – freestyle, snowboarding * New arena in Stubberud – ice hockey * Jordal Amfi – ice hockey * Valle Hovin (renovated) – speed skating * New arena in Lørenskog – curling * Telenor Arena – figure skating and short track * Holmenkollen – Nordic skiing * Grønmo/Huken – biathlon ;Lillehammer Area * Kvitfjell – alpine skiing * Hafjell – alpine skiing * Hunderfossen – bobsleigh, luge, skeleton  Accommodation  IOC requires 23,300 beds for accredited people (such as participants, leaders, journalists). This requirement is a little more than the hotel overall capacity of Oslo, Lillehammer and their surrounding areas. Since spectators and other Olympic-related visitors would have to be accommodated, more rooms would be needed. As a result, there were plans to arrange for their to temporarily be at least an additional 3,000 beds for visitors.  Transport  Olympic visitors would arrive at Oslo Airport, which receives intercontinental flights. Road and rail connections to all venues in the Lillehammer area would be provided, including a four-lane motorway between Oslo and Lillehammer (route E6). Previous bids Oslo bid to host the 1932 and 1944 Winter Olympics but lost to Lake Placid and Cortina d'Ampezzo respectively (the 1944 games were cancelled because of World War II). Oslo went on to successfully bid to host the 1952 Winter Olympics. The city later bid to host the 1968 Winter Olympics but lost to Grenoble. Previous bids from other Norwegian cities Lillehammer bid to host the 1992 Winter Olympics but lost to Albertville. Lillehammer successfully bid to host the 1994 Winter Olympics. The city also bid to host the 2012 Winter Youth Olympics but failed to become a candidate (the games were ultimately awarded to Innsbruck). Lillehammer went on to submit an uncontested bid for the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics.

Charles I King Charles I created several knights banneret after the battle of Edgehill (1642) including: *Thomas Strickland, of Sizergh for gallantry. *John Smith for rescuing the Royal Standard under enemy fire. Great Britain and the United Kingdom Whether any appointments as knight banneret were formally made after the Act of Union 1707 is debated by historians and there is no general agreement. George II George Cokayne notes in The Complete Peerage (1913) that King George II revived the honour when he created sixteen knights banneret on the field of the battle of Dettingen on 27 June 1743: Although Cokayne's source for this, a diary entry by Miss Gertrude Savile, states \\"This honour had been laid aside since James I, when Baronets were instituted\\", which contradicts other sources, a news magazine published in the same year as the battle recorded the honours. George III Several sources, including Edward Brenton (1828) and William James (1827), record that Captains Trollope and Fairfax were honoured as bannerets by King George III for their actions during the battle of Camperdown (1797). However, these awards were never recorded in The London Gazette and is much more likely that these knighthoods, which first appear in formal records in December 1797 without their nature being specified, were as knights bachelor. Victoria On 19 August 1843 James Bombrain, Inspector-General of Coast Guard in Ireland (knighted by the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, on board a cruiser in Kingstown Harbour, after an inspection of the Irish squadron of revenue cruisers at Kingstown, Dublin, is erroneously supposed to have been a knight banneret in consequence of having been knighted under the Royal Standard).

It later changed its name to Adalah-NY: The Coalition for Justice in the Middle East. In February 2010, Adalah-NY merged with the New York Campaign for the Boycott of Israel (NYCBI). The latter group was established in response to Israel's Operation Cast Lead, which took place in December 2008 and January 2009. NYCBI's founders were activists from various organizations who came together to support the boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement. In March 2009, NYCBI launched a boycott campaign against Motorola, which develops products for the Israeli Army. Adalah-NY founder Riham Barghouti explained, “This merger will allow boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) activists in New York City to combine their resources and work more effectively at promoting BDS in New York, the US, and worldwide.” Following the merger, the organization’s name changed from Adalah- NY: The Coalition for Justice in the Middle East to Adalah-NY: The New York Campaign for the Boycott of Israel. Views Adalah-NY describes itself as “a local, grassroots, non-hierarchical volunteer-only group of concerned individuals that advocates for justice, equality, and human rights for the Palestinian people through educational activities and campaign-building. Adalah-NY organizes in support of the 2005 call by Palestinian civil society organizations to maintain non-violent means of protest -- including boycotts, divestment, and sanctions...\\" ” The organization calls for Israel to meet “its obligation to recognize the Palestinian people's inalienable right to self-determination and fully compl[y] with the precepts of international law by: Ending its occupation and colonization of all Arab lands and dismantling the Wall; Recognizing the fundamental rights of the Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel to full equality; and Respecting, protecting and promoting the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and properties as stipulated in UN resolution 194.” It also “affirm[s] the right of all people to resist occupation and oppression.” Adalah-NY holds the United States responsible for “Israeli aggression,” which it describes as being “inseparably tied to the United States' illegal occupation of Iraq and larger U.S. strategies for hegemony in the region.” Adalah-NY maintains that Israel practices a policy of apartheid and ethnic cleansing, and describes the West Bank as being “carved into isolated cantons, akin to the Bantustans under South African apartheid, to which Palestinians are confined.” It further holds that Palestinian citizens of Israel are “second-class citizens” who “are systematically discriminated against by Israeli laws, courts, and society.” In the view of Adalah-NY, “Israeli policy has been the root of violence in the region for 60 years.” When the IDF raided a Gaza tunnel built to kidnap Israeli soldiers, Adalah-NY called the raid “unprovoked.” It employs the slogans “Zionism = racism,” “stop the genocide,” and “Israeli defense forces = war criminals.” Adalah-NY criticized the FBI for issuing subpoenas for persons suspected of supporting terrorist groups. Activism Adalah-NY believes that BDS is the “most effective non-violent and morally consistent means for achieving justice and genuine peace in the region....Like the global movement against apartheid in South Africa, the BDS movement takes as its task the organization of grassroots efforts to pressure institutions to hold Israel accountable.” Adalah-NY has held street protests and organized “cultural events, political forums, and other political events.” In addition, it has participated with other groups in various events, including Israeli Apartheid Week in New York City. In 2010, Adalah-NY condemned the Arava Institute for Environmental Studies for not focusing on “the fundamental and systematic inequalities that are at the root of the conflict,” and urged such celebrities as Pete Seeger and Mandy Patinkin to bow out of an Arava-sponsored event. At a 2011 Adalah-NY protest against Point Lookout Capital Partners, which facilitates investment in tear-gas supplier Combined Systems, activists “collapsed motionless on the sidewalk” following a “mock tear-gassing by an actor dressed as an Israeli soldier.” In 2011 Adalah-NY joined a campaign against the pension fund TIAA-CREF, which had been begun by Jewish Voice for Peace. The campaign “calls for TIAA-CREF to divest from companies supporting and profiting from Israeli apartheid, violations of international law, and human rights abuses, such as Elbit, Caterpillar, Motorola, Northrop Grumman and Veolia.” Adalah-NY led a July 2012 protest against TIAA-CREF. As part of its cultural boycott, Adalah-NY organized and participated in a 2011 multi- city protest of concerts by India Arie and Idan Raichel. Idan Raichel is an Israeli recording artist famous for his multi-cultural approach, which prominently features voices from Israel’s Ethiopian community. Also in 2011, Adalah-NY organized a panel for Israeli Apartheid Week featuring Judith Butler and John Greyson. Entitled “How Now? Media, Politics and Queer Activism,” the panel focused on the cultural and academic boycotts and the importance of queer BDS activism in Palestine and elsewhere. Adalah-NY organized a protest when the Israeli Philharmonic performed in New York City on February 22, 2011. It also helped coordinate protests nationwide at locations where the IPO played. Adalah-NY posted a YouTube video in 2011 of its activists performing a flash mob at Grand Central Station to Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believin’,” with special lyrics decrying the Israeli Occupation. When the video, which commemorated Palestinian Land Day and called on Americans to boycott Israel, was removed by YouTube on grounds of copyright infringement, Hannah Mermelstein of Adalah-NY said, “We are dismayed that our video has been removed from YouTube and are working to make it available again. We fear that this is but another example of attempts to silence calls for justice and Palestinian rights. But the BDS movement to hold Israel accountable for its crimes against Palestinians will not be silenced.” It also organized a protest against Israeli Batsheva Dance Company’s March 2012 performance at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Protesters handed audience members fake programs calling the dance company a “cultural ambassador for Israel.” Earlier, Adalah- NY had written to BAM asking that it cancel Batsheva's performance. After the 2012 Operation Pillar of Defense, Adalah-NY organized a protest against General Electric, which provides engines for Israeli military aircraft and helicopters. The protest was cosponsored by other groups, including Jewish Voice for Peace-NY, Jews Say No!, NYU Students for Justice in Palestine, and Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine]. In 2012, Adalah-NY “established a dedicated social media team to amplify our presence on Facebook and Twitter.” It also organized “teach-ins,” one of them, on July 15, with Havaar, an Iranian organization that opposes both Iranian state repression and U.S. sanctions against Iran. Campaign against Lev Leviev Adalah-NY has especially targeted Israeli jeweler Lev Leviev, chairman of the conglomerate Africa Israel Investments, whose Danya Cebus division is involved in constructing West Bank settlements. Adalah-NY considers him guilty of stealing Palestinian land. According to Adalah-NY, it “began its campaign against the Israeli diamond magnate and settlement builder Lev Leviev in 2007. Adalah-NY says that this campaign has had a number of successes, with governments, investment banks, celebrities, and international aid agencies distancing themselves from Leviev and his company Africa-Israel.” According to Adalah-NY, as a result of pressure by Jews against the Occupation-NYC and Adalah-NY, several celebrities, including Salma Hayek, Halle Berry, Drew Barrymore, Brooke Shields, Andie MacDowell, Lucy Liu, Whitney Houston, and Sharon Stone, asked in 2008 that their pictures be removed from Leviev's website, on which they were depicted wearing Leviev jewelry. When Oxfam was announced in 2008 as the beneficiary of a donation by photographer Timothy White, whose use of borrowed Leviev diamonds in a photo shoot had led Leviev to describe himself as an Oxfam supporter, Adalah-NY pressured Oxfam to publicly distance itself from Leviev. Oxfam accordingly issued a statement to the effect that “Leviev...is not an Oxfam supporter or partner and may not claim to be one....we are not and never will be partners or beneficiaries of Leviev.” Also in response to pressure from Adalah-NY, UNICEF decided in 2008 to refuse contributions from Leviev, who had contributed to UNICEF and sponsored at least one UNICEF fundraiser. “I can confirm that UNICEF has advised Adalah in New York that it will not be entering into any partnerships or accepting financial contributions from Lev Leviev or his corporate people,” Chris de Bono, a senior adviser to the executive director of UNICEF, said. Richard A. Marin, a 25-year trustee of CARE USA, was forced in 2010 to leave the board following a campaign by Adalah-NY. Marin was chief executive of Africa Israel Investments USA, a subsidiary of Africa Israel Investments, which, according to a CARE statement, was “connected to building settlements in the West Bank in violation of international law.” Marin protested that he had no influence on the activities of Africa Israel Investments. In November 2010, Leviev succumbed to Adalah-NY's pressure, and Africa Israel announced that it was suspending construction projects in the West Bank. Still, Adalah-NY continued to focus on Leviev. In 2011,” according to Adalah-NY, “we continued to place pressure on Leviev to end his settlement construction activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, with a focus on Leviev’s Leader Management and Development’s continued settlement construction on the lands of Jayyous.” In 2011, Adalah-NY sent a letter, along with two other groups, to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, urging the charity to “to return all funds received from [Leviev's] LVD Foundation and sever any ties to the Foundation and Lev Leviev.” In June 2012, Adalah-NY released photos indicating that Africa Israel was involved in building projects in Gilo, a neighborhood in Jerusalem. Whether or not it is a “settlement” is a matter of debate, as the neighborhood is wholly contained in the Jerusalem municipality. Caroling The group is especially known for organizing protests at Christmas time in which the participants sing parodies of Christmas and Hannukah carols. In December 2012, the sixth time that Adalah-NY arranged the annual event, eighty carolers sang in front of a Madison Avenue jewelry store owned by Leviev. The parody songs included “Buy Yourself a Merry Little Tchotchke,” “Leviev the Two-Faced Magnate,” and “Whitewashing,” set to the tune of “White Christmas.” Praise from Mondoweiss In 2010, Rebecca Vilkomerson, Executive Director of the organization Jewish Voice for Peace, nominated Adalah-NY for the Mondo Awards, presented by the Mondoweiss website to activists focusing on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Funding Although Adalah-NY has been described by the pro-Israeli organization NGO Monitor as not financially transparent, its website declares that its “financial sponsor” is Wespac, a 501 (c) (3) organization that is based in Westchester County, New York, and that also financially sponsors Israeli Apartheid Week. Adalah-NY posts annual program and financial reports on its website. Because Wespac claims tax exemption as an education sponsor but finances political activism, some have questioned the legality of its filings. Wespac is led by Nada Khader, a Palestinian woman who has been living in the U.S. since childhood. A frequent speaker at campuses across the U.S., she has accused Hollywood of making “over 700” films “that portray my [Arab] community in a derogatory manner....Why? To justify American policy in our region [the Middle East].” References Category:Boycotts of Israel ","title":"Adalah-NY"},{"id":"41009046","text":"Darwin drift – at the end of the animation – due to the passage of a rigid sphere, according to potential flow theory. The dark blue line is a timeline: a line of fluid parcels followed in time and deformed by the passage of the sphere. The timeline passes through the symmetry axis of the flow. The orange dots are drifters connected by a pathline, i.e. the path that individual fluid parcels follow when the sphere passes by. Note that fluid parcels may also move upward during the passage of the body. A larger version of this animation can be found here (15 MB), showing e.g. streamlines. In fluid dynamics, Darwin drift refers to the phenomenon that a fluid parcel is permanently displaced after the passage of a body through a fluid – the fluid being at rest far away from the body. Consider a plane of fluid parcels perpendicular to the direction of the body's constant velocity vector, far before the passage of the body. During the passage of the body the fluid parcels move, according to their Lagrangian motion. Far after the passage of the body, the fluid parcels are permanently displaced. The volume between the initial plane of the fluid parcels and the surface consisting of the parcel positions long after the body's passage is called the Darwin drift volume. The phenomenon is named after Sir Charles Galton Darwin, who proved in 1953 that the drift volume multiplied with the fluid density equals the added mass of the body, – known as Darwin's theorem. As shown by Eames and McIntyre in 1999, Darwin drift (by the passage of a body through a fluid otherwise at rest) and Stokes drift (in the fluid motion associated with surface waves) are closely related.

He will always be remembered for masterminding a great victory for the Glen over hot favourites Kilcar in the county final of 2016… and his attention to detail has always been quite forensic\\". Club While overseeing Glenswilly, he has led that team to two Donegal Senior Football Championships (2011 and 2013). They also won the 2013 All-County Football League Division Two title. He took a year off in 2012. He was part of Michael Canning's backroom team in 2016 as Glenswilly won their third county title. County McDaid publicly criticised the county board in 2011. He has been involved in coaching Donegal underage squads and has worked under the leadership of Joe McBrearty with Donegal's under-21 football team. In December 2014, it was announced that McDaid had joined the Donegal senior county team as a selector under the stewardship of Rory Gallagher. This coincided with introduction of Eamon Ward and Joe Gibbons from his home club Glenswilly, as well as the return of Gary McFadden, who had opted out in 2013. He stayed for one season. In October 2015, he stood aside from the role, citing family commitments. In 2016, McDaid hit out a people sitting in armchairs. He was particularly sensitive to the criticism of Glenswilly when his club had ground out a win on a score of 3 points against the 2 points to which they had limited their opponents. \\"We'd 14 wides, five dropped short and we scored three... I saw a lot of stuff on social media that it's the end of football and [other stuff] about mass defences\\", McDaid told Gaelic Life. McDaid was considered a leading contender to succeed Gallagher as Donegal senior manager, though Declan Bonner accepted the post. In November 2017, McDaid was ratified as the first manager of the new Donegal under-20 football team. Eamon McGee, Francie Friel and Brian Roper completed his back-room team. He carried on in 2018, developing players such as Jason McGee and Odhrán McFadden Ferry for Bonner's main team. But he gave up — unexpectedly — and, admitting \\"results had not been as good as they had hoped\\" (shifting the emphasis of blame onto others), announced his resignation in an interview he gave to Highland Radio on 28 September 2019. For him to complete his expected third year at the helm, McDaid would have had to \\"face an interview\\", the thought of which was too much for him. Referee McDaid is also a referee. Personal life McDaid teaches PE at St Eunan's College to Transition Year students, as well as the new Leaving Certificate PE course which the College is currently piloting. McDaid has also been part of various Gaelic football teams during his time at St Eunan's, most notably hitching on the back of the MacLarnon Cup-winning team of 2014 after they reached the final. As well as teaching, McDaid is an avid runner. His most noted achievement occurred when he broke the 20-minute barrier for five kilometres in the annual Glenswilly GAA 5k Road Race. The entire parish of \\"The Glen\\" came to a standstill as McDaid strode through the gates of Glenswilly GAA to complete the race.

It contained a majority proposal for a Plan of Partition into two independent states with Economic Union (CHAPTER VI) and a minority proposal for a Plan for one Federal union with Jerusalem as its capital (CHAPTER VII). The majority plan was supported by 8 of the 11 members, with Iran, India and Yugoslavia voting against. The Zionist side accepted the Plan of Partition while the Arab side rejected both proposals. Following release of the report, the Ad Hoc Committee on the Palestinian Question was appointed by the General Assembly. On 29 November 1947 the General Assembly adopted Resolution 181, based on the UNSCOP majority plan (with only slight modifications to the proposed recommendations).UNITED NATIONS: General Assembly: A/RES/181(II): 29 November 1947: Retrieved 10 May 2012 History On 15 May 1947, the General Assembly established the \\"United Nations Special Committee on Palestine\\" (UNSCOP). The Special Committee was given wide powers to ascertain and record facts, to investigate all questions and issues relevant to the problem of Palestine, and to make recommendations. It was authorized to conduct investigations in Palestine and wherever it might deem useful.ST/DPI/SER.A/47: Background Paper No. 47 , 20 April 1949] Members of UNSCOP 1947 It was decided that the committee should be composed of \\"neutral\\" countries, excluding the five permanent members of the Security Council, including the Mandatory power.It was urged that the special interests of the Great Powers meant that they would not be impartial and that their inclusion in the committee might result in political discussions which would delay its work, that the committee must not only be impartial but must also give the impression of being impartial. It was also felt that the United Kingdom as the Mandatory was an interested party and should not therefore sit on the committee. The Committee's final composition was: Australia, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Guatemala, India, Iran, Netherlands, Peru, Sweden, Uruguay and Yugoslavia.A/RES/106 (S-1)15 May 1947: Creation of the Committee: Retrieved 18 April 2012 Work of the Committee UNSCOP arrived in Palestine on 16 June 1947. While the Jewish Agency and the Jewish National Council cooperated with UNSCOP in its deliberations, the Arab Higher Committee charged UNSCOP with being pro-Zionist, and decided to boycott it. It announced a one-day general strike to protest its arrival, and Arab opposition figures were threatened with death if they spoke to UNSCOP. The Arab public was warned against making any contact whatsoever with UNSCOP and Arab journalists were prohibited from covering their visit. UNSCOP first heard evidence from two British representatives and the head of the Jewish Agency's Political Department, Moshe Shertok, who submitted documents and were questioned by the committee's members.Report of UNSCOP - 1947 From 18 June to 3 July, the committee visited Jerusalem, Haifa, the Dead Sea, Hebron, Beersheba, Gaza, Jaffa, the Galilee, Tel Aviv, Acre, Nablus, Bayt Dajan, Tulkarm, Rehovot, Arab and Jewish settlements in the Negev, and several Jewish agricultural settlements. When visiting Jewish areas, committee members were warmly welcomed, often with flowers and cheering crowds. When the committee visited Tel Aviv, a public holiday was declared.A State is Born in Palestine, New York Times The streets were decorated with flags and posters and crowds surrounded the delegates during their tour of the city. They met Tel Aviv mayor Israel Rokach, dining with him at a cafe and visiting city hall. During their visit to city hall, they were invited to step on to the balcony, at which point the crowd below sang Hatikvah. Jewish Agency officials also ensured that they met with Jews who spoke the native languages of committee members such as Swedish, Dutch, Spanish, and Persian. Committee members were given presentations arguing the Jewish case translated into their native languages. They were shown Jewish industry and commerce, agricultural innovations to allow farming in Jewish agricultural settlements in arid regions, and various institutions including Hadassah Medical Center, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and the laboratories of the Daniel Sieff Institute. During the committee's visit, it was accompanied by Jewish Agency officials acting as liaisons: Abba Eban, David Horowitz, and Moshe Tov. By contrast, committee members were ignored and faced hostility in Arab areas. During UNSCOP visits to Arab areas, they were often met with empty streets, as well as locals who refused to answer their questions and even fled restaurants when they arrived. In one instance, when committee members visited a school in Beersheba, the pupils were instructed not to look at the visitors. During a visit to an Arab village in the Galilee, the entire population was evacuated except for children who remained behind and cursed at the visitors. UNSCOP members were deeply impressed by the cleanliness and modernity of Jewish areas, in comparison to the dirtiness and what they viewed as the backwardness of Arab areas. They were particularly horrified by the common sight of child labor and exploitation in Arab factories and workshops. UNSCOP officials clandestinely met with members of the high command of the Haganah, the main Jewish underground militia. The Haganah officials who attended the meeting, Yisrael Galili, Yigael Yadin, Yosef Avidar, and Ehud Avriel, insisted that the Haganah could repel any Arab attack, including by the surrounding Arab states. UNSCOP also met twice with commanders from the right-wing Zionist guerrilla group Irgun after arranging contact with the Irgun through an Associated Press correspondent. In the first meeting, UNSCOP members met Irgun commander Menachem Begin along with Irgun high command members Haim Landau and Shmuel Katz, while in the second meeting they met with Begin and Irgun official Meir Cahan. As a result of these meetings, committee member Emil Sandström predicted that in any war the Yishuv would defeat the Arabs and gain most of Palestine. It then held 12 public hearings from 4 to 17 July, during which 31 representatives from 12 Jewish organizations gave testimony and submitted written depositions, totaling thirty-two tons of material. Jewish Agency representatives such as David Ben- Gurion, Moshe Sharett, and Abba Eban testified, along with Chaim Weizmann, a former senior Zionist official who held no office at the particular time and testified as a private citizen. Zionist leaders argued for a Jewish state in Palestine and accepted the principle of partition. Anti-Zionist Jewish representatives from the Palestine Communist Party and Ichud party were included.R. Judah Magnes Urges U.N. Committee to Recommend Bi-national State in PalestineMunists Ask Independent Jewish-arab State in Testimony Before U.N. Probers British officials also testified before the committee. During the hearings, the Haganah's intelligence branch SHAI conducted an extensive operation to eavesdrop on committee members so as to ensure that Zionist leaders would be better prepared for the hearings. Microphones were placed in their hotels and conference rooms, their telephone conversations were tapped, and the cleaning staff of the building that the hearings took place was replaced with female SHAI agents who monitored them while posing as cleaning ladies. The intelligence gathered was then distributed among Jewish leaders, who were instructed to destroy the documents after reading them. This did not go unnoticed: a member of the Swedish delegation remarked that the cleaning staff of the building was \\"too pretty and educated. They are the eyes and ears of the Zionist leaders, who come to hearings with replies prepared in advance.\\" Despite the official Arab boycott, several Arab officials and intellectuals privately met committee members to argue for a unitary Arab- majority state, among them AHC member and former Jerusalem mayor Husayn al- Khalidi. The committee also received written arguments from Arab advocates. The committee also met British officials. Some argued that the ideal solution would be to set up two autonomous Jewish and Arab states, and allowing Britain to manage the finances of the two states due to the economic difficulties of partition, and allowing Britain to retain a military presence in Palestine due to the growing threat from the Soviet Union. British military officials in particular emphasized the need for a continued British military presence in light of worsening relations between Britain and Egypt, arguing that bases in Palestine and continued control over Haifa harbor were essential for the defense of the Middle East. UNSCOP members were shown new British Army barracks being constructed in the Negev (which would never be completed), and were told that this would be the future basing area for British troops in the Suez Canal zone. The Committee also noted the intense security and draconian laws in Palestine as a result of the ongoing Jewish insurgency conducted mainly by the Irgun and Lehi and to a lesser extent the Haganah. UNSCOP members noticed the constant presence of armed British security forces and armored cars in the streets, barbed wire around entire blocks of buildings, abundant pillboxes and roadblocks, and constant security checks in the streets. In addition, the Emergency Regulations imposed by the British, which allowed for detentions, confiscations, and deportations as well as trials before military rather than civil courts with no right to counsel, as well as the admission of Henry Gurney, the Chief Secretary of Palestine, that the Palestine administration was spending nearly $30 million a year for police purposes, as well as the British insistence that their officials appear before UNSCOP hearings in private and a demand that they be informed in advance about who would be giving testimony, also left a negative impression. Guatemalan delegate Jorge García Granados referred to the Palestine Mandate as a \\"police state.\\" On June 16, the day of UNSCOP's first formal hearing, a British military court sentenced three Irgun fighters, Avshalom Haviv, Meir Nakar, and Yaakov Weiss, to death for their role in the Acre Prison break. UNSCOP appealed to the British government through UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie to spare their lives. The British refused, and were outraged at what they viewed as the committee's interference in the internal judicial affairs of the Mandate. Later, the Irgun captured two British sergeants and held them as hostages, threatening to kill them if the death sentences were carried out. Committee members discussed the sergeants when meeting with Begin, and refused an Irgun request to call Haviv, Nakar, and Weiss to testify before them over allegations of torture.Bell, Bowyer J. Terror out of Zion UNSCOP also followed the events surrounding the SS Exodus, an illegal immigration ship carrying 4,554 Jewish Holocaust survivors which was intercepted by the Royal Navy. Some Committee members were present at the port of Haifa and witnessed British soldiers violently removing resisting passengers from the ship so they could be deported back to Europe. The committee completed its work in Palestine by hearing the eyewitness testimony of the Reverend John Stanley Grauel,http://www.palyam.org/Hahapala/Teur_haflagot/John_the_Priest.pdf who was on the Exodus, convinced UNSCOP to reverse an earlier decision. The Committee decided to hear the testimony of the Jewish refugees in British detention camps in Palestine and in European Displaced Persons camps trying to gain admittance to Palestine.The Birth of Israel The Drama as I Saw it, by Jorge Garcia Granados, Guatemalan Ambassador, Alfred Knopf, 1949 Golda Meir, later Prime Minister of Israel, observed that Reverend Grauel's testimony and advocacy for the creation of the Jewish state fundamentally and positively changed the United Nations to support the creation of Israel.\\"There was great gratification for me in knowing that my eyewitness report was now a matter of record. Inherent in the nature of the relationship between Christians and Jews was the fact that because I was a Christian, in this situation my testimony would be given greater credence than that of a Jewish crew member.\\" pg.90 On July 21, the committee traveled to Lebanon, where they met with Lebanese Prime Minister Riad al-Solh and Foreign Minister Hamid Frangieh, who demanded an end to further Jewish immigration and the establishment of an Arab government in Palestine and claimed that the Zionists had territorial ambitions in Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. On July 23, the representatives of Arab League states testified before the committee in Sofar. Frangieh told the committee that Jews \\"illegally\\" in Palestine would be expelled while the situation of those \\"legally\\" in Palestine but without Palestinian citizenship would be resolved by a future Arab government. Efforts by UNSCOP members to get other Arab diplomats to soften their stance failed, with one committee member noting that \\"there is nothing more extreme than meeting all the representatives of the Arab world in one group... when each one tries to show that he is more extreme than the other. Privately, the committee met with pro-Zionist Maronite Christian leaders, who told them that Lebanese Christians supported partition. Half of the committee's members then flew to Amman to meet with King Abdullah of Transjordan, who claimed that the Arabs would have \\"difficulty\\" accepting partition but refused to completely rule it out, hinting that in such an event, the Arab parts of Palestine should go to Transjordan. UNSCOP then flew to Geneva, and on August 8, a subcommittee began a week-long tour of displaced persons camps in American and British occupation zones in Germany and Austria, and interviewed Jewish refugees and local military officials. They found that there was a strong desire to immigrate to Palestine among the Jewish DPs. In Geneva, while writing the report, the committee was subject to Jewish, Arab, and British pressure. Zionist representatives vigorously lobbied the committee. They repeatedly submitted memoranda and recruited a Palestinian Arab representative whose father had been murdered by the Husseini clan that dominated the Palestinian Arab community to argue in favor of a Jewish- Transjordanian partition of the country before the committee. The Arab League liaison submitted a memorandum demanding a solution satisfactory to the Palestinian Arabs, threatening catastrophe would result otherwise. The British submitted a memorandum arguing partition was a feasible option.Morris, Benny: 1948: A History of the First Arab-Israeli War Ad hoc committee deliberations The unanimous decision of the UNSCOP was for the termination of the mandate. The Ad Hoc Committee on the Palestinian Question was appointed by the General Assembly, and two plans were drawn up for the Governance of Palestine on the termination of the Mandate. Seven members of the UNSCOP endorsed a partition plan (the Majority report) favoured by the Zionist leadership on 2 October 1947. Members *Australia **John Hood, representative **S. L.

Synopsis Robert Wilson and the Civil Wars is an in-depth documentation of Robert Wilson’s ambitious attempt to stage an epic, twelve-hour, multinational opera for the 1984 Summer Olympics. Filmmaker Howard Brookner follows the avant-garde theatre director as he confronts a hectic work schedule, funding difficulties and relentless international travel in attempt to complete his preparations. The film examines Wilson’s unique theatrical style during The Civil Wars: A Tree Is Best Measured When It Is Down, which involves the continual creation of evocative stage sets, owing to a unique juxtaposition of movement, sound, text and image. Known for his precise, painterly images Wilson’s work derives more from visual art than the orthodox literary traditions of theatre. As a result, Wilson often challenges actors to perform in a boldly minimalist style, as well as collaborating with non-actors, such as young autistic poet Christopher Knowles in Einstein on the Beach. Cast * Robert Wilson * Philip Glass * Heiner Müller * Lucinda Childs * Sheryl Sutton * Ingrid Andree * Bénédicte Pesle * Gavin Bryars * Michel Guy * Isabel Eberstadt * Christopher Knowles Production Like Howard Brookner’s earlier film Burroughs: The Movie, Robert Wilson and the Civil Wars features unique access to its subject, as well as an impressive host of interviewees, including Wilson’s long-term composer Philip Glass, Heiner Müller, Lucinda Childs, Sheryl Sutton, Ingrid Andree, Bénédicte Pesle, Gavin Bryars, Michel Guy, Isabel Eberstadt and Christopher Knowles. Howard Brookner also narrates part of the film himself, which he shot on 16mm in Minneapolis, Rome, Rotterdam, Cologne, Tokyo and Marseille. The film originally screened in avant-garde and cinema festivals, as well as on public television in the US, on the BBC in the UK and ZDF in Germany.

It has illuminated the town's dockyard and a berthed battleship (marked with an 'A'). The silhouette of one of the attacking Avro Lancaster bombers can be seen A photoflash bomb, or flash bomb, is explosive ordnance dropped by aircraft, usually military surveillance aircraft, designed to detonate above ground to create an extremely bright flash of light. These bombs, which are capable of producing light at an intensity of up to hundreds of millionsU.S. Explosive Ordnance of candlepower, assist surveillance aircraft in taking nighttime aerial photos without the need to fly low to the ground which would make it vulnerable to possible enemy detection. Due to the advent of better nighttime optics, satellite imagery, and stealth aircraft, these bombs are no longer used by the military. Construction There were several models of photoflash bombs, but most had a similar construction and makeup. For example, the M23A1 was constructed of a cardboard tube, capped on both ends with metal \\"plugs.\\" The tube was then filled with a flash powder \\"charge\\" and a fuse. The fuse would be attached to the hanging wire using a standard friction wire, which would ignite the flash powder after a specified delay. In this specific model of ordnance, the flash would last approximately 1/5th of a second after detonation.\\"Historical Naval Ships Association\\" Recent events On 19 July 2015, a World War II-era M122 () photoflash bomb washed ashore at St. Pete Beach, Florida, USA. This led authorities to evacuate the beach and several nearby homes. An Explosive Ordnance Disposal team from MacDill Air Force Base responded to the scene and detonated the device.

He was an elder cousin of the 5th Dalai Lama, Ngawang Lobzang Gyatso (1617-1682). Pagsam Wangpo was considered to be an immediate re-incarnation of Kunkhyen Pema Karpo (1527-1592 CE). In 1597 he was enthroned as the 5th Gyalwang Drukpa hierarch of the Northern branch of the Drukpa Lineage at Tashi Thongmon monastery, resulting in a lengthy dispute with a rival candidate enthroned at Ralung Monastery. Disputed Incarnation Following a traditional paternal-uncle to nephew model of spiritual and temporal succession common in Tibet during that period known as khuwon (khu dbon), the Gya (rgya), also known as the Druk, family descended from Tsangpa Gyare (1161–1211) and his nephew Darma Senge (, 1177-1237)http://www.tbrc.org/#!rid=P912 held both the main spiritual succession of the Central Drukpa (bar 'bruk) tradition as well as the temporal control of Ralung Monastery and its extensive estates for over 400 years. In English sources, this particular line of spiritual and temporal succession is often referred to as the hereditary lineage of the \\"prince-abbots\\" of Ralung. The 13th hierarch of this Ralung succession, Kunga Penjor (, 1428-1476)http://www.tbrc.org/#!rid=P920 declared himself to be the reincarnation of the founder Tsangpa Gyare, thus becoming the 2nd Gyalwang Drukpa as well as the hereditary hierarch of Ralung. However, following his death, the Gya family had no male heir to assume the position of his reincarnation. Some of his students therefore looked outside of Gya clan in order to continue this incarnation line. Chödrak Gyatso, 7th Karmapa Lama (1454-1506) recognized Jamyang Chökyi Drakpa, a son of his patrons, the powerful Ja () clan, as the Third Gyalwang Drukpa.; Then following his death in 1523, a boy from the Kongpo region was recognized as his reincarnation and became the fourth Gyalwang Drukpa, Kunkhyen (\\"the omniscient\\") Padma Karpo, the greatest scholar in the history of the Drukpa school. Meanwhile, Ngawang Chögyal ()http://www.tbrc.org/#!rid=P873 the nephew of Drukpa Kunley and son of Kunga Paljor's brother Nangso Rinchen Zangpo (nang so rin chen bzang po)http://www.tbrc.org/#!rid=P4477 (also known as Lhawang), succeeded Kunga Paljor as the 14th hereditary prince-abbot of Ralung. He was succeeded by his elder son Ngawang Drakpa (1506-1530);http://www.tbrc.org/#!rid=P3866 who in turn was succeeded by his younger brother Ngagi Wangchuck (1517-1554);http://www.tbrc.org/#!rid=P4478 who was succeeded by his son Mipham Chögyal (1543-1606).http://www.tbrc.org/#!rid=P2629 The Central Drukpa school thus became effectively split into two, one group following the incarnation line of the Gyalwang Drukpas and another following the old hereditary Drukpa lineage of the prince abbots of Ralung monastery. Following the death of the Kunkhyen Pema Karpo in 1592, two candidates were claimed as his reincarnation: Pagsam Wangpo (b. 1593), the natural son of the prince of Chongye, and Ngawang Namgyal (b.1594), the son of Mipham Chögyal, 17th prince- abbot of Ralung. The arbitrage between the parties of the two candidates was long and complex, involving most of the principal religious and political dignitaries of Tibet at that time. Lhatsewa Ngawang Zangpo (lha rtse ba ngag dbang bzang po, 1546-1615), an influential follower of Gyalwang Drukpa Padma Karpo, and most of the monks of Tashi Thongmon and Druk Sangag Chöling monasteries, favoured Lhatsewa's nephew, Pagsam Wangpo; while the Gya clan of Ralung Monastery, the traditional seat of the Drukpa school, and their supporters laid claim on behalf of Ngawang Namgyal. The long dispute ultimately led to a decision by the strongman of Tibet, Karma Phuntsok Namgyal, who chose the Chonggye candidate Pagsam Wangpo.

Format The game consists of four rounds; the first three rounds see the 'TV Lovers' compete with the 'TV Legends' in order to win additional time for the fourth round; the fourth round then sees one of the 'TV Lovers' compete against the clock to win the daily £3,000 prize. Switch On The first round, Switch On, is a clip- based round. An on-the-buzzer question is asked to the team captains to determine the order of play. The teams then alternately pick from six programme categories given. Behind each category is a programme clip, and this is followed by three questions - though they are not necessarily always directly related to the clip shown (for instance, episode one featured a clip from Made in Chelsea followed by questions about The Valleys and The Only Way is Essex). Each player plays once in this round, and if the total score (out of nine questions given) achieved by the 'TV Lovers' exceeds that of the 'TV Legends', ten seconds are added to the time for the endgame; if the 'TV Legends' beat or equal the Lovers' score, no time is added. Interactive Viewing The second round is played in three parts, each worth five seconds added to the endgame if the 'TV Lovers' can better the score achieved by the 'TV Legends'. The first part of the game sees a board of six options shown, and the teams alternately pick one of the options and give the appropriate answer. For instance, the six options may be TV catchphrases, and the players have to give the character or show that the phrase is associated with; other versions of this game have asked contestants to fill in missing words in programme titles, or to determine whether a programme title given really existed as a programme. If the Lovers get more right than the Legends, five seconds are added to the endgame. At the end of this game, a clip from one of the featured shows or stars is played. The second round is a clips-based round: each team gets a clip and associated question, for instance working out which programme, personality or event a series of people taking part in vox pops are talking about, or determining which musician a Celebrity Stars in Their Eyes contestant is going to perform as. If the Lovers answer correctly and the Legends are wrong, five seconds are added to the endgame. The third part of the round sees a TV programme, character or actor shown, along with nine potential answers to a given question, of which five are correct (for instance, an actor may be shown alongside nine programme titles, or a sitcom alongside nine potential episode titles, or a reality show alongside nine potential participants), and the contestants have to identify which five of the nine options are correct (in the manner of Wipeout). If the Lovers get more right than the Legends, five seconds are added to the endgame. At the end of each round, a clip from one of the featured shows or stars is screened. Close Up The third round, Close Up, is a head-to-head quiz game which sees each of the Lovers take on one of the Legends in a series of seven on- the-buzzer questions. Each Legend has a specialist subject related to their common TV role (for instance, Ricky Tomlinson's is 'comedy and drama' and Jeremy Kyle's is 'Daytime'; Chris Tarrant's is 'Entertainment' in all episodes). The playing Lover and Legend join Bacon at a podium and face an initial four questions on the subject at hand, then a clip is played, which is followed by a further three questions derived from the featured programme or personality. If the Lover gets more questions right than the Legend they are facing, five seconds is added to the endgame. Screen Time The final round does not feature the 'TV Legends'. In this round, one of the 'TV Lovers' is chosen by the team captain to sit in the 'telly chair' in front of the main screen and play for the £3,000 daily prize fund. The selected player has 60 seconds plus any time won in the earlier rounds to play through the endgame. The player has to answer, without help from their teammates, a sequence of eight questions correctly in order to access the 'Prime Time Question', and then answer this ninth question, all within the available time, in order to win the prize. Whilst playing through the eight-question sequence, the player has three 'lifelines' - 'Record', which can be used on any question, allows them to skip to the next question, though all recorded questions have to be dealt with before the Prime Time question is unlocked. 'Live Pause', which can be used only once, stops the game clock to allow the player up to ten seconds of conferring with the other Lovers on the current question; and 'Delete' allows one question of the sequence to be junked (this will often be used alongside the Record function, to allow the contestant to decide which question they find most troublesome.) The lifelines cannot be used on the Prime Time question. At the end of the round, Bacon runs through the answers of any question not correctly resolved by the player during their time, and closes the show. Unlike on some other quiz shows, such as Pointless, unwon prizes do not roll over to future programmes.

Bolin using the Pan-STARRS telescope on 27 August 2013. Observations made by the Hubble Space Telescope revealed that it had six comet-like tails. The tails are suspected to be streams of material ejected by the asteroid as a result of a rubble pile asteroid spinning fast enough to remove material from it. This is similar to 331P/Gibbs, which was found to be a quickly-spinning rubble pile as well. Three-dimensional models constructed by Jessica Agarwal of the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Lindau, Germany, showed that the tails could have formed by a series of periodic impulsive dust-ejection events, radiation pressure from the sun then stretched the dust into streams. Precovery images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey from 2005 were found, showing negligible cometary activity in 2005. Characteristics The asteroid has a radius of about . The first images taken by Pan-STARRS revealed that the object had an unusual appearance: asteroids generally appear as small points of light, but P/2013 P5 was identified as a fuzzy-looking object by astronomers. The multiple tails were observed by the Hubble Space Telescope on 10 September 2013, Hubble later returned to the asteroid on 23 September, its appearance had totally changed. It looked as if the entire structure had swung around. The Hubble Space Telescope continued to track the object through 11 February 2014. The comet- like appearance has resulted in the asteroid being named as a comet. The object has a low orbital inclination and always stays outside the orbit of Mars.

The author of books on inherited wealth and the social foundations of economic efficiency, he focuses on the role of the economy in society – especially based on studies of markets – as well as organizational sociology, the sociology of inheritance, and sociological theory. He is director at the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies (MPIfG) in Cologne, Germany, and a member of the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities.  Education and career  Beckert earned his MA in sociology at the New School for Social Research in New York City in 1991 and his MBA at Free University of Berlin in 1993. He earned his doctorate with a dissertation in the field of economic sociology in 1996 at Free University of Berlin and his habilitation at the same university with a book on the sociology of inheritance in 2003. An associate professorship in sociology at International University Bremen (2002-2003) and a professorship in sociology at the University of Göttingen (2003-2005) preceded Beckert’s appointment at age 37 as director at the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies (MPIfG), which conducts basic research on the governance of modern societies. Beckert has had visiting fellowships at Princeton University, Harvard University, the European University Institute in Florence, the Center for the Sociology of Organizations (CSO) in Paris, and the Paris Institute for Advanced Study. He gave a Mario Einaudi Lecture at the Center for International Studies at Cornell University in 2007.  Current position and activities  In addition to his director at Max Planck, Beckert is a member of the Faculty of Management, Economics and Social Sciences at the University of Cologne. He is a faculty member and chair of the International Max Planck Research School on the Social and Political Constitution of the Economy, a doctoral program run jointly by the MPIfG and the Faculty of Management at the University of Cologne. He is a member of the Joint Council of the Max Planck Sciences Po Center on Coping with Instability in Market Societies at Sciences Po Paris, which investigates how individuals, organizations, and nation-states cope with new forms of economic and social instability in Western societies and is a unique innovation in Franco-German collaboration in the social sciences reflecting the Max Planck Society's aim to put its operations on an international footing. Beckert is an editor of the European Journal of Sociology, a member of the editorial board of Socio-Economic Review,. He was council member of the Economic Sociology Section of the American Sociological Association (ASA).  Research =Economies as social orders within societies Jens Beckert’s current work at the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies reflects a research program he has developed with his codirector Wolfgang Streeck which “proposes to invest in a theory of social action as the most promising approach to a deeper understanding and an improved theorization of the economy as a socially and politically constituted system of action.” “Any economy is socially and politically constructed. The way it is socially embedded reflects both prevailing systems of meaning and the results of political ‘market struggles’ over social regulation. Investigating institutional regulation of the economy requires studying how economies are constituted as social orders within societies.” Markets from a sociological perspective In his research cluster on the “Sociology of Markets,” Beckert focuses on “markets as the core institution of capitalist economies,” seeking “to understand the functioning of markets from a distinctively sociological perspective.” Analyzing markets “from a Weberian viewpoint as arenas of social struggle in which actors confront each other under conditions of competition,” he explores the “social, cultural, and political underpinnings for the development of the order of markets.” Embeddedness of economic action “The problem of uncertainty market actors face when making decisions” is a key issue in Beckert’s research, which examines “the coordination problems market participants must cope with” – the problems of value, competition, and cooperation. “Uncertainty also provides a theoretical opening to explain the embeddedness of economic action.”  Awards and honours  * 2010: Appointed to the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities * 2005: Best Law Book of the Year, by the German law journal Neue Juristische Wochenschrift, his book Unverdientes Vermögen [Unearned Wealth] * 2005: Prize of the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities donated by the Commerzbank Foundation.

Biography and career Franklin was born in New York, in 1773, the son of Thomas Franklin, a prosperous merchant. Thomas's brothers were also successful, especially his brother also named Walter. This Walter's Manhattan house (after his decease) would be George Washington's Presidential Mansion for the first year of his presidency. Two of Walter's daughters married the brothers DeWitt and George Clinton. The family moved to Philadelphia in 1775, and during the War, Thomas was appointed commissary of prisoners. Franklin was admitted to the bar in Philadelphia county in 1792, age 19. He married Anne Emlen in 1802. Five of their children survived to adulthood. He was appointed state Attorney General in 1809, and served until 1810, when Judge John Joseph Henry retired as president judge of the Second Judicial District, then consisting of York, Lancaster and Dauphin counties, and Franklin was appointed to take his place. (Since 1833, the District consisting of just Lancaster county.) Franklin was impeached twice by the state House of Representatives, in 1818 and in 1825, for alleged judicial misconduct, but the Senate acquitted him both times. Two of his sons, and three of his grandsons, would become members of the Lancaster bar. Of the sons, Thomas E. Franklin would eventually serve two terms as state Attorney General. Franklin died in office.

After directing television news in New York City, he transitioned to film by starting as a personal assistant to American actor, John Leguizamo. He wrote and directed the thriller Devil May Call. Biography Cuadrado was born in New York City, the son of Juan Jose Cuadrado, a high school teacher and Clementina Tang-Cuadrado, a university professor. He's the second born of three sons and is of Puerto Rican, Colombian, and Chinese descent. He was named after the Greek demagogue Jason after nearly being named after Orson Welles. He is a graduate of Townsend Harris High School and attended Queens College and New York University where he studied video and film production. After directing new segments for Bloomberg Television and heading the new media department for Deloitte and Touche's New York branch, Cuadrado relocated to Los Angeles where he focused on feature film directing, writing, and editing. It was in California where he was inspired by trends in Japanese horror to write and shoot the j-horror anthology film Tales from the Dead. The film features a cast of Japanese actors speaking their native tongue. Many of whom worked together on Letters from Iwo Jima by Clint Eastwood. Cuadrado did not know Japanese at the time so the original English script was translated into Japanese for the actors. When interviewed, Cuadrado said, \\"I had to direct the actors based on their performances instead of the script. If I could tell where they were in the dialogue without understanding what they were saying then that was a good take\\".Filmmaker Magazine, Spring 2007, Vol. 15, # 3 The film was embraced by j-horror fans who were intrigued by the Western take on Japanese horror tropes. Cuadrado went on to write and direct the short film Monstrous Nature. The short took top honors at numerous North American horror film festivals. His experiences as a hostel manager in Harlem were the inspiration for the feature Harlem Hostel by writer/director Nestor Miranda. After the death of his mother in 2009, Cuadrado took time off from film production to focus on his passion for design and programming. He co- founded Kulture Kick, a boutique web design and new media company. The company partnered with Tommy Wiseau to create officially licensed products for Wiseau's cult hit The Room. Cuadrado returned to filmmaking after actress/producer Camillia Sanes (Camillia Monet) introduced him to entrepreneur Urs Brunner, the CEO of Boncafe, a Thai/Swiss coffee company. Brunner had been interested in investing in motion pictures so he purchased Cuadrado's feature script Dark Desert Highway and financed the thriller Devil May Call starring Corri English, Tyler Mane, and Traci Lords. Devil May Call was directed by Cuadrado and written with Wyatt Doyle. He currently resides in Los Angeles where he continues to develop and direct features with manager/producer Deborah Del Prete and Coronet Entertainment.

His gift in 1975 of twenty-three pieces of early Chinese porcelain of superb quality and importance was not only one of the Museum's major benefactions this century but also a carefully thought out addition to the existing collections, every piece having been deliberately chosen in advance to fill gaps in the permanent exhibition. -- Lawrence Smith, Keeper of Oriental Antiquities, British MuseumLawrence Smith, Sir John Addis, The Times, London, 8 August 1983, page 10 Publications * The India-China border question, Harvard University, 1963.https://www.worldcat.org/title/india-china-border-question/oclc/659774387 *Chinese ceramics from datable tombs, Philip Wilson Publishers, 1978.

The main aims and objects of the organisation is to provide better social, legal and medical services and facilities to economically backward and socially marginalised people irrespective of their tribe, caste or belief. They also involved in the capacity building of youth and voluntarism.  History  In November 2010, a group of social-networking sites users who are using Facebook and other sites like Orkut, etc. have in mind that some social activities must be done outside of their computer room. So, they decided to form an organisation and role-out their plan of activities. Their first activity was making contribution by members and distributed the money to economically backward people living in Serchhip Town, irrespective of their tribe, caste or belief. In the early years, they use Serchhip Facebook Users Group abbreviated as SFUG, which is not desirable due to many concerns like using the registered trademark, Facebook, may have legal issues. So, the meeting of the Governing Body of the society on 28 September 2013 changed the name to \\"Serchhip Thalai Pawl\\".  Activities = 2010  Contributions made by the members were distributed to selected economically backward families within Serchhip Town.

Erdélyi was born in Szeged in 1895 and began a career as an actor then a stage producer, but became most famous for his operettas, including Csókos regiment (1932), Fehérvári huszárok (1933), A csavargólány (1936), Sárgapitykés közlegény (1937), A zimberi-zombori szépasszony (1939), Sárgarigófészek (1940), Vedd le a kalapod a honvéd előtt (1942), and A két kapitány (1943). Many of his songs have entered the Hungarian musical canon as folk music, often without an awareness of the original composer. A dorozsmai szélmalom brought Erdélyi the most lasting fame, and the title piece of the operetta was the subject of many covers and arrangements by popular musicians of the time, including Georges Boulanger, Barnabás von Géczy, Zarah Leander, Will Glahé, Ilja Livschakoff and Karsten Troyke. The piece was usually arranged as a slow foxtrot under the titles of Puszta fox or Le Moulin de Dorozsmà. It gained popularity in South America under the title of Amor en Budapest and in Yiddish as just Budapesht. Many of Erdélyi's works were patriotic or focused on members of the military. As the communist government took power after the war, Erdélyi was blacklisted. He briefly returned to the stage as an actor from 1955-1958, but this represented his only theatre- related work after the war. He died in Budapest in 1979 at the age of 83.

The idea has had an initial acceptance by the Polish government. On 10 May 2013 the Sejm of the Republic of Poland in a vote gave support to the possible bid. On 29 March 2014 Elżbieta Bieńkowska, Poland's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Development, said that the central government would only finance those Games-related infrastructure projects that are planned anyway, independently of the Games.Bieńkowska: znacząca część kosztów igrzysk spadnie na samorządy The remaining costs, including sport facilities and the Olympic village, would need to be financed by local authorities.ZIO 2022.

They were ultimately confirmed by the vote in a local referendum on 25 May 2014. In late 2013 and early 2014 opposition against Krakow's bid for Olympic Games has gathered momentum.

Main concerns raised by the critics are expected exorbitant costs, likely cost overruns and the resulting rise in Krakow's debt, as well as the need to build sport facilities of little use beyond the games, in contrast to limited interest of Krakow city authorities in spending public money to improve the quality of life of the population. It has been brought to attention in the national press that the overall economic benefits of holding Olympic games are doubtful, local and national public authorities are almost always laden with excessive debt in result, while the only parties actually benefitting from the Games seem to be the International Olympic Committee and national committees.Polskie igrzyska: jak Zabłocki na lodzie Criticism voiced by opponents of the Games was partly confirmed already when the Games application has been lodged in mid-March 2014. In difference to previous estimates, the Games application does not include several previously planned transport infrastructure projects, while spending on sport facilities is to be significantly higher than previously planned.Projekt olimpijski odchudzony o inwestycje drogowe Even though the bid was still in early stages, in February 2014 the bid committee has already drawn much criticism in the national press for employing staff (financed from public money) according to unclear criteria, questionable spending on promotional activities including TV spots and a visit by city officials to the Sochi Olympic Games, as well as awarding the contract for preparation of the Games application to a company involved in the 2010 Commonwealth Games corruption scandal.Igrzyska w Krakowie, czyli wielkie marnotrawstwo All the cited allegations were later responded by the bid committee.http://www.jagnamarczulajtis.pl/wydarzenia/o%C5%9Bwiadczenie- komitetu-konkursowego-krak%C3%B3w-2022-w-sprawie-artyku%C5%82u-z- dnia-24022014-w Kraków's Games application has been lodged on 22 March 2014.

The Poprad-Tatry Airport is located from Jasná. Kraków has no suburban rail system, but there are plans to develop such a system. Kraków is located on the A4 East-West highway. The road distance from Kraków to Jasná is , at least 2 hours 50 minutes by road in good traffic conditions. The road distance from Kraków to Zakopane is , 1½ hours by road in good traffic conditions.

After indie-math-rockers Kitchens & Bathrooms disbanded, Williams went on to start The Inflation Kills in 2004 with the intentions of demonstrating an aesthetic shift from more complex time signatures, toward a rock and roll inspired approach, and reestablishing a long commitment to an independent approach to musical creation.

Prior to playing their hometown, The Inflation Kills took the atypical approach of touring to a region where members' former bands had relative success; that is, they toured Eastern Canada and shared stages with friends Wintersleep, Contrived, Ermine and Jon Epworth. Following that initial tour, the band returned home to debut in Hamilton, ON at The Underground with The Constantines. Early in the new year, the band nearly had to cancel its recording plans after the studio they were booked into was flooded by a burst pipe, but the group was able to avert crisis when the producer, Matt Talbot (HUM), was able to book studio time at Electrical Audio in Chicago, IL. The album was engineered by Russ Arbuthnot at Electrical Audio in Chicago, IL, in early 2005, and completed and produced at Great Western Record Recorders by Matt Talbot. It was mastered by Ryan Mills (Antiantenna, 20 Hz) at Joao Carvalho Mastering in Toronto, ON and released on April 8, 2005. The album debuted at #44 in May 2005 on the earshot charts in Canada, dropping to 50th for the month of June 2005. Following the release of the album, the band primarily toured Eastern Canada while making appearances at the Pop Montreal and Halifax Pop Explosion festivals, sharing stages with Dependent Music affiliated artists such as Wintersleep, Contrived, Ermine, and Jon Epworth, but also toured Nationwide. The band also has a music video for the song \\"When Clones Come\\",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZMyVbaIRTw&list;=UUdHTnoanbtgMhYdDLYieHdg&index;=9 created by former MuchMusic producer Matt Unsworth. The band has also performed and recorded a CBC Radio 3 Live Session in the Glenn Gould Studio at CBC headquarters in Toronto, ON, a part of which segment reveals new music that is, as of yet, unreleased. After The Inflation Kills went dormant, Phil Williams wrote and performed a series of acoustic fragments as a solo artist and was featured in an episode of Southern Souls' musical video series whilst performing amongst installations at the Science Centre in Toronto, Ontario. Matt Fleming studied jazz guitar in Antigonish, NS, at St. Francis Xavier University and played in the Halifax-based band Kuato, Ottawa metal band Biipiigwan, and is currently playing bass for the Hamilton, ON roots rocker, and Sonic Unyon recording artist, Terra Lightfoot. Nicholas Daleo went on to play drums live and on record for Pneumatic Transit—a short-lived project started by Adrian Murchison—as well as live for Monster Truck, and Blinker the Star. Adrian Murchison toured once out east with his project, Pneumatic Transit, but the band has not performed or released any further material since. The Inflation Kills recorded a 7-song EP in Summer 2015 at Boxcar Recording (Hamilton, ON) with Sean Pearson (50 Watt Head, Teevee Freaks, WTCHS). Its scheduled release is end of 2015 via a limited run of 100 green cassette tapes with gold lettering through Cold Slither Tapes (Chicago, IL).

Facts  Prior to travelling on a work-related assignment, the deceased asked to see his first will, in terms of which he had left to the first respondent his entire estate. As this will could not be located, he decided to dictate a second will, in the presence of witnesses, which the first respondent wrote out in her own handwriting. He read through the will, which revoked all his previous wills, and signed it. While away on that assignment the deceased met his death. When the second, handwritten will was lodged with the Master, the first respondent was informed that, in terms of section 4A of the Wills Act,Act 7 of 1953. she was disqualified from benefiting under the will. Section 4A(1) disqualifies, inter alia, a person who writes out the will of another in his or her own handwriting from receiving any benefit under the will. The first respondent applied, without notice to the appellants, to the Johannesburg High Court for an order that she was entitled to benefit from the will. In the high court, Pretorius AJ agreed and granted her the relief that she had sought. Once the appellants came to learn of that order, they applied for its rescission. Ismail AJ, who heard the rescission application, dismissed it with costs, essentially because he was satisfied that Pretorius AJ was correct.  Argument  According to the SCA, the general principle encapsulated in section 4A(1) is subject to the qualification and exceptions set out in section 4A(2)(a), which empowers a court to declare any such person competent to receive a benefit under the will if it is satisfied that such a person did not defraud or unduly influence the testator. On behalf of the appellants it was argued that the qualification and exception in s 4A(2)(a) did not apply to persons who are family members of the testator. Rather, so the argument went, section 4A(2)(b), which makes provision for a person who, in terms of the law relating to intestate succession, would have been entitled to benefit from the testator if that testator had died intestate, applied. As subsection 2(b) restricted the benefit of such a beneficiary to the value of the share such a person would have received, in terms of the law relating to intestate succession, it was contended that being the spouse of the deceased the first respondent’s benefit should not exceed a child's share, being what she would have been entitled to inherit had the deceased died intestate.  Judgment  The SCA held that on the plain language of the section there was nothing to suggest that the application of section 4A(2)(a) was dependent on the inapplicability of section 4A(2)(b). If it had been the intention of the legislature that family members should be excluded from the ambit of subsection 2(a), one would have expected the relevant section to contain clear wording to that effect. The court thus rejected this argument. The court held that, as was the position under the common law, s 4A(2)(a) seeks to permit a beneficiary who would otherwise be disqualified from inheriting, to satisfy the court that he or she did not defraud or unduly influence the testator in the execution of the will. The court held that as the first respondent had not, by way of the second will, gained any advantage over anyone, nor had her bona fides been questioned, she should receive the benefits reserved to her by the will. The SCA consequently dismissed the appeal with costs.  See also  * Law of succession in South Africa  References  * Blom and Another v Brown and Others [2011] 3 All SA 223 (SCA).

She is a pioneer in early feminist and conceptual art focusing on clothing sculpture and drawing installation. She lives and works in New York City. Early life and education Born in Brookline Massachusetts, Smith spent her early years in Boston. In 1949, her family moved to Milton, Massachusetts where she grew up. She attended the Massachusetts College of Art and graduated with a BFA degree in 1963. In May of the same year, she moved to New York City. Smith enrolled in Rutgers University and received a MFA degree in 1966. Artwork=Clothes sculptures During her graduate studies at Rutgers, Mimi Smith began making sculpture that utilized clothing as both content and form. Smith’s early works were prescient of feminist and clothing art and predicted the feminist artists fascination with clothing as an extension of the body. Using the autobiographical as a point of departure, her work often parallels everyday moments. In 1965, she produced Recycle Coat, Model Dress and Bikini. These works were made of plastic, an important material for Smith. In 1966, she produced a room-size installation called The Wedding for her thesis show at Rutgers University. Designed as a plastic box that viewers were not permitted to enter, it contained a plastic wedding gown with a thirty-foot train. Within the next year she was to create her signature piece Steel Wool Peignoir. About the piece Smith said, “Growing up in the 1950s, I associated peignoirs [with] storybook romance… steel wool, however, was the stuff of everyday life… I felt that [the materials] combined the reality of my life with the romance of what I thought it would be”. That same year she made Maternity Dress and Girdle. These pieces were also prescient in their acknowledgment that fashion is part of what helps to construct women’s individual and social identities. In 1968 Smith made a conceptual piece about her own pregnancy that played on the idea of knitting baby clothes. Knit Baby was conceived as a knit-your-own-baby kit, with instructions to enable any woman, or man, to knit themselves a baby. Knotted thread and tapemeasure drawings Smith moved with her husband and two children from New York City to Cleveland, Ohio in the early 1970s. During this time, Smith created a series of wall drawings that replicated furniture, architectural features, and rooms in her home using knotted thread and tape measures to mark their precise dimensions. With this series, Smith used the fundamental parameters of conceptual art to tell her own story. When exhibited, the individual works are arranged on gallery walls in a ghostly reproduction of the domestic sphere. In a review of Smith’s solo show at Kustera Tilton Gallery in 1999, art critic Roberta Smith wrote “These wall drawings combine elements of high conceptualism with instant accessibility and a feminist viewpoint”. Installation art and artist books Smith and her family moved back to New York City in the mid 1970s. At this time, Smith’s work began to focus on installations and drawings about television news, the environment and nuclear threat. Installations ranged in size and included individual drawings hung directly on the wall to ten-foot tall paper houses suspended from the ceiling. These works often included audio of the artist reciting the daily news accompanied by her own phrases. Simultaneously, she began making artists books and in 1983 she published This is a Test with Visual Studies Workshop. This is a Test was produced in an edition of 700 and deals with nuclear disaster told through television news. Recent clothes and drawings From the 1990s to the present, Smith has returned to clothing sculpture producing pieces that comment on the lives of women in the workplace and the military (Slave Ready Corporate, 1993, To Die For, 1991, and Camouflage Maternity Dress, 2004) as well as illness, the environment and aging (Protectors Against Illness, and Coverings for an Environmental Catastrophe). Continuing with her drawing practice, Smith’s ongoing series, Timelines tracks the aging process of a woman through her clothes. Consisting of individual drawings displayed in a line, each Timeline depicts a specific article of clothing viewed from birth to seventy-nine, the average life expectancy of a woman. Exhibitions, grants, writings Mimi Smith has exhibited extensively throughout the United States and internationally. Her many exhibits include a retrospective ‘Steel Wool Politics’ at the ICA Philadelphia, a survey show at Ramapo College, NJ, and solo shows at Anna Kustera Gallery, NYC; Group shows ‘WACK! Art and the Feminist Revolution’ at LA MOCA, ‘Building Blocks’ at RISD Museum, ‘Artwear’ at Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, ‘Addressing the Century, 100 Years of Art and Fashion’ at the Haywood Gallery, London, Committed to Print at MoMA, NYC, and at many other museums. She has been the recipient of grants from the National Endowment of the Arts, the New York Foundation on the Arts and the Joan Mitchell Foundation. Among the many publications that have written about her work are Artforum, Art in America, Art News, Frieze, and Time Out magazines, as well as The New York Times, Dallas Morning News, and several books.

He pioneered the concept of home equity conversion (reverse mortgages) in the United States and developed innovative approaches to the funding of Social Security benefits and long-term care. His scholarship has contributed to a better understanding of the economic, political, and social implications and challenges of today's \\"mass aging\\" phenomenon—the ongoing and unprecedented shift to an increasingly elder- populated society.  Biography  Born in Jingjiang, Jiangsu Province, China, Chen went to the United States for graduate school in 1955 and remained there to teach economics and gerontology for 50 years. He retired in 2009. He is married and has three children and six grandchildren. A graduate of National Taiwan University in Taipei, he received his M.A. and Ph.D. in Economics at the University of Washington, Seattle. He is currently professor emeritus of gerontology and a fellow in the Gerontology Institute at the University of Massachusetts Boston, where he was the first holder of the Frank J. Manning Eminent Scholar's Chair in Gerontology, a professorship established by the Massachusetts Legislature in 1988, and where he participated in launching the Ph.D. program in gerontology. Previously he was professor of economics and the first holder of the Frank M. Engle Distinguished Chair in Economic Security Research at the American College, Bryn Mawr, PA. Prior to that he taught at UCLA, Seattle Pacific College (now University), and the University of Washington. He served as delegate and/or consultant to four consecutive White House Conferences on Aging (1971 to 2005) and as delegate to the 1998 White House Conference on Social Security. A founding member of the National Academy of Social Insurance, he is a fellow in both the Gerontological Society of America and the World Demographic Association. He received the Actuarial Foundation's John E. Hanson Memorial Prize (2009, co-recipient), the Gerontological Society of America's Robert W. Kleemeier Award for Outstanding Research (2010), and the International Insurance Society's John S. Bickley Founder's Award Gold Medal for Excellence (2012).  Work  Chen's research and associated program and policy proposals are founded on the principles of (a) fostering personal responsibility and societal solidarity by combining public- and private-sector programs and policies when feasible; (b) addressing the inevitable contingencies of individual and societal finances by employing risk-pooling mechanisms of both private and social insurance; (c) augmenting the potential benefits from finite budget resources facing individual, household, or government by means of tradeoffs; and (d) placing greater value on enhancing income generation opportunities for individuals than on providing financial assistance to them, while recognizing the need for the latter under certain circumstances. His portfolio of work, embodied in some 200 publications, encompasses a range of concepts, policies, and programs that have advanced the knowledge base regarding old-age economic security from both the individual and the societal point of view. Chen's work falls principally into six areas: :1. Home-equity conversion (reverse mortgage) :2. Financing and benefit structure of Social Security :3. Funding long-term care :4. Gaps in private pension coverage for minority workers :5. Work and retirement options for older workers :6. Special tax treatments and economic status of the aged  Home-equity conversion (reverse mortgage)  In the early 1960s Chen began conducting research on income and wealth distribution among older persons. In an effort to address the dilemma of some older people being \\"income-poor and house-rich,\\" Chen made the case for a voluntary conversion of home equity into annuity income as a means by which older homeowners could augment their income from other sources and keep their homes, while lessening the pressure on societal assistance programs.Testimony of Peter H.

UCLA professor Yung-Ping Chen testifies: 'I think an actuarial mortgage plan in the form of a housing annuity can serve two purposes: First, to enable older homeowners to realize the fruits of savings in the form of home equity; and second, to enable those homeowners, who wish to remain in their homes either for physical convenience or for sentimental attachment, to do as they wish.'

The program was made permanent by an act of Congress in 1998.  Financing and benefit structure of Social Security  Chen has made a number of contributions to policy development in the area of Social Security, one of his career-long research interests.Achenbaum, W.

Against a backdrop of intensifying public debate in the late 1970s about Social Security's long-term solvency, a 1981 article by Chen was the first to call attention to the implications of proliferating employee fringe benefits for the solvency of Social Security.

In the 1990s, in an effort to resolve politically contentious debates regarding Social Security reform, Chen designed the \\"Social Security Plus Pension Supplement Plan\\" (SS + PS), combining social insurance and individual accounts, as a means for eliminating Social Security's long-range deficit while maintaining or improving rates of return for future beneficiaries. Envisioned as a 10-year national demonstration project that could be acceptable to both advocates of individual accounts and proponents of traditional methods of raising revenues and reducing benefits via social insurance principles, the plan was included in the document issued by the 1998 White House Conference on Social Security.The White House Conference on Social Security (1998).

Policy options for public long-term care insurance. Journal of the American Medical Association. May 18, 1994, 271(19), 1520-1524. (see pp. 1523-1524) The plan is based on a new model of public and private partnership consisting of a public social insurance benefit as a base, with supplementation from private long-term-care insurance and individual payments, while Medicaid (a welfare program) is kept as a safety net for the poor. SS/LTC is designed to make paying for long-term care more rational and dependable by (1) employing the insurance principle in the design of both private- and public-sector programs and (2) creating linkages to combine several sources of funds that currently exist both privately and publicly.  Gaps in private pension coverage for minority workers  Chen was among the first to investigate the different coverage rates for black and Hispanic workers under private pension programs.Rosenblatt, R.A. Sharp drop in minorities' pension coverage found. Los Angeles Times, November 21, 1996. (http://articles.latimes.com/1996-11-21/news/mn-1395_1_pension-coverage) His research in this area explored the nature of growing gaps in pension coverage between these minority workers and white workers,Hendley, A.

Work and retirement options for older workers  Chen's 1987 article, \\"Making Assets out of Tomorrow's Elderly,\\" marked the beginning of his writing and research on the concept of \\"productive aging\\" and its associated implications for work and retirement. This concept is premised on the benefits of a changed societal perspective toward older people, recognizing their value as potential societal assets rather than primarily as societal liabilities. One outgrowth of such a perspective shift was the notion of \\"gradual retirement,\\"Pfizer Journal, op. cit., p. 33 based on growing concerns about a projected workforce decline as Baby Boomers reached retirement age, along with survey results that reflected many older people's interest in continuing to work part-time after retirement. Recognition of the many practical issues and complexities associated with phased retirement led Chen to argue for increased awareness of the need, both in the U.S. and abroad, for strategies that would create more work flexibility for workers in general—regardless of age, gender, or disability status—as a means of increasing the labor supply and promoting social cohesion via a universal policy that does not, de facto, pit one group of workers against another.  Special tax treatments and economic status of the aged  Chen's interest in the economic circumstances of the aged dates to the beginnings of his career in the early 1960s, during which he conducted research examining the efficacy of tax measures favoring older people.Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations.

His ongoing scholarship and policy development on the economic circumstances of older people have emphasized the combined role of macroeconomic policies and individual behavior in providing economic security, while also stressing the problematic nature of achieving economic security in old age without accessible and adequately financed health care and long-term care.Chen, Y-P.

He was born on November26, 1995 in Chushur Dzong, near Chushur Dzong, in Central Tibet. This recognition was confirmed by the 14th Dalai Lama, Sakya Trizin, the head of the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism, and Mindroling Trichen, the now deceased head of the Nyingma tradition. All three performed hair-cutting ceremonies and bestowed names, as is traditional. As the reincarnation of Jamgon Kongtrul, Lodrö is entitled to be styled \\"rinpoche\\". His parents brought him to India from Tibet in 1997 when he was only two years old, because they feared \\"political misconceptions of the Chinese Government\\" after the 14th Dalai Lama officially recognized him as the 4th reincarnation of Jamgon Kongtrul. He was supported by the monks of the monastery of Rumtek in Sikkim and adopted by a couple of Tibetan origin living nearby, with the agreement of the Central Tibetan Administration. Since then, he has lived in India as an Indian citizen. A passport was granted to him in 2006, allowing his travel to the United States that year. However, in 2007, the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs sent a letter to the child and to his adoptive mother Kunzang L Chungyalpa, informing them that the passport was revoked because he had entered illegally in India, challenging his Indian citizenship. In late October 2013, the Delhi High Court issued a notice until the next hearing date in December, opposing Lodrö's expulsion to Tibet, in China, where his life is threatened.

The program is used to predict the performance of inertial confinement fusion (ICF) devices such as the Nova laser or proposed particle beam \\"drivers\\". Versions of LASNEX have been used since the late 1960s or early 1970s, and the program has been constantly updated. LASNEX's existence was mentioned in John Nuckolls' seminal paper in Nature in 1972 that first widely introduced the ICF concept, saying it was \\"...like breaking an enemy code. It tells you how many divisions to bring to bear on a problem.\\" LASNEX uses a 2-dimensional finite element method (FEM) for calculations, breaking down the experimental area into a grid of arbitrary polygons. Each node on the grid records values for various parameters in the simulation. Values for thermal (low-energy) electrons and ions, super-thermal (high-energy and relativistic) electrons, x-rays from the laser, reaction products and the electric and magnetic fields were all stored for each node. The simulation engine then evolves the system forward through time, reading values from the nodes, applying formulas, and writing them back out. The process is very similar to other FEM systems, like those used in aerodynamics. In spite of numerous problems in very early ICF research, LASNEX offered clear suggestions that slight increases in performance would be all that was needed to reach ignition. By the late 1970s further work with LASNEX indicated that the issue was not energy as much as the number of laser beams, and suggested that the Shiva laser with 10 kJ of energy in 20 beams would reach ignition. It did not, failing to contain the Rayleigh–Taylor instability. A review of the progress by The New York Times the following year noted that the system \\"fell short of the more optimistic estimates by a factor of 10,000\\". Real-world results from the Shiva project were then used to tune the LASNEX code, which now predicted that a somewhat larger machine, the Nova laser, would reach ignition. It did not; although Nova demonstrated fusion reactions on a large scale, it was far from ignition. Nova's results were also used to tune the LASNEX system, which once again predicted that ignition could be reached, this time with a significantly larger machine. Given the past failures and rising costs, the Department of Energy decided to directly test the concept with a series of underground nuclear tests known as \\"Halite\\" and \\"Centurion\\", depending on which lab was handling the experiment. Halite/Centurion placed typical ICF targets in hohlraums, metal cylinders intended to smooth out the driver's energy so it shines on the fuel target evenly. The hohlraum/fuel assemblies were then placed at various distances from a small atomic bomb, detonation of which released significant quantities of x-rays. These x-rays heated the hohlraums until they glowed in the x-ray spectrum (having been heated \\"x-ray hot\\" as opposed to \\"white hot\\") and it was this smooth x-ray illumination that started the fusion reactions within the fuel. These results demonstrated that the amount of energy needed to cause ignition was approximately 100 MJ, about 25 times greater than any machine that was being considered. The data from Halite/Centurion was used to further tune LASNEX, which then predicted that careful shaping of laser pulse would reduce the energy required by a factor of about 100 times, between 1 and 2 MJ, so a design with a total output of 4 MJ began to be on the safe side. This emerged as the National Ignition Facility concept. As of 2013, NIF has not reached ignition, and remains at least a factor of away.Daniel Clery, \\"Fusion \\"Breakthrough\\" at NIF? Uh, Not Really …\\", ScienceInsider, 10 October 2013 For these reasons, LASNEX is somewhat controversial in the ICF field.Christopher Paine & Matthew McKinzie, \\"When Peer Review Fails: The Roots of the National Ignition Facility (NIF) Debacle\\", NDRC, 2000 More accurately, LASNEX generally predicted a device's low-energy behaviour quite closely, but becomes increasingly inaccurate as the energy levels are increased.John Lindl et al, \\"Progress Towards Ignition and Burn Propagation in Inertial Confinement Fusion\\", Physics Today, September 1992, p. 37 Advanced 3D versions of the same basic concept, like ICF3D and HYDRA,\\"New Features in Nuclear Diagnostic Modeling Using HYDRA\\", 55th Annual Meeting of the APS Division of Plasma Physics, 2013 continue to drive modern ICF design, and likewise have failed to closely match experimental performance.

It tells the story of Bert Ljung from 5 June to 23 August during the calendar year he turns 15 during the summer break between the 8th and 9th grade at school in Sweden. The book uses the 1992 almanac following the Gregorian calendar, but no specific year is mentioned. Just like Berts bekännelser, the book uses chapter names as well as dates. It was directly written for a 1992 summertime radio program. Book cover The book cover depicts Ber swimming at the bottom of the lake of Nöckeln with a diving mask, among different water animals, watching girls swimming above. Two eyes watch out from a lobster jark thrown at the bottom. Plot The book opens on 5 June, with Bert making plans for the summer. During the summer break, he'll study girls, and heads to the library to borrow books about sex. He also walks into a store selling sex items in a jokeful way, to borrow porno magazines, and buys what he thinks is chewing gums looking like condoms, but turn out to be real condoms. Bert soon goes on a holiday to Spain, with his mother and father and John (Åke 's father), Hillevi and Doris. They travel by aeroplane, but the hotel room turns out to be located with a view towards the landfill site. Bert gets interest for two Swedish girls, Steffa och Bella (who he first believe are named Erika och Jenny). Bella later travels to Australia. Bert's grandmother goes on a holiday to Florida with Görhild. When Bert returns to Sweden, he continues spotting bikini girls at the lake of Nöckeln near Öreskoga. The Heman Hunters are kicked out from their practice room. Bert also happens to see Åke throwing grass into the lower part Louise's bikini. Bert's family's neighbour soon learn how calm it has been without the Heman Hunters n the basement, and when practicing begins again, the band is kicked out. The band soon find a new practice place, inside an air-raid shelter next to a garbage room. Bert soon falls in love with Karolina Katarina Possén, who comes from a wealthy family and attends the school \\"Butter Palms skola\\". Bert takes a summer job at a cracker factory, while Åke sells coconut balls down a country road. Lill-Erik takes a summer job at his father's cinema. In August Bert meets Nadja at a rock band en festival. Najda is now together with a three years old older guy, and plays in a band, but not the violin as she did years ago. Bert and Dödgrävarn take their mopeds to go eating at Dödgrävarn, as Bert has invited Dödgrävarn before (see Berts ytterligare betraktelser). They escape a police car (none of them wears a helmet, and Dödgrävarn uses engine tuning), and Bert gets wounded and ends up at hospital, but is soon let home. The books end on 23 August, when Bert will begin the 9th grade.

He later gave up his position in society and entered the Dominican Order. Buzád was killed during a Mongol invasion of his homeland, and is now honored as a martyr by the Catholic Church, for which he has been beatified. Career Buzád was born into the Buzád branch of the Hahót clan, the son of Buzád I (died 1192).Markó 2006, p. 451. According to magister Ákos, the founder of the Hahót kindred was Buzád's grandfather, a certain German knight Hahold I, who himself was a descendant of the Counts of Weimar-Orlamünde and settled down in the Kingdom of Hungary in 1163 upon the invitation of Stephen III of Hungary to fight against his usurper uncle Stephen IV of Hungary and his allies, the Csáks. Buzád's brother was Arnold I (died c. 1234), who erected the family monastery at Hahót. Buzád had four sons from his unidentified wife: Buzád III (his presumptive heir, who, however, predeceased his father around November 1239), Csák I, Voivode of Transylvania, Tristan and Lancelot. According to a non-authentic charter, Buzád served as the Ispán (comes) of Győr County in 1209.Zsoldos 2011, p. 157. There is no record of him receiving any official positions for the coming two decades. According to a late 17th-century family tree of his kindred, Buzád participated in the first phase of the Fifth Crusade (1217–18), led by King Andrew II of Hungary, albeit the anonymous author confused his name with the name of his grandfather and clan founder Hahold, but the rest of the data is the same as his life path.Tantalics 2009, pp. 16–17. He functioned as the Ispán of Bihar County in 1222.Zsoldos 2011, p. 139. After that he was the head of Pozsony County between 1222 and 1224.Zsoldos 2011, p. 183. During that time there were emerging tensions between King Andrew II and his son, Béla. The latter rebelled against his father's rule. Buzád became a supporter of Béla, as a result of which he had to follow his lord into exile to Austria in 1223. After reconciliation between father and son, he returned to Hungary and became the Ispán of Vas County in 1225. Buzád served as the Ban of Severin from 1226 to c. 1232, when Béla governed Transylvania de facto independently from the king, holding the title of Duke of Transylvania.Zsoldos 2011, p. 49. In 1233, he called himself \\"former ban\\" () in a charter; as a result former archontological and genealogical works of Hungarian historians (e. g. János Karácsonyi and Mór Wertner) referred to him as the Ban of Slavonia (1226–1228/9). Nevertheless it is more likely that Buzád held the office of Ban of Severin, because of his close relationship with Béla, and there is also reason to believe he came into contact during that period with the Dominican friars, who were engaged in proselytizing among the Cuman people.Zsoldos 2011, p. 292. Buzád served as Ispán of Sopron County in 1232.Zsoldos 2011, p. 198. For this reason historian Attila Zsoldos considered he left Béla's court to return Andrew's loyalty by that year.Zsoldos 2016, p. 446. Monastic life Around 1233, Buzád joined the Dominican Order, giving up his political career and forsaking all property. As a charter dated 14 February 1233 mentioned, he already lived in a monastery at Pest. Then his eldest son Buzád III inherited his main estate and centre Szabar.Vándor 1996, p. 50. According to tradition narrated by a contemporary chronicler Thomas of Cantimpré, not willing to leave the monastery, the invading Mongols killed Buzád before the altar in the middle of April 1241, shortly after the disastrous Battle of Mohi. Buzád was beatified by the Roman Catholic Church because of his martyrdom and self- sacrifice. The narration of his martyrdom was preserved by Jesuit scholar and theologian Gábor Hevenesi at the end of the 17th century in his work Ungaricae Sanctitatis Indicia (1692). Honors In honor of Hahót, a wooden sculpture was erected in 2009 at Hahót, Zala County, which village was founded by his clan. The lifesize statue depicts the noble, with one hand holding a sword and a Latin cross in the other, referring to his secular and ecclesiastical careers. László Vigh, a member of the Hungarian National Assembly, gave a speech during consecration, where he said the youth should follow persons who lived out their lives with God's love and honest work, instead of false role models.

History A house was built at Eastwood by Sir John Newton, using stone from Richmont Castle, during the 16th century, although its exact location is not known. The current Eastwood Manor was built in 1871. It was built by Charles Adams Kemble (son of the Reverend Charles Kemble rector of Bath) who bought Eastwood Farm, including the Grade I listed Eastwood Manor Farm Steading, and used stone from the local quarry to construct the house. The quarry is approximately south of the current house. It includes the entrances to two small barite or ochre mines. In 1892 Charles Adams Kemble sold it to William Bateman Hope who extended it and installed electrical wiring, making it one of the first houses in Somerset to have electric lights. In the 1930s the house was occupied by the Wardell Yerburgh family and then by the businessman Sir Foster Robinson who died there in 1967. Architecture Eastwood Manor is in a Gothic Revival style. The two-storey building has an attic and tiled roof. In 2009 a swimming pool was added to the northern rear elevation. Garden At one time the gardens covered with of surrounding farm and parkland. The garden contains an avenue of lime trees and other mature trees, herbaceous borders, terraces and a spiral mound. There was once a kitchen garden but this is now a paddock.

Julius is an anthropomorphic cat, appearing intentionally similar to Felix the Cat. A bold and inventive hero, he gradually became the primary focus of the Alice Comedies, to the point Disney abandoned live action for pure animation on subsequent projects. Julius was the first of Disney's animated protagonists to battle Pete, their oldest continuing character. The two \\"Julius Katz\\" stores on Buena Vista Street in Disney California Adventure are named in his honor.  History  Anne Shirley) in a scene from Alice's Egg Plant (1925) The character first appeared (without a name) in eight of the ten animated shorts created by Disney's first studio effort, Laugh-O-Gram Studio, the last of these being the pilot of the Alice Comedies, Alice's Wonderland.John Grant, The Encyclopedia of Walt Disney's Animated Characters After a trial run as \\"Mike\\" (in Alice the Peacemaker), he would receive his permanent name of Julius in Alice's Egg PlantIntanibase, making him Walt Disney's first named animated character.Dave Smith, Disney A to Z: The Official Encyclopedia The primary motivation for the creation of the character was that Charles Mintz wanted to have the greatest possible visual gags in the series. Since the young Alice, first played by Virginia Davis, then only seven years old, could not be relied on for the comic role, she needed a partner, and Julius the Cat filled that role. Throughout the course of the Alice series, the animated Julius was increasingly made the central focus, over the live action Alice. In one of his first appearances, Alice's Fishy Story, Julius' tail demonstrates its great versatility, a recurring characteristic in the series. Walt repeatedly played on the mythology of cats having nine lives. In the short film Alice the Peacemaker, he is partnered with a mouse named Ike (a forerunner to Mickey Mouse). This cat/mouse pairing was one of many famous animated duos from Krazy Kat (and Ignatz) through Tom and Jerry and Itchy and Scratchy. Julius was the first of Disney's animated characters to be antagonized by Pete, beginning in Alice Solves the Puzzle. He would later box him in Alice Picks the Champ. He has occasionally appeared in Disney comics under the name \\"Mio Miao\\" in Italian and \\"Otto\\" in Swedish.INDUCKS  Character  Julius was bold, resourceful and ingenious, playing the role of the hero, frequently rescuing damsel-in-distress Alice. He often used his prehensile tail to his advantage, as a crane, unicycle, ladder, or other useful tool. Ub Iwerks' unique animation style resulted in smooth, fluid movement.  Similarity to Felix  In the early days of animation, Felix the Cat, who was created in 1919 by Otto Messmer for Pat Sullivan's studio, was the template for a successful animated character. Julius' similarity to Felix was not accidental, but due to Margaret Winkler urging the reluctant Disney to copy him. She had been the distributor for Felix the Cat, but was constantly fighting with Sullivan, eventually leading to a split, so she turned to Disney to fill the void. Like Felix, Julius would pace and detach his tail. When he was in a quandary, visible question marks would form over his head. The New York Times went so far as to call Julius a \\"blatant clone... from the rubber- hose-and-circle design to the detachable body parts.\\"  Legacy  Julius Katz & Sons store at Disney's California Adventure Many of the individual Alice Comedies films have been re-released, in packages like Disney Rarities: Celebrated Shorts: 1920s–1960s and Walt Disney Treasures: The Adventures of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. The Mickey Mouse cartoon Runaway Brain also features a character who, though visually modeled after Pete, is named Julius.

Kowalko Jr. (born September 17, 1945) is an American politician and a Democratic member of the Delaware House of Representatives since November 8, 2006. He represents District 25, which covers parts of Newark, Delaware. He was described as one of the first progressive members of the state legislature, which had grown to around 12 progressives by 2018. Early life Kowalko was born in Portsmouth, Virginia, to Adele and John Kowalko, Sr., a 24-year career Marine. He graduated from St. Joseph's Prep in 1963 and apprenticed at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. He was a machinist for over 30 years, including General Foreman (LL648 IAM) at the Delaware City Refinery. Kowalko also worked as a community advocate on a range of issues, including heating assistance for low-income families. Political career In 2006, Kowalko was elected as State Representative for the 25th District. He beat incumbent Republican Stephanie Ulbrich, who had been in office since 1994. In his first few years in office, he was instrumental in the push for the Delaware Offshore Wind Farm. In 2009, he was named one of Delaware Today's \\"People of Influence\\" for his work on environmental issues. He is known for being an advocate of open government and has also sponsored legislation focused on consumers, public education, public utilities, health care, and state worker pensions. He regularly testifies at Public Service Commission hearings on behalf of utility consumers. By 2015, Kowalko was known for his passionate and outspoken stances and was described as a \\"maverick\\" for being willing to publicly disagree with his own party, particularly Governor Jack Markell and other Democratic party leadership. After an attempt to remove Democratic House Speaker Peter Schwartzkopf from his leadership position, Kowalko was taken off several committees by the Speaker for being an \\"activist,\\" while Kowalko called Schwartzkopf's actions an \\"abuse of power.\\" Kowalko's participation in local community meetings and strong constituent support in his district has been cited as allowing him to take on his own party leadership. Kowalko and State Senator Dave Lawson sponsored a bi- partisan bill to allow parents and their children to \\"opt out\\" of statewide standardized testing, which was supported by the Delaware State Education Association (DSEA) and the Delaware Parent Teacher Association (PTA). After two contentious committee hearings, the bill passed both houses nearly unanimously but was vetoed by Governor Markell. Kowalko and Lawson criticized the action and attempted the first veto override since 1977, but it ultimately failed in the House after being blocked from debate. In 2018, Kowalko described the actions of Democratic Governor John Carney as \\"Trumpian\\" after Carney used an Executive Order to enact budget restructuring that failed to pass the General Assembly and was opposed by Kowalko. Electoral history *In 2004, Kowalko lost his first election to incumbent Republican Representative Stephanie Ulbrich in the general election. *In 2006, Kowalko won a rematch with Ulbrich in the general election with 2,473 votes (52.0%). *In 2008, Kowalko won the general election with 5,008 votes (73.4%) against Republican nominee James Gates. *In 2010, Kowalko won the general election with 3,402 votes (65.5%) against Republican nominee Gordon Winegar. *In 2012, Kowalko was unopposed in the general election and won 5,674 votes. *In 2014, Kowalko was unopposed in the general election and won 3,098 votes. *In 2016, Kowalko won the general election with 5,123 votes (68.6%) against Republican nominee Michael Nagorski. *In 2018, Kowalko won the general election with 4,027 votes (64.8%) against his Republican challenger.

These genes are the product of Artsy's team and their engagement with (and feedback from) the museums, galleries, curators, critics and art historians present on Artsy's platform. There are two general parts of the project: 1) Conceiving and defining such characteristics, referred to as \\"genes,\\" and 2) Applying these genes to artists and artworks—creating \\"genomes\\" for both—for the artsy.net site. Importantly, unlike tags, which are binary, genes are applied with values ranging from 0 to 100. The value indicates the degree of relevance of a gene to an artist or work of art. While not seen by users, such gene values account for the strength of a relationship between artists and artworks. It also enables similarity to be expressed in a more nuanced way< than it might be with just tags because one can weigh various attributes of an artist or work of art to establish which might be the most or less important. Furthermore, such nuance allows for matching potential collectors with artworks based on their tastes and preferences.Hamilton, Anita. \\"Works for Me: A Recommendation Engine Takes On Fine Art.\\" Time Magazine (June 4, 2012), 56-57. Artsy's \\"genes\\" create various opportunities for discovering and learning about the artist and artworks. If users search for an artist, they can see \\"related\\" artists and if they search for an artwork, they can see \\"related\\" artworks. Genes (with definitions) also appear on their own pages and provide the backbone for Artsy's Browse page. The Art Genome Project provides metadata for search (and similarity) results based on the principles of information retrieval (TF/IDF) and presents results in a UX-driven search product. Matthew Israel, an art historian, is the Director of The Art Genome Project.http://matthewisraelprojects.tumblr.com/  Precedents for The Art Genome Project  The Art Genome Project has often been compared to Pandora's Music Genome Project, and was originally developed in consultation with Pandora's Joe Kennedy.https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/09/arts/design/artsy-is- mapping-the-world-of-art-on-the-web.html?pagewanted=1 Both aim to create comprehensive (though by no means exhaustive) analyses of types of art by identifying a set of criteria, which both call \\"genes\\". These are both broadly applicable to their respective art forms, as well as useful for generating interesting connections for users. Importantly, while The Art Genome is currently one extensive list of genes for all works of art, Pandora has separate genomes (lists of genes) for each genre of music. The Music Genome Project and TAGP are examples of Big Data, which is a sector of algorithmic technology that synthesizes data to predict what users will prefer. Artsy's genome is user facing, allowing users to navigate genes manually. Netflix also makes customized recommendations to users based on the qualities of the movies that they enjoy. Amazon Art makes suggestions to users based on their browsing and purchasing history. Museums and galleries as well as other online art image databases, such as Google Art Project and Artstor, digitize artworks for public access, but beyond providing basic metadata (artist, title, date, medium) these databases do not extensively classify works of art or create connections between them.  The Art Genome Project and Other Taxonomies for Artwork  Art historians, libraries and image archives have long used classification systems, art cataloging standards or metadata, and created taxonomies, such as The Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus to systematize the description of artworks. Classification is one of the major foundations of the discipline of art history. Most college and university art history surveys are based on such an idea of classification, to provide students with a way of grasping the history of art and a jumping-off point for more focused research. Unlike other types of classification, The Art Genome's taxonomy was designed for the purposes of establishing similarities between artists and artworks.  Genes versus Tags  In the words of Matthew Israel, Director of The Art Genome Project, \\"Genes are not tags — though we have many tags on the site — because tags are binary (something is either tagged \\"dog\\" or not). Genes, in contrast, can range from 0-100, thus capturing how strongly a gene applies to a specific artist or artwork. This nuanced connection between works of art is impossible with a simple tagging mechanism.\\"http://www.quora.com/What-is-The- Art-Genome-Project Importantly, The Art Genome Project does incorporate over 6000 tags for content (iconography) in artwork as well as certain materials and mediums, which do not need the nuance of genes.  Reception = Positive Reception  Digtalmeetsculture.net calls TAGP \\"user-friendly,\\" \\"intelligent and orchestrated behind the scenes by the Artsy experts.\\" Complex.com highlighted genes in their article \\"15 Awesome Genes on Artsy\\" to show \\"just how incredible their project is.\\" In the New York Times, the Cooper-Hewitt Museum's director of new and emerging media Seb Chan said, \\"sites like Art.sy were not meant to replace museums, galleries or books, but rather to help the public, especially art neophytes, stretch the boundaries of their taste. ‘You shouldn’t need to be a scholar to discover works of art that you might be fascinated by,’ he said. ‘You go to museums and you browse — chancing upon things is what it’s all about. The Art Genome is another way of creating serendipitous connections.’\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/09/arts/design/artsy-is-mapping- the-world-of-art-on-the-web.html Jonathan Olivares praised The Art Genome’s comprehensiveness, objectivity and ability to accommodate future revisions: \\"Unlike books, which can only be modified between editions, the website is made of millions of layers of edits that can be reworked at any time… [and] [u]nlike the opinionated and subjectively ordered history book, this neutral and re-configurable database will allow us to access any work of art or design, within any imaginable order, and instantly.\\"  Criticism  Criticism around The Art Genome Project centers on \\"its classification system, which rubs some artists the wrong way.\\"Hamilton, Anita. \\"Works for Me: A Recommendation Engine Takes On Fine Art.\\" Time Magazine (June 4, 2012), 56-57. Some critics have questioned the accuracy of the connections made through genes: \\"'I don't think what I am doing has anything to do with Cindy Sherman,' says British artist Jonathan Smith after being told the site links his work to hers via a staged-photography gene. 'That sounds like something a programmer would think of.\\"Hamilton, Anita. \\"Works for Me: A Recommendation Engine Takes On Fine Art.\\" Time Magazine (June 4, 2012), 56-57. Others have highlighted the subjective nature of genes and expressed a concern that they might be applied reductively.https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/09/arts/design/artsy-is-mapping- the-world-of-art-on-the-web.html ReferencesExternal links * The Art Genome Project Category:Arts databases ","title":"The Art Genome Project"},{"id":"41012187","text":"Visceral slide is a technique while using ultrasound, that if bowel moves less than 2cm then there is probably adhesion in the bowel.

He was born and raised in Hollandia, Netherlands New Guinea, where he spent his young days. He became the first West Papuan to get an advanced education outside of West Papua. In 1988, he was arrested for his political beliefs and teachings and was sentenced to two decades behind bars. In 1996, he died as a political prisoner in an Indonesian prison. Education Dr. Thom grew up and went to school in his hometown of Jayapura, West Papua. After high school, he enrolled at the Cenderawasih university - one of the leading universities in West Papua. At Cenderawasih university, Dr. Thom excelled. He built up good grades and was selected for the exchange program in Japan. He graduated with a degree in Law at the Okayama University. He then traveled to the United States to study on a Fulbright Scholarship. He graduated with a master's degree (MA) in Public Administration at the State University of New York at Albany, New York, and then earned a Doctorate of Philosophy from Florida State University in 1987. He had reached a level of education that many West Papuans of his time, even today, could not. Political views Dr. Thom was involved in politics as at an early age. As a young man, he watched West Papuans fight against the Indonesian occupation of their land since 1969. In 1988, as one of the West Papuan respected leaders, he began to teach a new ideology: he taught that West Papuans are Melanesian people who are entitled to self-determination. Dr. Thom channeled the frustration of the people of West Papua over the legality of Indonesian occupation of their lands. In his view, the manner in which West Papua was handed over to Indonesia was highly unfair, grossly unjust, and illegal based on International Human Rights laws and conventions. Dr. Thom, a trained lawyer did refuse to hide his disdain and dissatisfaction toward Indonesian occupation of West Papua and determined to fight against Indonesia through logical and legal arguments. He used his knowledge of international statues to challenge the legality of Indonesian occupation of West Papua, but during the Suharto regime, it was a war he couldn't win without losing his own life. James Vorendberg of Asia Watch explained the kind of country Indonesia was - and continues to this day - during Dr. Thom's time: > Indonesia, ostensibly a Democracy, is in fact an authoritarian state where > real decision-making power rests with President Suharto and the Indonesian > military. Presidential decrees and administrative regulations are the major > source of law, and the Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat (DPR), the national > parliament dominated - though appointment and electoral procedures - by the > ruling party, GOLKAR (Golongan Karyan, literally \\"functional groups\\"), > serves more as a forum for discussion of national issues than as a > legislature. The Indonesian government under President Suharto was essentially a \\"dictatorship\\" in which presidential directives were executed as laws making it extremely hard for critics to engage the state in public debate. The basic rights of speech and public discourses were effectively banned. Hundreds of Indonesians, including West Papuans, were arrested for speaking out against the state. Dr. Thom's dreams of an independent West Melanesia was seen as an extremely dangerous movement, and in 1988, the movement had its first test of the Suharto military justice. Historical background The people of West Papua occupied this land and remained virtually untouched for tens of thousands of years. They were a \\"gathering and hunting people\\" whose cultures were influenced by their thick natural rich dense forest and vast marine resources. However, the arrive of Europeans between 17th and 19th centuries changed all that. The Netherlands (Dutch) claimed this territory by mere \\"proclamation\\" on August 24, 1828, and became a formal colony of the Netherlands in 1898. After World War II, Indonesia declared independence and by 1949, the Dutch colonial administration recognized its independence but continued to prepare West Papuans for their own independence. It was a reasonable argument to make since West Papuans and Indonesians are two distinctive cultures and ethnically differently. In a surprising move, the Indonesian government declared Irian Jaya (former name of West Papua) and other Islands - such as East Timor - parts of Indonesia. This is the beginning of the tension between the Dutch government and the newly recreated state of Indonesia. On December 1, 1961, the West Papuan leaders - together with Dutch leaderships - raised the West Papuan flag for the first time; flying together as one. It was the beginning of the journey to self-determination. Indonesian president Sukarno had the backing of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communist (CHICOM) launched a full-scale invasion of West Papua. The United States saw an opportunity to jeopardize Soviet efforts, offered Indonesian a deal - it was too good to pass up. The negotiations between Indonesia, Britain and the UN culminated in the New York Agreement, proceeded by the Act of Free Choice in 1969. The Act of Free Choice laid the foundation to the ultimate annexation of West Papua by the Indonesian government. According to the New York Agreement, it would be the responsibility of Indonesia and the UN to ensure that the people of West Papua voted to determine whether they would remain with Indonesia or to breakaway as an independent state. Unfortunately, voters were rounded up and coerced to vote in favor of Indonesia. In spite of the apparent flaws of that election, the UN observers quickly endorsed the election and leveled it \\"fair\\". West Papua was to be taken away from West Papuans based on an election whereby only a fraction of hand-picked voters determined that the rest of West Papuans - like the election or not - would be forever part of Indonesia. Dr. Thom saw this as a day-light robbery of his people; culture, language, and rights to certain \\"inalienable\\" rights. His argument is that West Papuans are Melanesians who were wrongly taken from Melanesia under a sham election. Anti-Subversion Law In 1963, the government of Indonesia passed one if toughest laws - the \\"Anti-subversion\\" law. The law was passed to protect the state of Indonesia from conspiracy to overthrow or divide the state. It explicitly defines the characteristics of individuals or movements liable to be tried under this statute: *All actions Pancasila as the state ideology *All actions that are considered to create insecurity of the state power, government of the state apparatuses *Spreading the feeling of enmity, disintegration, and instability amongst the security between Indonesia and other countries. *Disrupt and hamper industry, production, distribution, trade, cooperatives, or transportation conducted by the government. *State sympathy towards countries that are considered to be enemies for Indonesia. *Mass destruction of the public buildings or personally owned buildings. *The act of espionage *The act of sabotage This law was passed in 1963, two years after West Papua and Dutch authority hoisted the West Papuan flag - the Morning Star flag - on December 1, 1961, which West Papuans believed to be their self-determination day. By passing this law, the Indonesian government made it virtually impossible to criticize the state or do things that may appear to be threatening to the unity and safety of the state. Any movement that challenges the state authority can be prosecuted under this 'Anti-subversion' law.  Arrest and incarceration  The flag of West Melanesia Toward the end of 1988 - between November and December - Dr. Thom and his supporters met at his place where they mapped out a plan to declare the independence of West Melanesia - West Papua. On 14 December 1988, they marched to Manclula Sport Stadium in Jayapura. At the stadium, the Republic of West Melanesia was proclaimed with Dr. Thom as president of the newly declared independent state. A new flag was raised featuring 14 stars with three coloured bars of black, red and white. The flag had been sewn by his Japanese wife. It would be the first time that West Papuan independence movement declared West Papua as a Melanesian territory. Dr. Thom and his supporters apparently violated the 'Anti-subversion' law. The Indonesian reaction was anticipated: Police officers arrived at the scene and apprehended Dr. Thom and other West Papuan political leaders; they were arrested and taken to military headquarters for interrogations. Taking these prisoners to military facilities made it extremely impossible for family members to visit them.  Trial  After World War II, the world, having seen the ugliness of war, came together to pass one of the most important documents of our time - Universal Declaration on Human Rights. This agreement, which was signed by the major powers of the world, called for the protection and safety of all human beings irrespective of their location and circumstances. It also calls for the protection of the rights of individuals to a \\"fair trial\\". > Article 2: Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in > this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, color, sex, > language, religion, political or other opinions, national or social origin, > property, birth or other status. Furthermore, no distinction shall be made > on the basis of the political, jurisdictional, or international status of > the country or territory to which a person belongs, whether it be > independent, trust, non-self-governing or under any other limitation of > sovereignty. The declaration Human Rights agreement was signed prior to the independence of Indonesia in 1949, however, as a member state of the United Nations, Indonesia is - by default and by virtue of that membership - bound by that agreement to respect and protect the rights of Indonesians. Since the Suharto regime rose to power in the 1967, rights of all citizens were never protected instead they were discarded whenever they run counter to the will of the regime. In 1989, Dr. Wainggai found himself in the same predicament. In April 1989, West Papuans gathered to witness one of their heroes - Dr. Thom - taking on the full force of the Indonesian jurisprudence. According to Asia Watch, Dr. Thom was tried by the district court in Jayapura, in the months of April and June, in hearings that defied commonsense as it became transparent even to the unlearned that the Indonesian government (court) were pursuing long prison term against Dr. Thom even if it means violating common civil rights he was entitled to it. The court room was packed as indigenous people gathered to hear the proceedings. In June, however, the numbers of West Papuans who showed up fell dramatically because of political intimidation; police fired in the air and attendees were subjected to physical rough inspection.  Dr. Thom vs. State  The Act of Free Choice held West Papua in 1969 was a highly controversial election. To West Papuan nationalists, the failure to consult them and the lack of equal representations at the polls was a slap in the face of Democracy. Lack of transparency on the part of the UN made that plebiscite a mere scam coated in the name of Democracy. The apparent disregard of the rights of West Papuans in the execution of this plebiscite led to the formation of the Organisasi Papua Merdeka. Sympathizers and loosely associated groups often clashed with Indonesian police in violent struggles for control. Intellectual leaders such as Dr. Thom, however, preferred to challenge the legality of the acquisition of West Papua by pointing out the inconsistencies and discrepancies within the government policies and national statues (constitution). They preferred intellectual rational debate based on the reading of the laws. Asian Watch cited an event that demonstrated this new approach. Prior to the public demonstration at the stadium, Dr. Thom dispatched supporters to notify the Indonesian authority of his planned public declaration of West Melanesian independence and the location of the event, which essentially eradicate state's claim of conspiracy to overthrow the government. This new method of non-violent approach to Indonesian's claim over West Papua, made the state case against Dr. Thom extremely fluid and fundamentally weak. The state could not charge Dr. Thom with conspiracy to overthrow the government by force, nor did they have any evidence to just charge him for violence, public disturbance or obstruction of justice because his movement was completely devoid of violence and public disturbance. Dr. Thom's movement was not only unique to the OPM's struggle, but one that renewed the call for dialogue and reasonable debate over facts and mere claims - a call to revisit the legality of the 1969 election. He apparently borrowed the Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King style approach to the struggles of West Papuans. Indonesia saw him as extremely dangerous. Mr. Herman Wainggai, Dr. Thom's own nephew who followed his uncle's footsteps into the horror of Indonesian prison and served two years, referred to his uncle as the 'father of nonviolent struggle for the Liberation of West Papua. Dr. Thom's method caught the Indonesian government off guard, noted the Asia Watch.  Judgement  On September 7, 1989, Dr. Wainggai was sentenced to 20 years in prison.Dr. Thom would have been 71 if he served his full sentence. It is obvious from this Asia Watch report that the Indonesian government wanted to convict Dr. Wainggai at all costs, even if means bending and ignoring his rights to a fair trial. The report summed up the trial this way: \\"The Trial was marked by the irregularity that characterized all Indonesian political trials, including restricted access by lawyers to their client, insufficient materials to prepare the defense, failure to call defense witnesses and limited time for cross examination.\\" Dr. Thom was held in a prison in West Papua for eight years, while his wife was kept in a separate prison designed for women. The couple were held in Jayapura prison from 1988 to 1990 before the Suharto regime relocated them to Jakarta amidst continual violent protests by West Papuan separatists. The conditions were absolutely harsh, but they had family and West Papua loyalists and die-hard nationalists visited him often. Dr. Thom was sent to LP Cipinang prison, while his wife was transferred to Tangerang prison in Jakarta - the capital city of Indonesia.  Death  While the conditions in the state penitentiary in Jakarta were comparatively better to that in Jayapura, West Papua, Dr. Thom's healthy gradually deteriorated. Keeping the Wainggai's in Jakarta made it extremely complicated for the Wainggai family to visit them on a regular basis. On March 12, 1996, six years after his transfer to Jakarta, Dr. Thom succumbed to the illness he suffered; he died in jail. Since the Indonesian government did not provide adequate explanation as to the true cause of his Dr. Thom's death, relatives in West Papua believed he died by poison. They believe that Dr. Thom was deliberately positioned - a position that the Council on Foreign Relations echoed in its finding while investigating the issues of West Papua. According to reports, Dr. Thom returned from United States in late 1987 and worked as a lecturer at the Cenderawasih University, West Papua. He was also elevated to a senior position in the \\"Provincial Planning\\" office in Jayapura. What triggered his radical move to declare West Papua an independent state remained a debatable issue. It is also debatable why he only planned with a few people prior to the demonstration at the Mandala National Stadium where he was arrested. Some suggested that Dr. Thom may have been unhappy and decided to take his personal anger to the national arena. Jones Sidney of Asia Watch provided a possible explanation for Dr. Thom's decision. According to Sidney, Dr. Thom had a personal goal that was to lead West Papua - formerly Irian Jaya - as governor. In 1987, he garnered enough support to run as a candidate in the 1987 governor's election. Unfortunately, he only received a few votes. Sidney pointed to a popular view that he may have taken his personal dissatisfaction too far. This view suggested that Dr. Thom's decision to declare West Melanesia as an independent state came to being after the election, however, it didn't explain why Indonesian locked Dr. Thom up when he returned from Okayama University, Japan, for six months years back. It seems that Dr. Thom had held this position prior to 1987. Another \\"theory\\" which emerged after Dr. Thom suddenly died in jail, after only serving only nine years of his 20 years prison term, is that the Indonesian authority poisoned Dr. Thom. This theory is also widely accepted by authors and foreign reporters as the cause of Dr. Thom's death. For instance, Denise C. Blair and David L. Philips wrote that Dr. Thom died in prison from \\"food poisoning\\" in 1996. However, they failed to provide evidence to support that claim. Furthermore, the materials available contain little substantive evidence to support this claim. It may have emerged as West Papuans tried to make sense of what happened to their leader. On the other hand, Indonesia's explanation also seemed sketchy. To this day, it remains somewhat vague to say with all certainty that Dr. Thom died of food poisoning; there must be hard-evidence to support this claim, so far, there's little.

By 1868, restrictive covenants attached to the sale specified standards for heights, widths and construction of buildings on the lots, and also restricted the types of businesses which could be located there. The major development of the Tredwell Farm property took place from 1868–76, and was primarily in the form of Italianate row houses,\\"Treadwell Farm Historic District\\" on the Friends of the Upper East Side Historic District website with echoes of the French Second Empire style. The Presbyterian Church of the Redeemer, now the Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady of Peace, was built in 1886-87, and six-story apartment buildings at 245 and 247 East 62nd Street were built in 1899-1900. Noted architects who designed buildings in the district include Richard Morris Hunt, Samuel A. Warner, James W. Pirrson and George F. Pelham. In the 1920s, between 1919 and 1922, most of the buildings in the district were significantly altered. Many stoops were removed and architectural detail reduced to a more simplified form. In addition, in 1930 a church in the Scandinavian Modern style, designed by Martin G. Hedmark, was built at 250 East 61st Street. Notable residents By late in the 19th century, the Treadwell Farm area had deteriorated some, but affluent New Yorkers rediscovered it in the decades after World War I.

Biography During the Herzegovinian Uprising in 1875, Kosta Protić was sent by the Serbian government to Russia to investigate the possibilities for a war loan. Ivan Aksakov received Protić, instructed him and gave him letters of recommendation to the right persons in Saint Petersburg; moreover, since Aksakov's wife was a former lady-in-waiting with connections at the court, she introduced Protić to the empress Maria Alexandrovna and to the heir, the future Alexander III of Russia. The two were in favor of helping the Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina rid themselves of the Turks, more so than their government. Through their intercession public subscription for a loan was authorized by the tsar. Protić served as a military officer during the Serbian-Ottoman War (1876-1877) and the Russo-Turkish War (1877–78). He served as the Chief of the Serbian General Staff during the Russo-Turkish War. He later briefly served as Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Serbia during 1889. Upon the abdication of King Milan, Protić was appointed to a Regency council with Jovan Ristić and Jovan Belimarković for the underage Alexander I, on which he served until his death.

Saint Stephen's is one of the oldest churches in Strasbourg. The crypt contains the remains of a fifth- century Roman basilica. The site was originally occupied by a Roman fort. A new church was built on the site in early in 717 by Duke Adalbert of Alsace, brother of Saint Odile, as part of a new convent, in which he installed his daughter Attala as the first abbess. The Church also served for many years as the episcopal seat for the north of Alsace. The church was rebuilt in 1220 in Romanesque-Gothic style. At the beginning of the 16th century, St Stephen's was a parish church, the parish of Stephen's being one of the nine parishes of Strasbourg. In 1534, as the reform was being introduced in Strasbourg, the parish of St Stephen's was transferred to St William's, on account of the opposition of the cannonesses of St Stephen's to the new teaching. In the seventeenth century Louis XIV closed the abbey and transferred it to the Visitandines to serve as a boarding school for young women, a function which continued up until the French Revolution. In 1714 the church was equipped with an organ by Andreas Silbermann, which is now in Bischheim. After the French Revolution, the building was used as a warehouse, then as a theatre. In 1802, the church was deprived of its tower and in 1805 this was transformed into a theatre. The college, of which the church now forms part, began life in 1861 as a 'Petit seminaire' (literally 'little seminary'), educating future priests as well as lay students. Allied bombing destroyed much of the building in 1944. Only the wide transept with its triple apse survived. In 1956, the ancient site was excavated and a Merovingian apse was discovered beneath the foundations of the old tower. In 1961, the nave was renovated, exposing the timber structures. The church was classified as a historical monument in 1962. In 2016, the monumental concert organ from the former conservatory located in the National Theatre of Strasbourg was moved into the nave in order to be used as a church organ. The instrument, a 1963 work by organ builder Curt Schwenkedel, had been out of use since 1995. It was entirely restored by Quentin Blumenroeder from Haguenau. As the Church is now part of a school, public access is only possible on special occasions, such as European Heritage Days. The school owns some valuable historical tapestries from the abbey church, some of which can be seen in the nearby Notre Dame museum.

His radio broadcasts made him well known to the British public in the 1930s. Career After gaining a BA from Manchester University in 1913, he worked as a designer at Ludwig Oppenheimer Ltd, the mosaic firm founded by his grandfather and based in Old Trafford, Manchester. His work, and that of the Oppenheimer firm is still to be seen in several churches in Britain and Ireland. He took part in the Paris exhibition in 1925. He is best known as an art critic and writer. He was appointed art critic of the Manchester Guardian in 1930, although he had provided copy for that paper for some years prior to this. He was art critic for The Times for three years from 1947, and wrote frequently for the New York Times, Time and Tide magazine and ArtReview Newton delivered radio lectures on art, notably the 1935 BBC 12 part series \\"The Artist and his Public\\" subsequently turned into the first of several books. and took part in the radio arts series The Critics. In this programme, his Times Obituary states \\"his lucidity and critical sense were trenchantly displayed\\". The Oxford Dictionary of Art describes him as \\"a clear and polished writer and also an articulate lecturer and radio broadcaster\\". These broadcasts made his name well known and local newspaper archives reveal that Newton was clearly in demand, delivering public lectures across the country in the late 1930s and 1940s. Newton undertook lecture tours to North America in 1937, 1953 and 1956, the 1937 tour of Canada was sponsored by the National Gallery of Canada. His diary of this tour was subsequently published (see below). The 1956 tour included the Memorial University of Newfoundland where he lectured on modern art. A photograph exists in the university archives. Newton was lecturer in art history at the Central School of Art and crafts from 1963. His MA, completed in 1951 at Manchester was on the subject of the renaissance artist Tintoretto, and was subsequently published in 1952 as a book.

Interconnected CDNs offer many benefits, such as footprint extension, reduced infrastructure costs, higher availability, etc., for content service providers (CSPs), CDNs, and end users. Among its many use cases, it allows small CDNs to interconnect and provides services for CSPs that allows them to compete against the CDNs of global CSPs.  Rationale  Thanks to the many benefits of CDNs, e.g. reduced delivery cost, improved quality of experience (QoE), and increased robustness of delivery, CDNs have become popular for large-scale content delivery of cacheable content. For this reason, CDN providers are scaling up their infrastructure and many Internet service providers (ISPs)/network service providers (NSPs) have deployed or are deploying their own CDNs for their own use or for lease, if a business and technical arrangement between them and a CDN provider were made. Those stand-alone CDNs with well-defined request routing, delivery, acquisition, accounting systems and protocols may sooner or later face either footprint, resource or capability limits. The CDNI targets at leveraging separate CDNs to provide end-to-end delivery of content from CSPs to end users, regardless of their location or attachment network.  Example of operation  Let's consider an interconnection of two CDNs as presented in the below figure. The ISP-A deploys an authoritative upstream CDN (uCDN), and he has established a technical and business arrangement with the CSP. Because the CDN-A is authorised to serve on behalf of the CSP, a user in the network of ISP-B requests content from CDN-A (1). The uCDN can either serve the request itself or redirect it to a downstream CDN (dCDN) if, for example, dCDN is closer to the user equipment (UE). If the request is redirected, the interconnected CDNs must provide the requested content to the dCDN. If the content is not available in the uCDN, it can be acquired first from CSP (2) and then submitted to a surrogate in the dCDN (3). The UE following the redirection will request the content from the dCDN (4), and finally, the requested content will be distributed from the surrogate. An example of end-to-end content delivery using CDNI. In this example, all four parties can benefit from the interconnection: the end users can benefit from better quality of service (QoS); the CSP benefits because it has to make only one business and technical arrangement with uCDN; the uCDN benefits because it does not have to deploy such an extensive CDN; and the dCDN will receive some compensation for the delivery. The procedures and algorithms responsible for choosing the right dCDN, choosing a surrogate and the procedure for acquiring the content to be submitted to the surrogate can differ, but the dCDN serves the content on behalf of the uCDN.  Use cases  Below is an incomplete list of use cases for which CDNI was presented.G. Bertrand, E. Stephan, T. Burbridge, P. Eardley, K. Ma, and G. Watson. Use Cases for Content Delivery Network Interconnection. RFC 6770 (Informational), November 2012. The use cases seem to be convergent among the standardisation approaches (see Standardisation status section).  Footprint extension  Footprint is defined as a region for which a CDN is able to deliver content. With a deployed CDNI, non-global CDN providers may offer CSPs an extended geographical footprint without * compromising the quality of delivery; * additional transit costs, if the content is to be served from geographically or topologically remote surrogates; and * deploying and operating surrogates not justified in the corresponding region, e.g. high investments costs and low delivery volume. An interconnection may be attractive to a large CDN provider who possesses many CDNs in various locations and who may want to make them interoperable. A CDNI footprint extension is also beneficial for cases in which CDN providers deliver a lot of popular content to networks of a few ISPs. If so, interconnection of such CDNs would offer improved QoS and QoE to end users, reduce and allow control of ingress traffic in the ISP's network, reduce hardware capacity and footprint of uCDN and allow the ISP to derive some revenue. Additionally, interconnected networks may allow nomadic end users to access content with a consistent QoE across a range of devices and/or geographic regions.  Offload  A CDNI can be very useful in overload handling because it allows the unexpected spikes in traffic, e.g. a flash crowd that exceeds the peaks for which a CDN was dimensioned, to be spread between the uCDN and the dCDN. If the CDNs share their resources, they may benefit from dimensioning savings. For such a mechanism to work properly, the uCDN requires information in real time from a dCDN on the amount of traﬃc it can oﬄoad. Whereas for planned events, such as maintenance or special event distribution, a static resource reservation can be sufficient. Additionally, a CDNI provides means for resiliency against content delivery and acquisition failure. Deploying it, for cases in which the CSPs’ surrogates and origin servers are unavailable, allows delivery requests to be redirected towards another CDN. Similarly, with a deployed CDNI, if a default acquisition source fails, other sources within the interconnection, e.g. an alternate uCDN, can be used. This, in turn, provides load balancing between content acquisition sources.  Capability  A CDNI can be a means of extending a supported range of devices and network technologies if a CDN is not able to support them or if its provider is not willing to provide them. For example, a CDN provider may want to extend its portfolio of services to HTTP Adaptive streaming and/or IPv6 while supporting HTTP streaming and/or IPv4 only. This extension can be realized by interconnecting to a CDN that can provide the requested protocols. Similarly, an interconnection may enable a fixed-line CDN provider to extend its services to mobile devices. When a CDN provider runs many networks in different technologies, has a multi-vendor strategy or deploys separate networks for many CSPs an interconnection can ease its establishing technology and vendor interoperability by simplification or automatisation of some inter- CDN operations. Another use case would be an improvement of QoS and QoE for a CDN provider if an interconnection option with a network of surrogates closer to end users existed.  Interfaces in CDNI  The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) (see Standardisation status section) L. Peterson and B. Davie. Framework for CDN Interconnection. draft-ietf-cdni-framework-06 (Active Internet-Draft), October 2013. defines five interfaces required to interconnect a pair of CDNs from a technical perspective, as depicted in Figure 2. The interfaces are control plane interfaces operating at the application layer that aim to reuse or leverage existing protocols, e.g. HTTP, rather than to define a new one. This model of the CDNI does not define content acquisition, delivery, request interfaces and mechanisms because today CDNs already use standardised protocols for them, e.g. HTTP, FTP, rsync, etc. are used for content acquisition. The interconnection allows a number of CDNs to be connected in various topologies, such as line, mesh or start topology. It is important to note that in order to deploy a CDNI, additional business arrangements have to be established between the CSP and the uCDN and between the uCDN and the dCDN. At the time of this writing detailed operations of interfaces and the structure of exchanged objects are under standardisation process.B. Niven-Jenkins, F. Le Faucheur, and N. Bitar.

Request Routing Redirection Interface for CDN Interconnection. draft-ietf-cdni-redirection-01 (Active Internet-Draft), October 2013. The defined interfaces are briefly described as follows. A CDNI model as defined by the IETF.  Control interface (CI)  The CI is designed to initiate an interconnection across two CDNs and bootstrap the other CDNI interfaces. For example, the control interface can be used to provide the address of the logging server in order to bootstrap the logging interface, or it can be used to establish security associations for other interfaces. It can also allow an uCDN to preposition, revalidate or purge metadata and content on a dCDN.  Request routing redirection interface (RI)  Redirects and selects a delivery dCDN for a given user request. This interface provides loop prevention and detection mechanism for the served requests.  Footprint and capabilities advertisement interface (FCI)  Enables asynchronous exchange of routing information on capabilities and footprint to support dCDN selection for subsequent user requests. The union of the RI and FCI interfaces denotes the request interface.  Metadata interface (MI)  Allows a dCDN to provide content metadata from an uCDN. The metadata may include information on required authorization, geo-blocking, availability windows and delegation white- and blacklists. This information can, for example, limit the distribution to a given country or make content intended for adults available only in late-night hours. The collected metadata is used later for CDNI redirection and user content request responses.  Logging interface (LI)  Enables content distribution and delivery activity details to be exchanged via interconnection. Real-time exchange can be used for traﬃc monitoring and offline exchange can be used for billing of end user or billing between interconnected CDNs.  Downstream CDN selection criteria  For selection of a dCDN, the information on its footprint and capabilities is mainly used. The footprint can be specified with the use of IP subnets, autonomous systems (AS) numbers or country, state and code combinations.J. Seedorf, J. Peterson, S. Previdi, R. van Brandenburg, and K. Ma. CDNI Request Routing: Footprint and Capabilities Semantics. draft-ietf-cdni-footprint-capabilities-semantics-01 (Active Internet-Draft), October 2013. The capabilities describe features, services and states a CDN can or cannot meet and includes network and administrative capabilities, information about caches and the resources. The network information may disclose details on QoS or the supported streaming bandwidth. The administrative capabilities may inform on established limits and policies. The data about the caches may inform about the load and the available resources. The resource information may specify supported delivery technologies and content types, such as the ability to stream video to a particular device type. Given the information on footprint and capabilities, the uCDN may proceed to the initial selection of a dCDN—first on the basis of footprint and then on the basis of capabilities. However, such procedures may lead to suboptimal or incorrect decisions; for example when the dCDN is selected on the basis of footprint, it cannot provide the requested delivery technology. Therefore, a more approved procedure involves making the footprint information part of the capabilities requirements. Various protocols are considered for exchange of information on either footprint, such as BGP, on capabilities, such as HTTP, or on both footprint and capabilities, such as Application Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO).E. Stephan and S. Ellouze. ALTO session for CDN Interconnection. draft-stephan-cdni-alto-session-ext-04 (Active Internet-Draft), October 2013.  Redirection of content request in CDN  For user request redirection, two mechanisms, among others, are used in CDNs: mainly HTTP and DNS redirection. The HTTP method uses the HTTP redirection response, e.g. 302, containing a new URL to visit. Besides the option of changing the name of the server in the new URL, the URL can contain the name of the original server, which provides a means for an in-band communication. Moreover, the redirection mechanism can use the information on the IP address of a client, the requested content type or user agent for target surrogate selection. Unfortunately, change of a URL's domain will cause web browsers to not send cookies. The DNS redirection is completely transparent to the end user in comparison to the HTTP method. In the simple DNS redirection, the authoritative DNS server for the name returns an IP address based on the characteristic of a client. Which IP address is returned as a result depends, among other factors, on either the localisation of the end user or the surrogate server's load. There is another DNS redirection method in which the authoritative server returns a CNAME response. This forces the peer to restart the name lookup using a new name. To preserve the freshness of the redirection in case of cached DNS responses, an appropriate value of the time-to-live parameter is set. A drawback of this method is that DNS caches hide the end user's IP address. Both redirection methods, HTTP and DNS based, can be performed in the CDNI, either iteratively or recursively. The recursive redirection is more transparent for the end user because it involves only one UE redirection, but it has other dependencies on the interconnection realisation. A single UE redirection may be preferable if the number of interconnected CDNs exceeds two.  Exemplary operation of CDNI interfaces in content delivery  The sequence diagram presented in the figure below provides some details on CDNI and the iterative DNS redirection operation. In the depicted example, a UE downloads content from the address , which is primarily delivered by the CDN-A on behalf of a CSP with the address . An example of iterative DNS redirection of content request in CDNI. # Before any request redirection, the CDN-B (dCDN) announces information on supported footprint and capabilities. # The UE performs a DNS lookup for a server in the domain of the CSP from which it is going to download the content. # A request router in CDN-A (uCDN) servicing the domain processes the request and recognises, based on the source IP address of the request, that the end user could be better served by the dCDN. Therefore, it performs an inquiry in dCDN to determine if it is willing and able to serve this request. # If the dCDN is able to handle the request, the request router in uCDN returns a DNS CNAME response. This response contains a new domain, e.g. , indicating dCDN and the original domain and an NS record that maps this new domain to a request router in dCDN. # The UE does a DNS lookup using the new domain (). A request router in dCDN responds to this request with the IP address of a suitable delivery node. # The UE requests the content from the delivery node in dCDN. At this point, the delivery node receives the real IP address of the UE and the information on the requested content. If the redirections in previous steps were incorrect, the delivery node could perform a HTTP redirection. # If the metadata for content is not available in dCDN, the metadata interface is used to request it from the uCDN. # If the request is going to be served, i.e. metadata restrictions were met and a cache miss occurs, the delivery node in dCDN must start the acquisition process. The delivery node does a DNS lookup for an internal domain address . The uCDN recognises that the request is from a dCDN, rather than from a UE, and returns an IP address of a delivery node in the uCDN. # The content is delivered to the delivery node in dCDN from the delivery node in uCDN. # The content is delivered to the UE from the delivery node in dCDN. # After some time, the uCDN may instruct the dCDN to purge the content to ensure that it is not delivered again. # After the content is delivered a log of delivery actions is provided to the uCDN.  HTTP adaptive streaming  If addressed in CDNI specifications, support of HTTP adaptive streaming (HAS) R. van Brandenburg, O. van Deventer, F. Le Faucheur, and K. Leung. Models for HTTP-Adaptive-Streaming-Aware Content Distribution Network Interconnection (CDNI). RFC 6983 (Informational), July 2013. is particularly realised. Large objects are broken into a sequence of small, independent chunks, e.g. videos, that are perceived as if there were no relationship between the chunks. As a result, content acquisition and chunk purging are performed on a per-chunk basis. In order to reduce the CDNI load, specifications either allow relative Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) or modify absolute URLs in the manifest file of a resource distributed via HAS.  Security  The security of the CDNI is optional, and its support is introduced as a capability of a CDN. Security of the CDNI involves content confidentiality protection, authenticated peers communication and data origin authentication. The data origin authentication is of high importance if the trust of the link between CDN is questioned. The security is enforced by switching to secure versions of protocols deployed in the CDNI, e.g. HTTPS. Usually, if a CDNI is established via secure protocols, secure protocols are also used for content acquisition and distribution. Further issues related to security could be various end user privacy requirements in relation to the exchanged logs across different countries or authenticity of logs for delivery charging across CDNs. What consequences a security breakage would have depends on the interface and its function; for example, a corruption of the control interface could corrupt other interfaces, while a corrupted logging interface could enable a fraud in charging.  Standardisation status  A number of organisations and projects, i.e. IETF, European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS) and Open ContEnt Aware Networks (OCEAN), have been working or are working on the standardisation of CDNI interfaces and methods. There exist some mismatches and differences between the specifications in the defined interfaces as well as in terminology. The ETSI specifications Media Content Distribution (MCD); CDN Interconnection, use cases and requirements. Technical report, ETSI, 2012. TS 102 990. CDN Interconnection Architecture. Technical report, ETSI, 2013. TS 182 032. describe three CDNI interfaces. The first one, the interconnection control, seems to map on the union of ETSI's control and logging interfaces. The next one, the request and content control, seems to map in turn on the union of ETSI's request routing and metadata interfaces. The third one is the distribution of content interface. The OCEAN framework exhaustively specifies the open interfaces and processes of the proposed CDNI.D3.1 OCEAN Functional Architecture and Open Interface Specification. Technical report, OCEAN, 2012.Deliverable D2.2 Final requirements for Open Content Aware Networks. Technical report, OCEAN, 2013. The documents define additional business, acquisition and inner metadata interfaces. Further, the metadata interface as defined by the ETSI is split into two more specialised interfaces that, together, result in the reference model with nine interfaces. The paid ATIS standards and technical reports define specification of use cases and high-level requirements for a CDNI. According to the freely available abstracts these specifications cover, among other aspects, the interconnection of two CDN providers CDN Interconnection Use Case Specification and High Level Requirements.

It tells the story of Sune Andersson during the autumn term year in where he turns 9. The book was the first written by Anders and Sören all together. Several of the church- and Christmas-based stories were used for the 1991 Swedish TV Advent calendar Sunes jul. Book cover The book cover depicts Sune and \\"Svarta Mannen\\", standing on each side behind an outhouse. Plot Sune is a 3rd grader at Söderskolan, and the book opens with depicting the Andersson family. The opening chapter closes with Sune thinking back on what happened during the summer that past behind, when he was to a summer camp. The book then jumps backwards, depicting Sune and Joakim going to camp, for Sune it's the first time and he has been to a hike before and thinks it'll be fun, but Joakim has been to hikes before. The camp lasts for six days, and is split up in different hikes with circa 60 children aged 6–14. Sune and Joakim are to canoeing, and Joakim says there are crocodiles in the water, who have to be hit with the paddle, and when Sune says no crocodiles exist in Sweden Joakim insists. Joakim's mother Siw drives Sune and Joakim in a car to \\"Byholmen\\", a place in the woodlands where the camp will occur. Rumors say \\"Svarta Mannen\\" (\\"Dark Man\\") is there, pulls up tent pegs, frightens children with \\"hemlängtanbaciller\\" (\\"homesickness bacilli\\") and poisons the food. Sune thinks maybe camp leader Ulrik Bengtsson is Svarta Mannen. At the camp are also Simon, Jannika and Mirriam. During the first evening, twilight falls och Sune means he has seen Svarta Mannen in the woods, but camp manager Britt- Marie Rävberg says he doesn't exist, that it's just imagination and that homesickness can affect anyone. Sune now realizes that Joakim has made up the Svarta Mannen to avoid confessing his own homesickness. During the rest of the weak everything is fun, nobody talks of Svarta Mannen and not even when the canoe turns over hand his hair is filled with seagrass, Sune longs home. The book then continues with depicting Sune and Sophie kissing each other alone, when Håkan and Pär try to spy. They start a club, with the only ambition to reveal what Sunes and Sophie do. When Sune and Sophie are gone, Håkan and Pär hide in the wardrobe with a camera and a tape recorder. Sune and Sophie hear snoring from the wardrobe, and Sune think it's Svarta Mannen, but instead it's Håkan and Pär who have fallen asleep, and since that day, Sune and Sophie always check out the wardrobe first. In the autumn, the Andersson family go on a trip to an old castle to learn more history. Anna is not allowed to bring her boyfriend Lars-Olof. A bus appears and drops off schoolchildren next to a petrol station where the Andersson family stop, and Sune shows interest for Åsa Smörgåsa, who gives Sune a blown kiss. Sune offers Svenne (in the bus) two ice cream to change place, and Sune jumps into the bus, and Svenne goes into the Andersson family's car. Everything is revealed, Karin and Rudolf signal to the bus driver, who stops the bus. The trip continues, but is never depicted. When it's Sophie's birthday, Sune goes by bus into town to buy a present. After first believing he has ended up at the concert hall instead, as a man plays the accordion, he soon learns he is at the right place, the department store. Sune goes to a toy store where two guys check a cap gun that Sune purchases, and forgets the money for Sophie's present, a pink cloth cat. Sune steals the cloth cat and puts it in his inner jacket pocket, when discovering the store using camera surveillance. Sune is ashamed, but pays for the cap gun and nobody notices him stealing the cloth cat. Sune takes the bus home, and rings on Sophie' s doorbell and says he stole the cloth cat, while Sophie means he's a criminal, is ashamed and believes he will end up in prison. Sophie declares that's not the case, but stealing is outlawed in Sweden and that Sophie tells him to return the cloth chat, that she doesn't want. She also wants him o never do it again, or else she'll not be his best friend anymore. Sophie goes with him, and gives the table cloth and the cap gun to the store manager, so he can buy the cloth cat. The store manager pays he difference, five kronor, for Sune being \\"honest and brave\\", and having \\"such a kind and clever girlfriend . When Saint Lucy's Day approaches, Sune puts a boot as a star boy hat, and sings \\"Sankta Lucia, skänk mig en tia. Tian var trasig, lucian var knasig\\" (\\"Saint Lucy, give me 10 crowns. The 10 crown bill was broken, Saint Lucy was scatty \\"). The music teacher runs towards Sune and tells him to take the boot off, he doesn't need to wear a star boy hat. But when singing \\"Staffan var en stolledräng\\" (\\"Stephen was a fooly farmworker boy\\") he is sent to the classroom to draw, and soon the other students arrive to do Christmas decoration. Sune paints the headmaster, sitting in the sauna wearing a star boy hat at his penis. Sune puts the drawing at the headmaster's office door. Everyone laughs, and the headmaster rushes into the classroom, telling Sune drawing a star boy hat was unnecessary. Sune's little sister Isabelle is baptized in church, and Rudolf fears the name will be wrong. Anna declares that her religious studies-teacher has said baptism doesn't mean getting a name, but rather joining the parish. Since church is also called the \\"House of God\\" Sune thinks of God, and thinks of the church paintings as a comic book, while uncle Göran videotapes the baptism. The priest is female, Anna-Lena. When a sound from the church organ comes after being touched by Håkan, Sune turns worried for his little sister being baptized \\"Bröööl\\" (his perception of sound coming from the organ) fearing she'll be teased at school, but everyone just laughs. During the upcoming coffee break, they put on the videotape, but Göran took the wrong film, and instead a Tarzan movie appears on the screen, but Tarzan's shouting remind of the church organ's \\"Bröööl\\" sound. Rudolf says he's been offered a new job for a bigger company, getting better paid, if they move 15 miles away after New Year. In the other town lives Conny Bertilsson, and the Andersson's family met the Bertilsson's family last summer. The school in the other town is called Adolfinaskolan, next to a brook referred to as \\"Missipissifloden\\" (\\"Mississippi River\\"). Conny tells tall stories over the new school. Sune thinks he'll miss Sophie, and when he tells it she turns sad and starts crying, even if they will sometimes be able to see each other again. Because they think of marrying each other, they write a marriage contract, with Gud as witness. When not being able to agree over how many children they'll get, they call it their first marriage quarrel, and after that they kiss each other. The Andersson's family visits the new town, where they purchase a new house. Sune meets the Pär and Pål twins, who sing a swearing song, and Bengt-Göran, who Conny calls a \\"tattarunge\\" (\\"romani kid\\"), but Sune thinks saying that is stupid. This chapter also introduces the new school class, and the teacher Marie. Sune says goodbye to his old school class and gets a hug from Maria Perez, before going home baking gingerbread. Sune and Håkan fight, and Anna gets tired on them. Sophie shows up, and declares that tomorrow she will go to Småland and celebrate Christmas with her grandmother and grandfather on her parent's side, and will not return again until 5 January. Sune will move on 3 January. Both turns sad, but give each other Christmas presents, and Sune gives Sophie a diploma and a farewell poem for Sophie, and the final picture shows Sophie within a heart symbol and the words \\"Sophie for Ever\\" (in English). Audiobook Audio recordings were released to cassette tape by the Änglatroll label in 1990 on entitled \\"Sune och svarta mannen\\"., \\"Stjärniga gossen Sune\\". and \\"Sune gifter sig\\".

Barnum and transformed into the very successful Barnum's American Museum. Before Scudder The roots of the museum date back to 1791, when the \\"American Museum\\" was founded by John Pintard \\"under the patronage of the Tammany Society.\\"Westervelt, Harman C. John Pintard, The Chronotype (May 1873) It was located at 57 King Street, with Pintard serving as secretary and Gardner Baker (more of a showman between the two) as keeper. The museum was moved to a building at the intersection of Pearl and Broad streets by 1794 called the \\"Exchange\\". It occupied a thirty-by-sixty foot room with a high ceiling, and later opened a second room including a menagerie.Dennett, Andrea Stulman. Weird and Wonderful: The Dime Museum in America, pp. 14-17 (1997) It was called \\"Baker's American Museum\\" after Baker took control of it from the Tammany Society in 1795. Relying now only on ticket sales to finance operations, he raised admission prices and kept attempting to add new curiosities to draw visitors.The Old Merchants of New York City, Volume 2, p. 224-25 (1885) After Baker died in 1798, and his widow died in 1800, the collection was purchased by William I. Waldron. It then came into the hands of painter Edward Savage, who opened the \\"Columbian Gallery of Painting and City Museum\\" in 1802, and hired John Scudder to oversee the museum collection.  Scudder  The leftmost part of this 1861 lithograph shows a part of Scudder's American Museum (the letters \\"Museum\\" can be made out) in 1831, in its final location across from St. Paul's After earning money as a seaman, the collection became the property of John Scudder in 1809, and he opened \\"Scudder's American Museum\\" in March 1810 at 21 Chatham Street.

It was a high-wing monoplane, its wing supported centrally on a fuselage pedestal and braced on each side with a faired V strut from beyond mid-span to the lower fuselage. It was mounted without dihedral and was rectangular in plan apart from cropped aileron tips. The fuselage, rectangular in cross-section though with a rounded decking, was entirely fabric-covered. There was an open cockpit immediately ahead of the pedestal. Aft of the wing the fuselage tapered to the tail, where a triangular tailplane with rectangular elevators was placed on top of it. The fin was small and triangular and carried a straight-edged balanced rudder which extended down to the keel, operating in an elevator cut- out. The MF-1 landed on a conventional wooden skid fitted with rubber shock absorbers, assisted by a very small tail skid. Mantelli flew the MF-1 for the first time on 14 August 1934. Later that year he competed in it at Cantù in the Littoriali Contests.

A wet dock was constructed in 1842 which was 'the biggest enclosed dock in the United Kingdom' at the time. A major regeneration of the area has taken place since 1999. History=Initial work Laying of the First Stone, 26 June, 1839 by George Green Sampson, Mayor of Ipswich, Dykes Alexander, Treasurer of the Ipswich Docks Commission, Peter Bartholomew Long, Clerk, Henry Robinson Palmer, Vice-President of the Institute of Civil Engineers, David Thornbory, contractor. Drawing by Henry Davy.. In 1837 an Act of Parliament allowed the Ipswich Dock Commissioners to construct a new wet dock whilst also placing certain conditions on them. In addition to building the wet dock and providing a diversion for the river Orwell along a 'New Cut' to the west of the dock the commissioners were to allow all persons, with cattle and carriages, may thereby have free access to the dock and quays and the sides of the said new cut and channel and also to contribute to the health and recreation of the inhabitants [of Ipswich]. The Ipswich Dock Commission was provided with investment of £25,000 and the right to borrow a further £100,000 but needed a further loan of £20,000 and also an additional levy of six pence per tonne on all imported coal to fund the project.Twinch (2009), page 94 The dock opened in 1842; the original lock gates entered the dock from the New Cut opposite Felaw Street. The new custom house (now known as the 'Old Custom House') was completed in 1845. The development attracted new industries to the dock area such as the coprolite factory founded by Edward Packard in 1849. This factory gave its name to Coprolite Street in the docks area. Renovation following 1877 Act Map showing the quays to the north and east of the dock and part of the New Cut - 1884 Map showing the New Cut, the lock gates, the promenade and the griffin ferry - 1884 Map showing the original lock gates 1884 The Ipswich Docks Act of 1877 allowed for the construction of a new lock in their present position to facilitate access to the dock and allow trams to operate along the length of the 'Island' between New Cut and the dock. The new lock gates were constructed by the time of the 1898 Act which authorised the construction of a swing bridge. Ipswich Docks Act of 1913 allowed for the construction of a new entrance to the docks comprising inner and outer gates and a swing bridge, a quay and various tramways and also allowed for the 'stopping off' of various rights of way. There was however a condition that work had to be completed within 10 years and following World War 1 an extension was granted by an Act of Parliament in 1918. 1950-1973 The Ipswich Dock Act 1971 authorised the development of the West Bank to allow ro- ro ships to dock. The Ipswich Dock Commission was reconstituted as the Ipswich Port Authority in 1973Suffolk County Council (2009a), para 73 when the first stage of the development was completed, further work was carried out in 1977 and 1979 and then again in 1998.

This listing recognises the building's special architectural or historic interest. History This structure was built in 1719, and founded as a charity school by Henry Raine (1679–1738), who had made a large sum of money from selling alcohol. As a devout Christian, he felt that he should be philanthropic, and decided to found a school where poor children could get a free education. This school was built in the neighbourhood where he lived and he named it \\"the Lower School\\". It originally accommodated 50 boys and 50 girls.Website of the Anglican parish of St George- in-the-East with St Paul (accessed June 10, 2015). In recent years, this building has been used as a community centre, and as offices of the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields. The original school moved, and is now called the Raine's Foundation School, on Approach Road, Bethnal Green. Physical features The building has a baroque front, with giant pilasters.Cherry, Bridget et al. London: East, p. 29 (Yale University Press, 2005). There is a stone plaque over the door, at the center of the building: \\"Come in & learn your duty to God & man. 1719\\". Two of the window openings on the second floor have pedimented niches. Those niches were originally occupied by two contemporary figures of a boy and a girl, but they and other original objects from the school were moved when the school moved, and they are still preserved. The niches are now filled by replicas.

The company was founded by Godfrey Cohen in 1931, and has since grown to approximately 200 company and franchise- owned stores combined across Australia and New Zealand.  History  Godfrey Cohen founded the first Godfreys store in 1931 in the Prahran Market, Melbourne, simultaneously revolutionising the vacuum cleaner business in Australia. It wasn't long before John Johnston came across Godfrey Cohen's business, and the two quickly became business partners over a simple handshake that lasted for over 70 years. Over this period the business rapidly expanded within Australia as demand from customers increased after World War Two, and the product range grew from solely bagged vacuum cleaners to include steam mops, carpet shampooers, robotic vacuums, handstick vacuums, wet & dry vacuums, handheld vacuums, hard floor cleaners, garment steamers, backpack vacuums, floor polishers, carpet blowers, bagless vacuums, cleaning consumables and more including a range of anti-allergy, asthma and pet hair vacuum cleaners recognised by the National Asthma Council Australia as Sensitive Choice approved. Godfrey Cohen died in 2004 and Godfreys was sold to private equity companies Pacific Equity Partners and CCMP Capital Asia for $350 million in 2006. The company was relisted on the Australian Securities Exchange in 2014 at $2.75 per share, but was subsequently removed from the ASX in July 2018 after John Johnston, who first joined Godfreys in 1936 as a partner, proposed a private takeover of the company. His family company already owned 28% of the shares prior to this takeover.  Company overview  Godfreys consists of a combination of approximately 200 company and franchise stores in Australia and New Zealand. Together with their retail stores, Godfreys operates multiple service and repair centres across the two countries.  Brands  Godfreys currently holds the licence to distribute Hoover brand vacuum cleaners in Australia and New Zealand. In addition to the Hoover brand, Godfreys also owns the exclusive distribution rights to Wertheim, Vorwerk floorcare range, Pullman and Sauber cleaning products. Godfreys also supplies Nilfisk, Vax, Miele, Electrolux, Bissell, Black & Decker, Numatic and more cleaning machines for the domestic and commercial cleaning market.  Financing partnerships  Godfreys provides customers, both online and in store, with alternative payment options from Humm (since April, 2019), Afterpay & Openpay to bring more affordability to customers in the floorcare market.  Advertising  Godfreys has obtained brand awareness in Australia and New Zealand through many years of similar television advertisements featuring John Hardy.

It was built in 1865-1939, designed by F. H. Pownall. The church was the first Anglican mission to the poor of London. Work was begun in 1856 by the Revd Charles Lowder MA and a group of priests, all were members of the Society of the Holy Cross. The Society had been founded a year earlier with the express purpose of banding priests to a common rule of life and prayer in mission service. Wapping was one of the poorest districts in London, a haunt of prostitutes and petty criminals, living alongside those who earned a precarious living from the docks. Lowder’s work began in Lower Well Alley (now the park by the James Orwell sports centre) and moved to an iron church in Calvert Street (now Tench Street). Lowder's group of Clergy and Sisters provided practical care through schools, clubs, cheap canteens and child care and spiritual care through a wide range of services, centred on the Mass at the Mission Churches. Interior In 1866 the new Church of St Peter was consecrated. Soon afterwards cholera struck the East End. Lowder organised Sisters of Mercy and others to care for the sick and raised funds for a tented hospital. The Priests and Sisters took great risks and worked without stint for the people of Wapping. At the end of the cholera people were calling Lowder, ‘the Father’ because he seemed like the father of the whole community. After Lowder's death in 1880, Maurice Bingham Adams was engaged to design extensions in his memory. In 1884-94 a mortuary, chapel and baptistry were all added. Further work was done to the church in the 1930s, and finished in 1940, only to be immediately destroyed by a bomb in the Blitz. Repairs were completed in 1949. The church was completely renovated in 1985.

It was founded in 1825, initially dealing in textiles. Later it branched out into opium, tea, timber and petroleum. The company was closely associated with Matheson & Company of London and Jardine Matheson & Co. of Hong Kong. Early years Jardine, Skinner & Co. was founded in 1825 in Bombay. The early partners of Jardine Skinner were from Scotland, as were the partners of many of the British managing agencies of Bombay and Calcutta. Kinship ties were important, with new members often drawn from Scottish relatives. In 1844 the company was reformed in Calcutta by David Jardine and Charles B. Skinner. David Jardine (1819-1853) was the eldest son of William Jardine's sister Margaret. Jardine Skinner was a merchant and also became a shipping agent and shareholder in shipping companies. The company imported cotton goods from Manchester and Glasgow, and exported indigo, silk, and later jute. Their agents in Glasgow were James Ewing & Co., and their agents in Manchester were Matheson & Scott. The latter was associated with Matheson & Company of London and Jardine Matheson of Hong Kong. Jardine Skinner and Jardine Matheson were not legally connected, although both used the facilities of Matheson & Co., which James Matheson founded in 1848 after he returned from China. Opium trade With high levels of competition in the textile trade, Jardine Skinner earned additional income by shipping opium to Jardine Matheson in China. While Jardines carried opium for the larger suppliers, Apcar and Company catered to many smaller local dealers. With slower boats, the Apcars charged much lower rates than Jardines, ranging from Rs8 to Rs10 per chest compared to upward of Rs28 per chest charged by Jardines. The Apcars and Jardine Skinner also exported opium to Singapore for use by the Chinese in the Malay Peninsula or for distribution to other locations in southeast Asia. There were two types of opium, Bengal opium and Malwa opium, produced by private growers in central India and Rajputana. In the early years Jardine Skinner had to deal with fluctuations in both quality and quantity, but strict controls later helped standardize the product. In 1856 a risk emerged from P&O;, who appeared to be trying to enter and dominate the opium trade by undercutting the rival companies. The companies managed to strike a deal to retain the current rates. By 1860 Jardine Skinner and Jardine Matheson dominated the opium trade. Later expansion Jardine Skinner was one of the more prosperous of the British trading houses in India, but was relatively small. In the 1845–48 period it operated with a liquid capital of just £100,000. In the 1850s the company was the agent for the large Glasgow merchant house of J & A Dennistoun, which was active in England, France, the USA and Australia. In the late 1850s Matheson and Company was appointed Jardine-Skinner's principal agent in London, handling imports of commodities such as tea, rice, silk, cotton, jute and indigo. In the early 1960s Jardine Skinner represented J. Ewing and Company of Glasgow, the turkey-red dyers. By 1860 Jardine Skinner were conducting a large trade in tea, and later they expanded into timber and petroleum. Jardine Skinner entered into joint ownership arrangements with Matheson & Co. of a number of tea estates in the early 1860s. In the 1880s Jardine Skinner was profitable, but only making a return of 2% – 3% on capital. The original indigo and silk filature businesses were no longer profitable, and the company was looking for new ways to deploy its capital. Capital rose to £1.3 million by 1890. The company had to weather financial crises in 1848 and 1866, supported by credit from Matheson & Co., and in 1890 returned the favor when Matheson found itself in difficulty. The company was among the most influential of the agency houses that dominated the Bengal Chamber of Commerce, after Andrew Yule and Company and Bird and Company. By 1890 Jardine Skinner controlled six jute mill companies out of a total of twenty-one in India. With ample capital, the company was having difficulty finding investment opportunities. Jardine Skinner was the fourth largest jute mills operator in 1910-11 after Bird and Company, Thomas Duff and Company and Andrew Yule. The jute trade suffered at times from oversupply. Jardine Skinner was among the major Calcutta firms whose representatives met in London on 10 October 1911 to discuss setting up a cartel to regulate the trade. In the early 20th century the laws governing companies in India were relaxed, making it possible for firms like Jardine Skinner to control large numbers of publicly traded enterprises with very little capital outlay. Jardine Skinner would typically run the companies they controlled as if they were subsidiaries, dispensing with boards of directors. In 1946 Jardine Skinner merged with George Henderson to form Jardine Henderson. At first the Jardine and Steuart families controlled the new firm, although the Mehta family held 40% of the shares. In the early 1970s the majority of shares were transferred to Indians as the main British shareholders died. As of 2016 Jardine Henderson was a pest control company based in Kolkata. The company also had interests in real estate, tea gardens and marketing, carton manufacturing and printing.

McCombie was born in Tillyfour, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, the son of Charles McCombie and his wife Anne, née Black. McCombie arrived at Melbourne (then in the Port Phillip District of New South Wales) in April 1841. 1845 he was a member of the committee appointed at a public meeting held in Melbourne on 28 September to frame a petition to the Imperial Parliament in opposition to the proposal of New South Wales to pledge the credit of Port Phillip for an immigration loan for her own benefit. McCombie was one of the first members of the Melbourne Town Council. In 1846 he took an active part in exerting pressure on the Superintendent of Port Phillip, Charles La Trobe, to expend the moneys voted by the Sydney Legislature for public works in Melbourne, and which La Trobe had withheld owing to his distrust of local administration. On 15 June McCombie submitted the following motion to the Council, which was carried by nine votes to five: \\"That the Legislative Committee be instructed to prepare an humble petition to her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen praying for the removal of Charles Joseph La Trobe, Esq., from the office of Superintendent of the district of Port Phillip on account of his systematic mismanagement of the money voted for the service of the province, his neglect of public works of paramount consequence, and his repeated breaches of faith in his official transactions with this Council in matters of high public importance.\\" On 3 August following McCombie presided at a great public meeting held in Melbourne, when a resolution was carried for the despatch of a petition to the Home Government for the removal of La Trobe. The petition was courteously acknowledged, but not acted on. In 1848 McCombie took an active part in what was known as the non-election movement, under which it was proposed to abstain from sending members from Port Phillip to the Sydney Legislature. As, however, a local candidate persisted in standing for the city of Melbourne, McCombie proposed the nomination of Henry Grey, 3rd Earl Grey, and he was returned by a large majority. In the outside districts the non- electionists were not so successful. They put the Duke of Wellington, Lords Palmerston, Brougham, and John Russell, and Sir Robert Peel in nomination for the five seats, but in the result five local candidates were returned. On the subject of these proceedings McCombie addressed lengthy letters to Hawes, the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, and to Lord John Russell. He also took an active part in the anti-transportation movement, subscribing a hundred guineas towards the funds of the Australasian League in 1851. Though McCombie had been one of the most prominent advocates of the separation of Port Phillip from New South Wales, he was not elected to the mixed Legislative Council when in 1851 the colony of Victoria was constituted. In 1856, however, when responsible government was conceded, McCombie was returned to the Upper House for the Southern Province. He was a member of the second John O'Shanassy Ministry without portfolio from March 1858 to October 1859. Latterly McCombie eschewed public life, and was connected with the press in Geelong. He was the author of, New Plan of Colonial Government (1845); Waste Land Acts Considered (1846); Australian Sketches, reprinted from Tait's Magazine (1847); History of the Colony of Victoria (London, 1858). He also tried his hand at writing fiction. His two best known novels are, Arabin: or, The Adventures of a Colonist in New South Wales (1845), and, Frank Henly: or, Honest Industry Will Conquer, (1867).William H. Wilde, Joy Hooton & Barry Andrews, The Oxford Companion to Australian Literature, OUP, Melbourne, 1986, p.34-5, 437. In March 1868, McCombie was elected to the lower house seat of Gippsland South, which he held until resigning around March 1869. In 1869 McCombie sailed with his family aboard the Talbot bound for London. After suffering greatly McCombie died on 2 October 1869 in Scotland aged 50; he was survived by his wife and two daughters of their four children.

Commissioned by Paul Sacher for the Basel Chamber Orchestra, it reflects intense impressions, from both the composer's personal life and the political events of the time. The Concerto is structured upon the concerto grosso, the three movements scored as 1. Poco Allegro, 2. Largo, 3. Allegro; its outer movements are characterized by a mood of anxiety expressed through syncopated rhythms, while its Largo centres upon a defiant, declamatory statement; the concerto as a whole lasting circa 21 minutes in total. The cover of the manuscript score bears the dedication to my dear friend Paul Sacher to commemorate the quiet and fearful days spent at Schönenberg amongst the deer and the threat of the war. http://www.martinu.cz/en/news/598-double-concerto-in-munich-with-juraj- valcuha/ Martinů finished the last movement of the sketch on the same day of the signing of the Munich Treaty. It was first performed by the Basel Chamber Orchestra conducted by Paul Sacher in Basel in February, 1940; Martinů travelled from Paris to attend the Basel performance, despite the difficult international situation. The Swiss composer Arthur Honegger was among the audience of its first performance. Other contemporary compositions with a similar instrumentation as Martinů's Double Concerto are Bartók's Divertimento for String Orchestra, also commissioned by Paul Sacher for the Basel Chamber Orchestra in 1938, and Sir Michael Tippett's Concerto for Double String Orchestra (1938–39).

It tells the story of Bert Ljung during the calendar year he turns 15 during the autumn term in the 9th grade at school in Sweden. The book only uses chapter titles, but no names. The book also introduces a new concept, \\"Dagens dikt\\" (\\"Poem of the day\\"), a poem connected to the chapter plot. Book cover The book depicts a short-haired Bert, wearing a red sweater, sitting on a stool at Christmastime looking into the mirror. His pet turtle Ove lies on his neck. Next to a Christmas tree, with its roots placed in a jar, and on the floor is a broken, heart-shaped, gingerbread with the letters B + G (Bert + Gabriella). Plot Bert has started the 9th grade at school, and has love problems. No longer, he feels ashamed for liking Gabriella, since she has started the 7th grade. Before a PE lesson, the girls of the class have forgotten closing their door to the changing room. Bert walks past, staring, when suddenly Sanna shows up and pulls up Bert's shorts. Åke has fallen in love with Isabella Riez in class 9F, who comes from El Salvador, and hates Europe meaning they started up everything mean on Earth, like colonies, black slave, industry and English (a school subject where Åke has bad notes). In class 9F, Åke also has a friend called Douglas. At a toilet, Bert notices someone has written a telephone number to call once you want to have sex. Calls, and think Gabriella is behind, but soon learns it's the number to Travtjänst. Klimpen makes a short return from Motala, now as a member of religious organization \\"Lennarts ord\\", before returning to Motala. In Heman Hunters, it's fought over which music the band will play. Åke turns 15 years old and gets a moped. Bert's classmate gets cancer, but the doctors managed to save him, and Bert and his friends visit him at the hospital. Meanwhile, Beckaskolan is appointed Sweden's most moldy school. Around Saint Lucy's Day, Bert writes over Åke driving engine tuned moped, and throws it into the lake of Nöckeln, later reporting it stolen. Bert also joins the school choir because Gabriella does. Bert also describes the market day Höstskojet in Öreskoga, when the guys they have teased last year now want revenge, but this year Björna isn't there to defend them, since he is a hospital. At the market is also a \\"test your might\\"-punching ball, where Bert gets two points and is appointed \\"-En fjärt\\" (\\"-a flart\\"), while Hannu Vresi Määrkku in class 7D wins with 390 points, and is appointed \\"superstarkt muskelberg\\" (\\"superstrong muscle-mountain\\"). Bert also loses an amateur wrestling match against Lill-Erik. Bert also visits Dalecarlia for a bass seminar, and being out of money, he stands alone by the country road hitchhiking home. Hoping to ride with some hot girls, but instead encounters a German family with an Audi car on their way to Öreskoga to visit some friends, dropping off Bert at the town square. The book closes on Christmas Eve (24 December). Bert has gotten a parcel with condoms by his grandmother for Christmas present. Bert also talks over telephone with Nadja. Nadja thinks Bert has grown, and reminds Bert over feeling ashamed for his name, pretending his name was Åke (see Berts dagbok).

He, along with Prof. R. Y. Sharp, are the founders of generalized fractions, a branch in theory of commutative algebra which expands the concept of fractions in commutative rings by introducing the modules of generalized fractions. This topic later found applications in local cohomology, in the monomial conjecture, and other branches of commutative algebra.  Biography  Zakeri was born in Urmia, the capital of West Azerbaijan Province. He was accepted in Sharif University of Technology as a top student and studied Electrical Engineering there for a few months. But he then resigned due to family's financial status. He worked as a schoolteacher for 3 years before choosing mathematics as his major and he completed his B.S. in University of Tabriz (1968 to 1972). He then studied his M.Sc. in the Institute of Mathematics of Kharazmi University in Teheran, directed at the time by Prof. Gholamhossein Mosaheb (1972 to 1974). He then did another M.Sc. (1979 to 1980), and a Ph.D. degree (1980 to 1982) under supervision of Prof. R. Y. Sharp in University of Sheffield, England. His thesis title was \\"Modules of Generalized Fractions and Their Applications in Commutative Algebra\\" which is the first published paper on the topic. Zakeri is currently retired and works part-time. He was married to Parivash Tousheh in 1974. They have a daughter and a son. Academic career Zakeri was the head of department of mathematics of Tarbiat Modares University (1988 to 1990), head of the Institute of Mathematics of Kharazmi University (1991 to 1994), head of mathematics section of Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (1994 to 1996), and head of the commutative algebra research team in that institute (1994 to 1999). Zakeri has been named the father of commutative algebra of Iran in 2012, for his efforts and contributions in Commutative Algebra to Iranian mathematical community. The 10th seminar of \\"Commutative Algebra and Related Topics\\" of Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (December 2013), and the 24th Iranian Algebra Seminar (November 2014), were held in honor of him and as appreciation of his work. Zakeri has supervised 81 M.Sc. students, and 22 Ph.D. students until now. He has 34 published papers, most of which related to Generalized Fractions. In general there are more than 120 published articles (by him or others) citing Generalized Fractions in their content.

It was established in 1927 and closed in 1932. Meiklejohn proposed the idea for an alternative college in a 1925 Century magazine article. The magazine's editor- in-chief, Glenn Frank, became the University of Wisconsin's president and invited Meiklejohn to begin the college within the university. Despite pushback from the faculty, the college opened in the fall of 1927 with a self- governing community of 119 students and less than a dozen faculty. Students followed a uniform curriculum: Periclean Athens for freshmen and modern America for sophomores. The program sought to teach democracy and to foster an intrinsic love of learning within its students. The college's students became known as free spirited outsiders within the university for their different dress, apathetic demeanor, and greater interest in reading books. The college's demographics were unlike the rest of the university, with students largely not from Wisconsin and disproportionately of Jewish and East Coast families. The college developed a reputation for radicalism and wanton anarchy, especially within Wisconsin. The students lived and worked with their teachers, called advisers, in Adams Hall, away from the heart of the university. They had no fixed schedule, no compulsory lessons, and no semesterly grades, though they read from a common syllabus. The advisers taught primarily through tutorial instead of lectures. Extracurricular groups, including philosophy, law, and theater clubs, were entirely student-led. The Great Depression and lack of outreach to Wisconsinites and UW faculty led to the college's slow decline. Enrollment decreased every year since the program began, which its statewide reputation exacerbated. After his son was expelled in 1931 by dean and Experimental College critic George Sellery, Meiklejohn recommended the college's dissolution. Public criticism of the college included student radicalism, lack of discipline, administrative issues, and financial issues. Meiklejohn wrote a retrospective of the college, which philosopher John Dewey reviewed favorably and noted for its contribution to educational philosophy. University of Wisconsin faculty and regents voted to dissolve the college in May 1932. Some advisers stayed to teach in the university, and Meiklejohn remained briefly before moving to Berkeley. The Experimental College influenced programs internal to the university, and was the precursor to its Integrated Liberal Studies undergraduate program.  Background  Time magazine In June 1923, Alexander Meiklejohn had been asked to step down as president of Amherst College. He was recruited specifically to revitalize the college a decade earlier with the views on education for which he was known. Meiklejohn announced curriculum reform with a singular focus on \\"understanding human life as to be ready and equipped for the practice of it\\", and subsequently made the humanities coursework more interdisciplinary, added social sciences courses, and attracted new faculty members interested in the Socratic method. Meiklejohn had student support, but clashed with senior faculty and alumni, and was ultimately removed due to his administrative mismanagement and not his educational reforms. Meiklejohn resolved to open a new, experimental liberal arts college in late 1924, but struggled to find funding. Seeking $3 million for the venture, he was rejected by Bernard Baruch and Abraham Flexner but through support from The New Republic Herbert Croly was offered planning funds from the magazine's main benefactor. The planning team included journalist Mark Sullivan, New School professor Alvin Johnson, and The Century Magazine editor-in-chief Glenn Frank. Frank had previously published Meiklejohn's work and was sympathetic to his cause. In January 1925, Century published Meiklejohn's plan for a new and \\"experimental\\" college, \\"A New College: Notes on a Next Step in Higher Education\\". The proposed college would have a \\"unified\\" two-year curriculum and closer ties between faculty and students, who were to be \\"coequal partners\\". Meiklejohn called for a small school with a maximum of 35 professors and 300 students, with tutorial as the chief means of instruction. The planned program eschewed division by academic discipline and preferred holistic study of human civilization, particularly ancient Athens and the contemporary United States. The school sought to foster students who understood themselves in the context of their surrounding society as a \\"total human undertaking\\". Meiklejohn wanted students who would independently volunteer to live in self-governance. Meiklejohn biographer Adam Nelson wrote that for the 1920s, this idea of voluntary interest in study \\"seemed almost laughable\\". The augmented liberal arts program was a departure from vocational education trends of the time, as was its emphasis on smaller classes in a time of large lectures for burgeoning college populations. Frank stepped down from the magazine in May 1925 to become the incoming president of the University of Wisconsin (UW). He invited Meiklejohn to open his school there and offered him a distinguished professorship. Meiklejohn planned the experimental college in secret and moved to Madison in January 1926 to teach in the philosophy department. Meiklejohn finished his experimental college proposal by April 1926. It was similar in style to his Century article and became codified as the Experimental College based on its colloquial reference in correspondence between Meiklejohn and Frank. Meiklejohn presented his proposal to the All- University Study Commission convened by Frank \\"to investigate the first two years of liberal college work\\". The university faculty received the proposal apprehensively, and criticized its vagueness, lack of control group, costliness, and effect on their livelihoods. It was eventually approved on the condition that the faculty could review its details and regular progress. The Wisconsin legislature approved two years of funding, and the Experimental College was scheduled to open in fall 1927. Meiklejohn prioritized compatibility in his staff selection, and so hired ten of his friends who could work in \\"intimate fellowship\\". The college received hundreds of faculty applications in the summer of 1926, and the final makeup included six from Amherst, two from Brown, and one from Scotland, mostly in idealist philosophy and labor economics disciplines. The team met through the winter and into the 1927 spring to plan the program. They received 119 applications even though the program was unadvertised. Half of the applicant pool was interested in working with Meiklejohn specifically, and he was excited to work with \\"an entirely self-selected and therefore truly democratic community of learning.\\"  Program  Meiklejohn's Experimental College proposal called for two years of compulsory and interdisciplinary study of civilizations: ancient Athens for freshmen, and contemporary America for sophomores. The plan had students and teachers living and working together in the same residence hall with no fixed schedule, no compulsory lessons, and no semester grades, but a common syllabus. Their only grade was to be the single final exam. The college aimed \\"to inspire students to want to learn\\" and to teach democracy through \\"the intrinsic value of learning\\" over bribery, coercion, and physical violence. Meiklejohn and Frank (center) among the Experimental College advisers, March 15, 1928 The teachers, called advisers, would instruct via small, weekly tutorials and occasional schoolwide lectures on their personal research. Adviser appointments were split with two-thirds in the Experimental College and one-third in the rest of the university, a compromise between Meiklejohn and the College of Letters and Sciences. The program's budget and appointments were negotiated directly with President Frank, bypassing the UW College of Letters and Science and its dean, George Sellery. Meiklejohn saw books as the main instrument of a liberal education, and chose a great books curriculum so as to model the human intellect he wished to impart and to connect the timeless philosophical questions that occupy all such works. He wanted his college to read the same books and to debate the same questions simultaneously. Meiklejohn did not prefer one \\"great book\\" over another and saw them as interchangeable and in pursuit of the same essential questions about goodness, justice, and truth. Freshmen studied ancient Athens in the age of Pericles, reading authors such as Aeschylus, Herodotus, Homer, Plato, Thucydides, and Xenophon. Meiklejohn's curriculum accentuated the author's thoughts behind the work as related to general questions about society, and forwent emphasis on the texts themselves. Plato's The Republic was the freshman year capstone, as \\"the apex of literary and philosophical achievement in ancient Athenian thought\\" and the book that best embodied their civilization. Meiklejohn asked the students to synthesize how the contents of their first year were \\"interrelated in the experience of the individuals and of the community as a whole\\". Over the summers, Meiklejohn assigned Middletown studies where students drew conclusions about American society based a view of their hometowns as typical of society. The returning sophomores were expected to exhibit self-regulation as the primary regulator of their understanding, to educate themselves self-sufficiently, and to wean themselves of the college institution. This freedom was taught so as to empower students towards independence while the advisers continued to hold pedagogical power. Henry Adams's The Education of Henry Adams was the sophomore year capstone, chosen for its complexity, self-criticism, and study of modern America's development. Meiklejohn biographer Adam Nelson compared the Ex College curriculum and Adams's autobiography as both lamenting \\"the tragedy of lost spiritual and intellectual unity\\" and enabling students to relate \\"their literary and lived experiences\\".  Extracurriculars  Cast of the Experimental College's fall 1928 production of Lysistrata All extracurricular groups were student-led. Clubs included the Philosophy Club (held weekly at Meiklejohn's house), the Law Group, the Forum, and the Experimental College Players (a theater troupe). The Philosophy Club discussed topics such as the self and the relation between philosophy and science, for which Meiklejohn invited Clarence Ayres from Amherst to speak. The Law Group discussed liberty, state action, and laissez- faire, while the Forum discussed current events like war, behaviorism, and imperialism. The Players performed classical plays including Antigone, The Clouds, Euripides's Electra, and Lysistrata, which caused a particular stir for its cross-gender acting in erotic scenes. The English department chair and dean of women both castigated President Frank for letting the play run. Meiklejohn also invited several prominent speakers, including Bertrand Russell, Clarence Darrow, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Lewis Mumford.  Facilities  College men in the Adams Hall den, December 15, 1927 The College was based in Adams Hall, where students and their advisers lived and worked by the shore of Lake Mendota (except for Meiklejohn, who lived in a large house several blocks away). Adams Hall was constructed in 1926, with a Renaissance-style quad and eight identical divisions, each with its own common room, den, and facilities for 30 students, two advisers, and a fellow. The surrounding facilities afforded abundant sporting opportunities, and the site offered distance from the city and university. The students shared part of Adams Hall with non-Experimental College students, and the nearby common dining hall with the UW students in Tripp Hall. The other students were said to be bothered by the Experimental College's disregard for property, rambunctiousness, noise, and dining hall biscuit fights.  Rise  The first class arrived in fall 1927. The incoming Experimental College class was more diverse than the larger university's population. One third of students hailed from Wisconsin (as opposed to 90 percent in the university), most were from urban areas (the East Coast had particularly strong representation), one third were second-generation immigrants, and Meiklejohn estimated their Jewish population at 40 percent. The College was all-male, due in part to space availability and the regents' refusal of mixed-sex living arrangements, in keeping with American college conventions. The students were largely well- versed in current affairs, with higher scores on entrance exams and lower high school grades than their UW counterparts. Meiklejohn appreciated the challenges of reconciling this diversity and related this task to those facing the country's democratic governance. The first Experimental College class, 1927 Meiklejohn recommended student government to the fall 1927 class, but they couldn't decide on its form and ultimately voted against government. Put another way, they democratically voted against democratic governance in favor of anarchy. This disappointed Meiklejohn, but he thought they would eventually change their minds. As freshmen struggled with the Athenian curriculum, he reverted to classification by academic discipline and offered companion texts in the field of the current work studied. In their dorms, the college students were known for their lack of respect for property, with three times the breakage in dorm assets than the rest of the university. Meiklejohn saw this as desirable and indicative of abetting nonconformity, and did not attempt to curb it. Meiklejohn had full reign over the college, so the university and its disciplinary proceedings could not intervene. Upon their exit two years later, students transferred to a number of Ivy League and prominent state universities. By this time, the college was known throughout the nation and Europe. The college was reputed to be a radical institution. A judge presiding over a case involving three students in a socialist march declared the school \\"a hotbed of radical activity\\". Meiklejohn bemoaned this characterization of his school and blamed the college's media prominence for disproportionate coverage of an avant-garde minority. Two such cases included a former student who announced his Communist Party gubernatorial bid from jail, and another who organized a labor march with the college's students that ended in a face-off described as \\"bearded 'Experimenters'\\" against varsity athletes \\"bent on 'smashing the heads of the Reds'\\". The Experimental College students acted differently from those of the rest of the university. They grew beards, wore their hair long, carried an air of apathy conspicuously, and did not tend as meticulously to their outward presentation. They developed a tradition of wearing dark blue blazers with pearl gray trim, emblazoned with the owl of Athena, worn in the \\"spirit of fellowship\\" and to set the college apart from the university. Many of the advisers (including Meiklejohn) were indeed progressive-minded activists. Despite their stereotypical \\"queerness\\", The Daily Cardinal reported in 1930 that a majority of Experimental College students participated in sport, and that a number joined intramural teams, pledged for Greek life, and joined campus clubs. However, the students abnormally read an average of 16 non-assigned books each semester and had an average of \\"only two dates a month\\", which the paper considered abnormal amid hints of homosexuality. As these claims became widespread, Meiklejohn imported psychiatrist Frankwood Williams from New York to study the students' sexual habits. He found the students to be \\"warped and twisted\\" as \\"normal for ... their age\\", praised the program for aiding their psychosexual growth where others inhibit, and concluded that the advisers made the students subservient to their demands even as they spoke in praise of student autonomy.  Decline  Freshman class, March 21, 1929 With the onset of the Great Depression in 1929, the Experimental College began a slow decline. Many students couldn't afford tuition, fewer had additional savings, and several dropped out. Along with books and campus salaries, the Experimental College became a budgetary luxury during a time of economic need for both students and the state, and its funding was in jeopardy. Meiklejohn started an Experimental College interest- fee loan fund for unfunded students, and asked advisers and monied students to donate. During this period, some sophomores absconded the college for two weeks to live like the vagrant hobos who traveled the Midwest by rail looking for work. They returned to write papers about their experiences, which Meiklejohn is said to have appreciated for its syncretism of experience and the great questions grounded in their readings. A 1930 faculty review of the curriculum questioned the program's focus and choice of civilizations. The advisers entertained the Enlightenment, Middle Ages, and Renaissance as alternatives to their ancient Athens curriculum, but ultimately did not change course. By early 1930, Meiklejohn began to show a loss of faith in the experiment and in education reform, chiefly in the ability to teach \\"rational self-criticism\\". Around the same time, Meiklejohn received letters from the Baraboo, Wisconsin, schools superintendent and a Baraboo judge noting the Experimental College's sordid reputation in the state and its habit of repelling \\"ordinary\\" students whose parents were uninterested in the ramifications of such an education. Within the community, a January 1930 student committee reported a widespread lack of individual responsibility in their living arrangements. Parents began to complain about the college's public esteem, the qualities forming in their sons, and the curriculum. The experiment was in ill repute. Enrollment dropped every year since the program's inception such that, when compounded by dropouts, the program was below half-capacity three years later. UW President Glenn Frank had warned of decreased enrollment in August 1928 and of its consequences for the college. UW College of Letters and Science Dean George Sellery offered support conditional on codified discipline and uniform final exams, which Meiklejohn refused. Sellery later refused to allow transfer students into the college. Meiklejohn wrote letters to Wisconsin high schools in April 1929 that acknowledged the college's stereotypes and welcomed demographic change, but the campaign backfired. He sent an adviser to tour the state and solve what he saw as a communication issue. The adviser found high school seniors largely interested in vocational training, and that the prospect of traditional college excited students to the point where they did not consider improvements upon that model. The adviser found students uninterested in the Experimental College's prospects. The locals saw Meiklejohn as an outsider. He was foreign to Madison in his politics, social life, and personality. Dean Sellery and President Frank's professional relationship was untrusting and contemptuous, which extended to Meiklejohn due to his close association with Frank. Sellery had the support of the faculty, who were envious of the Experimental College advisers' arrangements for higher salaries. In objection to the college's reputation for radicalism, the son of the man who endowed Meiklejohn's professorship revoked his funding. Frank needed the donor's support, and so the incident marked Frank's waning support for the college. Sellery spoke out against the Experimental College in the first quarter of 1929, and Frank attempted to fire him in response. In 1931, Sellery received letters from spies who found Meiklejohn's son Donald, a philosophy doctoral student at the university and a part-time Experimental College adviser, engaged in sex acts against university policy. Sellery pursued expulsion and denied Meiklejohn and his son's separate requests for a lesser punishment. A week later, Meiklejohn asked the advisers to close the college. Common public explanations for the college's closure include student radicalism, lack of discipline, administrative issues, and financial issues. The Nations Eliseo Vivas blamed its lack of grades as detrimental to student incentive, and judged the effort to create self-motivated students through freedom to be a failure. In School and Society, Professor Grant Showerman also credited the college's freedoms and lack of compulsions with its demise. Proponents of the Experimental College painted it as the foil of a conservative, standard college, and blamed educational stagnation on the existing order. Meiklejohn believed in a liberal education's power to change society through imagining alternatives to the status quo. He aimed to produce students who could counterbalance society with independence of thought, but admitted that he did not know how to facilitate this. The University of Wisconsin faculty and regents voted to end the Experimental College in May 1932. There was a farewell banquet for 250 guests in June 1932. Meiklejohn did not judge the college's success by its permanence, which he did not expect—he said he attempted the college as a test. Meiklejohn asked Sellery to give his graduate student advisers university assistantships, but was denied. Meiklejohn began to work on adult education in the University of Wisconsin Extension Division in July 1932, where some of the Experimental College's ideas took hold. He later moved to Berkeley. Advisers who stayed after the program's end—such as classicist Walter Agard, philosopher Carl Bögholt, and political scientist John Gaus—were known as popular and innovative, and Agard became the Classics department chair.  Legacy  Meiklejohn wrote a retrospective of the Experimental College during the first half of 1932. John Dewey reviewed the published book and declared it \\"a contribution to the philosophy of American education\\". He saw the college to be a true expression of liberal education as it fostered rational faculties and self-criticism, and noted the college's place in fighting norms on a much larger timescale. For its ability to produce free- thinkers in an age without similar values, Dewey found the college \\"a tragic success\\". St. John's College, Annapolis, Maryland, May 10, 1957 Experimental College alumni celebrated reunions in 1942 at the University of Chicago, in 1957 at St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland, and in 1962 back in Madison. At St. John's, Meiklejohn addressed the audience and read his favorite poets. Over a hundred alumni announced a fund for the Alexander Meiklejohn Award for Academic Freedom through the American Association of University Professors. At the Madison reunion, alumni announced the Alexander Meiklejohn Lectureship on the Meaning and Methods of Education for Freedom. Their reunions featured notably intellectual speakers, and would take on the air of their college discussions. Over the next two decades, Meiklejohn would return to speak in Madison at the behest of the Memorial Union Forum Committee and philosophy department. In The University of Wisconsin: A Pictorial History, Arthur Hove states that the Experimental College \\"had little discernible influence beyond the university\\", though it served as a prototype for the university's Integrated Liberal Studies (ILS) program, spawned interest in learning, and showed the university's role in making individuals as well as workers. Cronon and Jenkins' The University of Wisconsin: A History, 1925–1945 notes the college's recognition as the \\"best known example of [Wisconsin] curricular innovation\\" at the time, and blamed the college's closure on the depression but more so \\"the hubris of its architects\\" for not evangelizing its value to Wisconsinites and UW faculty. Cronon and Jenkins also saw the college's influence in Charles Russell Bardeen's fourth-year medical school preceptor program, the academic recommendations from the 1930 Fish and 1940 Daniels Committees, and the inception of Integrated Liberal Studies. Similar to the Experimental College, the Integrated Liberal Studies started in the late 1940s was a great books, liberal arts, tutorial curriculum. It was developed in part by Agard, the Classics professor and former Experimental College adviser. An English professor described ILS's ambience as that of a \\"small college\\" within a large university. Meiklejohn received an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from Madison in June 1964, where he was escorted by the first ILS director, Robert Pooley. A 1939 announcement described him as \\"one of the university's greatest teachers\\". Notable alumni include Victor Wolfson, a Broadway playwright and founder of the college's theater group.

His books sold more than five million copies worldwide and have been translated into twenty languages.  Life and career  Weiss was born in Hittisau, a remote village in Austria. He studied psychology, philosophy and sociology in Innsbruck and Vienna and graduated in 1976 with a PhD. His thesis about the horrible state of care in an Austrian psychiatric clinic caused a scandal. After legal disputes and an internal investigation the director of the clinic was dismissed. The PhD- theses led to widespread reforms in the psychiatric services in Austria. Hans Weiss completed his studies at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Vienna with an MA in sociology in 1978. In 1977 he got a four-month scholarship from the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to study psychiatric services in Italy. In 1978–79 he went to Cambridge, England, and London with a scholarship from the British Council to study the psychiatric services in England. His first book Gesunde Geschäfte (Healthy Business – about the malpractices of the pharmaceutical industry), written 1981 in collaboration with three colleagues, was an immediate bestseller in the German speaking world. For this book he worked as a salesman for the pharmaceutical companies Bayer and Sandoz and collected thousands of highly confidential files. Healthy business describes in detail how pharmaceutical companies bribe doctors and use patients as guinea pigs. His next book Bittere Pillen (Bitter Pills – risks and benefits of the most frequently used drugs), written 1983 in cooperation with the same colleagues as his first book, was an even greater success – with more than three million copies sold. This comprehensive reference work is updated every three years and is up to the present day used by patients and doctors alike. Since then, he wrote more than twenty books, as author or co-author, fiction and non-fiction. His main topics are unethical practices of multinational companies (The Black Book of Corporations), tax evasion tricks of global banks and companies (Antisocial Market Economy) and especially Medicine (Corrupt Medicine, The promises of the Beauty Industry). Between 1982 and 1984 he directed award-winning TV-documentaries for the Austrian Broadcast Corporation ORF. During the spring-term of 1989 he taught methods of investigation at the Institute for Journalism and Communications (University of Vienna). For his often daring investigations he posed as a salesman for drug companies, as a consultant for big pharmaceutical companies, doctor, import/export-dealer, heir of a wealthy company owner, prison psychologist and patient. Sometimes he is focussing his view on very small communities or on one person. For example, in the book \\"The People of Langenegg\\" (Die Leute von Langenegg), where he described life in the 1930s and 1940s in a remote Austrian peasant village. Occasionally he writes fiction. For example, the novel Kulissen des Abschieds (Scenery of the goodbye), published in 1999 by Ullstein Verlag/Berlin. In his fiction work he intertwines personal experience with historic facts, for example in the book Mein Vater, der Krieg und ich (My father, the war and I), which was published in 2005 by Kiepenheuer & Witsch in Cologne, Germany. For this publication he used the secret diaries his father wrote during military service in World War II and during the holidays in his village. His father was a simple soldier with an anti-Nazi attitude, stationed in Norway at the Russian Front and captured as a prisoner of war in France. His journalistic reports for the magazines Der Spiegel, Stern, Die Zeit or the Austrian newspaper Der Standard often caused heated political debates, for example the illegal employment of a nurse in the family of the Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel in 2006 or the lush farm subsidies to multimillionaires. In February 2018 he published a series of three articles in the German weekly Die Zeit, about the tax avoiding schemes of multinational companies in Austria. In 1994/95 he lived in New York City and attended classes at the International Center of Photography. In 1998 and 2011 he completed courses at the Schule für künstlerische Fotografie (School of Art Photography) in Vienna. His photographs were on show in group exhibitions in the Museum der Moderne in Salzburg (2012, Rupertinum Salzburg (2012), Fotogalerie Vienna (2011), Saline Hallein (2010), Palazzo Zenobio in Venice (2009) and various other places. Single exhibitions at \\"Deutsches Haus New York\\" (2015) and Soho Photo Gallery New York (2016, 2017 and upcoming October 2018). In 2014/15 he again lived in New York City and published the diary Große Träume (big dreams) about his everyday live.

It was fought on the 19th of June on a spot on the Shannonvale- Ballinascarty road known locally as the big cross, about 4 miles east of Clonakilty in West Cork. It was the only battle fought in the rebellion in Cork or indeed the whole of Munster. Prelude events in West Cork The attempted landing of a French invasion fleet in Bantry Bay in late 1796 shook the British establishment. In response, British troops were garrisoned all over West Cork. In early 1798, Major General Sir John Moore was given command of the 3,000 British troops in West Cork. A proclamation was issued that all weaponry (firearms and pikes) be handed up to either the military of local magistrates by the 2nd of May under an amnesty. Despite this, Moore issued orders for his troops to treat the locals as harshly as possible and to take any provisions they needed for three weeks. In May, British troops scoured West Cork searching for arms burning homes and generally terrorizing the common people. Moore himself wrote the moment a single redcoat appears, everyone flees. The official disarming of West Cork was completed by the 23rd of May. Moore and his troops had found 800 pikes and 3,400 firearms, and large numbers of suspected United Irishmen were arrested. Summer 1798 When the United Irishmen in Leinster, especially Wexford, rose in rebellion in late May and early June 1798, West Cork remained very quiet. Many of the British troops in West Cork were in fact Irish and were recruited from among the peasantry. There is strong evidence that the British troops may have had United Irishmen members or sympathizers among their ranks. Battle A detachment of the Westmeath militia was stationed in Clonakilty under Lieutenant Colonel Sir Hugh O'Reilly. On the afternoon of the 18th, Sir Hugh received orders that his troops were to transfer to Bandon, about 15 miles east of Clonakilty. Early on the morning of the 19th of June, the Westmeath militia, including two artillery pieces, were marching in column when they were confronted by a force of 300-400 United Irishmen, very lightly armed and mostly local peasantry, at a local crossroads known as the Big Cross under the command of a man named Tadhg an Astna O'Donovan. Much of what we know of the engagement comes from local folklore or from the pen of Sir Hugh. O'Donovan is said to have appealed to the mostly Irish troops and United Irishmen among the Westmeath militias ranks to join his party. He was instead met with gunfire, though the Westmeath militia's commanding officer Sir Hugh O'Reilly denied this happened. In the short engagement that followed, the United Irishmen who had few firearms were routed. The United Irishmen were also attacked by the Caithness Legion, a Scottish regiment relieving the Westmeath militia in Clonakilty. Casualties were heavy with at least 100 United Irishmen left dead, including O'Donovan, possibly shot in the back during an almost successful assault on the British position. With few British casualties after the battle the Yeoman cavalry dragged the bodies of the dead United Irishmen into Clonakilty town and left them in front of the town's market house for several days. They were later dumped in a local strand at a spot now known as the Croppy Hole, with their relatives recovering them afterwards. Public notices were placed, written in both Irish and English, urging the local people to yield up to justice their leaders and instigators, surrender all their illegal weapons, return to their habitations and resume their industrious employments.

The organizations of this Roundtable collectively represent ten million Americans, tens of millions of acres conserved, and hundreds of years of conservation experience.” Founded by Simon C Roosevelt, the Conservation Roundtable Conferences are sponsored by The Rockefeller Brothers Fund, and hosted each year by Mr. Roosevelt and Allison Whipple Rockefeller at the Pocantico Conference Center on the Rockefeller Family estate. According to Dale Hall, CEO of Ducks Unlimited, \\"The primary purpose is to bring together the leadership of major non-government organizations to see how we can focus on substantive issues that we all share.\\" Former efforts include the publishing of an open letter to President Obama, Congressman John Boehner and Senator Harry Reid in Politico to encourage government “to find practical ways to make stewardship today more inclusive, concerted, and effective.” While the Conservation Roundtable consists of non-government organizations, the group works alongside politicians and government offices. Most recently, a meeting of the Conservation Roundtable convened at the Department of the Interior under the auspices of the Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, co-hosted by Roosevelt, bringing together an even larger group of private conservation organizations and the senior most officials in the Department. The purpose of the meeting was to advance collaborative thought and action on both the interior department’s agenda and priorities of the NGOs.

A specialist sprinter, she is best known for winning the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Sprint in 2012 and 2013. Unraced as a two-year-old she showed good form as a three-year-old in 2011, winning three races including the Gardenia Stakes. In 2012, she emerged as a world-class sprinter, winning the Madison Stakes, Humana Distaff Handicap, Presque Isle Downs Masters Stakes, and Thoroughbred Club of America Stakes before taking the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Sprint. In 2013 she repeated in the Masters Stakes and won a second Breeders' Cup. She was then sold as a prospective broodmare for $3.1 million. Her new owner chose to keep her in training into early 2014, running her against males in the Cigar Mile, and then in the Hurricane Bertie Stakes, where she won the final race of her career, to be retired and become a broodmare. Background Groupie Doll is a chestnut mare with a small white star bred in Kentucky by the Frankfort-based father and son team of Fred and William \\"Buff\\" Bradley who also bred and raced Brass Hat. She is by far the most successful racehorse sired by Bowman's Band, a Kentucky-bred stallion whose biggest win on the track came in the 2003 Meadowlands Breeders' Cup Stakes. Groupie Doll's dam Deputy Doll won two minor races, and was a great- great-great-granddaughter of the influential broodmare Boudoir, whose other descendants include Graustark, His Majesty, Secreto, Majestic Prince, Real Quiet and Daiwa Major. During her racing career, the mare was owned by the Bradleys in partnership with Brent Burns and Carl Hurst and trained by Buff Bradley. Groupie Doll usually raced in a white hood. Racing career=2011: three-year-old season Groupie Doll began her racing career as a three-year-old in Kentucky. After finishing unplaced on her debut at Churchill Downs she recorded her first success by winning a maiden race over six and a half furlongs at the same venue in June. She then moved to Ellis Park Race Course where she won a seven furlong allowance race before being moved up in class and distance for the one mile Grade III Gardenia Stakes. Ridden by Greta Kuntweiler, she took the lead in the straight and won by three lengths from Secret File. She then finished second, carrying top weight in the Charles Town Oaks and second again, to the Brazilian filly Great Hot in the Grade II Raven Run Stakes at Keeneland. When tried over a longer distance in November she failed to reproduce her earlier form and finished unplaced behind Marketing Mix in the Grade II Mrs. Revere Stakes at Churchill Downs. Groupie Doll was sent to Florida and dropped in class for her final appearance of the year, winning an allowance race at Gulfstream Park on December 22. 2012: four- year-old season Groupie Doll's four-year-old season began with three consecutive defeats at Gulfstream. She finished second to the Grade I winning colt Boys At Tosconanova in a one-mile allowance race in January, third to Awesome Maria and Royal Delta in the Grade III Sabin Stakes in February and third behind Musical Romance in the Group II Inside Information Stakes in March. In the last of these races she was partnered by Rajiv Maragh, who rode her in all her subsequent races. Groupie Doll won her next five races. Racing on the Polytrack surface at Keeneland on April 12 she recorded her first Grade I victory when she defeated seven opponents in the Grade I Vinery Madison Stakes in which she wore blinkers for the first time. Starting at odds of 3.9/1 she took the lead a furlong out and won by three lengths from She's Cheeky. Maragh said that the filly \\"finished with a lot of power. She was long gone by the eighth pole\\". In May she won another Grade I when she took the Humana Distaff Stakes on the dirt at Churchill Downs. On this occasion she took the lead at half way in the seven furlong event and drew away in the straight to win impressively by seven and a quarter lengths from Musical Romance. The winning time of 1:20.44 was a new track record. After a four- month break, during which her training was disrupted by a hock injury, the filly returned in September and won the Grade II Presque Isle Downs Masters Stakes over six and a half furlongs on Tapeta. On October 6 at Keeneland she started 2/5 favorite for the Grade II Thoroughbred Club of America Stakes over six furlongs and won easily by six and a half lengths from Strike The Moon. On November 3, Groupie Doll started the 4/6 favourite for the Breeders' Cup Filly and Mare Sprint over six furlongs on dirt at Santa Anita Park. Her opponents were headed by Dust and Diamonds, the winner of the Gallant Bloom Handicap at Belmont Park, and also included Strike The Moon, Great Hot and Musical Romance. Drawn ninth of the ten runners, Groupie Doll raced on the wide outside in the first quarter mile. She moved forward on the final turn, took the lead in mid-stretch and pulled away to win by four and a half lengths from Dust and Diamonds. After the race, Buff Bradley said, \\"We started with her from before she was born. My dad has worked a long time for this and we worked a lot of hours on the farm, and we've seen a lot of them not make it to the races. When you get here you know how special it is, and to be able to have one and keep this one healthy all through the campaign is exceptional\\". Three weeks after her Breeders' Cup win, Groupie Doll was matched against colts in the Cigar Mile Handicap at Aqueduct Racetrack. Starting the 21/20 she took the lead in the straight but was caught on the wire and beaten a nose by Stay Thirsty. 2013: five-year-old season Groupie Doll missed the first half of the 2013 and did not appear until August, when she attempted to repeat her 2011 success in the Gardenia Stakes. She started the 1/5 favorite, but after stumbling at the start she finished third behind Devious Intent and Magic Hour. A month later, she won her second Masters Stakes at Presque Isle Downs, taking the lead inside the final furlong and winning by one and a half lengths from Purely Hot with the Canadian-bred four-year-old Judy the Beauty in third. On October 2, the mare started 1/2 favorite for the Thoroughbred Club of America Stakes at Keeneland but after Maragh was unable to obtain a clear run in the straight she finished third behind Judy the Beauty and Gypsy Robin. On November 2 Groupie Doll defended her Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Sprint title at Santa Anita. She was made the 7/2 favorite ahead of Dance Card (Gazelle Stakes), Sweet Lulu (Test Stakes), Dance To Bristol (Ballerina Stakes) and Judy the Beauty. For the second year in succession, Groupie Doll was drawn on the outside and had to race wide in the early stages. She took the lead in the straight and held off the late challenge of Judy the Beauty to win by half a length, with Dance Card half a length back in third. After the race, a visibly emotional Buff Bradley said; \\"She's the best, I'm so glad she got to show that today. No one on my team ever lost confidence in her. We've always known how good she is.\\" Less than a week after her second Breeders' Cup win, Groupie Doll was auctioned at the Keeneland November Breeding Stock Sale. The bidding reached $3.1 million before he was sold to Mandy Pope's Whisper Hill Farm. It was announced that she would be sent to begin her career as a broodmare at the Timber Town stables at Lexington, Kentucky. However, before retiring to be a broodmare, she was raced again in 2013 in the Cigar Mile Handicap at Aqueduct on November 30. She finished fourth behind Flat Out after being denied a clear run in the straight. On February 9, 2014, she decisively won her final race, the Hurricane Bertie Stakes.http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse- racing/articles/83292/groupie-doll-roars-out-in-hurricane-bertie Assessment and Honors In the 2012 edition of the World Thoroughbred Rankings, Groupie Doll was rated the 46th best racehorse in the world, the best sprinter on dirt, the best sprinter in North America and the third best female sprinter in the world behind Black Caviar and Atlantic Jewel. In the Eclipse Awards for 2012 she was voted American Champion Female Sprint Horse taking 250 of the 254 votes. She was again voted Champion Female Sprinter for 2013 beating Mizdirection by 195 votes to 45. In 2015, Ellis Park renamed the Gardenia Stakes, which she had won in 2011, in her honor. It is Ellis Park's only graded stakes race. \\"Everybody I spoke with thought it was the right thing to do\\", said the racing secretary of Ellis Park, Dan Bork. \\"As much as I hate to change the name of the Gardenia, if there's one horse that deserves it – a mare – it would be her.\\" Retirement On March 5, 2015, Groupie Doll delivered her first foal, a colt by Tapit about a week before her original March 11 due date, Wayne Sweezey of Timber Town Stable confirmed March 28. There was a problem with the delivery and the premature colt was rushed immediately to Rood & Riddle Equine Hospital near Lexington for critical nursing care. Groupie Doll recovered well from foaling and did not display any post-delivery issues. Under the care of Dr Bonnie Barr, the colt was initially too weak to stand or nurse, but made great progress since the first couple of weeks and was eventually released. Groupie Doll was bred back to Tapit for a 2016 foal. in 2018 she had a filly by tapit PedigreeReferences Category:2008 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in Kentucky Category:Racehorses trained in the United States Category:Thoroughbred family 4-d Category:Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Sprint winners ","title":"Groupie Doll"},{"id":"41013975","text":"Gibney Dance, founded in 1991 by choreographer Gina Gibney, is a multi-faceted dance organization occupying two locations in New York City: one at 890 Broadway in the Flatiron District and the other at 280 Broadway in Tribeca. The organization’s activities are divided into the following three interrelated fields: Center, Company, and Community. The first, Center, refers to the facility and its programming, which provide rehearsal space to nonprofit and commercial renters in addition to classes, programs, and services to the New York dance community. Company refers to Gibney Dance Company, a professional contemporary dance company operating out of the Center. Finally, Community refers to Community Action, an outreach program uniting dancers with survivors of domestic violence in shelters around New York City. In 2008, Gibney Dance was inducted into Vanity Fair’s Hall of Fame for “making art and taking action”. History In 1991, choreographer Gina Gibney founded Gibney Dance in New York City as a performing and social action company. The following year, she began renting space in the historic 890 Broadway building to house her company’s rehearsals. The space, then called Studio 5-2, soon became home to a roster of professional level dance classes taught by some of the city’s most sought-after teachers. Over the next two decades, Gibney and her company developed a repertory of eight evening length works that were performed throughout the country as well as in Canada, Germany, and Turkey. From 1997 until 2007, Gibney Dance Company operated as an all-female troupe, a decision resulting from Gibney’s growing concern that women in professional dance were losing artistic and financial ground. Since 2007, the company has included both men and women. In 2000, Gibney Dance founded the Domestic Violence Project, known today as Community Action. In 2010, the Center reopened as a greatly expanded, seven-studio facility encompassing nearly the entire fifth floor of the 890 Broadway building, whose other tenants include Ballet Tech and the American Ballet Theatre. The following year, Gibney Dance began offering an array of programs designed to serve the professional dance field in New York City. In 2013, with support from The Agnes Varis Trust, Gibney Dance’s Community Action reached its goal of offering 500 workshops each year to survivors of domestic violence. Also that year, the organization acquired yet another studio, bringing the facility to eight studios, making it one of the largest of its kind in New York City. In January 2014, at the invitation of the NYC Department of Cultural Affairs, Gibney Dance created a strategic plan for the revitalization of 280 Broadway in order to preserve the space for the future of dance. The organization's vision for 280 Broadway is to create a preeminent training program, a tripartite performance complex, and a springboard for social action. The new space operates in tandem with existing programs at 890 Broadway. Center Gibney Dance 890 is a complex of nine studios located at 890 Broadway in New York City’s Flatiron District. Gibney Dance 280 is complex of fourteen studios located at 280 Broadway in Lower Manhattan. Both spaces rent studios to commercial theater and television productions, allowing them to offer rehearsal space to nonprofit renters at subsidized rates. Ongoing ballet classes taught by Jaclynn Villamil, Janet Panetta, Sharon Milanese, Amy Miller, Martha Chapman, and Elisa Osborne are held at 890 Broadway, along with Simonson and Trisha Brown techniques, somatic practices, and a number of other contemporary class offerings at 280 Broadway. Additionally, the Center offers a roster of programs and services designed to serve New York’s professional dance community, such as artist residencies, space grants, and feedback forums for choreographers. Partner Organizations in 280 Broadway's Training Program include the Trisha Brown Dance Company, the New Dance Collective, the Playground, and Movement Research. New facilities at 280 Broadway include a center for professional development called the Learning and Leadership Studio, a hub for the organization's Community Action Program, a white-wall gallery for visual art, and a digital media workroom for artists. 280 Broadway also features three performance spaces and will host its first performance series, DoublePlus, in November and December 2014. Company Gibney Dance Company, founded in 1991, is a professional contemporary dance company led by artistic director Gina Gibney and associate artistic director Amy Miller. The company’s repertory includes eight evening length works composed over the last decade that have been performed throughout the country and abroad. In her choreography, Gibney has collaborated with numerous artists, including composer Ryan Lott (Son Lux), lighting designer Kathy Kaufmann, costume designers Naoko Nagata and David C. Woolard, and visualist Joshue Ott.

Woolard (costumes) Community Gibney Dance’s Community Action is a unique program that unites dancers with survivors of domestic violence in a series of workshops held in shelters throughout New York City. The goal of the program is to “bring the possibility of self-expression where it would otherwise not exist.” Through original movement creation and trust-building activities, Gibney Dance Company members work with survivors of domestic violence to address issues of choice, self- expression, and sharing. Since its inception in 2000, Gibney Dance’s Community Action has partnered with Sanctuary for Families and Safe Horizon, two of New York’s leading organizations dedicated to serving victims of domestic violence. Beyond its work in shelters, Community Action provides training sessions in its methodology both in New York and abroad. In April 2013, Gibney Dance Company traveled to Istanbul, Turkey to conduct a Community Action Residency at Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University, teaching its unique approach to empowerment through movement to Turkish dancers and social service providers. In May 2014, the Company traveled to Cape Town, South Africa to conduct its second Global Community Action Residency in partnership with iKapa Dance Theatre and the Saartjie Baartman Centre for Women and Children. In the fall of 2014, Gibney Dance opened a Community Action Hub at 280 Broadway, a facility devoted to the organization's outreach program featuring a research and work space and a resource library. Gina Gibney Gina Gibney, originally from Ohio, attended Case Western Reserve University, where she graduated with high honors (summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa) with a liberal arts degree. She went on to earn a Masters of Fine Arts degree in dance from Case Western University, where she worked with Kathryn Karipides and Kelly Holt. Her work has been honored with the Northern Ohio Live Arts Award, the Copperfoot Award for Choreography, Case Western Reserve University Young Alumni Award, Alpert Award (Finalist), the OTTY (Our Town Thanks You) Arts Award, and by Sanctuary for Families, Safe Horizon and The Retreat and the Vanity Fair Hall of Fame. Gibney currently serves on the Board of Directors of Dance/NYC and Danspace Project, and has served as a Dance/USA Trustee. She is a frequent panelist and speaker on topics of dance, entrepreneurship, and social action. Artist Statement: “In my work, I want to reveal what it is to be human—in the most simple, basic terms. I want to create a choreographic world where strength and tenderness are equally important, where touch and separation are meaningful, and where movement takes on the quality of an intimate conversation. Much of my work is about connection. I want to create work that reminds us that we share a common environment and that our similarities are greater than our differences. As a choreographer, I am an observer. I try to look honestly at how dancers connect to movement and to the complex web of relationships. For example, I look for stillness, for that charged moment of non-movement and what that means to dancers examining their internal motivations and those of each other. I look for gestures that reach and enfold, hold and rebuff, contain and lose. I look for movement that has authenticity and weight. I look for focus that reaches deeply inward, yet is clear and open, with active awareness and a sense of reciprocity.” Funders Gibney Dance has received recognition and support from the following foundations and corporate donors: The Agnes Varis Trust, The Andrew W.

Since its formation the band has moved from a folk trio to a rock quartet. The group's second album, This is an Adventure, was produced by Ryan Hadlock and independently released in 2012 and received critical praise for its genre- bending melodic folk.  History = Early years and formation (2008–11)  The Lighthouse and the Whaler was formed by vocalist and guitarist Michael LoPresti in 2008. The name was inspired by Chapter 14 of Herman Melville's Moby Dick. \\"The Field Song\\", the band's first song, was a result of spontaneous collaboration that took place between Lopresti and former band members Aaron Smith and Evan Storey in a field when they were first starting. Soon after \\"The Field Song\\" was selected for the acclaimed Paste Magazine Sampler CD in Issue 29. In November 2009, the band self-produced and released its debut album, The Lighthouse and the Whaler. The band supported the release with a performance at SXSW 2010 and The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as well as tours and opening slots for bands like The Temper Trap, GIVERS and Motion City Soundtrack. Later in 2010 the band was named the \\"Best Indie\\" act in Cleveland by Cleveland Scene Magazine and was featured as a band of the month by BMI. That album went on to receive more attention from Paste, KEXP and Daytrotter.  This is an Adventure (2011-2014)  In August 2011, the band began recording This is an Adventure at Bear Creek Studios in Washington, where The Lumineers, Brandi Carlile, The Walkmen and Ra Ra Riot had previously recorded. The group lived in the barn attached to the studio while making the record under the production of Hadlock. A three-song Pioneers EP was released in March 2012, in anticipation of This is an Adventure, which followed in September 2012. Released independently, the album was the second highest ranking DIY album on the CMJ 200 in 2012 and received attention from NPR World Cafe, Paste, FILTER, Daytrotter, Under the Radar magazine and others. Music from the album was featured on Gossip Girl, CSI:NY, Emily Owens MD and other shows. In support of the album, The Lighthouse and the Whaler toured North America with Jukebox the Ghost, Matt Pond PA, Ra Ra Riot and Ewert and the Two Dragons, performing at CMJ Pop! Montreal, NXNE, SXSW and FILTER Culture Collide Festival. During Culture Collide, the band won Peter Gabriel's cover song contest to celebrate the 20th anniversary of So. This is an Adventure debuted on the Billboard Heatseekers chart in March 2013. Due to the success of This is an Adventure the band released the Venice Remix EP on June 10, 2014 featuring remixes from Savior Adore, Chancellor Warhol and Adam Snow as well as a new radio edit of Venice. The band supported the release of the EP with a national tour supporting Matt Pond PA and additional dates with Run River North on either side of its release date.  Mont Royal (2015–Present)  In January 2015, The Lighthouse and the Whaler started recording its third album, Mont Royal, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The album was produced and mixed by Marcus Paquin, who previously worked with Local Natives, Arcade Fire and The National. It was released on 28 August 2015 by Roll Call Records in the United States of America and Fontana North in Canada. It was released by Smack Face Records in Australia and New Zealand.

Richard Cox (c. 1766 – 20 May 1845) was an English brewer and horticulturist who bred the apple varieties Cox's Orange Pippin and Cox's Pomona. Cox operated the Black Eagle Brewery located at 27 White's Grounds, Bermondsey, London until 1820, when he retired with his wife Ann to The Lawns (later Colnbrook Lawn) in Colnbrook, Slough, Buckinghamshire (now Berkshire), England, to pursue his hobby of horticulture. The house sat on two acres of land in the vicinity of Rodney Way and Daventry Close on the north side of the old Bath Road (now the High Street), about a mile west of the modern-day boundary of Heathrow Airport. In 1830 he planted pips from a Ribston Pippin apple grown in his orchard, crossed with Blenheim Orange. Satisfied with the quality of the fruit produced by two of his seedlings, in 1836 he supplied grafts to E. Small & Son, the local nurseryman who offered the first trees for sale in 1840. The two varieties, Cox's Orange Pippin and Cox's Pomona, remained mostly unknown until Charles Turner of the Royal Nurseries in Slough, impressed by their quality, began to offer them in his catalog in 1850. Other English nurserymen began to graft and sell Cox's Orange Pippin trees, and by 1883 it was one of the most popular apples in the country. Cox died in 1845 without seeing the success of the apple varieties to which he gave his name. By 2007, Cox's Orange Pippin, grown worldwide, was Britain's most popular apple, accounting for over 50% of UK orchard acreage, and 48% of sales.Apple facts Ownership of the brewery passed to Noakes & Company after Cox's death and would continue operation under different owners, ultimately Courage, until 1930. The original Cox's Orange Pippin tree in Colnbrook was blown down in a storm in 1911, but two trees, grafted from the original, were still standing in the orchard as of 1933. The site is currently occupied by a block of low-rise flats also called The Lawns. Richard Cox outlived his wife by eight years and died in 1845, aged 79; both are buried in the churchyard at St.Mary's in Harmondsworth. A memorial orchard stands near the site of The Lawns in Colnbrook, consisting of Cox's Orange Pippin, Cox's Pomona, Ribston Pippin, and Blenheim Orange with metallic benches in the shapes of the letters C, O and X.

Outside of a few veteran players, many new players did not even know the basic rules of rugby, but with several practices devoted to the intricacies of the sport, that soon changed. Over the years, word about the club spread around the county, sparking interest and bringing players not only from Ukiah, which is the main hub of the club, but from outlying communities as well, from Potter Valley to Willits, Boonville to Hopland, Fort Bragg and Mendocino, stretching as far as Lake County. The Mendocino Steam Donkeys Rugby Club played their first game in 2006. Community outreach The club is known for community engagement - especially working with children. In 2013, the club partnered with the Mendocino County Library, to promote children's literacy through \\"Rugby Reads\\" where the players read to children. Also in 2013, the club collected toys for underprivileged children donating them to the Ukiah Valley Christmas Effort as part of a coalition with service club, the Active 20-30 Club of Ukiah, and roller derby teams Mendo Mayhem and Deep Valley Belligerents.

History During World War II, Zeke Bonura, a major league baseball player, was posted to Oran, Algeria. He organized large-scale baseball operations, consisting of 150 teams in 6 leagues. Playoffs among the teams narrowed them to two finalists – the Casablanca Yankees, consisting of medics, with a season record of 32-2 in the Casablanca-Oran area, and the Algiers Streetwalkers, consisting of MPs, which had been 17-3 in the Algiers- Tunis League. The North African World Series was a best two-out-of-three-game championship played on October 3 and 4, 1943, at St. Eugene municipal stadium in Algiers, Algeria, between the two teams. Attendance at the games was 4,000 people. Major General Everett Hughes, deputy theater commander, threw out the first ball. The Casablanca Yankees won the series in two straight games. They won the first game 9–0, and then won the second game 7–6, after scoring three runs in the bottom of the ninth.

Design Center (DC) Colorado is dedicated to fostering partnerships between students, industry, government agencies and other organizations. This is done by immersing teams of graduate and undergraduate students in externally sponsored design projects throughout the academic year. Since 2000, the Design Center, part of the I/UCPC, or the Industry/University Cooperative Projects Center, has had over 1600 student participants that have worked on 225 projects from 56 different organizations. Design Center projects require that at least 1500 student hours are put in per project. Undergraduate Program The CU-Boulder ME undergraduate degree includes a variety of design classes, starting with a freshman Computer Aided Design (CAD) course and culminating with a year-long Senior Design experience. Senior Design is the culminating design experience in the Mechanical Engineering (ME) Department at CU-Boulder. The purpose of this course is to simulate an entry-level engineering project in industry—allowing students to apply the engineering knowledge they acquired in the fundamental ME courses to a real-world, open-ended design challenge. Graduates of CU's ME department are expected to have a firm grasp of the design process and first hand experience executing the design loop in both theoretical and real life settings. Graduate Program The Graduate Design Program is focused on educating graduate (both Masters and Doctoral) students through hands-on design learning and industry-sponsored projects. The cornerstone of this program is a three- semester sequence of courses that begin in January, and culminate the following year in May. The first course in this sequence is Advanced Product Design (APD). Advanced Product Design, focuses on the design and development of consumer products such as bicycles, climbing gear, power tools, etc. Through review of existing products, high level frameworks and hands-on design assignments, the course is designed to give an overview of the processes and methods students need to design products. Following the APD studio class a two-semester Graduate Design project follows. Graduate Design consists of teams of 3-4 students working on a design project: the end result of this project is a piece of fully tested functional hardware with accompanying documentation. In many cases the project hardware will be representative of the final manufactured product. While the course focuses on team design projects, formal class time discussions center on design heuristics, project management, design trends, failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), entrepreneurship, and oral presentation skills. Projects come from various sources such as industry, non-profit organizations, student concepts for an entrepreneurship product, technology transfer, corporate grants, etc. Sponsors The Design Center (DC) Colorado fosters technical collaborations with business, industry, and non-profit organizations. Projects have incorporated many different subject areas including bio-medical, computers & peripherals, aerospace, automotive, energy, sports and recreation, government research, and packing and measurement. Student teams work on assigned projects for two consecutive semesters and deliver tested, functional hardware and documentation to the industry sponsor at the completion of the project. Past sponsors have included: Agilent, Boeing, ConMed, Covidien, Hewlett-Packard, TerumoBCT, Medtronic, MillerCoors, Ricoh, Sandia National Labs, Shell, Oracle, and Los Alamos National Lab. Facilities The DC Colorado program is primarily housed in the Mechanical Engineering department, in the Engineering Building, on the University of Colorado Boulder campus. The Fleming Building will be renovated into the Idea Forge, the new home of Design Center Colorado on the university's campus. The Durning Laboratory, which will also move to the Idea Forge, is the dedicated design space for undergraduate mechanical engineering students. With more than 6,000 sq ft, the laboratory is home to student project work areas, material testing instrumentation, composites fabrication space, the ME student machine shop, and an ME student computer lab. Durning Laboratory also provides essential tools for checkout to ME students, including: hand tools, measurement devices, fasteners, adhesives, reference materials, electronic components, and a high-speed camera. FALL is a dedicated Graduate Design Program space in the Fleming Law building. These facilities are used exclusively by the students in the Graduate Design Program. This space includes a dedicated computer laboratory, conference room, active learning classroom, mechanical fabrication room, electrical fabrication room, multi-use lounge area, and individual team studios for Grad Design.

However, he was best known for his work in the inter-war years, where he became a leading writer of magazine articles and books on radio topics, gaining particular notability with the public for the many popular radio sets he designed for the large home constructor market. Biography=Early years Born in 1897, John Scott-Taggart was educated at Bolton School, various technological institutions, King's College London and University College London. First World War On the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Scott-Taggart enlisted with the 2nd and 4th Seaforth Highlanders even though he had not yet reached the 18 years of age required by the army at that time. He was initially sent for training, where he passed the exams required to become \\"First Class Instructor in Signalling\\". Promoted to Sergeant-Instructor, he stayed on at the Scottish Command School of Signalling where he trained other recruits in army communication techniques. In 1916, he was sent to the Western Front in time for the First Battle of the Somme. Transferred to the Corps of the Royal Engineers in 1917, he worked in the Research Station under Major Rupert Stanley, before receiving his commission and being deployed to a Canadian field gun battery where he participated in the Battle of Vimy Ridge. Having been Wireless Officer to various units,Year Book of Wireless Telegraphy and Telephony 1925, (Biographical Notices), p.885 including the 55th (West Lancashire) Division, in late 1917 he was appointed Instructor in Wireless, First Army, Western Front. In 1918, he was mentioned in despatches, and was later awarded the Military Cross (MC) in connection with his wireless work during a crucial phase of the Battle of the Lys. Notwithstanding being on active service, Scott-Taggart wrote several of the countless technical articles he would produce during his life whilst serving on the Western Front, the first being published in Wireless World in October 1917.Irving, Feb/Mar 1996, p.16.

However, in 1920 he left Ediswan for the Radio Communication Company where for four years he was the Head of the Patent Department and a Research Engineer.Irving, Feb/Mar 1996 p.17. In 1922 he founded the Radio Press Ltd., with his employer owing 75% of the stock and himself the remainder.Irving, Feb/Mar 1996, p.19 Under his stewardship, the publisher issued a large number of books for the radio enthusiast, firstly those written by Scott-Taggart himself, and latterly by other experts in the field. They also produced a number of journals on the subject, two of which Scott-Taggart edited personally – Modern Wireless (Mar-1923-), and Wireless Weekly (Apr-1923-). It was in the first of these titles that he published the first of a series of radio set designs that made him a household name with wireless constructors throughout the United Kingdom. In addition to his writings for the Radio Press, he wrote a weekly column for the Daily Express. At the end of 1926, he sold his wireless publication business to the Amalgamated Press. He then read successfully for the Bar, being called up to it in 1928. However, although fully qualified, he never practised as a Barrister. He spent the next four years first learning to fly, then lived life as something a gentleman aviator developing skills that he was able to use in the service of his country during the Second World War.

The current head teacher of the school is Theodora Tsimpouri. It opened in September 1993 with only 28 pupils and 10 teachers. At the end of summer 2013, the school was recorded to have a roll of 231 pupils and 68 teachers. The school is made up of 12 sections of which 8 are for pupils in the first 3 years of high school and 4 for the use of pupils in the last 3 years of high school. Although the school mainly specialises in music, other subjects are also taught to pupils such as maths, physics, literature and languages. The school is open from Monday to Friday between the hours of 08:00 to 3:15. History The opening of the music school came about due to the demand for a music school from the Music School's Arts Committee (a department of the Education Ministry). When the school was founded in 1993, it had only 10 teachers: P. Giannakitsa (Philologist/Literature Teacher), T. Tsimpouri (Piano), E. xatzinikolaou (Piano), K. Loukas (Mathematician), B. Kattavenakis (Musician), H. Anastasiadis (Lyra), S. Perselis (Lyra), G. Paragios (Lyra), E. Statha (Piano), I. Dermitzakis (Violin) and N. Zervos (HeadMaster). The announcement of the creation of the school received lots of negative reactions from the public. Many people felt uninterested or suspicious about the idea. Others were doubtful at the idea of a school which was so different from any other schools, specialising in one particular subject. First Year During the school's first year of operation, the school had problems regarding the housing of students. For the first few days of operation, the housing for the school was situated in Rodini park. However it was later transferred to the 6th Lykeio of Rhodes (also known as Ikokiriki). Conflict between the Music School of Rhodes and the admission of the 6th school of Rhodes caused the Music school to transfer to an area called 'Therme'. Second Year After the problems with the housing and conflict with the 6th school of Rhodes, the music school was eventually moving slowly back on track. During the second year of operation, the school building was divided into 3 sections for smoother running of teaching. In this case, there are 2 sections of the building that was provided to the first year pupils and the last section was allocated to the use of second years, since there were 46 1st year pupils and 25 2nd year pupils at the time. However, the housing problem was still one of the major issues to the school, owing to several numbers of insufficient classrooms, the teachers have spent most of their time teaching at the kitchen or in the yard if the condition allowed. In addition to the smooth running, more teachers have joined the School: M.Pavlidou, M.Sotiraki (Philologist/Literature Teacher), H.Xatzinikolaou (Physicist), G.Stintixaki (German Language), E.Volonaki (Piano), A.Santoriniou (Piano), E.Ioannidou, P.Kouvaras, G.Kotis, S.Xatzinikolaou, Xatzipapas (Theatre), T.Athanasopoulos (Art). Third Year As the time moved onto the third year of operation, the school has found the way to temporarily solve its housing problem. As a result, the location of the school was transferred from 'Therme' to “Gold Court” at Afantou area. As the school was into a more stable situation and the buildings was in good condition, the 4 sections of the building were allocated as 1 section for the 1st years, 2 sections for 2nd years (as there are more pupils) and finally 1 section for the 3rd years. As a success achievement of the year, the school won the 2nd award at the 1st PanHellenic music competition for their Byzantine Choir and 1st place in both piano and European Choir. Recent The overall structure of the high school has been completed with the addition of 4th, 5th and 6th years, the school has gained support from EU funds for their new building at 'Asgourou' (which is their current location ). As a massive improvement at the end of the year the school has participated in the 2nd PanHellenic music competition and has taken four 1st places in different areas. Events The music school regularly hosts events and festivals for the public to attend. The events that are held vary from operas to concerts. Other events are culturally themed such as the \\"Dancing and Singing in Asia minor\\" event. Another event which featured at the Music School of Rhodes Island was the \\"Music Stand\\" event which took viewers into Alexandros Papadiamantis' word of romantic short stories. The Music School of Rhodes also hold a music festival every year in which its students get to take part in the Music Festival The music school, along with the Department of the Dodecanese of the South Aegean Region and the Municipal Culture Sports Organisation of the Municipality of Rhodes (DOPAR), is set to be hosting a festival showcasing the Creation of Contemporary Music. The main purpose of the event is to allow young musicians to express themselves and show their talents by providing them with the best possible opportunity for expression. All that is required to allow students to perform at the festival is that they have passed the music audition before the festival begins. This festival is the 3rd of its kind following the success of the 2nd festival which was organised by the Region of Southern Aegean, Department of Culture, and took place in 2011. The 2nd Festival of Contemporary Music Creation lasted 2 days and consisted of 25 bands, consisting of the Dodecanese, performing over the 2 days. The 1st festival, lasting only 1 day, brought 1000 spectators and the 2nd festival brought more than 1500 spectators over the 2 days it ran for. The reason as to why the music school itself was chosen to hold all 3 of the festivals is due to the fact that its location combines historical monuments and natural beauty providing the perfect backdrop to the festivals. The 3rd festival of the Creation of Contemporary Music is divided into 3 phases. The 1st phase involves the students, who wish for their bands to participate, submitting applications for performing in the festival. The 2nd phase is where the bands are invited to the hearing in the Music School's auditorium where they perform in front of The Arts Committee of the festival. The committee then evaluate each band determining whether or not they reach the artistic criteria required to move on to the 3rd phase. The 3rd phase involves all of the groups who the Arts Committee determined suitable being given their performance slots. The Arts Committee use the 3 phases to achieve their goal in ensuring the hard working bands are able to go on to perform at the festival and showcase their talents. Other projects Screenshot of Rollit! gameplay The school's computer department produced a 3D game in 2012 called Rollit! which is available online to play. Students Kalogerakis Alexander, Kapsimalis Panagiotis and Ntitsef Theodore from class C worked together to create the 3D game using Unity3d javascript. The game requires the players to make their way through a maze, collecting flags and then reaching the levels exit before time runs out.

Gutnick is an Orthodox rabbi and a member of the ultra Orthodox Chabad Hasidic movement. Rabbi Gutnick is a member of the Beth Din (rabbinical court) in Sydney, Australia. Gutnick is currently President of the Rabbinical Council of Australia and NZ. He formerly served as the rabbi of the Mizrachi synagogue in Sydney. In 2018 Gutnick and three other members of the Rabbinic Council of Australia and New Zealand were convicted of criminal contempt of court after pressuring a member of their community not to attend a secular court. At the time of this conviction, Gutnick was the president of RCANZ and controlled the running of the Beth Din in partnership with the other senior dayan, Yehoram Ulman. NSW Kashrut Authority Gutnick is the head of the NSW Kashrut Authority, the most widely known kosher authority in New South Wales. The NSW Jewish Board of Deputies alleged that the organisation \\"lacks transparency in relation to operations and finances\\", the community was not represented, and the meat suppliers were determined by factors outside of Jewish law, thus raising the prices of the meat to 30% more than in Melbourne. A report written on the state of kashrut in NSW was describe as a \\"damning indictment\\" of Gutnick's practices and bemoaned the lack of communal governance and transparency. This breakdown in communications lead to a competing agency in the kashrut space opening up in Sydney. A number of incidents played out in public. One such incident was when a caterer ordered kosher meat from Melbourne, under the supervision of his brother, Mordechai, because the particular cut of meat was unavailable in Sydney, thus threatening their monopoly over kosher meat. Gutnick confronted the owner and confiscated the offending meat. Another instance was when the kosher abattoir was closed due to cruelty to animals, and Sydney was forced to obtain their meat from Melbourne. In 2018, Gutnick threatened to remove his certification from Our Big Kitchen if they allowed caterers, the Shuk, to use their kitchens for a function. The Shuk had recently moved to the KA's rival authority, Community Kashrut for some of their certification. Gutnick declared food prepared under the rival authority to be not kosher. Gutnick has also been public in his condemnation of the Australian Jewish News, for their willingness to accept advertising from non-kosher caterers, even though the majority of their readership are secular. He felt that as part of the Jewish community and out of respect for the strictly Orthodox they should refuse such adverts. Royal Commission Gutnick was called in early 2015 to testify before the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. It was there that he said, \\"I believe the cover-ups and bullying and intimidation that has gone on ... represents the antithesis of the teachings of Chabad and Judaism and orthodoxy.\\"Rabbi Moshe Gutnick tells Royal Commission into child sex abuse that 'Jews must report sex abuse' The Age, 5 Feb 2015 He acknowledged that the Orthodox Chabad community in Australia was guilty of covering up sex crimes committed in the community and pressuring victims and their families not to report the crimes to the police. Gutnick said that people reporting abuse were ostracized mosers (“informers”). He said “a culture of cover-up, often couched in religious terms, pervaded our thinking and our actions.” He claimed that rabbis in these situations had misused their power, and that anyone who insists a child sexual abuse victim should go first to a rabbi rather than the police is not doing so out of religious reasons but trying to “hush it up, to cover it up, to prevent the victim from finding redress. There is no doubt at all: Mesirah [‘informing’] has no application whatsoever to instances of child sexual abuse. To use mesirah in this way is an abomination.” Gutnick also lamented that there was no formal training for rabbis on how to handle reported abuse. Manny Waks, an advocate for victims, said, “Today, Rabbi Moshe Gutnick restored my faith in ultra-Orthodox Judaism. For the first time ever the reform that is so critical seems much closer. Thank you Rabbi Gutnick. Hopefully the rest of the Orthodox Rabbinate will now follow suit. What an incredible day for justice.”In national abuse probe, leading Australian rabbi decries Orthodox community’s ‘cover-up culture’ The Jerusalem Post, 4 February 2015,  Dispute with Mizrachi synagogue  Gutnick was the rabbi at the Mizrachi synagogue in North Bondi from 1987 to 2009. After seeing their numbers fall, the synagogue tried a number of ways to change the situation. This included an ill-fated attempt to merge with the Great Synagogue. The synagogue then decided to make Gutnick redundant since his wages were becoming a financial burden on the synagogue and they could no longer pay them. Gutnick argued that the board had no right to make this decision and that communal rabbis should have life tenure. The only way to remove a rabbi is via a Beth Din. He successfully obtained an injunction from the NSW Supreme Court preventing his dismissal pending the ruling of a Beth Din. The case was taken to the London Beth Din, and Gutnick emerged with a ruling in his favour, and a payout including costs of close to $1 million. Sydney Beth Din Gutnick serves as a senior member of the Sydney Beth Din. One of the roles of the Beth Din is Jewish divorces and solving gett refusal. Gutnick has been aggressive in his condemnation of the practice of gett refusal, and is a strong supporter of Halachic prenuptial agreements. The Beth Din is also responsible for conversions, and it was revealed that the Sydney Beth Din are one of the few in the world that is approved to perform conversions by the Israeli Chief Rabbinate. While on the Beth Din he has courted controversy including the alleged lack of transparency and refusal to reform the structure of the institution. To date the Beth Din has no formal constitution, with no plans to create one, leading to the accusation of an opaque operating system, and no clear structure for the appointment of judges. Gutnick is also a director of the Beth Din along with fellow dayan, Yehoram Ulman. Gutnick and the Sydney Beth Din have also run foul of the secular law in Australia. In one case they were found to have intimidated a member of the public into approaching them instead of the secular courts, and were found in contempt of court. In another, the Beth Din were accused of not complying with the law and handling the case unfairly when they excommunicated a member of the Sydney Jewish community. In yet another case, Gutnick was involved in the ruling against Yacov Barber in his dispute with his synagogue. Gutnick sat on this case, despite being a colleague of Barber, who sat on the Melbourne Beth Din, and the details of the case being very similar to his own dispute with the Mizrachi synagogue. In March 2019 the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies (JBOD) intended to investigate the Beth Din which Gutnick is a part owner and senior member. The resolution which was passed unopposed was to look into all aspects of the Beth Din in the wake of the contempt of court rulings against the Beth Din in 2018. The Beth Din responded that JBOD had a \\"This attempt by the BOD to assert authority over the SBD creates an insurmountable conflict of interest for the BOD, a body with a history of effectively undermining the theological basis of Orthodoxy and halachah\\". They rejected the concept that JBOD \\"has any right to be involved in, to interfere with or comment on the affairs of an Orthodox rabbinical body\\".  Other activities  Gutnick is a former president of the Rabbinical Council of NSW. He is a former head of the Organisation of Rabbis of Australasia (ORA). After ORA was closed down after several of its members were forced to resign because they were implicated in abuse by the Royal Commission into Child Sex Abuse and reformed as the Rabbinical Council of Australia and New Zealand, Gutnick was elected in 2018 to lead the new body. Gutnick has been an outspoken opponent of same sex marriage, and has signed letters to parliament, and written articles affirming this position. He also defended rabbinic opposition to the Safe Schools program, aimed at reducing bullying, including bullying based on gender identity, saying that he did not want to \\"'celebrate' an orientation that is against Torah teaching.\\" Gutnick has also defended Halal certification against its detractors, saying that if that were to be said about kosher it would be considered anti-Semitic, and it was an attack on religious rights.

The seat was retained by the Conservative candidate Austin Taylor. Vacancy The by- election in East Toxteth was caused by the resignation on 27 October 1902 of the sitting Conservative MP, Augustus Frederick Warr. Warr was a solicitor who had held the seat since he was elected unopposed in a by-election in 1895. He was re-elected unopposed in the general election in 1900, but found that the increasing workload of Parliament was incompatible with his legal work in Liverpool and his wife's long-term illness. He resigned his seat on 27 October 1902 by the procedural device of accepting appointment as Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds, triggering the by-election. Candidates The Conservative party discussed several possible candidates, and at a meeting of the local party on 27 October selected as candidate Austin Taylor, head of the steamship company of Messrs. Hugh Evans and Co. Taylor was a prominent member of the Liverpool City Council and Chairman of the Laymen′s League. The selection was somewhat controversial among local members, and Peter McGuffie, another Conservative city councillor, was approached to contest the division as an Independent Conservative, but declined in a letter to newspapers printed 29 October. The Liberal party candidate was Herbert Rathbone, a city councillor of Liverpool and nephew of recently deceased Liberal MP William Rathbone (1819–1902). Issues ;Education Following the successful campaign in the Leeds North by-election in July 1902, the Liberal party spent much time on the government’s plans for an Education Bill to replace school boards with local education authorities, which included proposals to bring church schools into the public system. Many Liberals were strongly nonconformist and the idea that Church of England and Roman Catholic schools should be funded from the rates, a form of local taxation, was anathema to them. It provided the battle slogan ‘Rome on the Rates’ and united the party against the government.David Dutton, A History of the Liberal Party in the Twentieth Century; Palgrave Macmillan, 2004 p14 The bill was debated in the House as the campaign in East Toxteth took place. Rathbone ″strongly denounced″ the bill, whereas Taylor said he would assist in passing the amended version. ;Ireland Taylor spoke out as a stanch opponent of Home Rule for Ireland, while Rathbone argued for devolution which would ″satisfy the reasonable aspiration of the Irish people and at the same time add to the efficiency of the Imperial Parliament″. ;Other issues Taylor advanced the government′s naval policy, highlighting the ″duty of the nation at all costs see to it that the high roads of the sea was kept open for the safe passage of our ships and the safe transport to our shores of the means of sustenance for the population.″ Result The election result was announced on the evening of November 6, with the Conservative candidate Austin Taylor the winner. The fairly close race in a Conservative district was explained by local causes (the split among conservatives), and not as another Liberal win (they had won another by-election on the previous day). Austin was re-elected unopposed in the 1906 general election, but later the same year resigned the Conservative whip and joined the Liberal party.
