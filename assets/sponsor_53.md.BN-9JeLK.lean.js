He continued to reside in Mutare, the see city of his diocese, until he was asked by the Dean of the Church of the Province of Central Africa on 7 November 2007 to take over the Diocese of Harare after the ouster of Bishop Nolbert Kunonga, who had aligned himself with the Marxist r√©gime of Robert Mugabe in an attempt to withdraw his diocese from the Province of Central Africa. It was expected Bakare would be a caretaker bishop until a substantive leader could be elected.http://www.anglican-mainstream.net Bakare denounced Mugabe's treatment of Christians, particularly Anglicans who refuse to recognize the authority of Kunonga. Many Anglican churches have been closed on the orders of Mugabe's party, Zanu-PF, which believes it should continue to rule Zimbabwe despite an electoral defeat in March 2008. At the decennial Lambeth Conference in Canterbury, England, Bakare spoke of Zimbabwe to newsmen: \\"The ruling system is so oppressive that it has denied the people their human rights, including religious freedom. My diocese continues to suffer persecution. We have been denied the freedom to worship.\\" On 30 October 2008, it was announced that Bakare had been awarded Sweden's 2008 Per Anger Prize for his \\"committed work for human rights in a politically unstable Zimbabwe.\\" He received the award in Stockholm on 10 November 2008.http://www.episcopalchurch.org \\"It is like a war, in the sense that there is total absence of peace,\\" Bakare told Swedish radio news in describing conditions in his homeland.http://danielmolokele.blogspot.com References Category:1930 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century Anglican bishops Category:21st-century Anglican bishops Category:Bishops of Harare and Mashonaland Category:Per Anger Prize Category:Zimbabwean Anglicans ","title":"Sebastian Bakare"},{"id":"17411491","text":"Willis Hall (April 1, 1801July 14, 1868) was an American lawyer and politician from New York.

Its rear side acts as a European Health Insurance Card. The Italian Health Insurance Card was issued for Italian citizens by the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance in cooperation with the Italian Agency of Revenue in accordance with Article 50 of dl 269/2003, converted, with amendments, by law 326/2003. The objective of the Italian Health Insurance Card is to improve social security services through expenditure control and performance, and to optimize the use of health services by citizens. Features * It contains biographical data and welfare information * It contains the tax code on magnetic band format as well as barcode * It is valid throughout Italy * It grants the holder the right to obtain health services throughout the European Union * Replaces the paper version, E111 * Replace the Italian fiscal code card * In the more recent version, with integrated circuit included, offers added functionalities as a smart card, able to access online service provided by public administrations. This version is called Tessera Sanitaria-Carta Nazionale dei Servizi (TS-CNS), or Tessera Sanitaria-Carta Regionale dei Servizi (TS-CRS), the latter in the Autonomous regions with special statute. * It is valid for six years The material consists of a plastic card with identical size and consistency to a typical ATM card. The cards are printed on the front with the tax code, expiration date, biographical data, and the distinctive coat of arms of the Italian region of residence. The front of the card also includes Braille characters for the blind and an integrated circuit . On the back of the card is the tax code barcodes, the magnetic strip, and the words, Tessera europea di assicurazione malattia, meaning \\"European health insurance card\\".

The receipt shows the amount and type of drugs purchased, in addition to the tax code reviews. To purchase medicine, it is necessary to supply your health insurance card or your Italian fiscal code card.

Located on the north coast of Trinidad in the Sangre Grande region, the village has traditionally been seen as one of the most remote places on the island.  History  The Matelot area was inhabited by Amerindian groups until 1760 when the population was resettled at the Spanish mission at Toco. In 1783 two Venezuelan families‚ÄîEstrada and Salvary‚Äîsettled in Matelot after being granted land in the Cedula of Population. By 1873 there were forty families in the village and in 1887 the population was reported to be about 280, most descended from the Estrada and Salvary families. The development of cacao cultivation in the late nineteenth century lead to economic development and population growth. Driven by immigration from other West Indian islands and Venezuela, the population expanded to 605 by 1933. Falling cocoa prices in the 1920s and 30s drove the village into decline.

His color schemes are dense, with little indication of an understanding of lighting techniques.

Jordan, 113 U.S. 418 (1885), was a case regarding an Act of Congress that provided for the refunding to the persons therein named of the amount of taxes assessed upon and collected from them contrary to the provisions of the regulations therein mentioned. In other words, pay to each of such persons the sum set opposite his name, each of them is entitled to be paid the whole of that sum, and no discretion is vested in the Secretary of the Treasury or in any court to determine whether the sum specified was or was not the amount of a tax assessed contrary to the provisions of such regulations.. On the 29 July 1882, an Act of Congress was passed, 22 Stat. 723, c. 359, providing This was followed by the names of 81 persons, and the specification of a sum of money opposite each name. The Secretary of the Treasury sent the Commissioner of Internal Revenue the following letter on June 19, 1873, which is referred to in the act of Congress: > TREASURY DEPARTMENT, OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY WASHINGTON, June 19, 1873 SIR: > I have considered the claim of William Gosling and others, applicants for > refunding taxes alleged to have been illegally collected, included in > schedule No. 243, from your office, and am of opinion that under the > existing laws, the taxes paid by these parties were legally paid, and should > not be refunded. But I fully recognize the hardship of the case, and desire > that such claimants may receive relief from Congress. I have therefore to > suggest that you will, in your next annual report or on any other occasion > which you may deem more fitting, recommend the passage of a special act > authorizing the refunding of all taxes paid by residents of the > insurrectionary states which, under department circular of June 21, 1865, > should not have been collected, such refunding to be made whether the tax in > question was collected before or after the issue of the circular. I am, very > respectfully, WILLIAM A. RICHARDSON Secretary of the Treasury The brief for the United States stated that the payment was refused by the accounting officers of the Treasury on the grounds that the statute authorized payment of only The view taken by the Treasury officers was that the annual income tax for the year 1863, under the Act of July 1, 1862, became, by the statute, due and payable May 1, 1864, before the assessment division that comprised Rutherford County was established, and under the Treasury regulations of June 21, 1865, in circular No. 16, which required collection only of the first taxes due after the establishment of assessment divisions. That sum was collected contrary to the provisions of those regulations, and was to be refunded, though it was collected before the date of the circular. The Treasury officers decided, however, that the money, paid for the special income tax under the joint resolution of July 4, 1864, and which, by law, did not become due until October 1, 1864, after the establishment of such assessment division, was not collected contrary to the provisions of those regulations, and should not be refunded. The Court of Claims held that the statute did not admit of that interpretation, nor leave open any question for the court or for the accounting officers of the Treasury, except the identity of the claimants with the persons named in it, and that its language, taken together, was too clear to admit of doubt, that Congress undertook, as it had a right to do, to determine not only what citizens of Tennessee by name should have relief, but also the exact amount that should be paid to each one of them. We concur in this view. The act authorized and directed the Secretary of the Treasury to pay to the several persons named the respective sums named. The court found that it was not an improper inference from the language of the statute that Congress intended to refund the taxes covered by the recommendation of the Secretary of the Treasury, in his letter of June 19, 1873. That letter covers taxes described as those that under the circular \\"...should not have been collected,\\" though collected before it was issued. Congress may therefore have included some taxes collected before the circular was issued, but that it thought should not have been, or ought not to have been collected, in the sense intended by the Secretary. The judgment of the Court of Claims was affirmed.

In Old Norse ‚Äúskur‚Äù also carries the meaning shower, as in shower of rain, or a shower of arrows. The most likely origin of the surname Scurfield, therefore, is the name of an ancient field of battle. The name Scurfield is unique and every Scurfield in the world should be able to trace the origin of their name to the County of Durham in north east England. It is not true that the surname Scurfield has evolved from the more common names of Scarfield, Scorefield, Schofield, or Scourfield. While it is still not certain from exactly where or when the name began, it is certain that if there has been any name transference, it has been the loss of the less common spelling of ‚ÄúScurfield‚Äù towards the more common names of Scorefield or Scourfield. This is one of the reasons why the name Scurfield has remained unusual and scarce in the world.  Family history  There are two, Scurfield family lines ‚Äì both originating from the same region in north east England. There remains the possibility that the two lines are connected, but no direct evidence of this has yet been established. The oldest Scurfield name referenced belonged to Foulke Scurfield, who was allegedly born in the 14th century. There is a lineage for him, however that lineage ends in the 16th century and any connection to a continuing line of Scurfields is, at this point, pure speculation. The Golden Grove book of pedigrees, which is generally considered very reputable, references a Sir John Scurfield (a descendant of Foulke), of Kendal in Westmoreland. He allegedly married Mary, daughter of Sir Thomas Greene (1369‚Äì1417) and his wife Mary Talbot. The Talbots and Greenes are well-established families, but nothing further can be found on the alleged daughter Mary Greene, nor any other reference to a Scurfield connection to the Greene family. The earliest Scurfield with traced and living descendants is George Scurfield who, in 1580, owned and occupied, Sheraton Grange Farm in the parish of Monk Hesledon. Through ownership of land, this family was ‚Äúimmensely wealthy‚Äù and well respected. The property was passed down through six generations of Scurfields, until William Scurfield (born 1755, Coatham, Durham), departed the world in 1790 with only one daughter. In 1831, his daughter Joanna passed the property to her eldest son, George John Grey (born 1810). Before accepting the gift, George took the name George John Grey Scurfield by royal licence. Unfortunately, none of George‚Äôs children had issue and, as a result, the property was passed down to nephews who had no interest in the property further than the money it could be sold for. Without the property to retain and generate wealth, the family money was dissipated. Even so, members of this line of Scurfield is often found to be associated with the arts, and several of George Scurfield's living descendants earn their living working as musicians, actors, and authors, such as actor Matthew Scurfield, son of the late author George Scurfield. The other Scurfield family line are descendants of the English working class. The earliest known patriarch of this line has the name of Simon Scurfield, who was born 1644 in Washington, Co. Durham. Nothing is known of where Simon Scurfield came from or what his occupation was; however, his grandson Simon, born 1722 Washington, Co. Durham, was a captain of the trades at the South Shore port. The County of Durham is rich in coal, and the Scurfields who did not have property and wealth worked the coal mines. In the later half of the 18th century the mines started to close. By the time the Haswell Colliery was finally closed in 1896, most of the residents of the area had already moved to find employment elsewhere. The descendants of the few Scurfields who decided to seek opportunity in North America have often enjoyed unusual success in business and professional practices; such as Ralph Thomas Scurfield, and his first cousin Justice John Scurfield, Q.C., to name but two.  Early settlers to the United States of America  While there may have been earlier Scurfields who came to America, the first to have moved and settled appears to have been Thomas Scurfield, who was born 1832 in Easington Lane, Co. Durham. In 1854 Thomas married Mary Harding. They obviously had a difficult life as five of their eight children died in England. In 1866 he gambled for a better life and emigrated with his wife and their three living children to the USA, where they settled in the Monongahela, Pennsylvania area. Many of the American Scurfield‚Äôs will trace their roots back to one of his two sons, Thomas Scurfield (b. 1857) and John D Scurfield (b. 1859). Another early settler to the United States was James Hunter Scurfield (born 1851, Seaton Delaval, Northumberland) who came to America from England through the New York Harbour. It has not been confirmed yet if he was of the gentry‚Äôs line or of Simon‚Äôs line; however he came from a family of coal miners so it is assumed that he is of Simon‚Äôs line. He arrived in the USA on September 6, 1879, and took up residence in Somerset, Pennsylvania. His first wife died at age 28 after 8 children. He remarried and had one adopted son, John Smith Scurfield (born 1902, Somerset County, Pennsylvania). The line of James Hunter continues to prosper throughout the USA. Scurfield Coal Inc. still exists as a company in Berlin, PA. The last name Scurfield is related to the following famous family tree: RODHAM CLINTON Hillary. Elizabeth Scurfield is the 2nd Great-grandmother of Hillary (Rodham) Clinton, (1947 - ). Elizabeth was born 13 October 1816 and lived to the ripe old age of 97. Like her parents she lived her whole life in England. Elizabeth was the daughter of the marriage of Thomas Scurfield, a Coal Miner born: 28 May 1789 in Tanfield, Co. Durham England and Margaret (n√©e Charlton). Elizabeth married Joseph Rodham and had a son Jonathan Rodham.  Early settlers to Canada  The first settlers in Canada were two brothers, Ralph Davison Scurfield (born 1871, Haswell, Co. Durham) and Thomas John Scurfield (born 1872, Haswell, Co. Durham). After the local coal mine in Haswell was closed, the brother‚Äôs took the opportunity to travel to the open land of Manitoba, Canada. Ralph first travelled to Canada in 1887, and eventually both brothers settled in Manitou, Manitoba where together they built a house (later owned by Nellie McClung & her family). An interesting thing about these two brothers is that they married two sisters (Margaret and Sarah Ann Milburn) who were also from Haswell. By 1896 the two young couples were both starting to raise their young families in Manitou. Ralph had two daughters, Violet and Ruby, and Thomas had 9 surviving children, including five sons. The line of Thomas John Scurfield continues to prosper, and it is from this line that most every Scurfield in western Canada originates.  Early settlers to Australia  The earliest Scurfield settler to Australia appears to be William Dixon Scurfield (born 1811, Alnwick, Northumberland) who, in 1852, arrived in Melbourne, Australia with his wife, Catherine Hetherington Barwise, and children. His eldest son, John Barwise Scurfield (born 1844, Liverpool, Lancashire) married an English born woman named Charlotte Fox in 1866 in Melbourne. They had 12 children, nine of whom raised families in Australia.

The CIE is intended for both online and offline identification. The information is both printed on an ID-1 card and stored in a contactless chip. After about 15 years of trials, finally as per decree of 25 May 2016 every classic identity card with expired validity must be replaced by the electronic version. On 18 July 2019, the Minister of Foreign Affairs signed a decree allowing Italians who reside abroad to request an electronic identity card. Overview Italian citizens are entitled to request an identity card, that is an optional identity document in Italy and is also a valid document to leave the country when travelling to another EU country or to those countries with which Italy has signed specific agreements. Despite any government-issued document (such as the passport, the driving licence, etc...) can be shown for identification, the identity card is very popular in Italy; so much so that it is the first document asked and the most accepted in both the public and private sectors. It is not compulsory to carry the card itself, as the authorities may ask for only the identity of a person, not a specific document. However, if public- security officers are not convinced of the claimed identity, like from a verbally-provided identity claim, they may keep the claimant in custody until the identity is ascertained. All foreigners in Italy are required by law to have identification with them at all times. Citizens of EU member countries must be ready to display an identity document that is legally government- issued in their country. Non-EU residents must have their passport with customs entrance stamp or a residence permit issued by Italian authorities; while all the resident/immigrant aliens must have a residence permit (otherwise they are illegal and face deportation), foreigners from certain non-EU countries staying in Italy for a limited amount of time (typically for tourism) may be required only to have their passport with proper customs stamp. Permanent resident aliens with a valid permesso di soggiorno (residence permit) may request an identity card, but in this case it is valid only and exclusively in Italy for identification purposes. Issuing system & costs The CIE can be requested at the Italian municipality of residence by Italian citizens and resident aliens. The request is digitally processed and transmitted to the Ministry of Internal Affairs which issues the card in collaboration with the IPZS in Rome. Finally, the card is sent to an address chosen by the applicant (or else to the municipality) and it should arrive within 6 business days. The costs are: ‚Ç¨16.79 for the card issuing and ‚Ç¨5.42 for fees charged by the municipality, which may vary (usually doubled) if the previous card was lost, stolen or deteriorated. Starting from 20 September 2019 the request can be submitted even at the Italian embassies/consulates just by Italian citizens residing abroad. After a test time at the consular offices in Vienna, Athens and Nice, the service is extended to all the European Union and to some countries where Italians have the right of free movement (Norway, Monaco, San Marino, Switzerland and Vatican City). The issuing process is the same as in Italy and the card should arrive within 15 days. The costs are: ‚Ç¨21.95 in case of renewal or first issue, otherwise ‚Ç¨27.11 if the previous card was lost or stolen. Validity According to the Law 106/2011 the card lasts: * 10 years for adults aged 18 and above * 5 years for minors aged 3‚Äì18 * 3 years for children aged up to 3 and, according to the Law 35/2012, the validity is extended or shortened in order to expire on the birthday. Contactless chip The biometric symbol on the front of the CIE 3.0 Like European biometric passports, the CIE has an embedded electronic microprocessor chip that stores the following items: * Name * Surname * Place and date of birth * Residency * Holder's picture * Two fingerprints (one of each hand), only if the applicant is aged 12 or over The information can be read with NFC tools, but anyway fingerprints are accessible just by police forces. Physical appearance The card has an ID-1 standard size and it is made of polycarbonate with many security features (such as holograms, security backgrounds, micro-texts, guilloches, etc...), over which the information is printed by using the laser engraving technology. The front side bears the emblem of the Italian Republic and the background of the reverse side is derived from the geometric design of the Piazza del Campidoglio in Rome created by Renaissance artist and architect Michelangelo Buonarroti. =Front= Front of the CIE 3.0 # Card number (for example CA00000AA) # Issuing municipality (or, if living abroad, issuing embassy/consulate) # Surname # Name # Place and date of birth # Sex # Height # Nationality # Date of issue # Date of expiry # Holder's signature # Card Access Number ‚Äì CAN # This field is located under the CAN and it doesn't exist if the document is valid to travel abroad.

He is a former member of the Rwandan Patriotic Army and allegedly a former Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Patriotic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (FPLC), the military wing of the Union of Congolese Patriots. Until March 2013, he was wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for the war crimes of enlisting and conscripting children under the age of fifteen and using them to participate actively in hostilities. Prior to his surrender, Ntaganda had been allegedly involved in the rebel group March 23 Movement, a military group based in eastern areas of the DRC. On 18 March 2013, Ntaganda voluntarily handed himself into the U.S. Embassy in Rwanda, asking to be transferred to the ICC. On 22 March, he was taken into custody by the ICC. On 8 July 2019, the ICC convicted him of war crimes. He was subsequently sentenced to 30 years for crimes against humanity. Early life Ntaganda was born in the small town of Kinigi, situated in the foothills of Rwanda's Virunga mountain range in the Musanze District. When he was a teenager, Ntaganda fled to Ngungu-Masisi in eastern DRC after attacks on his fellow ethnic Tutsis started taking place in Rwanda. He attended secondary school there but did not graduate; at the age of 17 he joined Rwandan Patriotic Front rebels in southern Uganda. At some point he acquired Congolese citizenship. Rwandan and Congolese military career Ntaganda fought with the Rwandan Patriotic Army in the early 1990s and participated in the overthrow of the Hutu-led Rwandan government in 1994 following the Rwandan genocide. He subsequently joined the Patriotic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (FPLC), the military wing of the Union of Congolese Patriots (UPC), and became its chief of military operations. During this time, he is alleged to have been involved in numerous massacres and other serious human rights abuses. When Ntaganda was in charge of the UPC, he told child soldiers; \\"When you're a soldier, you get a woman for free. Everything is free.\\" In January 2005, Ntaganda was offered a position as a general in the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo as part of a peace process, but he refused the offer.

Congolese authorities reported that on both occasions Ntaganda had gone there to attend a burial, having sought official authorization to do so from his military hierarchy and from immigration authorities. Rwandan officials said that they have no objections to Ntaganda crossing the border. They claim that his status as a sanctioned individual \\"is not a Rwandan problem, but a Democratic Republic of the Congo problem\\", adding that \\"Bosco contributes to peace and security to the region, which converges with Rwanda's aims\\".United Nations Group of Experts, S/2011/738, p.149 A United Nations group of experts reported in late 2011 that Ntaganda controlled the Mungwe and Fungamwaka mines, near Numbi, through the Great Lakes Mining Company, managed by Edson Musabarura. Ntaganda also derived profits from mineral exploitation at Nyabibwe, through his alliance with Colonel Saddam Ringo. At Rubaya, Ntaganda gained large revenues from taxation levied by \\"parallel\\" mine police. Ntaganda ordered his troops to intervene on behalf of Krall Metal Congo at Lueshe.UN Group of Experts, S/2011/738, p.150 On 4 April 2012, it was reported that Ntaganda and 300 loyal troops defected from the DRC and clashed with government forces in the Rutshuru region north of Goma. On 11 April 2012, president Joseph Kabila called for Ntaganda's arrest. On 16 March 2013, Sultani Makenga's forces \\"seized control ... of the town of Kibumba ... Ntaganda and an estimated 200 fighters fled into the forest while hundreds of others crossed the border into Rwanda,\\" including \\"about 300 uniformed M23 rebels loyal to Ntaganda.\\" Indictment by the International Criminal Court On 22 August 2006, a Pre-Trial Chamber of the ICC found that there were reasonable grounds to believe that Ntaganda bore individual criminal responsibility for war crimes committed by the FPLC between July 2002 and December 2003, and issued a warrant for his arrest. He was charged with the war crimes of enlisting and conscripting children under the age of fifteen and using them to participate actively in hostilities. The arrest warrant was originally issued under seal because the court decided that \\"public knowledge of the proceedings in this case might result in Bosco Ntaganda hiding, fleeing, and/or obstructing or endangering the investigations or the proceedings of the Court\\". In April 2008, the court ruled that circumstances had changed and unsealed the warrant. On 18 March 2013, Ntaganda handed himself in to the U.S. embassy in Kigali, Rwanda, where he requested transfer to the International Criminal Court in The Hague. Though the reasons for his surrender are unknown it was speculated that he was either pressured to do so by Rwanda or feared infighting within the M23 movement and its military leader Sultani Makenga, which had recently militarily forced a faction around Jean- Marie Runiga Lugerero and Baudouin Ngaruye, which was allegedly connected to Ntaganda, to flee the DRC into Rwanda. Though Rwanda was not a signatory to the Rome Statute, the media speculated it would be forced to turn him over to the ICC. The U.S. also had listed him on its War Crimes Rewards Program. On 22 March, he was detained by the ICC. He made his first appearance before the ICC on 26 March. At his first appearance before the ICC in the Hague on 26 March 2013, Ntaganda denied his guilt. Trial Ntaganda's trial at the ICC began on 3 September 2015. He pleaded not guilty to eighteen charges brought against him, including rape, murder, recruitment of child soldiers and sexual slavery of civilians. The trial was expected to last many months with the prosecution calling eighty witnesses, thirteen of them expert and the rest victims. Three of the witnesses were former child soldiers in Ntaganda's Patriotic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (FPLC). On 8 July 2019 he was convicted on all 18 counts and on 7 November 2019 was sentenced to 30 years in prison, the longest sentence ever handed down by the ICC. He is the first person to be convicted of sexual slavery by the ICC.

He was born in 1946 in Ishikawa, Japan. From a family that owns a cedar forest and lumber mill. Originally trained as a painter, Kadonaga soon realized that ‚Äúothers painted better‚Äù.The New Yorker, 1987 In his father‚Äôs sawmill he rediscovered the natural beauty of wood. His work can be related to two recent art movements in Japan, though he was not directly involved with either. The Gutai, or ‚Äúconcrete‚Äù movement of the 1950s and, later, the Mono-ha or ‚Äúobject‚Äù group which operates in a way similar to Western ‚Äúprocess artists‚Äù.Artspace, 1989  Wood  Kadonaga's earliest works that gained him international attention were made with a veneer slicer to cut cedar logs with the bark removed into long strips the thickness of paper. The strips were then glued back together in the form of the original log. As well as slicing logs, Kadonaga has also carved geometric shapes, and split logs to reveal the grain. Wood is Kadonaga‚Äôs most extensively used material, which he uses to ‚Äúexplore different ways of looking at a tree, not to take a tree for granted‚Äù (Artspace, 1989)  Silk  In his silk pieces, Kadonaga builds wooden grids from pine or cedar wood. He then releases on them silkworms that have been fed and readied for making cocoons. The worms then explore the structures Kadonaga made for them, and settle in the different crannies throughout. Because worms tend to bunch toward the top, and left the bottom of the structures untouched, Kadonaga has previously spent 48 hours periodically turning the grids while the worms roam, tricking them into settling in a more even distribution. The final result was niches filled with the round silkworm cocoons as well as threads of silk left along the frame.  Paper  In his works of paper, Kadonaga uses handmade paper, a traditional Japanese craft. He has it made into unusual shapes such as triangles, strips, oblongs, and stack it wet. While the paper is wet, it is clamped, so as it dries the free sections fluff up while the clamped sections remain flat. (New Yorker, 1987).  Glass  In more recent years Kadonaga has worked extensively with glass, which he forms with the spiral flow of a single stream of molten glass, sustained up to 48 hours. After working with and experimenting with the material, Kadonaga devised a process for pouring the glass through an opening in the top of a custom built, computer controlled kiln.San Francisco Chronicle, 2002 The process is monitored to make sure the structure continues to grow, and a computer keeps the temperature in the kiln constant to avoid cracks or other types of breaks. Otherwise, there is no control over the piece and the glass itself dictate's the work's final form. Once the pour is completed, the works have to cool up to 4 months before being moved.  Collections  Kazuo Kadonaga‚Äôs art is included in collections such as the Museo de Arte Moderno in Mexico City, the Museum of Modern Art in Toyama, Japan, The Museum of Class in Tacoma, Washington, Rijksmuseum Kroller Muller, in Otterlo, the Netherlands.

It is found in wetlands and peat bogs from northern Europe eastwards to Siberia, and the adults are active from around April till September, which is known as the \\"flight period\\". It breeds in acidic bodies of water, laying its eggs in clumps of sphagnum moss that provide a safe habitat for larval development. The larvae are particularly vulnerable to predation by fish, and so are usually found in lakes where fish are not present. L. dubia is listed as a species of least concern (LC) by the IUCN Red List, however, it is potentially threatened by habitat destruction, pollution, and climate change. Description This species has a predominantly black body, usually 33-37mm in length \\\\- the abdomen is 21‚Äì27 mm long and the hindwing is 23‚Äì28 mm long. Mature males have striking red and orange markings on the abdomen and thorax which become darker with age, whereas young males and females have pale yellow markings. All individuals have a conspicuous white frons at the front of the head. The wings have a brown patch at the base and noticeable black pterostigma. It may be confused with similar species, including the black darter (Sympetrum danae), ruddy darter (Sympetrum sanguineum) and common darter (Sympetreum striolatum), however is usually distinguishable by its white face patch.  Distribution  This dragonfly's range extends from western Europe to Japan, and it is commonly found in western, northern and eastern Europe at higher altitudes, but is rare in southern Europe and the United Kingdom. In recent decades, this species has been observed as far afield as Russia and China, however the vast majority of sightings have occurred in central and northern Europe. In Britain, the majority of individuals of this species are found in the highlands of Scotland, with key populations located in Inverness-shire and Ross-shire. In England, a few isolated populations occur in Cheshire and Cumbria, where biodiversity action plans have been set up to protect them, and as far south as Chartley Moss National Nature Reserve in Staffordshire. However, when British populations are considered overall, this species has been in decline over the past 35 years.  Habitat  Adult individuals of L. dubia can utilise scrub and woodland habitat for roosting and foraging. The larvae require terrestrial areas of water, such as marshes, wetlands and peat bogs, that generally have vegetation growing at the water's edge. Peat bogs form a particularly important habitat, since they provide acidic conditions necessary for the growth of sphagnum moss, which provides a source of food and shelter. Life history = Larval stage = Female Like all other species of dragonfly, the larvae of this species grow by moulting (in which the exoskeleton is shed) several times during development. In the early stages of development, larvae preferentially inhabit sphagnum moss, which may provide a reliable source of food because the moss can trap organic matter that would otherwise sink to the bottom of the water. As well as fish, many waterfowl, amphibians, and other invertebrates will prey upon dragonfly larvae, so the mats likely also provide a safe hiding place from predators. The larvae are able to change colour depending on whether the moss they are inhabiting is brown or green, which would help to visually disguise them from predators. The acidification of ponds and lakes due to airborne pollution may in fact benefit L. dubia and other species that prefer acidic conditions, as this can result in a greater occurrence of sphagnum moss. Larvae will actively forage throughout both the day and night, however have been shown to capture more prey during the night. Larvae will also cannibalise their conspecifics, particularly in the absence of an abundant food source (zooplankton), and can be threatened by predation from other species of dragonflies. Larger individuals will generally cannibalise smaller individuals, and it is believed that this functions as a way of controlling population numbers. The larvae generally do not thrive in environments where fish predators are present, and in some case appear to be more vulnerable to predation compared to other species of dragonflies, possibly due to their active foraging behaviour. An active foraging strategy means the larvae purposely swim to different parts of their habitat in search of prey, as opposed to a passive ‚Äúsit and wait‚Äù strategy exhibited by some other species of dragonfly. They rely primarily upon visual cues to locate prey, and will consume anything that isn‚Äôt too large or powerful for them to handle. They are therefore more likely to occur in areas of water where fish are absent. Since fish are less likely to occur in relatively smaller bodies of water, since these are at greater risk of becoming oxygen deficient during the winter, it has been suggested that adult dragonflies may choose where to lay their eggs by judging the size of a lake. The larvae have, however, been shown to exhibit phenotypic plasticity in the presence of predators, which means that larvae in danger of predation are able to grow longer dorsal and lateral spines as a defence mechanism. = Reproductive stage = Individuals of this species typically take 1-3 years to reach adulthood. The adults breed in acidic pools where sphagnum moss is present. The male holds a small territory near a body of water, and copulation with the female often begins over the water before they settle on the ground for about 30 minutes. The female drops the eggs amongst submerged moss or stems of cottongrass that grow along the edge of the water. Adult dragonflies emerge between May and early July in Great Britain; the exact timing depends on the latitude and weather. When the larvae have developed sufficiently and are ready to emerge as adults, they climb out of the water up a plant stem and shed their exoskeleton one final time. Males become sexually mature 4‚Äì12 days after emergence, and females a few days later; can generally be seen during their \\"flight period\\" from April till September. Conservation = Status = L. dubia is listed as a species of least concern (LC) by the IUCN Red List, meaning that it is not currently considered to be threatened by extinction. This categorisation applies to the species when all populations are considered across its entire range. However, it is red-listed in a number of European countries within its range, including Germany, Austria, Switzerland and the UK. Greater research and monitoring is currently required on population distribution and trends, to better understand how this species will fare in the future. Most of the recent scientific research has been conducted in central and northern Europe, and less is known about eastern populations in Siberia, where L. dubia is rarely seen. = Threats = L. dubia is vulnerable to alteration and destruction of its habitat, primarily due to water pollution, industrialisation, and development for agriculture. It is protected by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 in the United Kingdom, where 95% of lowland peat bogs have been destroyed, and it is also covered by Biodiversity Action Plans in some British counties. Conservation reintroduction programmes have been shown to be a successful method for restoring populations to suitable sites, and in 2010 it was reintroduced to Witherslack Mosses in Cumbria, after 13 years of restoration management. Isolated, fragmented populations are at an increased risk of local extinction due to a lack of exchange of genetic variation, resulting in potential inbreeding depression and increased impact of sudden, random events such as disease outbreaks. Populations of L. dubia in the UK, the Pyrenees and the Alps have been found to be more genetically distinct than other European populations, and may therefore be considered priorities for conservation, as they are likely to retain important genetic variation for adapting to changing climate conditions. A rise in average annual temperatures caused by global warming could negatively impact L. dubia by allowing invasive species such as the scarlet dragonfly (Crocothemis erythraea) to occupy habitats further north of their natural range. Although the growth rate of L. dubia doesn‚Äôt appear to be affected by temperature, C. erythraea can grow faster at higher temperatures, causing L. dubia to suffer higher levels of competition and mortality. Due to the particular sensitivity of the larval stage to the presence of fish, this species could be threatened by the practice of artificially stocking lakes with fish for the purpose of recreational fishing. The process of liming acidified lakes, to increase their pH and restore fish populations, also poses a threat by reducing the amount of sphagnum moss present. Acidic lakes where fish are naturally absent could be of high conservation value for this species.

Bronchomalacia means 'floppiness' of some part of the bronchi. Patients present with noisy breathing and/or wheezing. There is collapse of a main stem bronchus on exhalation. If the trachea is also involved the term tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) is used. If only the upper airway the trachea is involved it is called tracheomalacia (TM). There are two types of bronchomalacia. Primary bronchomalacia is due to a deficiency in the cartilaginous rings. Secondary bronchomalacia may occur by extrinsic compression from an enlarged vessel, a vascular ring or a bronchogenic cyst. Though uncommon, idiopathic (of unknown cause) tracheobronchomalacia has been described in older adults. Cause Bronchomalacia can best be described as a birth defect of the bronchus in the respiratory tract. Congenital malacia of the large airways is one of the few causes of irreversible airways obstruction in children, with symptoms varying from recurrent wheeze and recurrent lower airways infections to severe dyspnea and respiratory insufficiency. It may also be acquired later in life due to chronic or recurring inflammation resulting from infection or other airway disease.Carden, KA, Boiselle, PM, Waltz, DA, et al.

Career =As a fashion designer= Michael Fish was born in Wood Green, London in 1940. His Mother Joan, worked in a chemist shop in Winchmore Hill, his father, Sydney, was an on-course bookmaker. He had one sister, Lesley and a brother named Philip. Fish was apprenticed in shirtmaking, and by the early 1960s was designing shirts at traditional men's outfitters Turnbull & Asser of Jermyn Street. His designs reflected, and to some extent brought on, the \\"Peacock Revolution\\" in men's fashion design, which was a reaction against the dull conservatism of men's dress. His shirts were floral in pattern and often included ruffles and other adornments. By the middle 1960s, he had opened his own boutique in Mayfair, with Mr Barry Sainsbury, the exclusive establishment was named Mr. Fish, and was situated on Clifford Street.ibid Peculiar to Mr Fish became a fashion icon known for designing flamboyant, attention-getting clothing for notable celebrities of the 1960s and 1970s such as Peter Sellers, Lord Snowden and David Bowie. By the middle 1970s, the Mr Fish shop had closed, and he took a job with Sulka in New York, a label famous for its silk foulard dressing gowns. In 1978, he returned to London to work for Jeremy Norman as greeter at the fashionable Embassy Club in Bond Street, the London equivalent of Studio 54. Mr Fish designs set fashion trends, the kipper tie being one unique example, the polo neck sweater look, which proved a major success in New York and London in the winter of 1967.Sims, Josh. Rock Fashion. Omnibus Press, 2001. P. 81. Perhaps the most controversial of Fish's designs was the \\"dress\\" designed to be worn by men, which was occasionally worn by such rock stars as David Bowie (including on the cover of the album The Man Who Sold the World) and Mick Jagger in the Hyde Park charity concert (including in the film Performance).Rock Fashion p. 116 In 2004, Fish suffered a ruptured aorta which led to a severe stroke. He has been in a nursing home for the last ten years. Fish was never married and has no children. His brand has now been purchased by David Mason who is bringing out a range of Mr Fish clothing. =Film work= Fish's designs could be seen in films between the middle 1960s and the early 1970s as well, such as Performance, in which Mick Jagger wears one of Fish's dresses for men. Fish was credited as a costume designer for the Peter Sellers film There's a Girl in My Soup.There's a Girl in My Soup, (1970).

Biography  William Ruggles was born in Rochester, Massachusetts, about fifty miles south of present-day Boston, on Tuesday September 5, 1797. He was the son of Elisha Ruggles and Mary Clap who also parented six other children: Nathaniel, Micah, Henry, Charles, James, and Lucy. William was the second youngest child in his family. Not much is known about his childhood growing up in Massachusetts until he enrolled in Brown University; where he later graduated from, at the age of twenty-three, in the class of 1820. Two years after graduating from Brown University, Ruggles became a tutor at Columbian College. On February 9, 1821 Congress chartered Columbian College, a nonsectarian school but with Baptist sponsorship that would not become the George Washington University until January 23, 1904. In 1824, two years after he became a tutor, Ruggles became a Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy, a position he would retain until 1865. In 1827 William Ruggles became the chair of both mathematics and natural philosophy. In 1865 Ruggles was made professor emeritus. He continued to lecture on political economy and civil polity from 1865 to 1874. He died at Schooley's Mountain, New Jersey, on Monday, September 10, 1877, five days after his eightieth birthday. Legacy Ruggles was a man of many admirable characteristics including loyalty, conscientiousness, and morality, which are shown not only through the words of those who describe him but through his actions as well. The best example of William Ruggles' loyalty was shown in his dedication to the Columbian College itself. Until 1985, no person had a longer stay at the George Washington University. Ruggles came to the George Washington University in 1822 and stayed until his death, a record at the time, of fifty-five and a half years, which has only been surpassed once by Elmer Louis Kayser who came to the university as a student in 1914 and stayed until his eventual death in 1985. William Ruggles was involved at the Columbian College (George Washington University) from almost the beginning of the Columbian College. He lived through the drab years of 1826 through 1842 where mounting debt and pressure threatened to shut down the Columbian College and rejoiced harder than anyone when that debt was lifted. He served under the first six presidents of the institution and even served as acting president three times. He saw a large student body dwindle down to a handful of students due to the US civil war. Since the college buildings were being used as a hospital in the war efforts, classes were taught in the homes of professors. Lastly, Professor Ruggles had the enjoyment of being a contemporary to University President Welling. Ruggles was the owner of over thirty historical and archival books which are now located in the Gelman Library Archives at George Washington University. The subjects include theology, philosophy, psychology, economics, mathematics (algebra and geometry), and chemistry, all of which Ruggles either taught or was passionate about. Ruggles was described by President Welling, the second president of the George Washington University: The Board of Trustees, in adopting resolutions in appreciation of his services, declared Ruggles in similar words to Welling, saying, \\"We hereby testify and record our exulted sense of the virtues which adorned his private character, the unselfish zeal he brought to the performance of all his duties and the inestimable value of the manifold and multiform services which he rendered to the College during the long period of his connection with its history.\\" William Ruggles was noted for his generous contributions to charities and missionary bequests. His accomplishments and contributions were honored and recognized when he received an honorary LL.D. from Brown University in 1852, the same school that he graduated from more than thirty years prior Upon reviewing letters that Ruggles had written, it can be seen that he was full of charity towards his students. While he may be described as someone who was \\"not always loved but who was always respected,\\" it can be seen that Ruggles did have great affection towards the students he taught. On November 24, 1837, Ruggles wrote a letter to Joel R. Poinsett about the character of a young man named John D. Kuntz, who was expecting to make appointment as a cadet at West Point Military Academy. In the letter Ruggles goes on to praise the young boy and even go as far as to call him, \\"a young man of sound principles.\\" William Ruggles' folders were filled with many such letters, expressing his kind opinions on the young students that he respected and cared for. Although it is noted that Ruggles was a man of spirit, he was a member of no religion despite the fact that he dealt almost exclusively with the Baptist church. Ruggles shared very many correspondences with Reverend Elon Galusha with letters dating from November 1825 all the way until April 1832, while it is unclear what the two wrote about it clear that these letters dealt with Ruggles faith. In a letter preserved to a different Reverend, Ruggles states that, Although William Ruggles died 1877, a reprint of his obituary appeared in the Faculty Newsletter volume 2, number 1, Spring 1965 as part of a series of called GW Footnotes. It was titled the 55-Year Professor and was the first in a series of anecdotes from the university's past written by the university historian. Ruggles Prizes The Ruggles Prizes are awarded annually for excellence in mathematics to a candidate for a bachelor's degree. The prizes were initiated in 1859, and consists of two gold medals.

Life Maurice, the son of Thomas Maurice, curate of the parish of Llangristiolus, Anglesey, was educated at Beaumaris Grammar School. He then matriculated at Jesus College, Oxford in 1664 at the age of 16, graduating with a B.A. degree in 1668. His ability led to Leoline Jenkins, the college principal, taking an interest in him, and Maurice was elected to a fellowship in 1670 (a position he retained until 1685). He obtained further degrees: M.A. (1671), B.D. (1679) and D.D. (1683). After his ordination, he became curate of Cheltenham after 1669, returning to the college in 1671 only to leave in 1673 to accompany Jenkins as his chaplain to the Congress of Cologne, where Jenkins was an English representative in attempts to settle the Third Anglo-Dutch War. Maurice gained skills in modern languages on this mission and at later negotiations with Jenkins at Nijmegen. In 1680, William Lloyd, Bishop of St Asaph, helped Maurice to be appointed domestic chaplain to William Sancroft, Archbishop of Canterbury (a position that Maurice held until 1691).

The summary on the dust jacket of the first UK edition reads, in part; 'The setting is again South Africa, but the tragedy this time is of a white man who, for complicated reasons, some of them not unconnected with his childhood and training, succumbs to the very temptations he might have been thought strong enough to resist.

He is chiefly known for his work on Roman Catholic churches, including the cathedral churches of Salford and Sheffield. Training Hadfield was born at Lees Hall in Glossop, Derbyshire, the son of Joseph Hadfield and Mary Hadfield (n√©e Ellison). He attended Woolton Grove Academy in Liverpool, and subsequently, between 1827 and 1831, he worked for his uncle Michael Ellison (his mother's brother), agent of the estates of the Dukes of Norfolk in Sheffield. From 1831 he was articled to the architectural firm of Woodhead and Hurst of Doncaster, and then to P. F. Robinson of London. He married Sarah Frith of Sheffield at around this time. Career Practising as an architect in Sheffield from 1834, Hadfield's first commission was the design of the Cholera Monument in Sheffield, a memorial to the 402 victims of the cholera epidemic of 1832 in the city. In 1838 Hadfield entered a partnership in Sheffield with John Grey Weightman, which lasted until 1858. In 1850 they were joined by their former pupil George Goldie, and the partnership between Hadfield and Goldie lasted until 1860. From 1864Oxford Dictionary of National Biography or 1865 Hadfield was in partnership with his son Charles Hadfield (1840‚Äì1916). After Hadfield's death in 1885, his son continued the practice, and was later joined in partnership by Hadfield's grandson Charles Matthew Ellison Hadfield (1867‚Äì1949). St Marie's Cathedral, Sheffield (1847‚Äì1850) As an architect, Hadfield was an early follower of the Gothic revival movement led by A.W.N. Pugin. Hadfield designed numerous Catholic churches, including All Saints, Glossop, St. Bede's, Rotherham, St Hilda's, Whitby, St Catherine's Church, Littlehampton and St Chad‚Äôs. His largest and most significant work was St John's Church in Salford (1844‚Äì1848) which in 1850 was elevated to cathedral status upon the restoration of the Catholic hierarchy in England and Wales. St John's was in the decorated style, as was St Marie's Church in Sheffield (1847‚Äì1850; elevated to cathedral status in 1980). A further cathedral commission, in the form of the Cathedral of the Annunciation and St. Nathy, Ballaghaderreen, in the diocese of Achonry, Ireland, came in 1855 (completed 1860). Hadfield also designed railway stations, including that at Glossop, and those of the East Lincolnshire Railway together with Sheffield's Wicker Arches viaduct, in the neo-classical style, in 1848.

Winding its way up the backbone-like crest of Snake Den Ridge, the trail connects the Cosby Campground to the Appalachian Trail and provides the quickest access to the high peaks of the Eastern Smokies. The trail passes through three forest types-- a mixed deciduous forest at its lower elevations, a substantial stand of heath bald on the more narrow sections of the ridge crest, and an old growth northern-style coniferous forest at its higher elevations. The trailhead is located at the Cosby Campground across the street from Campsite B51, at the southwest end of the campground. Spur trails connect the trailhead to the Low Gap Trail to the east and the Gabes Mountain Trail to the north. A substantial parking lot for hikers is located on the opposite side of the campground, near the ranger station. The park's Cosby entrance is located just off Tennessee State Route 32, which splits off from U.S. Route 321 in the town of Cosby. Vital information *With a few minor exceptions (namely the two creek crossings), the Snake Den Ridge Trail is a continuous, unbroken ascent from trailhead to trail terminus. The ascent is very gradual at first, following an old maintenance road, but becomes rugged and steep just beyond the maintenance road's cul-de-sac. The section between the Inadu Creek crossing and the Maddron Bald Trail junction winds through multiple switchbacks. *There is no footbridge at the Inadu Creek crossing, but the stream is usually passable with little effort. Like any mountain stream, however, heavy rains can render Inadu Creek volatile and unpredictable. *As the trail approaches the Maddron Bald Trail junction, it ascends a poorly lit and poorly drained section of the ridgecrest laden with rocks. In colder months, the water that accumulates along this section of the trail freezes over, coating the rocks in a sheet of ice. *The Cosby Knob Shelter is located along the Appalachian Trail east (going northward) of the Snake Den Ridge Trail junction. The Tricorner Knob Shelter is located along the Appalachian Trail southwest of the Snake Den Ridge Trail junction.

Inadu Knob is the northernmost of the high summits of the Eastern Smokies and the last mile-high summit traversed by the Appalachian Trail heading northward before the trail begins its descent to the Pigeon River Valley.

Inadu Creek parallels the southern base of Snake Den Ridge, flowing in a northeastward direction toward Cosby Campground before emptying into Crying Creek near the Gabes Mountain Trailhead. The northern flank of Snake Den Ridge is drained by the upper Greenbrier Creek watershed. All of these streams are part of the greater Pigeon River watershed. Trail synopsis =Cosby Campground to Inadu Creek -- 2 miles= Cul-de-sac end of the gravel road, appx. 1 mile from the trailhead. Campsites at the Cosby Campground are organized into \\"A\\" group and \\"B\\" group, with the B group being south of the A group. The Snake Den Ridge Trailhead is located across the street from Campsite B51. The hikers' parking lot is situated on the other side of the campground, so dayhikers must cross the campground (appx. ) to reach the trailhead. From the trailhead, the trail follows a gravel maintenance road to its intersection with the Cosby Horse Trail, which connects the Snake Den Ridge Trail to the Low Gap Trail on the slopes of Mount Cammerer. The Snake Den Ridge Trail continues westward, rising gradually along the gravel road. At approximately , the trail passes a small cemetery, which contains several burials of residents who lived in the Cosby Campground vicinity before the creation of the park. One notable burial is Ella Costner (1894-1982), the \\"Poet Laureate of the Smokies,\\" who wrote extensively of the Eastern Smokies region. Beyond the cemetery, the trail continues its gradual ascent along the old gravel road. At approximately one mile, the road ends in a cul-de-sac. A brief spur path on the right (north) leads to a low cliff overlooking Rock Creek. The Snake Den Ridge Trail continues westward near the top of the cul-de-sac, where it departs from the gravel road to follow a rugged backcountry trail (there is no sign, but the trail is marked by a string of mid-sized rocks). Shortly thereafter, the trail descends briefly to cross Rock Creek. The creek can be crossed via the log footbridge or an adjacent low fording area. After the Rock Creek crossing the Snake Den Ridge Trail begins a steep ascent toward Inadu Creek, which it briefly parallels. At around , the trail turns sharply to the south for several hundred yards before switching back to the west and reapproaching Inadu Creek. From this section of the trail, the crest of Snake Den Ridge is discernible through the treeline. After a series of relatively steep inclines, the trail finally turns northward and briefly descends to the creek. =Inadu Creek to Maddron Bald Trail junction -- 2.6 miles= The Snake Den Ridge Trail entering a stand of heath along the ridgecrest. The Snake Den Ridge Trail crosses Inadu Creek immediately upstream from a small waterfall. The creek's streambed, like most streams on the slopes of the Smokies, is filled with boulders. From Inadu Creek, the trail follows a steep incline northward to the crest of the ridge, where it turns westward again to ascend along the ridgecrest. The trail follows a series of inclines and switchbacks as it winds its way across the top of the ridge. Views through the treeline of Cocke County to the north alternate with views of Camel Hump Ridge and the main Smokies crest to the south as the trail switches back and forth across the ridgeline. As it ascends the crest of Snake Den Ridge, the trail traverses several backbone formations lined with thick stands of rhododendron and mountain laurel known as heaths (sometimes called \\"hells\\" in Appalachia). Heaths often appear on narrow ridges, where the soil is too poor to support larger wooded plants. One of the park's most spectacular examples of heath bald occurs atop Maddron Bald, a mountain rising to the west of Snake Den Ridge. At around , vestiges of the coniferous forest that blankets the higher elevations in the Smokies begin to appear. The trail passes through a final switchback to the poorly lit western flank of Snake Den Ridge and ascends southward along a steep, rock-strewn incline to its junction with the Maddron Bald Trail. Maddron's heath-covered summit is located along the Maddron Bald Trail approximately west of the Snake Den Ridge Trail junction. =Maddron Bald Trail junction to Appalachian Trail -- 0.7 miles= The Snake Den Ridge Trail at its Maddron Bald Trail junction At the Maddron Bald Trail junction, the Snake Den Ridge Trail continues southward up into the northern-style forest. Just beyond the junction, before the trail turns briefly to the east, the summits of Inadu Knob and Old Black are visible through a break in the foliage. The inclines along this last section of the trail become more gradual before culminating a final sharp ascent to the Appalachian Trail. At this junction, there is a large outcropping of contorted sandstone and a view of the Upper Cosby Valley to the southeast. Near the Appalachian Trail junction, a few pieces of wreckage from an F4 Phantom fighter jet are scattered along the trail. This plane crashed near the summit of Inadu Knob in 1984.Jack Neely, \\"Smoky Mountain Archaeology.\\" Metro Pulse 12, no. 14 (April 2002). A more substantial scattering of this wreckage can be found along the Appalachian Trail, just south of the Snake Den Ridge Trail junction. A high- altitude helicopter landing pad is located along the Appalachian Trail in the gap between Inadu Knob and Old Black, approximately southwest of the Snake Den Ridge junction. This landing pad area allows an unobstructed view of the high peaks of the Eastern Smokies, with Old Black and Mount Guyot to the southwest, Luftee Knob to the south, and Big Cataloochee Mountain and Mount Sterling to the southeast. Just beyond the landing area, on the slopes of Old Black, there are several breaks in the treeline opening up views of the Tennessee Valley to the northwest and Clingmans Dome and Mount Le Conte to the west.

The catchment starts in Wahpoonga Range near Mount Elliot in the coastal Great Sandy National Park and meanders south through a lakes district around Tewantin. Lakes situated on the river include Lake Cooloola, Lake Como, Lake Cootharaba, Lake Cooroibah and Lake Weyba. The catchment is mostly covered by sand dunes and has two major tributaries--Kin Kin Creek and Teewah Creek. Pelican on the banks of the Noosa River The Noosa River enters the Coral Sea between Noosa Heads and Noosa North Shore. Substantial residential development has encroached into areas previously occupied by the changing river path. The river is noted for its populations of migratory birdlife. History Logging along the river began in 1864. The logs were transported north to a sawmill near Maryborough until 1870 when a sawmill was built on Lake Cootharaba. Richard Branson purchased Makepeace Island on the river in May 2003. Noosa Council scaled down his plans for a luxury resort on the river. Several kilometers of beach to the north of the mouth were a popular destination for four-wheel driving, until the Sunshine Coast Regional Council placed restrictions on them in May 2007. Chemical contamination has been the suspected cause of a fish mutation resulting in two-headed fish larvae found in the Noosa River. Government investigations into the problem began in 2007. A final scientific report into the cause of the spawning was delayed in 2010 because of the potential to prejudice ongoing civil court proceedings involving the hatchery and a nearby macadamia nut farm. Until the 1960s the Noosa beach and river entrance were in a state of dynamic equilibrium. The beach was wide and usable and it recovered quickly from the occasional extreme storm events such as cyclones. From the mid 60's rapid development on the beachfront including building a rockwall along the beach created instability. The beach became narrow and often non existent at high tide. At this time the river entered the sea at the present day Noosa Woods. In 1978 a training wall was built to relocate the river entrance to the northwest where it is today.

The valleys in the river's catchment area are broad rather than gorge-like as in the nearby Carnarvon Gorge, with isolated bluffs and pillars of sandstone on sandy plains. The Maranoa passes through Mitchell and flows south towards St George. The river reaches its confluence with the Balonne River north of St George. The Balonne eventually flows into the Darling River (via a few branches), so it contributes to the Murray-Darling Basin. From source to mouth, the Maranoa is joined by 31 tributaries including the Merivale River and descends over its course. The Warrego Highway crosses the river at Mitchell. The Neil Turner Weir was built on the river in 1984. It provides limited supplies for irrigation purposes. It also regulates streamflow and has recreational uses.

The bridge crosses the Lugton Water a short distance northwest of Eglinton Castle () and was named after the Eglinton Tournament of 1839. The castle and surrounding grounds were once home to the Montgomerie family, Earls of Eglinton and chiefs of the Clan Montgomery.  History  =The Tournament Bridges= The surviving 'Tournament Bridge' was built to provide an appropriate crossing point to gain access to the far side of the Lugton Water and the Eglinton Kennels, circa 1845. Archibald Montgomerie, the 13th Earl of Eglinton had the bridge built in a Gothic style, using cast iron for the arches, pinnacles, etc. and stone for the two pairs of miniature ornamental towers at either end. These towers have subtle design differences (See photographs) which are significant in the context of the extended history of the bridge. This 'Tournament' bridge is said to have been designed by the architect David Hamilton; agreement to build the original three arched bridge was reached on 16 October 1799 by the 12th Earl of Eglinton and Hamilton's first recorded work dates from 1807. An Adam Russell is recorded as being partner to the agreement.National Archives of Scotland. GD3/2/170. The first bridge is described by Aiton in 1811 as A bridge of three arches, the piers of stone, and the arches of cast-iron, of the most elegant device, imitating the gothic style of the castle, with the family arms in the centre, now building about 100 yards below the castle, where the river is 102 feet broad ...Aiton, William (1811).

The 1839 Eglinton Tournament was held on a meadow or holm at a loop in the Lugton Water. Most of the holm no longer exists, the excavations in this area having provided gravel and sand for the construction of the Kilwinning bypass and leaving behind an excavation pit which is now known as Eglinton Loch. The Knights on horseback and their retinue reached the tilt yard ('C' on the map) via an enclosed ride ('G' on the map), whilst the guests and visitors made their way to the stands via the route marked 'F' on the map illustrated. Both groups crossed over the previous three arched Gothic bridge. A map of 1837 of Eglinton Castle, Grounds and Tilt yard of 1837 shows that the tilt yard was already in existence at this early date, but it is not recorded what its fate was after the tournament was over.Anstruther, Ian (1986).

The 'new' Tournament Bridge served as a well used route across the Lugton Water, running through the Deer Park to Eglinton kennels (previously known as Laigh Moncur), especially on days when the Eglinton Hunt met at the castle itself. It was built by Messrs Connell of Dalgarven, using parts of the original bridge and possibly to a design by David Hamilton.Ness, J. A. (1968). Eglinton Tournament 1839. Privately produced. p. 15. Messrs. Connell also built the new Kilwinning Tower to a design by David Hamilton. The 'old' Tournament Bridge converted artificially to two arches, etc. for comparison.

It was this bridge that was used at the Eglinton Tournament as can be seen from the illustrations of the event, however the name was passed on to the 'new' bridge constructed downstream of it.

Surviving architects drawings show the designs for a three arched bridge and as stated, contemporary prints of the Eglinton Tournament also show a three arched Tournament bridge, with cast iron arches, pinnacles and parapets which may have been re-used in the later 'new' bridge which survives today. David Hamilton is recorded on the 1811 engraving as being the architect.

Pub. Edinburgh & London : Mainstream. . p. 14. The first Ordnance Survey map of 1856 shows the two arched bridge in position, a weir at the position of the old bridge and by this time the old lake had gone, replaced by a canalised Lugton Water with several weirs. Ironically the strengthening work done on the 'new' bridge to create an extra arch of bricks in addition to the cast iron, may have weakened the structure, contributing to its eventual partial collapse. The army used the bridge extensively with large lorries and even tanks crossing over it. Numbering on the cast iron arch sections. The bridge circa 1905. The lower courses of ashlar- Ashlar on the bridge abutments and central pier were vermiculate.- Vermiculate stonework At some point the height of the weir beneath had been raised using an odd assortment of re-used stonework; this would have increased the depth and extent of the waters behind it. The central pier and the original weir had used reworked but re-cycled stone, probably from Kilwinning Abbey; as illustrated by a stone window surround recovered during restoration work (See illustration). Examination of the top of the outer towers shows that something was attached to the centres, the 'plug' hole still being present. It is possible that the holes are related to the method of lifting them into position during construction work. The larger towers are capped with cement and nothing is therefore visible. During restoration work (2008) electricity power cables or possibly gas pipes were located leading to the bridge and they may have served some form of lighting on the bridge. These are not visible in the available illustrations. The Eglinton estate had its own gasworks and later its own power station, so it would have been natural to provide lighting on the bridge. The old OS maps show that by 1897 the gas works had been established here to supply the castle and offices, whilst by 1911 this had been replaced by an electricity works; the present day park workshop. The larger and taller inner towers have been re-used from the older bridge, this being confirmed by the presence of ornate carving as infill within one of the larger towers. The curtain walls and the smaller and lower outer towers are made from a different type of stone and, as stated, the towers have a number of architectural differences, suggesting that they were made specifically for the 'new' Tournament Bridge (See photographs). During work on the central pier it was found that some of the hidden infill work is vermiculate ashlar from the 'old' bridge. The cast iron sections of the arches are numbered and some of the sequence are absent, suggesting that these missing sections may have been damaged previously beyond repair and were not used therefore in the 'new' bridge. =Previous Eglinton bridges that crossed the Lugton Water= File:Eglinton Castle Bridge in 1811.jpgEglinton Castle bridge in 1811 File:Eglinton Castle and grouinds circa 1811.jpgA view of the castle and a wooden footbridge in 1815.

The old bridge partly collapsed in early 1936, the cast iron fascias and central pinnacles falling outwards. To save the bridge from total collapse the 103rd (Glasgow) Company Royal Engineers, who were encamped on the Irvine Moor,Eglinton Archive, Eglinton Country Park removed the cast iron outer fascia coverings and the pinnacles, encasing the remaining cast iron arches in concrete as can be seen from contemporary photographs and as further revealed during restoration work. It is not known what happened to the pinnacles and cast iron coverings. It had been thought that they were safely in storage, however enquiries have led to nothing. The soldiers in 1936 were at their annual camp and the repair section were commanded by Lieut R. J. P. Cowan and Sergeant David Borland. = Repair work = File:Tournament bridge one.jpgA view across the damaged bridge.

John Ainslie's 1790 map showing pleasure garden on the opposite side of the Lugton Water to the castle in what became part of the deer park. Originally the river would have been crossed by simple fords, however by the 18th century ornamental pleasure gardens had been formed and these were partly situated in what later became the deer park. No signs of these gardens are now visible, apart from Crop marks on aerial photographs taken around the end of the Second World War. A bridge was necessary to give access to the ornamental gardens and one is indicated on John Ainslie's map dated 1790, crossing the Lugton Water close to the castle itself. A small wooden bridge across the Lugton Water is shown in an illustration from around 1815, however this may not have been across the Lugton Water. Thomson's map of 1828 (See illustration) indicates a bridge crossing the Lugton Water at the castle where the three arched bridge was and a drive starting off at the position of the present day bridge, which may have been a ford at the time. Another bridge is suggested further upstream and close to the castle.Thomson, John (1828). A Map of the Northern Part of Ayrshire. A wooden 'Laundry Bridge' stood close to the castle and downstream from it was second wooden bridge which was washed away in a storm in 1938. Local children used it to build rafts.

The restored Stables Bridge, also called Lady Jane's Bridge, lies on the Kilwinning Lodge drive and just downstream from it stood an elegant cast- iron bridge with a 50-foot span. This cast-iron bridge had high-quality stonework on both of the abutments, much of which survives. This bridge gave access to the kitchen walled gardens and glasshouse ranges and lasted into the mid-1940s when the army removed it. The suspension bridge built by the army in the 1980s on behalf of the country park lies just below the weir beside the ruined gazebo. Lady Jane's Cottage had a wooded pedestrian footbridge which is shown in several postcards of the time; however, no clear sign remains apart from elements of the abutment on one bank. The restored Diamond Bridge lies upstream near the Eglinton Loch and continues to give access to the old Toll Road from Irvine to Kilwinning via Fergushill. This bridge was named after the nearby Black Diamond mine, the spoil heap or bing of which still remains rear the Chapelholm Gate. The colliery name in turn was associated with one of the 13th Earl's favourite horses, Black Diamond.

The concrete arches were replaced with the existing refurbished cast iron arch sections and new cast iron fascia sections, which have restored the original width of the structure. The load-bearing capacity of the bridge is carried by a modern steel structure concealed beneath the wooden deck surface, as this was considered to be the original material, possibly coated with a layer of whin dust or such-like. The timber parapets have been replaced with cast iron sections to match the original items. All of the cast iron elements have been fabricated and fitted by the Ballantine Bo'ness Iron Company to restore the splendour of the original structure.The Irvine Herald, Friday 25 April 2008. P. 10. The restoration involved hydrodemolition to expose the cast iron arches through removing the concrete in which they had been embedded. This process used very high pressure water jets and confirmed the poor structural integrity of the iron arches. They were not however intended to be load bearing in the restored bridge and an upside was the degree of Gothic artwork found to exist on the arches. The estimated total project cost was ¬£720k. Historic Scotland have indicated that they would be able to contribute some ¬£161k, around ¬£5k will be provided in kind, and the shortfall of ¬£354k was the subject of the successful grant application to the Heritage Lottery Fund.

The river enters the Coral Sea north of Cape Tribulation. The river estuary is in near pristine conditions. In 2014 the Australian and Queensland governments completed a 21 million bridge across the river, called the Bobby and Jacky Ball Bloomfield River Bridge. The bridge was named after two respected elders, brother Bobby and Jacky Ball. The land where the bridge was constructed and south to Degarra is their traditional country. The Ball brothers are the eldest remaining sons of their family. During the construction of the bridge, they would visit the site daily. They walk from the Wujal Wujal Shire to Degarra each day to visit a river fishing spot. Etymology The river was originally named Blomfield's Rivulet by Phillip Parker King on 26 June 1818.

Florida, 385 U.S. 39 (1966), was a United States Supreme Court case regarding whether arrests for protesting in front of a jail were constitutional. Background information In 1966, a group of students from Florida A&M; University demonstrated against racial segregation, and were subsequently arrested. The day after, around 200 FAMU students gathered in front of the Leon County jail to protest their arrest. Petitioners, 32 students, were members of a group of about 200 who on a nonpublic jail driveway, which they blocked, and on adjacent county jail premises had, by singing, clapping, and dancing, demonstrated against their schoolmates' arrest and perhaps against segregation in the jail and elsewhere. The sheriff, the jail's custodian, advised them that they were trespassing on county property and would have to leave or be arrested. The 107 demonstrators refusing to depart were thereafter arrested and convicted under a Florida trespass statute for \\"trespass with a malicious and mischievous intent.\\" Petitioners contend that their convictions, affirmed by the Florida Circuit Court and the District Court of Appeal, deprived them of their \\"rights of free speech, assembly, petition, due process of law and equal protection of the laws\\" under the Fourteenth Amendment. Decision The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the trespassing conviction in a 5‚Äì4 decision. The majority opinion, authored by Justice Black, argued that county jails were not public places and so it did not infringe on their right to assembly. The decision argued that states may protect their property and withhold its use from demonstrators for nondiscriminatory reasons such as protection from damage.Adderley v. Florida Oyez Project =Dissenting opinion= Justice Douglas authored a dissenting opinion in which Chief Justice Warren and Justices Brennan and Fortas concurred. Douglas argued that the protesters did not engage in or threaten violence or block the entrance of the jail.

Gilligan, who predominately played as a catcher, also played as an outfielder and a shortstop. Over his career, Gilligan compiled a career batting average of .207 with 217 runs scored, 388 hits, 68 doubles, 23 triples, three home runs, and 167 runs batted in (RBI) in 523 games played. Although the majority of his career was spent in the major leagues, Gilligan also played in minor league baseball. He was listed as standing and weighing . Early life Andrew Bernard Gilligan was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts on January 3, 1856. He was the sixth child of seven born to Patrick Gilligan, a laborer, and Sarah Gilligan. Both Patrick and Sarah had immigrated to the United States from Northern Ireland. Professional career Gilligan began his professional career playing right field in 1874 for the New York Flyaways, an amateur baseball club. He continued his professional baseball career in 1876 and 1877. In 1878, Gilligan played for various minor-league clubs such as the Somerville Unions of Somerville, Massachusetts, and the Charlestown Alerts of Charlestown, Massachusetts. In his first full MLB season, Gilligan played for the Cleveland Blues. After his first game with the Blues, the Cleveland Leader stated \\"Gilligan caught exceedingly well taking some fine pickups.\\" Over 52 games played, Gilligan batted a career-low .171 with 11 RBI and six doubles. Defensively, he played 27 games as catcher and 23 as an outfielder. Next season, Gilligan continued to play for the Blues, serving as backup catcher to Doc Kennedy before leaving the team at the end of the season to sign with the Providence Grays. With the Grays, he served again as a backup catcher before the starter (Emil Gross) became injured; on the season, Gilligan batted .219 with 20 RBI. Next year, in 1882, Gilligan became the starting catcher for the Grays; his backup, Sandy Nava, was the first Mexican-American baseball player. When the season was over, the Grays finished 52‚Äì32, second in the National League (NL), under manager Harry Wright. By 1883, Gilligan had become the Grays starting catcher. Despite breaking his finger and missing two weeks in May, Gilligan led the National League in assists as a catcher, while his team finished third in the NL. He continued his tenure with the Grays the following season. Gilligan played in a career-high 82 games, while also recording career highs in RBI (38), strikeouts (41), and on-base percentage (.325) and leading MLB in defensive games as a catcher (81). After finishing at the top of the NL, the Grays played in the 1884 World Series against the New York Metropolitans of the American Association. Gilligan went 4‚Äìfor‚Äì9 over the three-game series, with the Grays defeating the Metropolitans three games to none. After spending the 1885 season with the Grays, and tying Andy Cusick for the MLB lead in errors committed as a catcher, the Grays management sold out in November of that year. The NL bought the Grays for $6,000, while Gilligan was assigned to the Washington Nationals. He served as captain of the team for the 1886 season, catching 71 games and batting .190. Before the 1887 season, he established a restaurant in the District of Columbia. In 1887, Gilligan was fined $25 for binge drinking and missing a game for the Nationals. The next season, Gilligan was released by the team. In his final MLB season, Gilligan signed with the Detroit Wolverines. He played in one game for the team, going 1‚Äìfor‚Äì5 with a run and a strikeout. Later that year, Gilligan signed with the Lynn Shoemakers, appearing in 11 games before joining the Manchester Maroons for three games. For the next three years, Gilligan continued to play minor league baseball. In 1889, he played for the Hyannis town team in what is now the Cape Cod Baseball League. His career MLB batting average (.207) is tied with John Henry for the seventh lowest all-time among batters with at least 1,000 at bats. After baseball After retiring from baseball, Gilligan lived in Lynn, Massachusetts, with his wife, Sara. He worked as a garbage collector before dying of erysipelas on April 1, 1934.

In September 2019 the school celebrated its 80th anniversary. History The school claims no connection with the Masonic order of Knights Templar or with The Da Vinci Code - rather, it is named after the chivalrous medieval order of the Knights Templar, who founded Baldock and built the original 12th-century parish church of St. Mary the VirginHertfordshire Genealogy: Baldock in the town. The motto of the Knights Templar School is \\"Courage and Courtesy\\". Boys carry out a science experiment at Baldock County Council School in 1944 The school opened the day after the start of the Second World War in 1939 as the Baldock County Council School and within a week of opening had welcomed evacuee children from Stratford in London; in 1944 a photographer from the Ministry of Information took a series of pictures of students at the school to show the positive way that a typical country school was adjusting to life during wartime. These images showed students having medical examinations, taking part in sports and domestic science lessons, cooking over open fires and cultivating the school's playing field to grow food.'Country School: Everday Life at Baldock County Council School (1944) - the Imperial War Museum Collection Children having lunch at Baldock County Council School in 1944 By 1949 the school was known as Baldock Secondary Modern School, at which time His Majesty's Inspector for Schools (HMI) found it to be flourishing under the 'dynamic personality' of the Headmaster, Mr Frank Hancock MBE, who had created a 'very happy and active school' with overseas trips, school camps, Sports Days and strong links with the local community. However, the inspectors found the syllabuses to be too ambitious with the school moving forward too quickly, with teaching staff confused by arrangements which were complicated and difficult to manage.Parker, David John Newsom - A Hertfordshire Educationist University of Hertfordshire Press (2005) pg 130 Google BooksPRO ED109/8828 HM Inspectors' report on Baldock County Secondary Modern School; Inspected 16-18/11/49 Finally, the school was renamed The Knights Templar School by Vivian Crellin, the then headmaster of the school and a scholar of Baldock's medieval history.Vivian Crellin, Baldock's Middle Ages Since that time the school has been greatly extended with several new buildings and ever increasing pupil numbers, leading to oversubscription every year. As of September 2013 there are 1350 pupils, with 103 teachers and 60 support staff. In September 2013 the school opened a new purpose-built Sixth Form block with specialist classrooms, tutor meeting rooms and computer suites, and a new Science Centre was opened in 2016 by Lord Robert Winston. As a former specialist school in sport the Knights Templar School also has a million-pound sports centre with fitness suite and a floodlit all-weather sports pitch. In July 2017, the school press team writing KTS NewsKnight attended the prestigious national journalism competition, Shine School Media Awards and won several prizes. Houses The school Houses are Crellin, Hancock, Hine, Pembroke, Bennett, Knights and Templar, named after former Headmasters of the school (Hancock and Crellin); local educationists (George N. Bennett, who taught at the Pond Lane (Council) School in Baldock for over 40 years) and Alderman Neville Hine who for many years was Chairman of Managers of Baldock County Council School and worked for the building of the Knights Templar School; 'Strongbow', the Earl of Pembroke (the school is built on land owned by the Earl in the medieval period), and the Knights Templar who built the parish church St. Mary the Virgin c.1125. Music at the school The school has a strong musical tradition, with about a third of all pupils taking extra tuition in an instrument or voice. The Big Band and Senior Chamber Choir perform locally and the school organises a music tour bi- annually, geared mainly towards these two groups (though anyone is welcome). Recent tour locations include Budapest in Hungary during July 2006 and Liguria in Italy in July 2008.

Byers, 402 U.S. 424 (1971), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States decided that providing personal information at the scene of an accident does not infringe on one's Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination..  Prior history  Jonathan Byers proceeded for writ of prohibition to restrain the Justice Court from proceeding further on a complaint of violation of California's \\"hit and run statute.\\". The Superior court granted the writ and the People appealed. The Supreme Court of California held that the state's \\"hit and run statute\\" was valid, but prosecution was precluded from using information disclosed as a result of compliance, or the fruits of such information. Compliance confronted Byers with \\"substantial hazards of self-incrimination\\" in violation of his Fifth Amendment privilege. California appealed to the US Supreme Court, which granted certiorari. Plurality opinion of the Court In a plurality opinion of four, Chief Justice Burger concluded that \\"hit and run\\" statutes were not criminal, but regulatory in nature. Such statutes put the burden of compliance on the public at large rather than on a group of suspected criminals, and the possibility of self-incrimination was not substantial. Therefore, there was no significant infringement on Byers' privilege against self-incrimination. Relying on United States v. Sullivan, 274 U.S. 259 (1927), the Chief Justice wrote that even with the possibility that compliance under the statute were an incrimination per se, an extension of Fifth Amendment protection would be an \\"extreme if not extravagant application.\\" The Chief Justice analogized that just as there is no constitutional right to refuse to file a tax return, there is no constitutional right to flee the scene of an accident. =Concurring opinion by Justice Harlan= Justice Harlan concurred in the result. He wrote that the purpose of the \\"hit and run\\" statute was non-criminal and the fear of self-incrimination was not enough to create actual self-incrimination in violation of the privilege. He noted that the state received very little information from the requirement and still endured a burden of proof at trial for all elements of the criminal offense. The risk of self-incrimination was not the same as actual incrimination. Justice Harlan noted that there were a line of cases that restricted the use of compulsory, self-reporting information for prosecutorial purposes, but they should be limited and not overruled. = Black dissent = Justice Black's dissent noted that the compulsory information from the \\"hit and run\\" statute was used to satisfy a material element of the offense. The requirement applied to those \\"involved in an accident resulting in damage,\\" satisfying the material elements of the crime of property damage. Although the statute applied to a broad class of all California drivers, as applied in this particular case it violated Byers Fifth Amendment privilege. Justice Black found Byers self-report to be testimonial in nature. = Brennan dissent = Justice Brennan concluded that it was the position of the court to make the Bill of Rights \\"relevant to contemporary conditions\\" (as opposed to traditional or historical interpretations of the Bill of Rights). He criticized the plurality for making broad determinations on the tension between state law and constitutional protections writing, \\"only rivers of confusion can flow from lakes of generalities.\\" Justice Brennan found that the record in the instant case resulted in a conviction from self- incrimination and that it was unnecessary to address any broader issues. He concluded that an individual could only be compelled to comply with the statute if given full immunity for prosecution. This differed substantially from the California Supreme Court ruling that would merely make such information inadmissible.

Parker, the 33rd in his acclaimed Spenser series. Synopsis Following a high school shooting in which seven people were killed by two masked students, one of the perpetrators, Wendell Grant, gives himself up, and police believe that shady peer Jared Clarke was his accomplice. However, his grandmother Lily Ellsworth, the grand dame of Dowling, Massachusetts, believes otherwise and hires P.I Spenser to prove the young man's innocence. As he investigates, the detective finds himself drawn into an increasingly tangled web of deception, blackmail and insanity, which isn't at all helped by Jared's curious apathy regarding his fate. Plot summary Months after a school shooting at an elitist prep school in small-town Massachusetts leaves fifteen students and faculty dead, Spenser is hired by the grandmother of one of the alleged killers, a rich old lady who firmly believes in her grandson's innocence: she is convinced that he is not the one of the two shooters who never lifted his ski mask in front of their victims and who somehow managed to disappear in the crowd without being identified. Both suspects are now in custody but unwilling to talk to anyone. Wherever Spenser turns, people are reluctant to co-operate with him, if not outright hostile. The local police chief considers the case closed as both perpetrators are under arrest, awaiting trial and have already confessed to the crime. The head of the school is concerned with the school's reputation, bans Spenser from the school premises, and prohibits students to talk to him should he accost them anywhere in town. Even the boys' parents and their respective lawyers do not wish to throw any more light on the matter. For Spenser, however, three decisive questions have not been answered yet: where the two youngsters got the weapons from and how they were able to pay for them; where and from whom they learned to shoot; and why they planned and carried out the massacre in the first place. The pupils Spenser meets at one of their hangouts, however, are thrilled to disobey their head teacher and collaborate with a private eye. This is how Spenser learns where the less fortunate youngsters in town who attend the local public school usually meet, that a young man of mixed ethnicity supplies them with drugs, and that he might also have sold weapons to the shooters. Spenser is soon able to answer his first two questions, but for the time being he sees no way to find a good reason why two 17-year-olds with no criminal record should go ahead and cause a bloodbath. Gradually, however, he realizes that the motive is more to do with parents and teachers than anyone is prepared to admit. In School Days, Spenser's close friend Hawk does not appear but is mentioned. Susan Silverman is away at a conference and only returns at the end of the novel to celebrate the successful conclusion of the case. Pearl, however, having been left behind by her mistress, is constantly present. Literary and other allusions Spenser calls himself a \\"poetic devil,\\" but he does not always quote correctly or verbatim. In School Days, references to various works of literature and popular culture are made. This is an incomplete list of quotations: * John Keats, from \\"Ode on a Grecian Urn\\" (\\"Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard / Are sweeter\\") * Richard Lovelace, from \\"To Lucasta, Going to the Wars\\" (\\"I could not love thee, dear, so much, / Lov'd I not Honour more\\") * Wallace Stevens, from \\"The Emperor of Ice-Cream\\" (\\"Let be be finale of seem\\") * Alfred, Lord Tennyson, from \\"Sir Galahad\\" (\\"My strength is as the strength of ten, / Because my heart is pure\\") * the Rin Tin Tin stories * General Douglas MacArthur's \\"I shall return\\" * Sigmund Freud's seminal book, Civilization and Its Discontents.

Dambal is about southeast of Gadag city and southwest of Ittagi in Koppal district.Cousens (1926), p. 114 The sanctum contains a Shiva linga, the symbol of the presiding deity, God Shiva. The temple interior is a standard construction and consists of a sanctum (cella), a vestibule (antarala) and a main mantapa (also called navaranga or hall). The vestibule connects the sanctum to the mantapa. The Western Chalukya monuments, regional variants of existing dravida (South Indian) temples, defined the Karnata dravida architectural tradition.Hardy (1995), pp. 6-7 Temple plan vimana of Dodda Basappa Temple in Dambal, 12th century CE Reliefs on the walls of the temple at Dodda Basappa Dambal, 1897 Wall relief in projections and recesses: Kirtimukha, Pilasters and dravida style miniature towers (aedicule) Half pillar supports the roof of the porch =Stellate plan= The temple is based on a very original 24-pointed uninterrupted stellate (star-shaped) plan and uses soapstone as its basic building material. Contemporary stellate plans of the Bhumija shrines in central India where the inspiration for this temple came from, were all 32-pointed interrupted types. No temples of the 6-, 12-, or 24-pointed stellate plans are known to exist in Karnataka or Maharashtra, with the exception of the Doddabasappa temple, which can be described as a 24-pointed uninterrupted plan.Foekema (2003), p. 60 In an 'interrupted' stellate plan, the stellate outline is interrupted by orthogonal (right-angle) projections in the cardinal directions, resulting in star points that have been skipped.Foekema (2003), p. 63 Nandi (vehicle of Shiva-bull) facing shrine through the eastern doorway The Doddabasappa temple marks the mature development of the Chalukyan art which originated from basic dravida architecture of South India. Its departure from conventional dravida plan used in the Virupaksha temple in Pattadakal is so extreme that it would be very difficult to find similarities without detailed examination. A star shape is obtained by rotating a square about its centre. The star points form equidistant projections. The angles and re-entrant angles thus formed make the perimeter of the outerwall of the shrine. The star projections are carried right up the superstructure (tower over the shrine -- Shikhara), giving it an exotic look, though it loses strength in comparison to the square superstructures found in conventional dravida plans. The storied arrangement of the superstructure found in dravida plans is not easily distinguishable here.Cousens (1926), p. 115 The upper tiers of the seven-tiered (tala) superstructure look like cogged wheels with 48 dents.Foekema (2003), p. 61 =Other details= The pillars in this temple are finely chiseled and \\"complicated\\" but lack the elegance of those at the Kasivisvesvara Temple in Lakkundi. The entrance to the shrine has above it a decorative architrave with space for images (now missing) of the Hindu Gods Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. Depending on the dedication of the temple, either Vishnu or Shiva would take the central position in this arrangement. The entrance to the sanctum is elaborately decorated on either side with designs that are floral containing tiny images of dancers, musicians and even a mithuna couple (Gemini). In the main mantapa (hall) there are three images, one of the \\"five headed\\" Brahma and his vehicle (vahana), the goose, and two images are of Surya, the Sun God. The temple has two doorways each with a porch, one facing south and the other facing east. The east facing door has on either side the remains of what must have been elegant lintel decoration, and an open hall type of pillared extension containing a large recumbent image of Nandi (bull) which faces the shrine.

It was first published by Coteau Books in 2006. It follows the story of Adeline Mueller who tries to adapt to her new life in Canada with her father, mother and younger brother. The story has been well received as reviewers claim that the book is satisfying and heart warming. Plot summary The narrative follows the story of twelve- year-old Adeline Mueller as she moves with her mom and five-year-old brother to Canada from their German home to move in with her father to start a new life. Adeline has not seen her father since she was eight and she is expecting a great and wonderful life in Canada from the description in the letters she has received from her father.Adeline's Dream Plot But Adeline's relationship with her father has been strained ever since he left her and the rest of the family to move to Saskatchewan.Donna Gamache's review of Adeline's Dream Her father worked in a bank in Germany and then, after being fired, decided to find a better life for the rest of the family in Saskatchewan. Finally Adeline's father had reported that he has started a splendid new life for the family. The book begins with Adeline, her mother, and her brother Konrad traveling by steamship and then by train from Germany to Saskatchewan. The family then arrives at Qu'Appelle. When Adeline arrives, the truth is revealed. Adeline's father now works on a farm bagging flour and doing the accounts which does not make enough money to provide a home. So the family lives in a soddle made of grass and earth. All her life Adeline had dreamed that one day she would be a singer but she feels that because her father has brought her into these horrible conditions, that her dream will be ruined making their relationship even more strained. Adeline soon learns that the richer townspeople do not take kindly to the immigrants that move to the area. But through all the prejudice, Adeline makes two friends, Kat and Henery, who are also immigrants. Kat helped Adeline fight off prejudiced bullies at their school. One day the farm where her father was employed is burned down and her father is forced to get a new job. Kat's family moves and Adeline is left to fight the bullies, especially a girl named Sarah: a girl who sings just like Adeline and takes her solo in the Christmas play. By the time of the play, Adeline has begun to get along with her father and Sarah allows Adeline to have the solo at the play and Adeline's dreams start to come true.  Reception  In Prairie Fire, Donna Gamache writes: \\"Young readers will empathize with Adeline's resentment and struggles to accept her new home and in turn to be accepted.

Rarefaction allows the calculation of species richness for a given number of individual samples, based on the construction of so- called rarefaction curves. This curve is a plot of the number of species as a function of the number of samples. Rarefaction curves generally grow rapidly at first, as the most common species are found, but the curves plateau as only the rarest species remain to be sampled. The issue that occurs when sampling various species in a community is that the larger the number of individuals sampled, the more species that will be found. Rarefaction curves are created by randomly re-sampling the pool of N samples multiple times and then plotting the average number of species found in each sample (1,2, ... N). \\"Thus rarefaction generates the expected number of species in a small collection of n individuals (or n samples) drawn at random from the large pool of N samples.\\". A set of rarefaction curves from a NASA biology study History The technique of rarefaction was developed in 1968 by Howard Sanders in a biodiversity assay of marine benthic ecosystems, as he sought a model for diversity that would allow him to compare species richness data among sets with different sample sizes; he developed rarefaction curves as a method to compare the shape of a curve rather than absolute numbers of species. Following initial development by Sanders, the technique of rarefaction has undergone a number of revisions. In a paper criticizing many methods of assaying biodiversity, Stuart Hurlbert refined the problem that he saw with Sanders' rarefaction method, that it overestimated the number of species based on sample size, and attempted to refine his methods. The issue of overestimation was also dealt with by Daniel Simberloff, while other improvements in rarefaction as a statistical technique were made by Ken Heck in 1975. Today, rarefaction has grown as a technique not just for measuring species diversity, but of understanding diversity at higher taxonomic levels as well. Most commonly, the number of species is sampled to predict the number of genera in a particular community; similar techniques had been used to determine this level of diversity in studies several years before Sanders quantified his individual to species determination of rarefaction. Rarefaction techniques are used to quantify species diversity of newly studied ecosystems, including human microbiomes, as well as in applied studies in community ecology, such as understanding pollution impacts on communities and other management applications. Derivation Deriving Rarefaction: N = total number of items K = total number of groups Ni = the number of items in group i (i = 1, ..., K). Mj = number of groups consisting in j elements From these definitions, it therefore follows that: \\\\sum_{i=1}^K N_i = N \\\\sum_{j=1}^{\\\\infin} M_j = K \\\\sum_{j=1}^{\\\\infin} jM_j = N In a rarefied sample we have chosen a random subsample n from the total N items. The relevance of a rarefied sample is that some groups may now be necessarily absent from this subsample. We therefore let: X_n = the number of groups still present in the subsample of \\"n\\" items It is true that X_n is less than K whenever at least one group is missing from this subsample. Therefore the rarefaction curve, f_n is defined as: f_n = E[X_n] = K - \\\\binom{N}{n}^{-1} \\\\sum_{i=1}^K {\\\\binom{N-N_i}{n}} From this it follows that 0 ‚â§ f(n) ‚â§ K. Furthermore, f(0)= 0, f(1) = 1, f(N) = K. Despite being defined at discrete values of n, these curves are most frequently displayed as continuous functions. Correct usage Rarefaction curves are necessary for estimating species richness. Raw species richness counts, which are used to create accumulation curves, can only be compared when the species richness has reached a clear asymptote. Rarefaction curves produce smoother lines that facilitate point-to-point or full dataset comparisons. One can plot the number of species as a function of either the number of individuals sampled or the number of samples taken. The sample-based approach accounts for patchiness in the data that results from natural levels of sample heterogeneity. However, when sample-based rarefaction curves are used to compare taxon richness at comparable levels of sampling effort, the number of taxa should be plotted as a function of the accumulated number of individuals, not accumulated number of samples, because datasets may differ systematically in the mean number of individuals per sample. One cannot simply divide the number of species found by the number of individuals sampled in order to correct for different sample sizes. Doing so would assume that the number of species increases linearly with the number of individuals present, which is not always true. Rarefaction analysis assumes that the individuals in an environment are randomly distributed, the sample size is sufficiently large, that the samples are taxonomically similar, and that all of the samples have been performed in the same manner. If these assumptions are not met, the resulting curves will be greatly skewed.Newton, Adrian C. Forest Ecology and Preservation: A Handbook of Techniques. Illustrated Edition. Oxford, 1999. 128-131. Cautions and criticism Rarefaction only works well when no taxon is extremely rare or common[reference needed], or when beta diversity is very high. Rarefaction assumes that the number of occurrences of a species reflects the sampling intensity, but if one taxon is especially common or rare, the number of occurrences will be related to the extremity of the number of individuals of that species, not to the intensity of sampling. The technique does not account for specific taxa. It examines the number of species present in a given sample, but does not look at which species are represented across samples. Thus, two samples that each contain 20 species may have completely different compositions, leading to a skewed estimate of species richness. The technique does not recognize species abundance, only species richness. A true measure of diversity accounts for both the number of species present and the relative abundance of each. Rarefaction is unrealistic in its assumption of random spatial distribution of individuals. Rarefaction does not provide an estimate of asymptotic richness, so it cannot be used to extrapolate species richness trends in larger samples.

Only a handful of direct hints still survive and many possible indications are only vague and offer plenty of room for speculation.  Depictions of possible homosexuality  Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep kissing. =Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep= The best known case of possible homosexuality in ancient Egypt is that of the two high officials Nyankh-Khnum and Khnum-hotep. Both men lived and served under pharaoh Niuserre during the 5th Dynasty (c. 2494-2345 BC).Richard Parkinson: Homosexual Desire and Middle Kingdom Literature. In: The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology (JEA), vol. 81, 1995, pp. 57‚Äì76. Nyankh- Khnum and Khnum-hotep each had families of their own with children and wives, but when they died their families apparently decided to bury them together in one and the same mastaba tomb. In this mastaba, several paintings depict both men embracing each other and touching their faces nose-on-nose. These depictions leave plenty of room for speculation, because in ancient Egypt the nose-on-nose touching normally represented a kiss. Egyptologists and historians disagree about how to interpret the paintings of Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep. Some scholars believe that the paintings reflect an example of homosexuality between two married men and prove that the ancient Egyptians accepted same-sex relationships.Dena Connors-Millard: Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep - Evidence of Gay Relationships Exists as Early as 2400 B.C.? (English). Other scholars disagree and interpret the scenes as an evidence that Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep were twins, or even possibly conjoined twins. No matter what interpretation is correct, the paintings show at the very least that Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep must have been very close to each other in life as in death. =King Pepi II and his general officer Sasenet= A well known story, dating back to the Middle Kingdom, tells about an anonymous citizen, who comes to the audience hall of king Pepi II (here named by his birth name, Neferkar√™). The citizen wants to lament about an unnamed circumstance, but the king does not want to listen to the laments, so he orders his royal musicians to drown the stranger's speech with noise. Disappointed, the stranger leaves the palace. When this happens several times, he orders his friend, the high official Tjeti, to follow the king. The king in turn is frequently leaving the palace during the night. Tjeti finds out that king Pepi II keeps visiting his loyal general officer Sasenet for several hours, then returning home.Emma Brunner-Traut: Alt√§gyptische M√§rchen. Mythen und andere volkst√ºmliche Erz√§hlungen. 10th Edition. Diederichs, Munich 1991, , pp. 178‚Äì179. The chapter in which king Pepi II visits his loyal general officer is subject of passionate discussions. Especially one certain phrase stays in the centre of investigations: the text says, that \\"his majesty went into Sasenet's house and did to him what his majesty desired\\". The phrase \\"doing what one desires\\" is a common flowery phrase to describe sex.G√ºnter Burkard, Heinz J. Thissen: Einf√ºhrung in die alt√§gyptische Literaturgeschichte vol. 1 (= Einf√ºhrungen und Quellentexte zur √Ñgyptologie,vol. 1). LIT, Berlin 2003, , pp. 187‚Äì191. For this reason, some scholars are convinced, that the papyrus reveals king Pepi's homosexual interests and his same-sex relationship to his general officer. But other scholars are instead convinced, that the passage is merely an allegoric pun to religious texts, in which the sun god R√¢ visits the underworld god Osiris during the middle four hours of the night. Thus, king Pepi II would be taking the role of R√¢ and Sasenet would take the role of Osiris. The phrase \\"doing what one desires\\" would therefore be overrated and misinterpreted. A Ramesside period ostracon, depicting a homosexual couple in coitus (two men having sex together) =Horus and Seth= A further famous story about same-sex intercourse can be found in the Kahun Papyri, dating back to the Middle Kingdom. It contains the nearly completely preserved story of the Osiris myth and the legendary fight for the throne of Egypt between Horus and Seth. The chapter in question reports that Seth was unutterably jealous about his young nephew Horus, because Horus was very young and popular. He was quite pampered by the other gods. Seth instead had very few companions and he was comparatively unpopular because of his choleric and vindictive behaviour. As a result, Seth tried to either chase away or even kill Horus, no matter what the cost. When Seth constantly fails, he plans to humiliate his rival so badly that Horus would be banned from Egypt forever. Seth invites Horus to a party and convinces the teenage Horus to drink more than Horus could normally cope with. When Horus is drunk, Seth seduces him to sleep over the night in one bed together. When lying together in one bed, Seth grabs Horus and rapes him. But Horus has tricked Seth; his drunkenness was staged. He catches Seth's semen with his hands and hides it. The next morning, Horus runs to his Mother, Isis, to tell her what happened. Isis is at first speechless with rage and disbelief, then she tells Horus to masturbate and use his semen to lubricate Seth's favorite food (Egyptian lettuce). Oblivious, Seth eats the manipulated lettuce, then he goes to the divine court to inform on Horus. At first, the divine judges swear at Horus, but when Thoth, the scribe of the court, calls for Seth's semen to emerge from the body of Horus, instead the semen of Horus emerges from the body of Seth. Seth blushes in embarrassment and shock, then flees. Horus is acquitted. The famous rape of Horus by his jealous uncle is also a subject of passionate discussion. While most scholars agree that the papyrus clearly describes rape, it must remain open, if it actually describes a homosexually driven deed. Background of the dispute are Seth's motives: he does not love Horus; in contrast, he hates his nephew and the rape was clearly performed to humiliate Horus. The only common ground between the rape and homosexuality is that the act was of same-sex nature. But some scholars are not so sure and point out that Seth was often credited with alternative sexual interests.  Ancient Egyptian views  It remains unclear what exact view the ancient Egyptians fostered about homosexuality. Any documents or literature that contain stories involving sexual acts never name the nature of the sexual deeds but instead use flowery and euphemistic paraphrases. While the stories about Seth and his sexual behavior may reveal rather negative thoughts and views, the tomb inscription of Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep may instead suggest that homosexuality was likewise accepted. Ancient Egyptian documents never clearly say that same-sex relationships were seen as reprehensible or despicable. No ancient Egyptian document mentions that homosexual acts were punishable offenses. Thus, a direct evaluation remains problematic.  Talmudic literature  In Talmudic literature, the ancient Egyptians are known for their liberal sexual lifestyles and are often used as the prime example of sexual debauchery. Rashi describes an Egyptian practice for women to have multiple husbands. Maimonides refers to lesbianism as \\"the acts of Egypt\\". While polyandry and lesbianism are characteristics of the ancient Egyptians according to religious Jewish discourse, male-male homosexual relationships are usually attributed to Sodom, Gomorrah, and Amalek.Rebecca T.

LPR causes respiratory symptoms such as cough and wheezing and is often associated with head and neck complaints such as dysphonia, globus pharyngis, and dysphagia. LPR may play a role in other diseases, such as sinusitis, otitis media, and rhinitis, and can be a comorbidity of asthma. While LPR is commonly used interchangeably with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), it presents with a different pathophysiology. LPR reportedly affects approximately 10% of the U.S. population. However, LPR occurs in as many as 50% of individuals with voice disorders. Signs and symptoms Extraesophageal symptoms result from exposure of the upper aerodigestive tract to gastric contents. This causes a variety of symptoms, including hoarseness, postnasal drip, sore throat, difficulty swallowing, indigestion, wheezing, globus pharyngeus, and chronic throat-clearing. Some people with LPR have heartburn, while others have little to no heartburn as refluxed stomach contents do not remain in the esophagus long enough to irritate the surrounding tissue. Individuals with more severe forms of LPR may experience abrasion of tooth enamel due to intermittent presence of gastric contents in the oral cavity. Additionally, LPR can cause inflammation in the vocal tract which results in the symptom of dysphonia or hoarseness. Hoarseness is considered to be one of the primary symptoms of LPR and is associated with complaints such as strain, vocal fatigue, musculoskeletal tension, and hard glottal attacks, all of which can reduce a person's ability to communicate effectively. Moreover, LPR patients may try to compensate for their hoarseness by increasing muscular tension in their vocal tract. This hyper-functional technique adopted in response to the inflammation caused by LPR can lead to a condition called muscle tension dysphonia and may persist even after the hoarseness and inflammation has disappeared. A speech- language pathologist will often need to be involved to help resolve this maladaptive, compensatory pattern through the implementation of voice therapy. LPR presents as a chronic and intermittent disease in children. LPR in children and infants tends to manifest with a unique set of symptoms. Symptoms seen in children with LPR include a cough, hoarseness, stridor, sore throat, asthma, vomiting, globus sensation, wheezing, aspiration and recurrent pneumonia. Common symptoms of LPR in infants include wheezing, stridor, persistent or recurrent cough, apnea, feeding difficulties, aspiration, regurgitation, and failure to thrive. Moreover, LPR in children is commonly concomitant with laryngeal disorders such as laryngomalacia, subglottic stenosis, and laryngeal papillomatosis. =Relationship to GERD= Illustration of the superior view of the larynx. Tissues lining laryngeal structures, including the vocal folds, may be damaged in LPR. LPR is often regarded as a subtype of GERD that occurs when stomach contents flow upward through the esophagus and reach the level of the larynx and pharynx. However, LPR is associated with a distinct presentation of symptoms. LPR and GERD frequently differ in the relative prevalence of heartburn and throat clearing. While heartburn is present in over 80% of GERD cases, it occurs in only 20% of LPR cases. Throat clearing shows the opposite prevalence pattern, occurring in approximately 87% of LPR cases and in fewer than 5% of GERD cases. Unlike GERD, LPR also poses a risk for bronchitis or pneumonitis as reflux of stomach acid to the level of the larynx can result in aspiration. LPR is also commonly associated with erythema, or redness, as well as edema in the tissues of the larynx that are exposed to gastric contents. In contrast, most cases of GERD are nonerosive, with no apparent injury to the mucosal lining of the esophageal tissue exposed to the refluxed material. Differences in the molecular structure of the epithelial tissue lining the laryngopharyngeal region may be partly responsible for the different symptomatic manifestations of LPR in comparison to GERD. In contrast to the resistant stratified squamous epithelium lining the esophagus, the larynx is lined by ciliated respiratory epithelium, which is more fragile and susceptible to damage. While the epithelium lining the esophagus is capable of withstanding as many as 50 instances of exposure to gastric contents each day, which is the uppermost estimate considered to be within the range of normal physiologic functioning, injury to laryngeal epithelium can occur following exposure to only small amounts of acidic gastric contents. Diagnosis LPR presents with non- specific symptoms and signs that make differential diagnosis difficult to achieve. Furthermore, symptoms of the disorder overlap greatly with symptoms of other disorders. Therefore, LPR is under-diagnosed and under-treated. As there are multiple potential etiologies for the respiratory and laryngeal symptoms of LPR, diagnosing LPR based on symptoms alone is unreliable. Laryngoscopic findings such as erythema, edema, laryngeal granulomas, and interarytenoid hypertrophy have been used to establish the diagnosis; however, these findings are nonspecific and have been described in the majority of asymptomatic subjects undergoing laryngoscopy. Response to acid-suppression therapy has been suggested as a diagnostic tool for confirming diagnosis of LPR, but studies have shown that the response to empirical trials of such therapy (as with proton-pump inhibitors) in these patients is often disappointing. Several studies have emphasized the importance of measuring proximal esophageal, or ideally pharyngeal acid exposure, in patients with clinical symptoms of LPR to document reflux as the cause of the symptoms. Additionally, several potential biomarkers of LPR have been investigated. These include inflammatory cytokines, carbonic anyhydrase, E-cadherin and mucins; however, their direct implications in LPR are still being established. The presence of pepsin, an enzyme produced in the stomach, in the hypopharynx has also become an increasingly researched biomarker for LPR. Research suggests that the stomach enzyme pepsin plays a crucial role in the complex mechanism behind LPR. Once present in the larynx pepsin is active at a low pH, but persists even when inactive. Pepsin can manifest both extracellularly and intracellularly; however, damage is realized differently in these two environments. Intracellularly, pepsin enters the laryngeal tissue through endocytosis and causes damage that accumulates over time. Pepsin has implications on cellular transcription and therefore, gene expression, which subsequently leads to the recruitment of inflammatory cells, but inhibition of protective mechanisms such as growth factors. Structurally, pepsin plays a role in increasing viscosity of the vibratory portion of the vocal folds and decreasing cellular water retention, which reduces the overall thickness of the vocal folds. These morphological changes result in decreased vibratory amplitude, increasing demands for initiating vibration and ultimately, impacting voice quality. Before a diagnosis can be made, a physician will need to record the patient's medical history and ask for details about the presenting symptoms. Questionnaires such as the Reflux Symptom Index (RSI), Quality-of-Life Index (QLI) for LPR, Glottal Closure/Function Index (GCI) and Voice Handicap Index (VHI) can be administered to gain information about the patient's medical history as well as their symptomatology. A physical examination will then need to be performed with particular concentration around the head and neck. A scope with a specialized camera lens made of fiber optic strands is gently fed down the throat and feeds back images to a monitor. This provides a clear view of the throat and larynx. Signs of LPR include redness, swelling, and obvious irritation. Other, more invasive tests, such as fibre-optic transnasal laryngoscopy, 24-hour ambulatory dual probe pHmetry, pharyngeal pHmetry, transnasal esophagoscopy (TNE) and biopsy may be used. A noninvasive test for diagnosis of LPR is the collection of refluxate where the refluxed material is collected and analyzed. Another noninvasive diagnostic test that can be used is an empirical trial of proton-pump inhibitor therapy; however, this test is mostly successful in diagnosing GERD. There is no agreed-upon assessment technique to identify LPR in children. Of the debated diagnostic tools, multichannel intraluminal impedance with pH monitoring (MII-pH) is used as it recognizes both acid and non-acid reflux. A more common technique that is used is 24-hour dual probe pH monitoring. Both of these tools are expensive and are therefore not widely used. Treatment Management of symptoms for patients within this subgroup of the GERD spectrum is difficult. Once these patients are identified, behavioural and dietary changes are advised. Dietary modifications may include limiting the intake of chocolate, caffeine, acidic food and liquids, gaseous beverages and foods high in fat. Behavioral changes may include weight loss, cessation of smoking, limiting alcohol consumption and avoiding the ingestion of food shortly before bed. Lifestyle changes in children diagnosed with LPR include dietary modifications to avoid foods that will aggravate reflux (e.g., chocolate or acidic and spicy food), altering positioning (e.g., sleeping on your side), modifying the textures of foods (e.g., thickening feeds to heighten awareness of the passing bolus), and eliminating the intake of food before bed. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the leading pharmaceutical intervention chosen for the relief and reduction of LPR and are typically recommended for ongoing use twice a day for a period of 3‚Äì6 months. PPIs have been shown to be ineffective in very young children and are of uncertain efficacy in older children, for whom their use has been discouraged. While PPIs may provide limited clinical benefits in some adults, there is insufficient evidence to support routine use. Many studies show that PPIs are not more effective than placebos in treating LPR. When medical management fails, Nissen fundoplication can be offered. However, patients should be advised that surgery may not result in complete elimination of LPR symptoms and even with immediate success, recurrence of symptoms later on is still possible. One way to assess treatment outcomes for LPR is through the use of voice quality measures. Both subjective and objective measures of voice quality can be used to assess treatment outcomes. Subjective measures include scales such as the Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, Strain Scale (GRBAS); the Reflux Symptom Index; the Voice Handicap Index (VHI); and a voice symptom scale. Objective measures often rely on acoustic parameters such as jitter, shimmer, signal-to-noise ratio, and fundamental frequency, among others. Aerodynamic measures such as vital capacity and maximum phonation time (MPT) have also been used as an objective measure. However, there is not yet a consensus on how best to use the measures or which measures are best to assess treatment outcomes for LPR. History LPR was not discussed as a separate condition from GERD until the 1970s and 1980s. However, at around the same time that GERD was first recognized as a clinical entity in the mid-1930s, a link between gut symptoms and airway disease was suggested. Later, acid-related laryngeal ulcerations and granulomas were reported in 1968. Subsequent studies suggested that acid reflux might be a contributory factor in other laryngeal and respiratory conditions. In 1979, the link between these airway symptoms and reflux of gastric contents was first documented. At the same time, treatment of reflux disease results was shown to eliminate these airway symptoms.

Technical characteristics Plut√≥n was built in the United Kingdom. Her keel was laid by Thomson on 12 February 1897; the company changed its name to Clydebank Engineering & Shipbuilding Co. in April 1897 and completed her under this name on 4 November 1897. She had three funnels. In the parlance of the day, she was a \\"torpedo boat destroyer\\", designed to protect larger ships against torpedo boat attack, but also carrying torpedoes with which to attack larger ships herself. Operational history An unidentified Spanish destroyer‚Äîeither Plut√≥n, , or ‚Äîwith Cervera's squadron at S√£o Vicente sometime between 14 April 1898 and 29 April 1898. As tensions between Spain and the United States grew in early 1898, Plut√≥n was part of the Spanish Navy's 1st Squadron, commanded by Vice Admiral Pascual Cervera y Topete. The squadron was ordered to concentrate at S√£o Vicente in Portugal's Cape Verde Islands. Accordingly, Plut√≥n, in company with Cervera's flagship, the armored cruiser , armored cruiser , and destroyers and , departed Cadiz on 8 April 1898 and arrived at S√£o Vicente on 14 April 1898. The ships had experienced mechanical problems and burned an excessive amount of coal during the voyage. Soon, the squadron was reinforced by two more armored cruisers, and . The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War began while Plut√≥n was at S√£o Vicente. Ordered by neutral Portugal in accordance with international law to leave S√£o Vicente within 24 hours of the declaration of war, Plut√≥n and the rest of Cervera's squadron departed on 29 April 1898, bound for San Juan, Puerto Rico. Because of continuing engine trouble and low coal supplies, Plut√≥n and her fellow destroyers were towed part of the way. Cervera's ships reached French-owned Martinique in the Lesser Antilles on 10 May 1898. While Plut√≥n and the armored cruisers loitered in international waters, Furor and Terror went into Fort-de-France to ask for coal. France was neutral and would not supply coal, so the Spanish squadron‚Äîminus Terror, which stayed behind at Fort-de-France with engine trouble‚Äîdeparted on 12 May 1898 for Dutch-owned Cura√ßao, where Cervera expected to meet a collier. Cervera arrived at Willemstad on 14 May, but the Netherlands also was neutral, and strictly enforced its neutrality by allowing only Vizcaya and Infanta Maria Teresa to enter port and permitting them to load only 600 tons of coal. On 15 May, Cervera's ships departed, no longer bound for San Juan, which by now was under a U.S. Navy blockade, but for as-yet unblockaded Santiago de Cuba on the southeastern coast of Cuba, arriving there on 19 May 1898. Cervera hoped to refit his ships there before he could be trapped. His squadron was still in the harbor of Santiago de Cuba when an American squadron arrived on 27 May 1898 and began a blockade which would drag on for 37 days. Some action occurred during the blockade. On 3 June 1898, the U.S. Navy steamed the collier into the entrance channel to the harbor, hoping to scuttle her so as to block the channel and trap the Spanish ships inside. Spanish shore batteries already had disabled Merrimac when she drifted up the channel to a point where the Spanish ships could fire on her as well. Plut√≥n, Vizacaya, and unprotected cruiser all opened fire, and Merrimac quickly sank in a position that did not block the entrance. Apparently a torpedo from Plut√≥n gave the coup de gr√¢ce to Merrimac.Goode, W. A. M. (2008). With Sampson Through the War. BiblioBazaar, LLC, p. 151. The blockade wore on, with Plut√≥n and the others enduring occasional American naval bombardments of the harbor. Some of her men joined others from the fleet in a Naval Brigade to fight against a U.S. Army overland drive toward Santiago de Cuba. By the beginning of July 1898, that drive threatened to capture Santiago de Cuba, and Cervera decided that his squadron's only hope was to try to escape into the open sea by running the blockade. The decision was made on 1 July 1898, with the break-out set for 3 July 1898. The crew of Plut√≥n spent 2 July 1898 returning from Naval Brigade service and preparing for action. Plut√≥n was to be the sixth and last ship in line during the escape, following the four armored cruisers and Furor; while Infanta Mar√≠a Teresa sacrificed herself by attacking the fastest American ship, the armored cruiser , Plut√≥n and the others were to avoid action, put on all the speed they could, and run for the open sea. At about 0845 hours on 3 July 1898, the Spanish ships got underway. The U.S. squadron sighted the Spanish ships in the channel at about 0935, and the Battle of Santiago de Cuba began. While the four armored cruisers turned to starboard to run westward, Plut√≥n and Furor turned inside them and made their run closer to the coast. The blockading American battleships and armored cruisers opened fire on the two destroyers as they emerged from the channel, hitting both destroyers several times, but then turned their attention to pursuing the Spanish cruisers. The two damaged destroyers put on speed, pursued only by the armed yacht , a ship less well armed than the destroyers, but larger, faster, and undamaged. Gloucester hit both destroyers repeatedly. Too badly damaged to continue, Plut√≥n ran herself aground at 1045 on the beach just west of Cabanas Bay, a total loss. Those of her crew who got ashore had to beware of Cuban insurgents, who began shooting Spanish sailors they found along the shore. Other survivors were taken off by U.S. sailors who brought small boats alongside her wreck. Notes References * Chesneau, Roger, and Eugene M. Kolesnik, Eds.

Casting Harrison debuted in the role in January 1989, and departed in July 2006, when her character was killed off after being accidentally run over by Taylor Hayes, but made additional appearances in July 2007 as a ghost. On January 29, 2014, Michael Logan from TV Guide reported that Harrison had reprised her role and would be returning to the show. A representative for the show said Harrison would feature in three episodes airing from March 18. The episodes saw Darla appear to her now-teenage daughter Aly (Ashlyn Pearce) as a ghost. She made additional appearances in November of the same year. In May 2015, Harrison confirmed via Twitter that she would be returning as Darla again as a ghost. Harrison said that she had an \\"awesome story line\\". Storylines Darla was born and raised in foster homes, and the amount of time she spent shuffling from one place to another had a permanent impact on how she viewed herself. Regardless of how hard she tried, she couldn't stop herself from worrying that she would always be found lacking in some way. From the beginning of the show, she was always Sally Spectra's (Darlene Conley) faithful assistant, who she looked up to as her mother. Although she had a soft spot for fashion designer Clarke Garrison (Daniel McVicar), in the end, her loyalty was always to Sally. After a brief failed relationship with Bill Spencer (Jim Storm), Darla had little airtime for many years, until winding up in bed with Thorne Forrester (Winsor Harmon) one night in 2003 and getting pregnant. A drunken Thorne didn't even realize what he was doing at the time, and Darla originally planned to have an abortion, but Thorne convinced her to give the child to him and his wife, Macy (Bobbie Eakes), who was also Darla's best friend. After Macy chose Deacon Sharpe (Sean Kanan) over Thorne, Darla decided to keep the baby and raise it herself. Thorne, knowing he'd lost Macy, decided to lend a hand in raising his child. When the little girl was born, she was named Alexandria in honor of Macy, who had recently died as a result of an accident. Darla and Thorne had formed a romantic attachment, each realizing that they had found the person they had searched their whole life for, and Darla happily accepted when Thorne proposed. The two were soon married. Unfortunately, it wasn't long before Darla was at odds with Thorne's brother Ridge Forrester (Ronn Moss) and his wife Brooke Logan Forrester (Katherine Kelly Lang). Ridge wanted Darla to keep her mouth shut about family business and to stay out of things, constantly calling her names such as \\"dingbat\\" and \\"glorified secretary\\". Darla, however, refused to let Ridge continue to belittle Thorne. While in Thorne's office one day, printing out some photographs of Sally and her together for Sally's birthday, she left the envelope on the desk while talking to Clarke, who was trying to convince her to steal the Ing√©nue line from Forrester. She didn't see Megan (Maeve Quinlan) take her envelope (containing Sally's birthday photos) off the blotter and put it to the side and put the envelope with the Ing√©nue shots on the blotter. Darla accidentally gave the envelope to Sally. Ridge was furious, and made it clear she was either one of two things‚Äîa manipulator, or a dingbat. Darla ran out of the room in tears and went home to pack her bags, but Thorne stopped her, swearing that no matter what, he would always love her, and did not blame her. The battle between Thorne and Ridge only got worse until Thorne told his parents that one brother had to leave the company. Both Brooke and Darla campaigned for their significant other in the meantime until Eric and Stephanie made up their minds. They chose to keep Ridge, which prompted Thorne to quit Forrester Creations. Sally saw this as an opportunity and made Thorne a job offer. Thorne accepted and he became president of Spectra Fashions. Darla's continued support and encouragement helped Thorne continue to stand up for himself in front of his family on a personal and business front. In the fall of 2005, Sally put all her money in Thomas Forrester's designs which were competing against those of the Forresters in a fashion showdown. When Forrester Creations came out on top, Sally was devastated and knew that her company would soon face trouble. Shortly after, Sally gathered Darla, Clarke, Thorne, Thomas and her faithful Spectra employees at her office to announce she was going to shut down the company and as a retirement gift to herself, take a long cruise around the world. This of course was a ruse on Sally's part as she was really retiring due to health complications as she was now a wheelchair user. When Darla realised what was really going on with Sally, she invited Sally to come and live with her and Thorne at their beach house as Sally was like family to her. Darla again saw little air time until mid-2006. One night, after Alexandria's fourth birthday party, Darla's niece Phoebe (MacKenzie Mauzy) got a flat tire and was stranded at the side of a busy road. She called her mother Taylor (Hunter Tylo), but the call was interrupted when a mysterious bearded man approached Phoebe and she screamed and dropped the phone. Worried about her daughter, a frantic Taylor, who had been drinking, got into her car and rushed to find Phoebe. Phoebe had gotten back into the car and, unbeknownst to Taylor, also called Darla. Darla got to Phoebe first and insisted on changing the tire, Darla lost her balance and fell in front of Taylor's car. A horrified Taylor tried to revive her good friend and sister-in-law, and Phoebe called an ambulance. Darla was rushed to hospital in critical condition. A devastated Thorne and Sally gathered at Darla's bed as she flatlined and died with Thorne at her side. Darla occasionally appears to Aly in a cloud-like circle, and the two carry on conversations. Only Aly can see her, but she has the power to make her presence known to others, in subtle ways. In late June 2015, Aly becomes increasingly agitated about Steffy's permanent return to Forrester Creations. Darla appears to Aly on a daily basis, her appearance changing to reflect Aly's dark and angry mood. Reception During a feature on what storylines were working and not working for the show, a Soap World reporter thought Darla's return to help out Aly was \\"a disaster\\". The reporter wondered why the producers brought back a popular character if they were not going to use all of her, saying \\"forcing a fun and effervescent actress like Schae Harrison to play a 'dismembered floating head' is stupid.\\" References External links Category:The Bold and the Beautiful characters Category:Fictional secretaries Category:Television characters introduced in 1989 Category:Female characters in television ","title":"Darla Forrester"},{"id":"17413759","text":"Renzo Sambo (17 January 1942 ‚Äì 10 August 2009)Renzo Sambo's obituary. ilmessaggero.it was an Italian rower who had his best achievements in the coxed pairs, together with Primo Baran and coxswain Bruno Cipolla.

Life According to Horace Walpole in his Anecdotes of Painters, a work based on the notes of George Vertue, Bushnell was the pupil of the sculptor Thomas Burman. He spent two years in France, before continuing to Italy. He spent some time in Rome, and in Venice, where he made a monument depicting the siege of Candia and a naval battle for a Procutare di San Marco. He returned to England via Hamburg. His first works on his return included statues of Charles I, Charles II and Sir Thomas Gresham for the Royal Exchange. He had intended to make a complete set of kings for the exchange \\"but hearing that another person... had made interest to carve some of them, Bushnell would not proceed, though he had begun six or seven\\". Anecdotes concerning his haughty disposition and increasing eccentricity were repeated in artistic circles and recorded in the eighteenth century by George Vertue in his notebooks. One of these stories involves his attempt to prove that the Trojan Horse was not a fable but a practical possibility. He is said to have spent ¬£500 on constructing a timber horse, its head capable of seating twelve men, but it was wrecked by a storm before it was completed, and Bushnell was too disillusioned to continue with the project, although two vintners, who had contracted to use the horse as a drinking-booth, offered to pay for its reconstruction. Following his death in 1701, his widow Mary and his sons continued to live in his half-finished house near Hyde Park, London after his death, keeping at bay strangers curious to see his remaining sculptures, and by degrees destroying them. A monument, probably his last, is in the North Chapel of St. Andrews Church, Great Billing in Northampton. it is possible that this was moved here unfinished following his death. In the mid-nineteenth century Bushnell's reputation stood high enough for an imaginary portrait representing him to be included amongst the world's great sculptors in the Frieze of Parnassus on the Albert Memorial, in Kensington Gardens in London.

However, she argues that \\"the very mention of Plath's name shapes, and threatens to place limits on, the reader's experience of Ryan's poetry\\", that \\"Tracy Ryan's poetry does not need the Plath myth to prop it up\\".Zott, Debra (2003) \\"Review of Tracy Ryan's 'Hothouse', at Australian Public Intellectual Network In 2001, Ryan said the following about her writing: > I don‚Äôt adhere to any particular school of thought, except in the broadest > sense that my writing is inextricably bound up with my feminism.

Quarters and neighborhoods =M√∏llevangen= The skyline of M√∏llevangen is dominated by H√∏jhus Charlotteh√∏j - one of the only brick-constructed highrises in Denmark. Built primarily in the 1940s, M√∏llevangen has many four-storey apartment blocks in red or yellow brick, but also larger detached house areas and several townhouses. The area is situated close to Aarhus Botanical Gardens and the shopping mall of Storcenter Nord. M√∏llevangen has two churches, a school and a nursing and retirement center. Charlotteh√∏j The skyline of M√∏llevangen, is dominated by one of the only brick-constructed highrises in the country; a 16-story red apartment block in the neighbourhood of Charlotteh√∏j. In the northwest, lies the residential area of Finnebyen; a well defined neighbourhood of 122 colourful wooden houses from Finland, established in 1947-48 to address the increased housing needs after World War II. Finnebyen will perhaps be granted a local conservation status in the near future.Lokalplan 853 Aarhus Kommune In the west, there are large playing fields for association football and athletics and beyond that, a large association of allotments. Fuglebakken This is a detached housing area from the 1920s, south of Charlotteh√∏j. In the east there are two dormitories, one of which is dedicated to descendants of members of the Danish resistance movement during the German occupation. There is a public memorial grove for Danish Nazi Concentration Camp prisoners in association with the dormitory grounds here. Business Academy Aarhus is situated on the outskirts of the neighbourhood, at the heavily trafficked meeting point of Viborg Vej and the Ring 1 ring road. =Frydenlund= Frydenlund is a residential area southwest of M√∏llevangen, mainly consisting of the characteristic high rise concrete apartments from the 1960s and 70s, constructed of large, prefabricated concrete slabs. Approximately 2,500 people live in Frydenlund and they represent a diverse social and ethnic background. 58% are ethnic Danes and 42% are immigrants or descendants of immigrants. There is a large youth and child center (an adventure playground), with playgrounds, animal farms, facilities for sports, etc.Frydenlund Det boligsociale F√¶llessekretariat =Herredsvang= This neighbourhood is located northwest of M√∏llevangen and consists mainly of apartment blocks in various designs, but with a diverse mix of townhouses, detached houses and a dormitory as well. Around 5,000 citizens are living here, with 50% of foreign heritage. There is a church in Herredsvang and easy access to several recreational nature sites such as Marienlyst Park, Brendstrup Skov and Vestereng. There are many community activities in Herredsvang, with institutions such as a culture house and several youth and child centres, including a small farm with livestock and forest kindergartens.

File:Brendstrup Skov 4.jpgFrom Brendstrup Skov beyond Marienlystparken. =Hasle= Hasle, with its 21,700 inhabitants, is by far the biggest part of Aarhus V and is divided into Hasle Vest and Gamle Hasle (Old Hasle). Hasle Vest is located west of the main road Viborgvej and was developed from 1954 and built in the 1960s. The area consists primarily of suburban houses and Marienlyst Park. In the middle of the area and in the northern parts, high rise concrete apartments characterise several public housing programs and projects, many of which are homes to immigrants. The public housing area of Bispehaven, is designated as an immigrant \\"ghetto\\" in Aarhus V; approx. 70% of the inhabitants are immigrants. Hasle ends east of the ring road Ring 2, as there was uncertainty about where the planned Jutland-Interstate E45 was to be located, when the area was in the planning phase. Gamle Hasle (Old Hasle) extends east and south, with detached houses and some apartments. The center of the area is Hasle Torv, a square at the very busy junction of Viborgvej and Ryhavevej.  Music and culture  The hip hop culture has been strongly represented in Aarhus V, in particular in the 2000s, when the milieu here gave rise to the so-called Aarhus-V style. The most famous rappers in or from the district includes L.O.C. (Liam O'Connor,), Johnson and U$O, creators of the group B.A.N.G.E.R.S, the Pimp-A-Lot crew and the two rappers Kajser A and Ham Den Lange comprising the Haven Morgan group.

Volume 191 , Issue 4 , Pages 419 - 434. Murphy drip,Journal of the American Medical Association (April 17, 1909) Proctoclysys in the Treatment of Peritonitis (the Murphy Drip). Murphy‚Äôs punch, Murphy‚Äôs test, and Murphy-Lane bone skid. He is best remembered for the eponymous clinical sign that is used in evaluating patients with acute cholecystitis. His career spanned general surgery, orthopedics, neurosurgery, and cardiothoracic surgery, which helped him to gain international prominence in the surgical profession. Mayo Clinic co- founder William James Mayo called him \\"the surgical genius of our generation\\". Over the course of his career he was renowned as a surgeon, a clinician, a teacher, an innovator, and an author. In addition to general surgical operations, such as appendectomy, cholecystostomy, bowel resection for intestinal obstruction, and mastectomy, he performed and described innovative procedures in neurosurgery, orthopedics, gynecology, urology, plastic surgery, thoracic surgery, and vascular surgery. He also ventured into techniques such as neurorrhaphy, arthroplasty, prostatectomy, nephrectomy, hysterectomy, bone grafting, and thoracoplasty. Life and death Murphy was born in a log cabin in Appleton, Wisconsin. His parents, Michael Murphy and Ann Grimes Murphy, were Irish immigrants who escaped from the Great Famine and who later raised him on their own farm. He was tall and strong with a red beard and mustache.Sarah Regal Riedman, Masters of the Scalpel: The Story of Surgery, p.272, Rand McNally, 1962The Journal of the International College of Surgeons, vol.32, no.1, p.20, July 1959. Murphy died of heart disease in Mackinac Island, Michigan after having been ill for six months. He was staying at the Grand Hotel and was attended by his wife and Drs. L. L. MacArthur and James Keefe. After he suffered from angina pectoris for several years, his death was attributed to aortitis. Two days prior to his death he correctly predicted the findings of his own autopsy: \\"I think the necropsy will show plaques in my aorta.\\" Education and training Murphy attended public school in Appleton and graduated from Appleton High School in 1876. He obtained a doctorate from Rush Medical College in 1879 and entered an eighteen-month internship at Cook County Hospital. He then practiced there briefly. From 1882-1884 he performed practical work at universities and hospitals in Vienna, Munich, Berlin and Heidelberg. Most of this time was spent working in Vienna with Theodor Billroth, who introduced gastrectomy techniques that are still in use today. Academic career Mercy hospital, looking at something he is holding in his hands. After his sojourn in Europe, he returned to Chicago to start a general practice. He was quickly recognized as a leader in abdominal surgery and was appointed lecturer in surgery at Rush Medical College at the end of 1884. In 1890 he was elected Professor of Surgery. In 1892, he was named Professor of Clinical Surgery at the College of Physicians and Surgeons (currently University of Illinois College of Medicine). By 1899, he had become acclaimed for bone surgery. From 1901-1905 he held a position at the Northwestern University Medical School. From 1905-1908, he worked at Rush Medical College, and from 1908-1916 he returned to Northwestern University Medical School. Meanwhile, he also taught at the Graduate Medical School of Chicago, and from 1895 until his death in 1916, he was the surgeon-in-chief at the Mercy Hospital. From 1908 on he also held a commission in the Army Reserve Medical Corps. While at Mercy, he developed a following for his \\"wet clinics\\", in which he operated and lectured to an audience. Physicians from around the world attended these sessions. The only method for wider dissemination of these lectures and demonstrations was print publication. A secretary transcribed his words, and they were printed as \\"The Surgical Clinics of John B. Murphy, M.D., at Mercy Hospital, Chicago\\". This became 'The Surgical Clinics of Chicago\\", and, subsequently, the \\"Surgical Clinics of North America\\", which continue as of 2019. Experiences Early in his career, on May 4, 1886, he was one of the doctors summoned to the scene of the Haymarket Affair in the Near West Side community area of Chicago. He dressed approximately 30 men while working until 3:30 AM. A bomb had been thrown at the Chicago Police officers leading to several deaths and a high-profile trial, in which Murphy was called to testify. The labor unrest leading up to and surrounding the events led to the tradition of May Day labor rallies. After an October 14, 1912 assassination attempt on former United States President Theodore Roosevelt in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Roosevelt was brought to Chicago's Mercy Hospital. When he asked Roosevelt about any fears he might have about his bullet wound he said that Roosevelt responded, \\"I've hunted long enough, Doctor, to know that you can't kill a Bull Moose with a short gun.\\" Legacy The John B. Murphy Memorial building, at 50 East Erie Street in Chicago. As of May 2019 it is an event space called The Murphy Although his surgical prowess was not questioned, his approach to practice was considered pretentious by a segment of his professional colleagues in the U.S., and his work was more highly regarded by his contemporaries in Europe than in Chicago. He was an early advocate of intervention via the removal of the appendix in all cases of appendicitis. His thoughts were controversial in a time of conservative management of appendicitis. Having been met with skepticism after his first presentation of appendectomy, he gathered evidence from 250 cases and presented his opinions again as an authority on the subject. A number of procedures and devices were named after Murphy, including Murphy‚Äôs button (a mechanical device used for intestinal anastomosis), Murphy‚Äôs punch (a punch tenderness at the costo-vertebral angle in cases of perinephric abscess), Murphy's sign (a sign of inflammation of the gallbladder), Murphy‚Äôs test (a test for deep-seated tenderness and muscular rigidity in cases of perinephric abscess), Murphy drip for administration of fluids by proctoclysis in patients with peritonitis, and Murphy-Lane bone skid (a common commercial steel instrument used for femoral head procedures). Murphy developed his eponymous anastomotic button for a sutureless anastomosis of the gallbladder to the duodenum (his preferred treatment for acute cholecystitis), but it was equally suitable for intestinal anastomoses. He developed it in the experimental animal laboratory in a barn behind his house and first used it less than a week after developing it on a dog. The Murphy button can be credited as the forerunner of the modern end-to-end stapling instrument after having become the method of choice for operations at the Mayo Clinic and elsewhere in the United States for over twenty years. In 1896, Murphy was the first person to successfully unite a femoral artery severed by a gunshot wound. In 1898, Murphy was first in the United States to induce artificial immobilization and collapse of the lung (pneumothorax) in treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. He pioneered bone grafting techniques and made inroads in the management of ankylosis, especially with reconstruction. He was also considered an innovator for surgical intervention for prostate cancer, performance of end-to-end anastomosis of hollow viscera. In 1912, he performed what was arguably the first biliary tract endoscopy. He was a founding member of the American College of Surgeons. Honors He was knighted with the Order of St. Gregory the Great at the direction of Pope Benedict XV by Archbishop George Mundelein on June 16, 1916. He was awarded Laetare Medal by the University of Notre Dame in 1902, and a Doctor of Science by University of Sheffield, England in 1908. Although Murphy's flamboyant demeanour and consequent unpopularity among his colleagues kept him from early membership in several professional associations, he was eventually elected President of both the Chicago Medical Society and the American Medical Association (AMA).The American Surgical Association realized their mistake and belatedly granted Murphy membership. There is a public elementary school named in his honor the John B. Murphy Public School located at 3539 West Grace Street in the Irving Park community area on the northwest side of Chicago, which opened in 1924.

This photo was taken by 1901 and was featured in Samuel Adelstein's book Mandolin Memories, printed that year. Raffaele Calace (1863 ‚Äì 1934) was an Italian mandolin player, composer, and luthier. Calace was born in Naples, Italy, the son of Antonio Calace, a successful instrument maker. He initially trained to be a musician, discovered the mandolin, and soon became a virtuoso. After Calace graduated with high honors from the Regio Conservatorio di Musica in Naples, he set out to elevate the mandolin's place in music. To achieve this, he toured Europe and Japan, giving concerts on the Neapolitan mandolin and liuto cantabile. The liuto cantabile is a bass variant of the mandolin family that scholars believe Neapolitan luthiers of the Vinaccia family created in the last decade of the 19th century, and that Raffaele Calace subsequently perfected. Raffaele Calace made three long-playing phonograph records on which he plays mandolin and liuto cantabile. Raffaele Calace wrote about 200 compositions for mandolin. These include concert works for mandolin solo and compositions for mandolin and other instruments‚Äîduets with piano, trio combinations with mandola and guitar, the Romantic Mandolin Quartet (two mandolins, mandola, and guitar), and quintets. Calace also wrote pedagogical works, including a mandolin method, Schule f√ºr Mandoline,Schule f√ºr Mandoline, Released 1902 and a method for playing the liuto cantabile. The mandolin method was published in 1910 and elaborates on the 18th-century Italian mandolin tutors by Giovanni Battista Gervasio (c. 1725‚Äìc. 1785), Gabriele Leone (c. 1725‚Äìc. 1790) and others. It shows the development of the traditional Italian playing style. The Calace school forms a bridge between other modern methods for mandolin, such as those by Raffaele Calace's countryman Silvio Ranieri (1882-1956), a Roman virtuoso who settled in Brussels, and the American-based Italian mandolinist Giuseppe Pettine (1874-1966). Raffaele Calace and his brother Nicola Calace (1859-1923), also a musician, also became instrument makers in the Neapolitan mandolin family. They introduced improvements in building techniques and modernized the Neapolitan mandolin. Among other innovations, they enlarged its sound box and‚Äîlike the Roman luthier Luigi Embergher‚Äîextended the fingerboard over the sound hole to increase the range. When Nicola Calace emigrated to the United States in 1898, Raffaele continued the Calace workshop with his daughter Maria (also a mandolin player), and his son Giuseppe Calace. Today the Calace atelier is run by Calace's grandson Raffaele Jr. See also * List of mandolinists (sorted) References External links *Biography page (Italian), has pictures) *Page with biography (English), has a portrait) *[http://www.calace.it Calace family workshop.

Cover-all Building Systems, Case-New Holland agricultural machinery manufacturer, Peavey Mart, Maple Leaf pork processing facility, Akzo Nobel Chemicals Ltd., Beachcomber Hot Tubs, Centennial Plumbing and Heating are a few of the Marquis Industrial businesses. The Saskatoon Correctional Centre also is located in the Marquis Industrial park. NORAC Systems International Inc. opened their land, $2.5-million industrial plant in 2007. In the Marquis Industrial subdivision are 1092 full-time employees and 24 part-time employees. Transportation Until recently, the area was primarily accessed via Wanuskewein Road and Miller Avenue from the south and north and 71st Street from the west. An extension of Marquis Drive has now provided the region with its major road access, and in 2013 the city approved plans for a north commuter bridge off the east end of Marquis to connect to an extension of McOrmond Drive from the east, providing a major commuter link between Marquis Industrial and the residential communities in northeast and east Saskatoon. The bridge is not, however, being considered a truck route. This new route opened to traffic in the fall of 2018.

Background In 1942, the Japanese invaded the Dutch East Indies, occupying it for the next three and a half years. In September 1944, with the war going badly, the Japanese promised independence, but the following the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Japanese surrendered. Under the terms of the surrender, the Japanese forces still in the archipelago were responsible for maintaining order prior to the arrival of allied forces under British Admiral Earl Louis Mountbatten, the Supreme Allied Commander, South East Asia Command. Two days after the surrender, on 17 August 1945, Indonesian nationalist leader Sukarno proclaimed independence for Indonesia. The Allies learned of this three weeks later from the commander of the Japanese forces, and because there were still at least 70,000 Allied prisoners of war in Indonesia, RAPWI (Recovery of Allied Prisoners of War and Internees) was sent on a mission by the Allies to \\"try to contact the responsible Japanese authorities, alleviate conditions in the prison camps and arrange the evacuation of the prisoners and internees.\\" However, Indonesian nationalists, known as pemuda (youths), demanded the Japanese hand over all arms and ammunition. RAPWI \\"strongly objected to such actions and demanded that the Japanese continue to protect the [Allied POW] camps\\". However, many officers, including Major General Nakamura Junji, ignored RAPWI's request and turned over their weapons. However, not all Japanese officers, such as Major Kido Shinichirou, agreed to surrender their weapons. Instead, on 15 October, he ordered his men to take control of the city of Semarang. Massacre The former Bulu Prison, now Semarang Women's Penitentiary In response to Kido's military actions, Indonesian nationalists locked around 80 Japanese Army workers in a small cell in Bulu Jail without food or water. A day later, those still alive were shot dead, along with another 130 Japanese detained at the same prison, whose bodies were mutilated. Some dying prisoners wrote final messages on the cell walls in their own blood. When the Japanese forces reached and took control of the prison and discovered the massacre, they were infuriated and began to kill Indonesians in revenge. They were joined in this by Japanese civilians, who were given weapons seized from the Indonesians. All together, the Japanese killed over two thousand Indonesians as revenge for the Bulu Prison Massacre, while a further 500 Indonesians also died. The killing stopped when British Gurkha troops arrived on 19 October and after an initial misunderstanding and exchange of fire, the Japanese agreed to cooperate with them.

She was nicknamed la Dinamitera (the Dynamiter) for her expertise with explosives, and was a Republican heroine in the Spanish Civil War. Early life She was born in Villarejo de Salvan√©s, Spain to a mechanic father. Her mother died before the Civil War started, and she moved to Madrid when she was 16 to work as a seamstress. Spanish Civil War Sanchez was one of the first women to join the Republican militias against the Nationalist forces led by General Francisco Franco. She joined the Republicans at the age of 17 on July 17, 1936, the same day that the Spanish Army first revolted against the Second Spanish Republic. Sanchez first served as one of only a few women in the front lines defending Madrid. She was the only woman in the Republican dynamiters section. She was nicknamed, La Dinamitera, which stuck throughout the war. However, Sanchez's right hand was blown off within two months of the start of the war while she was in the trenches making explosives and other bombs. She was personally visited by Spanish philosopher, Jos√© Ortega y Gasset, while recovering in the hospital. After her recovery, she worked first as a telephonist at military headquarters and then became a postwoman in 1937 when the Spanish government ordered all women off the front lines. A driver brought her to the military frontlines every morning to deliver mail between Republican forces and their families. However, she continued to aid the Republicans and their allies during the rest of the war. For example, she worked with Dolores Ib√°rruri, the President and Secretary General of the Communist Party nicknamed \\"La Pasionaria\\", to recruit women to take jobs left by men who had gone to fight the Nationalist forces. She married a young Republican sergeant, Paco Burcet in 1937, with whom she had one daughter. Burcet almost immediately left to fight in Teruel and the couple lost touch for the rest of the Spanish Civil War. When the Nationalist forces amassed at Madrid in 1939 before the fall of the city, Sanchez buried her rifles and burned papers which linked her to the Republican cause. She left her baby daughter with relatives and left for Valencia, Spain, where the Republican government had withdrawn, in order to join her left-wing Republican father. Later they fled to Alicante hoping for ships to take them to safety. However, the ships never arrived and both were captured. Sanchez's father was executed. Francoist Spain years Sanchez was sentenced to death \\"for joining the rebellion\\" by the victorious Francoist government. However, her sentence was commuted to thirty years in prison, of which she ultimately served three years in jail. She was released from jail in March 1942 and tried to find her husband, Paco Burcet. She learned that the Francoist State had dissolved all Republican civil marriages and that Paco had remarried and now had two sons. This left Sanchez as a single mother with a young daughter. She had a second daughter later in life. To support herself and her family during the Francoist State, Sanchez set up and operated a cigarette stall in Madrid. She continued to sell cigarettes until her retirement. After the death of Franco, Sanchez began speaking about her experiences during the war. She wrote of her experiences as a woman during the Spanish Civil War, which was \\"the opportunity to fight when women didn't fight. They stayed at home. [She] lost [her] hand. It didn't matter. [She] was prepared to lose [her] life.\\" Later life In her eighties, Sanchez was formally recognized as one of Spain's mutilada de guerra, or war wounded, for her injuries during the Spanish Civil War. Rosario Sanchez died on April 17, 2008, in Madrid at the age of 88.  Poems  Miguel Hern√°ndez, a Spanish Republican poet who died in prison in 1942, wrote the following poem in Sanchez's honor during the Spanish Civil War. > Rosario, dinamitera, > the dynamite watched over your pretty hand > envying its fiery attributes . . . > The enemy knew well > the hand of this maiden > that is no longer a hand, because > without moving a single finger > it ignited the dynamite > and made her a star > References External links *The Telegraph: Rosario S√°nchez Mora: Republican heroine of the Spanish Civil War known as 'The Dynamite Girl‚Äô' Category:1919 births Category:2008 deaths Category:People from Villarejo de Salvan√©s Category:Communist Party of Spain politicians Category:Spanish military personnel of the Spanish Civil War (Republican faction) Category:Women in war in Spain Category:Spanish Civil War prisoners of war Category:Spanish prisoners of war Category:Women in war 1900‚Äì1945 Category:Spanish women of the Spanish Civil War (Republican faction) ","title":"Rosario S√°nchez Mora"},{"id":"17414233","text":"Erwan Berthou, after a photograph by √âmile Hamonic Erwan Berthou (September 4, 1861 ‚Äì January 30, 1933) was a French and Breton language poet, writer and neo-Druidic bard. His name is also spelled Erwan Bertou and Yves Berthou. He also used the bardic pseudonyms Kaledvoulc'h, Alc'houeder Treger and Erwanig. He was born in Pleubian, C√¥tes-d'Armor. He studied at the small seminary of Tr√©guier, then at the college of Lannion.Anthologie de la litt√©rature bretonne au XX√®me si√®cle. 1, 1900-1918, Morlaix : \\"Skol vreiz\\", 2002 He worked as an engineer in Le Havre, later moving in 1892 to Rochefort. On 12 June 1892, he married Elisa M√©zeray. He joined the Navy for five years. During his service he visited the Caribbean, Africa and China. Berthou returned to Le Havre in 1896. He then began contributing to the journals L'Hermine and Revue des provinces de l'Ouest. In 1897, he published a magazine La Tr√™ve de Dieu (The Truce of God), but it folded after a year. He continued to work as an engineer, especially in construction of settlements in 1898 in Paris. In the following year was one of twenty-two Bretons who went to Cardiff to establish links with Welsh neo-Druidism, being received at the Gorsedd. He also joined the Union R√©gionaliste Bretonne, helping to create the Breton nationalist movement. He participated in all stages of the creation of the Gorsedd of Brittany, of which he was Archdruid from 1903 to 1933, using the bardic name Kaledvoulc'h. He occasionally participated in Emile Masson's journal Brug. Much of his writing is imbued with pantheist ideas. In 1906 Berthou and Jean Le Fustec published Eur to gir of rear Varzed, Triades des druides de Bretagne,Triadon, Eur gir d‚Äôar Varzed, Triades des duides de Bretagne, Paris, Bib. de l'Occident, 1906), √©dition bilingue, Iann Ar Fustec et Yves Berthou. a translation into Breton of the 46 theological Triads of the neo-Bards, according to a text first published by Iolo Morganwg with his own Lyric Poems, then in the Barddas of J. William ab Ithel (1862). The collection, in fact a forgery by Morganwg, was claimed to have been a translation of works by Llywelyn Si√¥n detailing the history of the Welsh bardic system from its ancient origins to the present day. Based on these ideas Berthou also published Sous le ch√™ne des druides (Under the Druids' Oak), which described a mystical history of human spiritual and cultural evolution culminating in the achievement of \\"pure whiteness\\". In 1918, he returned to live in Pleubian, to take over his parents' farm. He found it difficult to keep it solvent, and was reduced to great poverty a result of the inflation after the war. His last years were severely impoverished, leading to his wife's mental breakdown. Members of the Breton national movement organised financial assistance for him. The following is an obituary notice in the Western Mail & South Wales Newspaper, Monday, March 6, 1933 BARD OF BRITTANY M. E. BERTHOU'S LINKS WITH WALES A valuable link between Wales and our cousins in Brittany has been severed by the death recently of M. Erwan Berthou. He was for many years engaged as an engineer in Paris, returning on his retirement to his native corner of Northern Brittany. He was one of the leading poets and most distinguished writers in the Breton tongue, and also wrote French verse of quality. He followed M. Ian ar Fustek as the Archdruid (\\" Y Derwydd Mawr ‚Äù) of Brittany in 1910, and was officially recognised by the Welsh Gorsedd, having been publicly welcomed by \\"Dyfed\\" at the Carmarthen National Eisteddfod in 1911. A few years ago a private fund in recognition of Berthou‚Äôs services to Celtic literature was organised in Wales by Mr. D. Rhys Phillips, of Swansea, and Dr. P. Diverres. The cultural movement of the Celtic races will be the poorer for his passing.

Presses de la Cit√©) Maigret and the Headless Corpse (French: Maigret et le corps sans t√™te) is a detective novel by the Belgian writer Georges Simenon. Overview When a man's arm is fished out of the Canal Saint-Martin in Paris, Maigret and his colleagues are puzzled. A woman's arm they would understand as the work of a psychopath or a man's body as a gang related killing, but they are even more puzzled when the rest of the man, minus his head, is dug out of the Canal. Maigret's attention turns to Madame Calas, a strange woman running a bistro along with her husband near the canal. The husband is away in the country, Madame Calas willingly sleeps with anyone who asks (Maigret does not test this theory) and the judge soon arrests her, her lover (the main one), and a young delivery boy (also a lover). But Maigret is not satisfied and pushes further and uncovers a story, and a motivation for murder, that is far stranger than anything he has ever seen before. Originally written in French in 1955, the novel was translated into English by Eileen Ellenbogen and published by Harcourt Brace in 1968.

Originally signed by the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1967, after attending Eisenhower High School and San Bernardino Valley College he began his professional career with the Ogden Dodgers that very year. His performance was lackluster, as he went 1-1 with a 9.45 ERA in 20 innings, allowing 25 hits and 26 walks. On a positive note, he did strike out 24 batters. The following year, again with the Ogden Dodgers, Rauch went 1-2 with a 4.66 ERA in 29 innings. In 1969, playing for the Rogue Valley Dodgers and Bakersfield Dodgers, Rauch went a combined 6-4 with a 4.55 ERA. With Rogue Valley, he struck out 72 batters in 62 innings, although with Bakersfield, he struck out only 19 batters in 31 innings. Pitching for Bakersfield again in 1970, he went 4-4 with a 2.82 ERA and 91 strikeouts in 83 innings of work. On November 30, 1970, he was drafted by the Mets in the minor-league draft. In his first year in their minor league system - 1971 - he had perhaps the best season of his career when he went a combined 9-5 with a 2.10 ERA while splitting time between the Memphis Blues and Tidewater Tides. His numbers would have been better if he had not pitched for the Tides that year - while with the Blues, he went 9-4 with a 1.48 ERA. With the Tides, his record was 1-0 and his ERA was 4.76. In 1972, Rauch had another impressive year, pitching for the Tides and earning a call up to the Mets. In 21 games with the Tides, he went 1-2 with a 2.72 ERA. He made his big league debut on June 29 of that year, at the age of 22. Facing the Philadelphia Phillies, he pitched one inning, allowing 2 hits, 2 walks and a run. The Mets overall did poorly that game, losing 9-4. The opposing pitcher - Steve Carlton - pitched a complete game, striking out 13 batters. In his one and only big league season, Rauch went 0-1 with a 5.00 ERA in 19 relief appearances. He played in his final big league game on October 2. On November 27, 1972, he was traded with Brent Strom to the Cleveland Indians for Phil Hennigan. He never actually appeared in an Indians uniform.

A force of 300 Dominican troops, a portion of the Army of the South, led by General Francisco Dom√≠nguez, encountered an outnumbering force of 10,000 troops of the Haitian Army led by General Jean Francois Jeannot. Campaign of 1849 Faustin Soulouque, who now governed Haiti, launched a new invasion with an army of some 10,000 men. On the 21 March 1849, Haitian soldiers attacked the Dominican garrison at Las Matas. The demoralized defenders offered almost no resistance before abandoning their weapons. Soulouque pressed on, capturing San Juan. This left only the town of Azua as the remaining Dominican stronghold between the Haitian army and the capital. Since a Dominican flotilla dominated the coastal road with its guns, Soulouque was forced to use the longer approach through El N√∫mero and Las Carreras to reach Azua and could not be supplied or reinforced from the sea. These circumstances forced the president of the Dominican Republic, Manuel Jimenes, to call upon Pedro Santana, whom he had ousted as president, on the 2 April to restore the confidence of the army and to lead the Dominicans against this new invasion. Santana hurried from El Seibo at the head of his mounted following, some 200 men. On the 6 April, Azua fell to 18,000 Haitians and a 5,000-man Dominican counterattack failed. Santana's force swelled to some 800 men as he advanced westward. On the 17 April General Francisco Dom√≠nguez defeated an element of the Haitian army at El N√∫mero, but, lacking supplies and drinking water, he ordered a retreat to Las Carreras. Beginning on the 21 April, Santana delivered the coup de gr√¢ce to the Haitian army personally commanded by Soulouque at the two-day Battle of Las Carreras. Soulouque had homes and mills burned as he retreated from Azua. In retaliation, a Dominican squadron composed of the brigantine 27 de Febrero (guns unknown), commanded by Capt. Charles J. Fagalde, a Frenchman, and schooner Constituci√≥n (guns unknown), commanded by Juan Luis Duquela, raided the Haitian coasts, plundered seaside villages, as far as Cape Dame Marie, and butchered crews of captured enemy ships.

Telechron is the name of a U.S. company that manufactured electric clocks between 1912 and 1992. \\"Telechron\\" is derived from the Greek words tele, meaning \\"far off,\\" and chronos, \\"time,\\" thus referring to the transmission of time over long distances. Founded by Henry Ellis Warren, Telechron introduced the synchronous electric clock, which keeps time by the oscillations of the alternating current electricity that powers it from the electric power grid. Telechron had its heyday between 1925 and 1955, when it sold millions of electric clocks to American consumers. Henry Warren: the Synchronous Motor and the Master Clock Warren master clock, installed in utility power plants, made accurate synchronous clocks possible. Henry E. Warren established the company in 1912 in Ashland, Massachusetts. Initially, it was called \\"The Warren Clock Company,\\" producing battery-powered clocks. These proved unreliable, however, since batteries weakened quickly, which resulted in inaccurate time-keeping. Warren saw electric motors as the solution to this problem. In 1915, he invented a self-starting synchronous motor consisting of a rotor and a coil, which was patented in 1918.Patent Number: 1283433, Filing Date: Feb. 5, 1917, Issue Date: Oct. 1918, Inventor: Henry E. Warren, Assignee: Warren Clock Company (Self-Starting Synchronous Motor). A synchronous motor spins at the same rate as the cycle of the alternating current driving it. Synchronous electric clocks had been available previously, but had to be started manually. In later years, Telechron would advertise its clocks as \\"bringing true time,\\" because power plants had begun to maintain frequency of the alternating current very close to an average of 60 Hz. But such constancy did not yet exist when Warren first experimented with his synchronous motors. Irregularities in the frequency of the alternating current led not only to inaccurate time-keeping but, more seriously, to incompatible power grids in the United States, as power could not readily be transferred from one grid to another. In order to overcome these problems, Warren invented a \\"master clock,\\" which he installed at the Boston Edison Company in 1916. This master clock had two movements, one driven by a synchronous motor connected to the current produced by the power plant, the other driven by a traditional spring and pendulum. The pendulum was adjusted twice a day in accordance with time signals received from the Naval Observatory. As long as the hands of the electric clock, powered by a 60 Hz synchronous motor, moved along perfectly with those of the \\"traditional\\" clock, the power produced by the electric company was uniform.For further details on the technology of the Warren Master Clock, see Harry S. Holcomb, III, and Robert Webb, \\"The Warren Telechron Master Clock Type A,\\" NAWCC Bulletin vol. 27:1, no. 234 (February 1985): 35‚Äì37. In Electrifying Time, Jim Linz writes that \\"in 1947, Warren Master Clocks regulated over 95 percent of the electric lines in the United States.\\"Jim Linz, Electrifying Time: Telechron & G.E. Clocks, 1925‚Äì1955 (Atglen, Pa.: Schiffer, 2001), p. 14. It is interesting to note, then, that the uniformity of alternating current in the United States, which was necessary in order to build large power grids, was initially ensured by a very traditional clock system. Furthermore, Henry Warren invented his master clock at first simply in order to guarantee that his synchronous clock motor would provide accurate time. Telechron and Art Deco The Telechron company's success from the 1920s into the 1950s was not solely due to the technical advantages of their clocks, although all Telechron clocks were powered by successive versions of Henry Warren's synchronous motor.The rotor types are identified on the clocks with the letters B, F, H, and S. B indicates the earliest and S the last (and least reliable) generation of Telechron rotors. Rather, the Telechron company sought to produce clocks whose designs reflected one of the fundamental principles of the Art Deco movement: to combine modern engineering (including mass-production) with the beauty of simple geometric shapes. Thus, Telechron clocks are often considered genuine pieces of art‚Äîbut art affordable by all, as thousands of them were made. The company employed some of the finest designers of the time, such as Leo Ivan Bruce (1911‚Äì1973) and John P. Rainbault. In the evolution of their designs, Telechron clocks were a faithful mirror of their own time. Just as a clock like the \\"Administrator\\" (designed by Leo Ivan Bruce) reflected thirties aesthetics, so the \\"Dimension\\" had 1950s lines. Telechrons were relatively expensive compared to other clocks. In 1941, their most inexpensive alarm clock was the model 7H117 \\"Reporter,\\" and it sold for $2.95, the equivalent of $30.00 in 2008 funds. But their beautiful design and amazing reliability assured a brisk market for them throughout the company's most prosperous years.

As early as 1917, General Electric acquired a strong interest in Telechron, realizing the economic potential of Warren's invention. When Warren retired in 1943, General Electric gradually absorbed Telechron into its operations. The clocks labeled \\"Telechron\\" on the dial, as well as those labeled \\"General Electric\\" were both made in the Ashland, Massachusetts factory. GE clocks had their own case, dial and hand designs, as well as model names and numbers, but the internal workings of both brands of clock were always the same Telechron type of movement. A Revere Clock with Westminster Chime (1940) In addition to its association with GE, Telechron cooperated closely with one of America's most famous makers of traditional clocks, the Herschede company. Walter Herschede became interested in synchronous clocks in the 1920s, but did not want to risk the good name of his company by associating it too quickly with the new technology. Thus, he founded the Revere Clock Company as a division of Herschede that would market clocks driven by Telechron motors. These motors, however, were housed in the elegant cases of mantel and grandfather clocks for which Herschede was known; moreover, these clocks were equipped with chimes. Telechron‚Äînow the \\"Clock and Timer Division\\" of GE‚Äîdeclined in the 1950s, mainly because batteries had become much more long-lived and reliable. Battery-powered clocks have the obvious advantage of not depending on the proximity of a power outlet, and do not require the often somewhat unattractive electric cable. Furthermore, the accuracy of the quartz clock superseded the principles of the synchronous motor. GE tried to respond to the declining market for Warren's technology by producing cheaper, less solidly manufactured clocks. Thus, plastic replaced bakelite or wood as the material for the cases; glass crystals were phased out in favor of plastic ones; and the much less durable S rotor took the place of the H rotor. Nevertheless, the decline of the synchronous clock could not be stopped. GE sold the last of its former Telechron plants in 1979. After successive attempts to revive the business remained fruitless, it closed permanently in 1992. Nonetheless, even if Telechron's original operations have ceased, Telechron continues to exist as a brand: \\"Telechron\\" is the name used by a manufacturer of electric timers in Leland, North Carolina.http://telechron.net/main.htm Moreover, a company that spun off from one of Telechron's research labs in 1928 is still flourishing: Electric Time Company manufactures custom tower and post clocks in Medfield, Massachusetts. Electric Time is the only such company in the U.S. that still makes its own clock movements. Limitations of the Telechron Technology Indicating Device on Telechron 2H07-Br From a commercial point of view, it was the increased durability of batteries as well as the invention of the quartz movement that proved fatal to Telechron. From the point of view of the history of technology, however, another problem is more crucial: if the electric power grid is used as a system for the \\"distribution of time,\\" as Warren himself wrote,See Henry E. Warren, \\"Modern Electric Clocks: A Paper Read at the Meeting of the Clock Club held at the Old State House, Boston, on February 6, 1937,\\" reproduced in Journal of the Electrical Horology Society vol. 3, no. 3 (June 1978): 2‚Äì9. then, in the case of a power failure, the clocks stop, and the individual consumers' Telechrons lose their connection with the master clock (and, by implication, with the time provided by the Naval Observatory). If there is a temporary power outage while the owner is out, the running clock will display the incorrect time when he returns. Warren, foreseeing this difficulty, provided his clocks with an \\"indicating device\\": a red dot that would appear on the dial whenever the power failed. This red dot alerted the consumer to the need to reset the clock (by obtaining the accurate time through the telephone, for example, or from a radio). Setting the clock would reset the indicator. The electric clock market grew rapidly in the 1930s, and Telechron's patented power interruption indicator gave his clocks an advantage over competing synchronous clocks, but by the 1950s battery-operated clocks that weren't dependent on the power grid took market share, and in the 1960s the quartz clock replaced synchronous clocks. In recent years the problem of how to keep clocks synchronized with primary standards has been solved with the radio clock, which receives time signals not through the electric grid, but from government time radio stations. Collecting Telechron Clocks There is a growing community of hobbyists who collect Telechron clocks. An antique Telechron clock will usually come to life immediately (though sometimes noisily) when it is plugged in. Telechron motors are easily quieted and revived by carefully drilling 2 small holes that just punctures the surface, one on the large section, and one on the small section. A very light oil is injected, and then the small holes are carefully soldered shut. If a heavy oil is used, the clock may fail to keep accurate time until the motor becomes warm. Telechron Alarm Clocks Telechron alarm clocks are particularly popular with collectors. Until about 1940, the overwhelming majority of Telechron alarm clocks had bell alarms. The entire mechanism was enclosed in a bell housing of steel. Atop the clock's coil was a metal strip that vibrated at 60 cycles per second when the alarm was tripped. This strip had a V-shaped arm attached to it, ending in a striker, which vibrated in turn against the bell housing. With the approach of war, restrictions on various metals required a reduction in their use, and the bell housing was eliminated, with only the metal strip above the coil remaining. This in itself, however, provided a loud buzz when the alarm was tripped (and was the basis of the alarm in all brands of alarm clocks for many years after the war). Post-war, very few Telechrons had bell alarms, and the bell had disappeared completely by 1960. Telechron was one of the first companies to introduce what became known as the \\"snooze\\" alarm in the early 1950s. Notes Further reading Jim Linz, Electrifying Time: Telechron & G.E.

Established in 2004 through the consolidation of Network Rural Bank of Davao del Sur, the Rural Bank of Panabo of Davao del Norte and the Provident Rural Bank of Cotabato, ONB is the largest rural bank in the Philippines in terms of assets, with a network of 96 branches in Mindanao, 1 branch in Makati City and province of Iloilo (including Iloilo City) and a fleet of 135 ATMs throughout the provinces of Mindanao, including seventeen localities where it is the sole provider of financial services. It is the first rural bank in the Philippines to receive the nod of the Philippine Clearing House Corporation (PCHC) to establish a checking account, as well as to have its cheques cleared directly by the PCHC, instead of an intermediary bank. It is also an equity member of MegaLink (now a BancNet member), one of the first banks in Mindanao to join an interbank network. In December 2014, the bank was acquired by Banco de Oro. July 2015: BDO Unibank, Inc. has completed the acquisition of the largest rural bank in the Philippines. . To align with the continued expansion of its parent company Banco de Oro (BDO Unibank), it changed its name to BDO Network Bank on August 06, 2019. One Network Bank changed its name. Retrieved 08-06-2019. Corporate history One Network Rural Bank is a consolidation of three rural banks in the country. Before the historic consolidation which formed the biggest rural bank in the country with the widest private banking network in Mindanao, there were three partner rural banks ‚Äî Rural Bank of Panabo, Inc., Network Rural Bank, Inc. and Provident Rural Bank of Cotabato, Inc. *Rural Bank of Panabo, Inc. (RB Panabo) RB Panabo has been servicing Davao Province since 1967. While it was the component bank with the fewest branches, it provided technical and logistical support to its partner banks. Many of the banking systems and procedures used by its partner banks came from RB Panabo. RB Panabo received its authority to operate from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas on February 11, 1967. Founded by Dr. Luis A. Buenaventura, Jr.. It was in 1980 that RB Panabo saw the induction of Alex V. Buenaventura as President of the bank. *Network Rural Bank, Inc. (NB) Originally the Rural Bank of Davao City and operating four branches across Davao City, it was merged in 1993 with 5 other rural banks ‚Äî Community Rural Bank of San Isidro (Davao Oriental), Rural Bank of Governor Generoso (Davao Oriental), Rural Bank of Pantukan (Compostela Valley), Rural Bank of Bayugan (Agusan del Sur) and Rural Bank of Kalamansig (Sultan Kudarat) ‚Äì and renamed as Network Rural Bank. RB Panabo‚Äôs success was such that also in 1993, Network Rural Bank, Inc. asked Alex V. Buenaventura of RB Panabo to take over its helm. Mr. Buenaventura‚Äôs acceptance brought his leadership and rural banking experience into Network Bank. This move was the start of a long-standing partnership between the two rural banks. In its 11 years of existence, Network Bank became a giant in the Philippine rural banking industry. From 9 branches in 1993, NB expanded to 33 branches in Mindanao. The ties between the two banks even went so far as to spur the creation of another strong financial institution, what may be called the offspring of the RB Panabo and Network Bank. *Provident Rural Bank of Cotabato (ProBank) In 1996, Network Bank and a group of Cotabato investors, led by the Diocese of Kidapawan, acquired a rural bank in Central Mindanao called the Community Rural Bank of Matalam. Re-launched under a new name, Provident Rural Bank of Cotabato (Probank), a known Cotabato banker, Elpidio F. Masbad III, took over the reins as president of Probank. From total assets of P5 million with P3 million owed to BSP, ProBank grew to a P 235 million bank with 7 branches in its 7-year run. The rapid turnaround can be attributed to aggressive marketing campaigns as well as logistic and systems support from Network Bank. With a strong third partner in place, the basis for cooperation was set and the ‚Äúthree banks, one system‚Äù approach was formed. *The Network Rural Banking Group (NRBG) Working in parallel with similar systems was however not enough for the three rural banks. In 1996, RB Panabo and Network Bank entered a ‚Äúmutual purchase‚Äù or stock swap arrangement. With Network Bank owning 49% of ProBank, the stockswap arrangement brought the three banks closer. This paved the way for the conception of The Network Rural Banking Group (NRBG). The Network Rural Banking Group was created in 1998 when Network Bank, RB Panabo and ProBank resolved to operate as a single unit with joint policy formulation made possible through a common Executive Committee and synchronized systems and procedures. Sharing common central office services such as human resource development, legal services, treasury, product development, information technology, internal audit and appraisal, in effect, contributed to the rapid growth of the partner banks. The Consolidation Former logo as One Network Bank from July 2015 to August 2019 After 8 years of working closely together, the partner banks decided to consolidate, allowing the Bank to take advantage of economies of scale, avail of incentives from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas and bring better banking services to countryside Mindanao, given a bigger capital base and increased Single Borrowers Limit (SBL).

Justice Matthews delivered the opinion of the Court. He recited the facts as stated above and continued: > The right of removal from the state court which is contested in this case is > founded on the last clause of the second section of the Act of March 3, > 1875, 18 Stat. 470, Richardson's Supplement 173: \\"And when in any suit > mentioned in this section there shall be a controversy which is wholly > between citizens of different states, and which can be fully determined as > between them, then either one or more of the plaintiffs or defendants > actually interested in such controversy may remove said suit into the > Circuit Court of the United States for the proper district.\\" It is > accordingly argued in its support that the sole and real controversy > disclosed by the pleadings is between the plaintiff below and the plaintiff > in error, to which the Des Moines and Minneapolis Railroad Company is a > merely nominal party. The action, it is said, is brought in pursuance of ¬ß > 3373 of the Iowa Code, which is as follows: \\"The action of mandamus is one > brought in a court of competent jurisdiction to obtain an order of such > court commanding an inferior tribunal, board, corporation, or person to do > or not to do an act, the performance or omission of which the law enjoins as > a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station.\\" And by ¬ß 3379 it is > further provided that \\"The pleadings and other proceedings in any action in > which a mandamus is claimed shall be the same in all respects as nearly as > may be, and costs shall be recovered by either party as in an ordinary > action for the recovery of damages. \\" It is also declared in ¬ß 3375 that > \\"The plaintiff in any action, except those brought for the recovery of > specific, real, or personal property, may also, as an auxiliary relief, have > an order of mandamus to compel the performance of a duty established in such > action. But if such duty the performance of which is sought to be compelled > is not one resulting from an office, trust, or station, it must be one for > the breach of which a legal right to damages is already complete at the > commencement of the action, and must also be a duty of which a court of > equity would enforce the performance.\\" The proposition that the Des Moines > and Minneapolis Railroad Company is a merely nominal and not a real and > substantial party to the controversy is maintained on two grounds, (1) that > the relief sought against it rests upon the force of the alleged agreements > in reference to the location of its line, which constitute the conditions of > the taxes voted, lands granted, and stock subscriptions paid to it, and that > mandamus will not lie for the purpose of enforcing the specific performance > of personal contracts, (2) and that the Des Moines and Minneapolis Railroad > Company is not only exonerated but disabled from the performance of the duty > sought to be enforced against it, if for such it were amenable to the > process of mandamus, by virtue of the lease of its road, property, and > franchises to the plaintiff in error, that lease being authorized by ¬ß 1300 > of the Code of Iowa, as follows: \\"Any such corporation may sell or lease its > railway property and franchises, or make joint running arrangements with any > corporation owning or operating any connecting railway, and the corporation > operating the railway of another shall in all respects be liable in the same > manner and extent as though such railway belonged to it, subject to the laws > of this state.\\" But to sustain the first point it is necessary to decide the > controversy in favor of the Des Moines and Minneapolis Railroad Company, one > of the defendants sought to be charged, upon its merits. That necessarily > affirms that such a controversy exists, and that, in its turn, proves that > the circuit court did not err in holding that it had no jurisdiction to > entertain it. It may be a question whether the remedy by mandamus is not > larger and more extensive under the Iowa Code than the plaintiff in error > admits. And at any rate, we cannot strike from the record parts of the > plaintiff's case as immaterial without assuming the point to be proved that > we have a right to consider its merits at all, for whether they are material > may be the substance of the controversy. It may well be that the scope of > the plaintiff's case includes the claim that the railway company, having, on > the faith of the alleged agreements, made a location of its line, exhausted > its corporate power in reference to its establishment, or that even if it > still had corporate discretion to change it, the circumstances alleged, > including the agreements made on condition of its original location, may not > have created a corporate duty, enforceable by mandamus, to maintain and > permanently operate it. These are questions certainly which the plaintiff in > the action has the right to raise and have tried in any court of his own > selection having proper jurisdiction, and they raise a controversy with the > Des Moines and Minneapolis Railroad Company, to which it is a necessary > party, unless it is relieved from it by the substitution in its place of its > lessee by the law under which it transferred its property and franchises to > the plaintiff in error. But that section of the statute already quoted has > no such effect. The court found that It does not discharge the lessor > company from any of its corporate liabilities. It merely imposes a liability > upon the lessee while operating it, and if this liability extends, as is > claimed, to obligations of the lessor antecedent to the lease, such as that > sought to be enforced in the present proceeding, there is nothing in the > statute to exclude the idea that it is a joint liability, enforceable > against both. If it be said that the liability is that of the lessor, but > that it is disabled by the lease from its performance, and that that duty is > cast by the lease and the law upon the lessee, then the necessity for a > joinder in the action is still more apparent for, to obtain a judgment > against the plaintiff in error, requiring it to per form a duty devolved > upon it merely because it has assumed under the law to perform the duties of > another, makes it necessary, upon well settled rules of pleading, also to > obtain a judgment against the latter to declare and determine with > conclusive force the existence and limits of the duty to be enforced against > its guarantor and substitute. In any view we are justified in taking of the > nature of the controversy disclosed by the pleadings in this proceeding, we > conclude that both the original defendants are necessary parties to its > determination, and that consequently the plaintiff in error was not entitled > to remove the suit from the jurisdiction of the state court.

Technical characteristics Furor was built in the United Kingdom by Thomson, (which would rename itself Clydebank Engineering & Shipbuilding Co. the following year). Her keel was laid on 21 February 1896, and she was completed on 21 November 1896. She had three funnels. In the parlance of the day, she was a \\"torpedo boat destroyer\\", designed to protect larger ships against torpedo boat attack, but also carrying torpedoes with which to attack larger ships herself.Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1860‚Äì1905, p. 385 Operational history An unidentified Spanish destroyer ‚Äì either Furor, , or ‚Äì with Cervera's squadron at S√£o Vicente sometime between 14 April 1898 and 29 April 1898.As tensions between Spain and the United States grew in early 1898, Furor was part of the Spanish Navy's 1st Squadron, commanded by Vice Admiral Pascual Cervera y Topete. The squadron was ordered to concentrate at S√£o Vicente in Portugal's Cape Verde Islands. Accordingly, Furor, in company with Cervera's flagship, the armored cruiser , armored cruiser , and destroyers and , departed Cadiz on 8 April 1898 and arrived at S√£o Vicente on 14 April 1898. The ships had experienced mechanical problems and burned an excessive amount of coal during the voyage. Soon, the squadron was reinforced by two more armored cruisers, and .Nofi describes the concentration of the squadron, pp. 78‚Äì80 The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War began while Furor was at S√£o Vicente. Ordered by neutral Portugal in accordance with international law to leave S√£o Vicente within 24 hours of the declaration of war, Furor and the rest of Cervera's squadron departed on 29 April 1898, bound for San Juan, Puerto Rico. Because of continuing engine trouble and low coal supplies, Furor and her fellow destroyers were towed part of the way. Cervera's ships reached French-owned Martinique in the Lesser Antilles on 10 May 1898.Nofi recounts the concentration of the squadron and its transatlantic voyage, pp. 82‚Äì85 While the other ships loitered in international waters, Furor and Terror went into Fort-de-France to ask for coal. France was neutral and would not supply coal. Moreover, the American auxiliary cruiser had just left port, and French officials announced that in accordance with international law and France's neutrality, the destroyers, as belligerents, could not leave port until 48 hours after Harvard had left, i.e., on 13 May 1898. Terror had become immobilized with engine problems, so the destroyer flotilla commander, Captain Fernando Villaamil, took Furor out in the harbor on 12 May 1898 under the ruse of testing her engines, then successfully made a dash out into international waters 24 hours early.Nofi, p. 85 Leaving Terror behind, Furor and the rest of Cervera's squadron set out on 12 May 1898 for Dutch-owned Cura√ßao, where Cervera expected to meet a collier. Cervera arrived at Willemstad on 14 May, but the Netherlands also was neutral, and strictly enforced its neutrality by allowing only Vizcaya and Infanta Maria Teresa to enter port and permitting them to load only 600 tons of coal. On 15 May, Cervera's ships departed, no longer bound for San Juan, which by now was under a U.S. Navy blockade, but for as-yet unblockaded Santiago de Cuba on the southeastern coast of Cuba, arriving there on 19 May 1898. Cervera hoped to refit his ships there before he could be trapped. His squadron was still in the harbor of Santiago de Cuba when an American squadron arrived on 27 May 1898 and began a blockade which would drag on for 37 days.See Nofi, pp. 85‚Äì86, for an account of Cervera's voyage in the Caribbean. During the blockade, Furor and the others endured occasional American naval bombardments of the harbor; during one such bombardment on 6 June 1898, she took a shell hit in her bunkerage, but suffered no serious damage.Hit and damage reported in Cervera's papers, p. 101 Some of her men joined others from the fleet in a Naval Brigade to fight against a U.S. Army overland drive toward Santiago de Cuba.Nofi discusses the Naval Brigade, pp. 146, 172 By the beginning of July 1898, that drive threatened to capture Santiago de Cuba, and Cervera decided that his squadron's only hope was to try to escape into the open sea by running the blockade. The decision was made on 1 July 1898, with the break-out set for 3 July 1898. The crew of Furor spent 2 July 1898 returning from Naval Brigade service and preparing for action. Furor was to be the fifth ship in line during the escape, following the four armored cruisers and with Pluton behind her; while Infanta Maria Teresa sacrificed herself by attacking the fastest American ship, the armored cruiser , Furor and the others were to avoid action, put on all the speed they could, and run for the open sea.See Cervera's plan in Nofi, pp. 172‚Äì173 At about 0845 hours on 3 July 1898, the Spanish ships got underway. The U.S. squadron sighted the Spanish ships in the channel at about 0935, and the Battle of Santiago de Cuba began.Nofi, pp. 173‚Äì176 While the four armored cruisers turned to starboard to run westward, Furor and Pluton turned inside them and made their run closer to the coast. The blockading American battleships and armored cruisers opened fire on the two destroyers as they emerged from the channel, hitting both destroyers several times, but then turned their attention to pursuing the Spanish cruisers. The two damaged destroyers put on speed, pursued only by the armed yacht , a ship less well armed than the destroyers, but larger, faster, and undamaged. Gloucester hit both destroyers repeatedly.Nofi, pp. 179‚Äì180 In short order, casualties aboard Furor began to climb, and her stern flooded and became submerged; all her boilers were destroyed and her engine damaged; fires broke out in several places, including a particularly bad one in the engine room, which lay over the shell room, causing a danger of explosion; a hole was punched in her side; and finally her steering failed.Damage reported in \\"Report of the Furor\\" in Cervera's papers, pp. 132‚Äì133 Too badly damaged to continue, Pluton ran herself aground at 1045 on the beach just west of Cabanas Bay. Now alone, Furor survived only five more minutes. Still firing her guns, but with half her crew killed or wounded and clearly doomed, Furor stuck her colors and began to lower her boats; several American projectiles struck Spanish sailors struggling in the water before the Americans realized she had surrendered. Two American boats came alongside and began to take off survivors, but quickly pushed away again fearing an imminent magazine explosion, which promptly occurred. Furor sank about a mile offshore in deep water at 1050.See \\"Report of the Furor\\" in Cervera's papers, pp. 132‚Äì133 Captain Villaamil died aboard Furor, as did over half of her crew.See \\"Report of the Furor\\" in Cervera's papers, pp. 132‚Äì133 Those of her crew who got ashore had to beware of Cuban insurgents, who began shooting Spanish sailors they found along the shore. Other survivors were recovered by U.S. sailors in small boats.Nofi, p. 183 Notes References * Cervera, Pascual, Ed. Office of Naval Intelligence War Notes No. VII: Information From Abroad.

He was born in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania on January 23, 1799, the son of William and Sarah Ann Wright. He married Josephine De La Rua on February 23, 1826. He owned the Pensacola Gazette from 1834 to 1839 and edited the paper till 1846. He opposed secession and refused to swear allegiance to the Confederacy. He died on April 28, 1874. Wright was admitted to the Luzerne County, Pennsylvania bar on April 7, 1820. When he was twenty-four, he moved to the Pensacola area. He became friends with and went to work for Richard K. Call, a prot√©g√© of Andrew Jackson. In April 1824 he was appointed to the Florida Territorial Council. In May, the president appointed him United States Attorney for Middle Florida, and then for West Florida in February 1826. His political career encountered difficulties after he accused Judge Henry Marie Brackenridge of malfeasance in November 1827. The judge retaliated by seeking Wright's replacement through a letter writing campaign and his political connections. As a result, another man was appointed in his place when his term expired in 1830. He represented Escambia County in the territorial council from 1831 to 1833 and again in 1837. He served as a member of the 1838 constitutional convention till January 5, 1839. That year, he became a member of the Territorial Senate. He left office to work behind the scenes politically. He served in the Florida Senate in 1845, and again returned to his law practice. In 1850 he became an Alabama and Florida Railroad commissioner. The governor appointed him to the Supreme Court in 1853 to replace Walker Anderson. He was replaced in turn when the voters elected Thomas Baltzell, the first Florida Justice chosen by popular election. He again returned to his Pensacola business interests and law practice. He became president of the Alabama and Florida Railroad in 1856. He served on the 1865 constitutional convention, but never again served as an elected official. He died on April 28, 1874.

The software was developed by the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT), which is the operational arm of the National Cyber Security Division (NCSD) of the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The program was originally developed to provide \\"situational awareness\\" for the civilian agencies. While the first version examined network traffic and subsequent versions examined content, the current version of EINSTEIN is significantly more advanced. Mandate The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace (February 2003) featured the new cabinet-level United States Department of Homeland Security as the lead agency protecting IT. EINSTEIN is the product of U.S. congressional and presidential actions of the early 2000s including the E-Government Act of 2002 which sought to improve U.S. government services on the Internet. So where did the name EINSTEIN come from? During the initial formation of the program, the program was referred to as SAP which stood for the Situational Awareness Program. Unfortunately, SAP is not the best acronym for a government cybersecurity program and there was a need to change this to something different. Hanging in Rob Pate's office at GSA Building in Washington, D.C. at 7th and D Street (initial offices of both FedCIRC and the newly formed US-CERT) was a poster of Albert Einstein. The team was looking for a new name and the decision to use the name EINSTEIN was made by Rob Pate, Sean McAllister, and Mike Witt. EINSTEIN's mandate originated in the Homeland Security Act and the Federal Information Security Management Act, both in 2002, and the Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 7, which was issued on December 17, 2003. The Federal Computer Incident Response Capability (FedCIRC) was one of four watch centers that were protecting federal information technology when the E-Government Act of 2002 designated it the primary incident response center. With FedCIRC at its core, US-CERT was formed in 2003 as a partnership between the newly created DHS and the CERT Coordination Center which is at Carnegie Mellon University and funded by the U.S. Department of Defense. US-CERT delivered EINSTEIN to meet statutory and administrative requirements that DHS help protect federal computer networks and the delivery of essential government services. EINSTEIN was implemented to determine if the government was under cyber attack. EINSTEIN did this by collecting flow data from all civilian agencies and compared that flow data to a baseline. # If one Agency reported a cyber event, the 24/7 Watch at US-CERT could look at the incoming flow data and assist resolution. # If one Agency was under attack, US-CERT Watch could quickly look at other Agency feeds to determine if it was across the board or isolated. On November 20, 2007, \\"in accordance with\\" an Office of Management and Budget (OMB) memo, EINSTEIN version 2 was required for all federal agencies, except the Department of Defense and United States Intelligence Community agencies in the executive branch. Adoption EINSTEIN was deployed in 2004 and until 2008 was voluntary. By 2005, three federal agencies participated and funding was available for six additional deployments. By December 2006, eight agencies participated in EINSTEIN and by 2007, DHS itself was adopting the program department-wide. By 2008, EINSTEIN was deployed at fifteen of the nearly six hundred agencies, departments and Web resources in the U.S. government.Apart from 106 listings for \\"Website\\" or \\"Home Page\\", 486 listings appear in Features When it was created, EINSTEIN was \\"an automated process for collecting, correlating, analyzing, and sharing computer security information across the Federal civilian government.\\" EINSTEIN does not protect the network infrastructure of the private sector. As described in 2004, its purpose is to \\"facilitate identifying and responding to cyber threats and attacks, improve network security, increase the resiliency of critical, electronically delivered government services, and enhance the survivability of the Internet.\\" EINSTEIN was designed to resolve the six common security weaknesses that were collected from federal agency reports and identified by the OMB in or before its report for 2001 to the U.S. Congress. In addition, the program addresses detection of computer worms, anomalies in inbound and outbound traffic, configuration management as well as real-time trends analysis which US-CERT offers to U.S. departments and agencies on the \\"health of the Federal.gov domain\\". EINSTEIN was designed to collect session data including: * Autonomous system numbers (ASN) * ICMP type and code * Packet length * Protocol * Sensor identification and connection status (the location of the source of the data) * Source and destination IP address * Source and destination port * TCP flag information * Timestamp and duration information US-CERT may ask for additional information in order to find the cause of anomalies EINSTEIN finds. The results of US-CERT's analysis are then given to the agency for disposition. EINSTEIN 2 During EINSTEIN 1, it was determined that the civilian agencies did not know the entirety of what their registered IPv4 space included. This was obviously a security concern. Once an Agency's IPv4 space was validated, it was immediately clear that the Agency had more external Internet Connections or Gateways than could be reasonably instrumented and protected. This gave birth to the OMB's TIC, Trusted Internet Connections\\" Initiative. Three constraints on EINSTEIN that the DHS is trying to address are the large number of access points to U.S. agencies, the low number of agencies participating, and the program's \\"backward-looking architecture\\". An OMB \\"Trusted Internet Connections\\" initiative was expected to reduce the government's 4,300 access points to 50 or fewer by June 2008. After agencies reduced access points by over 60% and requested more than their target, OMB reset their goal to the latter part of 2009 with the number to be determined. A new version of EINSTEIN was planned to \\"collect network traffic flow data in real time and also analyze the content of some communications, looking for malicious code, for example in e-mail attachments.\\" The expansion is known to be one of at least nine measures to protect federal networks. The new version, called EINSTEIN 2, will have a \\"system to automatically detect malicious network activity, creating alerts when it is triggered\\". EINSTEIN 2 will use \\"the minimal amount\\" necessary of predefined attack signatures which will come from internal, commercial and public sources. The EINSTEIN 2 sensor monitors each participating agency's Internet access point, \\"not strictly...limited to\\" Trusted Internet Connections, using both commercial and government-developed software. EINSTEIN could be enhanced to create an early warning system to predict intrusions. US-CERT may share EINSTEIN 2 information with \\"federal executive agencies\\" according to \\"written standard operating procedures\\" and only \\"in a summary form\\". Because US-CERT has no intelligence or law enforcement mission it will notify and provide contact information to \\"law enforcement, intelligence, and other agencies\\" when an event occurs that falls under their responsibility. EINSTEIN 3 Version 3.0 of EINSTEIN has been discussed to prevent attacks by \\"shoot[ing] down an attack before it hits its target.\\" The NSA is moving forward to begin a program known as ‚ÄúEINSTEIN 3,‚Äù which will monitor ‚Äúgovernment computer traffic on private sector sites.‚Äù (AT&T; is being considered as the first private sector site.) The program plan, which was devised under the Bush administration, is controversial, given the history of the NSA and the warrantless wiretapping scandal. Many DHS officials fear that the program should not move forward because of ‚Äúuncertainty about whether private data can be shielded from unauthorized scrutiny.‚Äù Some believe the program will invade the privacy of individuals too much. Privacy The Privacy Impact Assessment for EINSTEIN version 2 describes the program in detail. In the Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) for EINSTEIN 2 published in 2008, DHS gave a general notice to people who use U.S. federal networks. DHS assumes that Internet users do not expect privacy in the \\"To\\" and \\"From\\" addresses of their email or in the \\"IP addresses of the websites they visit\\" because their service providers use that information for routing. DHS also assumes that people have at least a basic understanding of how computers communicate and know the limits of their privacy rights when they choose to access federal networks. The Privacy Act of 1974 does not apply to EINSTEIN 2 data because its system of records generally does not contain personal information and so is not indexed or queried by the names of individual persons. A PIA for the first version is also available from 2004. DHS is seeking approval for an EINSTEIN 2 retention schedule in which flow records, alerts, and specific network traffic related to an alert may be maintained for up to three years, and if, for example in the case of a false alert, data is deemed unrelated or potentially collected in error, it can be deleted. According to the DHS privacy assessment for US-CERT's 24x7 Incident Handling and Response Center in 2007, US-CERT data is provided only to those authorized users who \\"need to know such data for business and security purposes\\" including security analysts, system administrators and certain DHS contractors. Incident data and contact information are never shared outside of US-CERT and contact information is not analyzed. To secure its data, US-CERT's center began a DHS certification and accreditation process in May 2006 and expected to complete it by the first quarter of fiscal year 2007. As of March 2007, the center had no retention schedule approved by the National Archives and Records Administration and until it does, has no \\"disposition schedule\\"‚Äîits \\"records must be considered permanent and nothing may be deleted\\". As of April 2013, DHS still had no retention schedule but was working \\"with the NPPD records manager to develop disposition schedules\\". An update was issued in May 2016.

It stars Van Johnson, Thomas Mitchell, and Janet Leigh in her film debut. It was adapted from the novel of the same name by MacKinlay Kantor. Plot Henry Carson (Van Johnson), a schoolteacher before the Civil War, shows up in a rural region of the Missouri hills. He spends the night with a family consisting of Gill MacBean (Thomas Mitchell), his wife Sairy (Selena Royle), and two of their children, Lissy Anne (Janet Leigh), and youngster Andrew (Dean Stockwell). Another son, Ben (Marshall Thompson), had run off to fight in the war; the family's hope that he will someday return is gradually waning. Gill does not welcome the stranger, unsure of his allegiance, but the others like the good-natured young man, especially Lissy Anne. Henry offers to help with the farming; the MacBeans desperately need more hands, but Gill remains very suspicious of his motives. A band had been burning the barns of those still loyal to the defeated Confederacy; the MacBeans had been the latest victims. Henry, however, proves to be a hard worker. When storekeeper and unofficial banker Cal Baggett (Guy Kibbee) visits the family to ask about repayment of a loan, Henry talks him into hosting a \\"play party\\", inviting everyone, regardless of affiliation, to help heal the rift in the community. Gill is strongly opposed to it, but Henry tricks him into bringing his family. At first, the two groups do not mix, but Sairy talks Northern sympathizer Dan Yeary (Russell Simpson) into dancing with her, breaking the ice. Soon, everyone is having a very good time. However, an argument breaks out about the playing of a tune associated with the North. To forestall a fight, Cal calls for a vote. Unfortunately, it is a tie. Gill calls upon Henry to cast the deciding vote. Henry is finally forced to reveal that he fought in the Union army. After that, the party quickly breaks up, much to the secret delight of John Dessark (Charles Dingle) and his son Badge (Jim Davis). Henry is no longer welcome at the MacBeans. He does not leave the area though; he starts building a schoolhouse. Eventually, Lissy Anne can no longer bear to be apart from Henry. She walks away into the night with him, without her father's knowledge but with her mother's approval, after Henry escorts her brother home from the schoolhouse where he had walked to attend class. Gill tracks them down with a bloodhound, intending to shoot his would-be son-in-law. When five masked nightriders approach, Henry strikes Gill unconscious and seizes his rifle. The horsemen start shooting to kill. Taking cover Henry kills four and captures the fifth after a lengthy footchase and fistfight at a burnt-out dwelling. It is Badge Dessark. He confesses that his father is behind the raids, not out of loyalty to the South, but simply for financial profit. With the Dessarks hanged, the community starts to heal. Finally, Henry reveals why he sought out the MacBeans. In a flashback, it is revealed that he first met Ben as they were walking across the hills to enlist in the war. As they traveled together singing and laughing, they became good friends. Approaching the turn-off signpost they decided in jest on a foot race to see who could be the first to reach it. Henry ended up on the north branch, with Ben on the south. They were momentarily silent on the choice that each had made. Henry proposed that they \\"take a five minute rest\\". Henry ultimately persuaded Ben into going north. Two days before the war's end, Ben was killed suddenly. Before dying, he made Henry promise to help the family with the crop harvest. After hearing Henry's quiet testimony of their deep trust and friendship, a teary-eyed Gill gives Henry and Lissy Anne his blessing to get married. Sairy reaches out to touch Gill's arm, offering agreement. As the wagon rolls down the road with Lissy Anne and Henry aboard, Andrew and the dogs climb in the back, to indicate that the picture is once more complete.

A force of Dominican troops, a portion of the Army of the South, led by General Antonio Duverg√©, defeated an outnumbering force of the Haitian Army led by General Jean-Louis Pierrot. Prelude =Campaign of 1845= On the 17 June 1845, the Dominicans, under the command of General Antonio Duverg√©, invaded Haiti in retaliation for Haitian border raids. The invaders captured two towns on the Plateau du Centre and established a bastion at Cachim√°n. Haitian President Jean-Louis Pierrot quickly mobilized his army and counterattacked on the 22 July driving the invaders from Cachim√°n and back across the frontier. On the 6 August Pierrot ordered his army to invade the Dominican Republic. Battle On the 17 September 1845 the Dominicans defeated the Haitian vanguard near the frontier at Estrelleta where the Dominican \\"square\\" repulsed, with the use of bayonets, a Haitian cavalry charge. Aftermath On 27 September 1845, Dominican Gen. Francisco Antonio Salcedo defeated a Haitian army at the battle of ‚ÄúBeler,‚Äù a frontier fortification. Salcedo was supported by Adm. Juan Bautista Cambiaso's squadron of three schooners, which blockaded the Haitian port of Cap-Ha√Øtien. On the 28 October other Haitians armies attacked the frontier fort ‚ÄúEl Invencible‚Äù and were repulsed after five hours of hard fighting. In the first significant naval action between the Hispaniolan rivals, a Dominican squadron captured 3 small Haitian warships and 149 seamen off Puerto Plata on the 21 December.

The highway linked Fort Simcoe State Park in the west to White Swan and Toppenish in the east. The highway had been built sometime between 1915 and 1937, and was renumbered from Secondary State Highway 3B during the 1964 state highway renumbering. The route was slated to be removed from the state highway system during the 1991 legislative session, and was removed April 1, 1992.  Route description  SR 220 started at Fort Simcoe State Park, headed easterly along Fort Simcoe Road until it intersected Hawk Road. At the t intersection with Hawk Road, the highway turned north and follows Hawk Road until an intersection with White Swan Road. The highway turned back east along White Swan Road, passing through downtown White Swan, before turning south along Curtis Street. The highway passed over a BNSF Railway rail line, formerly part of the Toppenish, Simcoe & Western Railroad, before Curtis street turned easterly and became Fort Road. Fort Road continued almost perfectly east for about before intersecting US Route 97 (US 97). After crossing US 97, the highway continued as a city street through west Toppenish before terminating at SR 22. Every year the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 1991, WSDOT calculated that as few as 340 cars used the highway at the western terminus and as many as 9,300 cars at the interchange with SR 22.  History  The highway was first constructed some time between 1915 and 1937, with a segment linking Fort Simcoe to White Swan completed by 1937. The highway was signed as Secondary State Highway 3B (SSH 3B) between White Swan and Toppenish until the 1964 state highway renumbering when the SR 220 number was applied to the highway. The original eastern terminus was US 97, but in 1971 the terminus was extended to SR 22. The highway was de-legislated in 1991 along with eleven other highways, and was removed from the system effective April 1, 1992.  Today  All of the roads that SR 220 were routed along are still accessible, and have been designated major collector roads by WSDOT. The entirety of the former routing of SR 220 has been designated Classified Route S390. The city of Toppenish is eligible to receive hardship funding for the former highway between the junction with SR 22 to near Linden Road, a span of .

Universal Publishers, 2004. Referred to as the \\"Athens Ripper\\", he was sentenced to thirteen terms of life imprisonment, plus 25 years. Crimes Daglis, a truck driver, preyed upon Athens prostitutes between 1992 and 1995. He had been a repeat juvenile offender since the age of 14. He had a prior record for a 1988 charge of seducing a minor, and in 1989 he was arrested for attacking a group of men at the Zappeion in Athens with a knife. Daglis was initially suspected for two murders after he was arrested for the rape and abduction of an English woman named Ann Hamson.Amanda Howard and Martin Smith, River of Blood: Serial Killers And Their Victims, page 108, Universal Publishers, 2004. After his arrest, Daglis confessed to the rape, strangulation and dismemberment of two women and the attempted murder of a further six, and having robbed all eight women. He later admitted to dismembering the bodies of two women, Eleni Panagiotopoulou, 29, and Athina Lazarou, 26, with a hacksaw and disposing of them around Athens. Daglis subsequently confessed to the previously unsolved murder of a prostitute whose dismembered body was found in a dumpster in 1992. During his trial, Daglis told the court, \\"I hated all prostitutes and continue to hate them. I went to meet them for sex but suddenly other pictures came into my head. I heard voices which ordered me to kill. Once I thought about strangling my fianc√©e, but I restrained myself.\\" He revealed that he hated prostitutes because his mother had been one. On 2 August 1997, Daglis was found hung dead in his cell, along with his cell mate G. Makridis, in an apparent suicide pact.

Called \\"a timeless staple of the blues\\", the song also had strong crossover appeal to the rock audience with its synchronous bass and guitar lines and topical astrology reference. \\"Born Under a Bad Sign\\" became an R&B; chart hit for King, and numerous blues and other musicians have made it perhaps the most recorded Albert King song. Original song The lyrics to \\"Born Under a Bad Sign\\" were written by Stax Records rhythm and blues singer William Bell with music by Stax bandleader Booker T. Jones (of Booker T. & the M.G.'s). Bell recalled, \\"We needed a blues song for Albert King ... I had this idea in the back of my mind that I was gonna do myself. Astrology and all that stuff was pretty big then. I got this idea that [it] might work.\\" The lyrics describe \\"hard luck and trouble\\" tempered by \\"wine and women\\", with wordplay in the chorus in the turnaround: Similar lyrics are found in Lightnin' Slim's 1954 swamp blues song \\"Bad Luck Blues\\":Numerous blues songs share this title, but with different lyrics. Jones's arrangement for the song does not follow the typical twelve-bar blues I-IV-V progression. Rather, it is dominated by an R&B-style; bass/rhythm guitar line, which Bell claimed that he came up with \\"while fooling around on the guitar\\". Albert King provided his signature guitar fills around his vocals and solos during the break and outro, with backing by Booker T. & the M.G.'s and the Memphis Horns. \\"Born Under a Bad Sign\\" became a Billboard R&B; chart hit for King, reaching number 49. It was later included on his first album for Stax, also titled Born Under a Bad Sign. The album's cover depicts images of \\"bad luck signs\\" or common superstitions, including a black cat, a Friday the 13th calendar page, skull and crossbones, ace of spades, and snake eyes. Subsequently, the song has appeared on numerous King and various artist collections. Albert King recorded an updated version of \\"Born Under a Bad Sign\\" with producer Allen Toussaint for his 1978 New Orleans Heat album. Live versions are included on Wednesday Night in San Francisco, Chicago 1978, In Session with Stevie Ray Vaughan, The Godfather of the Blues: His Last European Tour 1992, and Talkin' Blues (see Albert King discography for album details). Cream version British rock group Cream recorded \\"Born Under a Bad Sign\\" for their third album, Wheels of Fire (1968). The group's record company, which also distributed Stax records, requested that they record it, according to guitarist Eric Clapton. Cream's rendition follows Albert King's, except for bassist and singer Jack Bruce combining two verses into \\"I've been down ever since I was ten\\" and an extended guitar solo by Clapton. Musicologist Robert Palmer described Clapton's playing as \\"practically Albert King parodies\\". Cream recorded a live version for the BBC October 24, 1967, which was released on BBC Sessions in 2003. Another live version was recorded during their reunion performances in 2005 and included on Royal Albert Hall London May 2-3-5-6, 2005. Recognition and influence In 1988, Albert King's \\"Born Under a Bad Sign\\" was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame. Writing for the Foundation, Jim O'Neal called it \\"one of the signature hits of Albert King that started to win the left-handed string-bender a crossover following in 1967, as he began to break out of the chittlin circuit to invade rock venues like the Fillmore\\". King's song is also included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's list of the \\"500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\\". It has also been recorded by many artists in a variety of styles.

He is best known for his ingenious mechanical innovations and specifically for his claim that he had invented a machine that could be used to communicate with the dead via the transference of image. As this machine no longer exists, and no patent ever filed, its existence is still debated amongst folklorists, spiritualists, and scholars.  Early life  Hopewell was born in 1831, and beyond that date most information regarding his early life is speculative at best. Some scholars, notably Arthur McCallister, describe him as a lonely child without siblings; others believe him to have been the eldest of as many as seven brothers and sisters.Arthur McCallister Myth and Invention: Fantastical Inventions of the Nineteenth Century (New York: Maritime Press, 1994). It is however certain that by 1850 he was the only remaining Hopewell child. The profession of his father prior to the 1840s is unknown. However, based on several letters and daguerreotypes it is relatively certain that his father, Richard D. Hopewell, was excited by the prospect of photography‚Äîso much so that he became a traveling photographer who circulated primarily through New York and New Jersey taking portraits in the towns he visited. While Jacob Hopewell's adolescence is shrouded in uncertainty, it can be sure that he attended the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London. It was there that he saw Frederick Bakewell's demonstration of the facsimile machine (an early precursor to the modern fax machine). In a letter dated November 15, 1851, Hopewell writes to his fianc√©, Margaret Beecher, about some of what he saw at the exhibition: > Of all the wonders I have seen, not the least is Mr. Bakewell's facsimile > machine. I find myself marveling at the ingenuity required to harness the > powers of clockwork so as to recreate something without need of the hand of > man.Violet Hopewell, ed. The Words of Our Fathers, Collected Writings of the > Hopewell Family: 1849-1942 (New York: Maritime Press, 1993) This fragment is all that is known of Hopewell's impressions of the device. The following year, Hopewell married Margaret Beecher and in 1853 they had their first child, a boy named Richard. It is certain they had other children, among them a daughter named Margaret, often referred to as Maggie. None of these others lived to adulthood and thus information is rather hazy. It can be assumed that by the birth of Richard, the Hopewells had established themselves in the Catskill region of New York State. Jacob did a variety of work in and around his local community. He repaired clocks, watches and even early cameras.  The Hopewell Machine  The American Civil War officially broke out in 1861. It seems Hopewell was content to tinker at his home and remain separate from the war effort. That year, Margaret died in childbirth. The baby, named Margaret after its deceased mother, lived. It is thought by some that the trauma of this event is what caused him to withdraw from the world and reacquaint himself with the facsimile machine; this claim is supported by the hiring of a young local girl, also named Margaret, to care for Maggie. In 1863 Richard married Margaret before going off to enlist. At this time Jacob became obsessed with finding a way to show his dead wife a picture of their baby girl. McCallister cites a journal entry of Richard's in support of this claim: > I was much saddened by my father's absence at my recent wedding to Margaret. > His body was there to be sure but his mind elsewhere, no doubt considering > alterations for his facsimile device. The only endeavor he can bear to sit > with for more than an instant. This is the last document known to have been written in Richard's own hand, as he died in battle soon after. It is clear from a very involved correspondence between Margaret and her mother that any final traces of the man that was Jacob disappeared completely after the death of his son. He was totally and completely obsessed with modifying a facsimile machine so as to be able to send images of his daughter Maggie and grandson, Richard‚Äîborn the day his father was killed in battle‚Äîto the dead Margaret and Richard. No one knows exactly what Jacob Hopewell's device looked like. In fact, its material reality is still widely contested by a number of scholars today (a theory first proposed by Michael Winterbarton in 1996).Michael Winterbarton, The Hopewells of the Hudson (Boston: Independence Press, 1996). Whether physically real or not, the idea of the machine consumed Jacob until the day he died.  Death  Like most of his life, the events of Jacob's death are widely contested. Lightning struck the barn he had been working in (this is recorded as fact by multiple neighbors). As a direct result, the barn burned to the ground leaving only rubble. The more romantic Hopewell scholars believe the heartbreak of seeing his life's work burn to the ground killed him. Some say he was in the barn when it was struck (the former group believe he was outside relieving himself due to a mild bladder infection). There are still others who believe he ran away and died 5 years later unknown and penniless in a Massachusetts shipping town. There is some conjecture that Hopewell committed suicide that night; he realized that only the charge of a blast of lightning could make his machine work and used his expertise to summon it with a special lightning rod (which he is known to have invented but never patented). These scholars say he knew the lightning was coming, knew it would make the machine work and knew a fire would probably ensue and kill him.  Hopewell's \\"Relic\\"  In December 1943 Jacob Hopewell III was up in his attic packing away some of his son's belongings, Richard Hopewell IV, who had recently died of an infected battle wound. According to Jacob III, as he was finding a place for his son's belongings he knocked over an old chest that held all the personal documents of Jacob Hopewell. It is from these documents that all known information about Hopewell stems. According to Jacob III he found not only photographs and documents, but a small, charred wooden mechanism enclosed in an envelope with a note from Margaret Hopewell (Richard Hopewell I's wife). This note explained that it was the only salvaged piece of Jacob Hopewell's device that could be found. The Hopewell family was the subject of much mockery regarding Jacob I's contraption. In a moment of despair, Jacob III brought the remaining piece of the machine downstairs and placed it in a birdhouse (Jacob III was a noted birdhouse builder although some claimed they were actually houses for his family spirits). For the next year (until he died) Jacob III placed a photograph from every family function he could find, probably in hopes that somehow the power of the machine would exist in the remaining object and that his dead son would be able to see all he had missed. This practice was met with further ridicule within the larger community. However, years later, when the birdhouse was rediscovered, photographs from multiple families were found inside, implying that others in the community, made desperate by the loss of their loved ones, were willing to suspend disbelief in the hope of being able to communicate with the dead. In a letter written just before his death, Jacob III stated explicitly that: > Regardless of the belief of subsequent generations, on no account are any of > the images to be removed from the impromptu reliquary. For the device to > function they must remain together as a set in perpetuity. While no images > are to be removed under any circumstances, others should be allowed to add > to them, provided only that they believe in the powers of the > device.Hopewell, Words of Our Fathers. Due to the words of Jacob III, today when scholars write of Hopewell's relic they mean not only the small wooden component of the original mechanism, but also all of the accompanying photographs. Since 1945, the location of Hopewell's relic has remained unknown. Some reports of the relic's recent discovery in New York's Hudson Valley are currently under investigation.

The poem describes a local blacksmith and his daily life. The blacksmith serves as a role model who balances his job with the role he plays with his family and community. Years after its publication, a tree mentioned in the poem was cut down and part of it was made into an armchair which was then presented to Longfellow by local schoolchildren. Synopsis The poem is about a local blacksmith. Noted as being strong, he works by the sweat of his brow and does not owe anyone anything. Children coming home from school stop to stare at him as he works, impressed by the roaring bellows and burning sparks. On Sundays, the blacksmith, a single father after the death of his wife, takes his children to church, where his daughter sings in the village choir. He goes through his life following the daily tasks assigned to him and has earned his sleep at night. The narrator concludes by thanking the blacksmith for the lessons he can teach. Origins The title character of \\"The Village Blacksmith\\", third from the left, depicted in the Longfellow Memorial by Daniel Chester French and Henry Bacon, Cambridge, Massachusetts Longfellow said the poem was a tribute to his ancestor Stephen Longfellow, who had been a blacksmith, a schoolmaster, then a town clerk.Nelson, Randy F. The Almanac of American Letters. Los Altos, California: William Kaufmann, Inc., 1981: 226. In 1745, this ancestor was the first Longfellow to make his way to Portland, Maine, the town where the poet would be born.Hawthorne, Hildegarde. The Poet of Craigie House: The Story of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. New York: D. Appleton-Century Company, 1936: 130. The poem was written early in Longfellow's poetic career, around the same time he published his first collection, Voices of the Night, in 1839. The book included his poem A Psalm of Life. On October 5, 1839, he recorded in his journal: \\"Wrote a new Psalm of Life. It is 'The Village Blacksmith.'\\" It would be another year before the poem was published, however. Longfellow wrote to his father on October 25, 1840: \\"There will be a kind of Ballad on a Blacksmith in the next Knickerbocker, which you may consider, if you please, as a song in praise of your ancestors at Newbury.\\"Hilen, Andrew (editor). The Letters of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1967: vol. II, p. 259. The actual village blacksmith in the poem, however, was a Cambridge resident named Dexter Pratt, a neighbor of Longfellow's. Pratt's house is still standing at 54 Brattle Street in Cambridge.Wilson, Susan. Literary Trail of Greater Boston. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2000: 105. Several other blacksmiths have been posited as inspirations for the character in the poem, including \\"The Learned Blacksmith\\" Elihu Burritt, to whom Longfellow once offered a scholarship to attend Harvard College.Della Valle, Paul. Massachusetts Troublemakers: Rebels, Reformers, and Radicals from the Bay State. Guilford, CT: Globe Pequot Press, 2009: 140. Several people, both in the United States and in England, took credit for inspiring the poem with varying amounts of evidence. The Longfellow family became annoyed with the preponderance of claims. In 1922, the poet's son Ernest Wadsworth Longfellow responded to these people in his book Random Memories. In a section called \\"Quips and Cranks\\", he wrote: Publication and response Chair made from the chestnut tree in the poem, presented to Longfellow in 1879 \\"The Village Blacksmith\\" was first published in the November 1840 issue of The Knickerbocker.Gale, Robert L. A Henry Wadsworth Longfellow Companion. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2003: 278. It was soon after printed as part of Longfellow's poetry collection Ballads and Other Poems in 1841.Williams, Cecil B. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. New York: Twayne Publishers, Inc., 1964: 78. The collection, which also included \\"The Wreck of the Hesperus\\", was instantly popular.Calhoun, Charles C. Longfellow: A Rediscovered Life. Boston: Beacon Press, 2004: 138. . In 1879, years after the publication of \\"The Village Blacksmith\\", the local schoolchildren in Cambridge, Massachusetts presented Longfellow with an armchair made from \\"the spreading chestnut tree\\" in the poem which had recently been cut down.Williams, Cecil B. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. New York: Twayne Publishers, Inc., 1964: 100. Under the cushion of the chair is a brass plate on which is inscribed, in part: \\"This chair made from the wood of the spreading chestnut-tree is presented as an expression of his grateful regard and veneration by the children of Cambridge\\".Harberts, Ethel F. Footprints of Henry W. Longfellow: A Travel Guide to America's Favorite Poet. St. Cloud, Minnesota: North Star Press, 1993: 78. From then on, Longfellow made it a rule to allow schoolchildren to be admitted into his study to see the chair.Sullivan, Wilson. New England Men of Letters. New York: The Macmillan Company, 1972: 198. . He also composed a poem to commemorate his gift called \\"From my Arm-Chair\\". The site on Brattle Street in Cambridge where the tree once stood is now designated with a stone marker.Wagenknecht, Edward. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow: Portrait of an American Humanist. New York: Oxford University Press, 1966: 109. Analysis \\"The Village Blacksmith\\" is written in six line stanzas alternating between iambic tetrameter and trimeter with a regularity of cadence and rhyme that mimics the stability invoked in the poem's narrative.Pennell, Melissa McFarland. Masterpieces of American Romantic Literature. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2006: 68. The title character of the poem is presented as an \\"everyman\\" and a role model: he balances his commitments to work, the community, and his family.Schwehn, Mark R. and Dorothy C. Bass. Leading Lives That Matter: What We Should Do and Who We Should Be. Grand Rapids, Michigan: William B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2000: 281. . The character is presented as an iconic tradesman who is embedded in the history of the town and its defining institutions because he is a longtime resident with deeply rooted strength, as symbolized by the \\"spreading chestnut tree\\".Laurie, Bruce. Beyond Garrison: Antislavery and Social Reform. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2005: 175. Longfellow uses the poem to glorify and celebrate a humble, plain person, much as John Greenleaf Whittier does in his poem \\"The Barefoot Boy\\".Curti, Merle. The Growth of the American Thought (sixth edition). Transaction Publishers, 2004: 296. Further, Simon Bronner notes that, like Nathaniel Hawthorne's woodcarver character in \\"Drowne's Wooden Image\\", Longfellow is praising the craftsman in a time of industrialization.Bronner, Simon J. Explaining Traditions: Folk Behavior in Modern Culture. University of Kentucky Press, 2011: 138‚Äì139. Adaptations and influences The poem, along with several others by Longfellow, was translated into Spanish by Colombian poet Rafael Pombo.Jaksiƒá, Iv√°n. The Hispanic World and American Intellectual Life, 1820-1880. Palgrave Macmillan, 2012: 107. In several interviews, baseball player and manager Billy Southworth noted that his father recited the poem to him as a child, that he himself memorized it, and that it inspired him as an adult.Skipper, John C. Billy Southworth: A Biography of the Hall of Fame Manager and Ballplayer. Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Company, 2013: 90. Several quotes from the poem were used in Buster Keaton's 1922 silent comedy The Blacksmith (1922). In 1926, a comical song called \\"The Village Blacksmith Owns the Village Now\\" was published with words by Leslie Moore and music by Johnny Tucker. The lyrics detailed how the blacksmith grew rich with the rise of the automobile by converting his shop into a service station. The song was recorded by popular U.S. comedians and bandleaders of the era including the Happiness Boys and Harry Reser. In 1938, songwriters Tommie Connor, Jimmy Kennedy, and Hamilton Kennedy created a comical song and dance routine inspired by the poem; Glenn Miller's recording of the song was featured in the 1990 film Memphis Belle.Kennedy, J. J. The Man Who Wrote the Teddy Bears' Picnic. AuthorHouse, 2011: 134‚Äì137. Daffy Duck recites a portion of the poem in the 1953 cartoon Duck Amuck. The first bandmaster of the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, R. T. Stevens, suggested the adoption of the song version of \\"The Village Blacksmith\\" as the Corps' march of the RAOC in 1922. He argued that the melody had a marching lilt, the theme was appropriate, and that many regimental marches were based on airs. Accordingly \\"The Village Blacksmith\\" became the RAOC Regimental March. The Royal New Zealand Army Ordnance Corps adopted the same march.

The term, Tradespace, is a combination of the words ‚Äútrade-off‚Äù and ‚Äúplayspace‚Äù, where ‚Äútrade-off‚Äù indicates the method of traversing the Tradespace in search of the optimal boundary space (e.g., trading off a cost in one cost center (variant A) for a cost in another cost center (variant B)). Tradespace analysis is used in this context by NASA, DARPA and MIT for analyzing the complex resource, costs and provisioning involved in large projects with multiple stakeholders and multiple objectives. #As a collection of processes spanning multiple organizations. ‚ÄúTradespace‚Äù in this context is used to distinguish the difference between intra-corporate process management and inter-corporate process management (although it may include (not exclusively) intra-corporate, inter-departmental processes). This type of Tradespace shares business processes and human resources across the system resulting in a collection of business processes spanning corporate or departmental boundaries. The term Tradespace was first applied in this context in 2003 by QBOS, Inc. as a way of signifying the relevance of the term in its above context to the search for equilibria (the Pareto frontier) in a collection of processes spanning multiple organizations where those organizations each have their own seven- sigma core objectives. The relevance of the term as a collection of inter- corporate processes to its meaning as a multi-variant interdependent playspace becomes very apparent when observing organizations working together in a Tradespace via processes put in place between the organizations. Their at- first-glance independent objectives take on an interdependency similar to the multi-variant models in the mathematical use of the term. Thus, the very act of creating inter-corporate processes creates an interdependency that must be explored and managed in order to reach an equilibrium state that is stable, resilient and maximizes opportunity and ROI for the participant organizations (see Tradespace Management System). Multiple Tradespaces of this type may aggregate to form larger Tradespaces of this type. #In a financial sense as an environment for supporting inter-corporate financial exchange transactions. This form of the term was instantiated by NextSet Software, Inc. in 2000. Multiple Tradespaces of context type 2 or 3, above, may aggregate to form larger Tradespaces of the same type. Merging Tradespaces of both types (2 and 3) results in an eco-system. Distinctions between Tradespaces and eco-systems include: #Tradespaces can give rise to strong eco-systems but not the other way around and #By focusing on either the analysis of inter-corporate processes (context 2 above) or the analysis of inter-corporate funds exchange (context 3 above), Tradespaces form natural boundary interfaces matching the cash flow / provisioning interface and thus protect against the anomalies that can arise in a poorly designed cash-flow/provisioning interface. Eco-systems that are not designed on a Tradespace foundation model first, run the risk of dissolution due to anomalies created by the cash flow / provisioning interface.

Built in 1857 to a design by Gridley J.F. Bryant, it was the college's first academic building following the move of the Maine State Seminary (as it was then known) from Parsonsfield to Lewiston. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. Description Hathorn Hall is centrally located on the Bates College Campus, which is located northeast of Lewiston's commercial downtown area. The hall is a rectangular brick building, three stories in height, with a hip roof capped by a cupola housing an open belfry. Low pedimented gables rise from the short ends of the roof. The gables and the roof's cornice are studded with modillions. Its main entrance, set on one of the short ends, is sheltered by a rectangular flat-roof portico, which has fluted Corinthian columns supporting a full entablature with cornice. History Hathorn Hall and Parker Halls were completed in 1857 by Gridley J.F. Bryant as the first buildings on the Bates campus, then called the Maine State Seminary. Bryant also completed the main building on the Tufts University campus in 1852. The building was named after Seth Hathorn and Mary Hathorn of Woolwich, Maine who donated funds for the construction of the building. Jonathan Davis donated the bell in Hathorn's bell tower. Nineteenth century \\"ivy stones\\" from early classes at the college are embedded in the brick along the exterior of the building. Hathorn Hall's interior has changed several times since its original construction. A fire started in the bell tower of Hathorn Hall in 1881 which severely damaged much of the interior of the building, and the interior was again renovated in 1898, 1960‚Äì62, and 1984 (with $180,000 from the Pew Foundation).

When the Nazis take over, the Bergers organize a student visa for Ruth to be sent ahead to England, not realizing that she will not be allowed to leave Austria because of her political leanings as a Social Democrat. When her father is suddenly arrested by the Gestapo, he is told to leave Austria within a week and while his family is able to escape to London, Ruth on a separate transport is stopped on the border by the SS and sent back to Vienna. Quinton Somerville, an English professor and scientist who worked with Professor Berger in the past, arrives in Vienna for an award ceremony and learns that Professor Berger has been dismissed. Trying to contact the family, he visits Bergers' home and discovers Ruth, who is desperate to find a way to escape to England. Several attempts to get a valid visa for Ruth fail and Quin realizes that the only way to get her out of the country quickly is through a marriage of convenience. The marriage has to stay a secret until Ruth receives British citizenship, but once safe in London, the annulment of the marriage takes much longer than expected. Ruth and her family try to re-establish their life in the world of refugees, using their humour to keep the terror and desolation at bay. When the university that Ruth is set to attend is forced to transfer her, the Quakers enrol her into Quinton's University. She ends up being lectured by her own husband by coincidence, alongside the snobbish and clever Verena Plackett, who has ambitiously set her sights on Quinton. Unaware of Ruth's marriage of convenience, her real fiance Heini, a talented pianist from Budapest, escapes to England, and the unfolding events put Ruth and Quinton's secret marriage of convenience on the verge of being discovered and betrayed. Desperately trying to cling to their moral values, Ruth and Quin deny their growing attraction for each other - then World War II breaks out and personal intentions become insignificant.

The two-story brick building was one of several built in 1866 by the Androscoggin Mill Company to provide housing for workers with families, and is one of only three such 19th-century buildings to survive in the city. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. Description and history The Androscoggin Mill Block is set at the southern edge of Lewiston's downtown area, and about two blocks east of the canal from which the city's 19th- century mills drew their power. It is one of three nearly-identical buildings on the west side of Park Street, north of its junction with Maple Street. It is a two-story brick building, with a low hip roof and a granite foundation. Its main facade is four bays wide, and is symmetrically arranged, with two doorways in the center bays on the first floor, and sash windows in the other bays. The windows have granite lintels and sills, and the cornice is studded with Italianate brackets. The sides of the building have six bays of windows on each level. The interior of the building as built housed four units, two on each floor. Much of the original woodwork from the building's construction has been preserved, despite a variety of uses and the addition of indoor plumbing to the building. Due to rapid growth beginning in the 1850s, all of the major operators of mills in Lewiston began to build housing for their workers. Most of these facilities were little more than boarding houses, with single rooms and communal dining rooms. Of 44 known to have been built between 1852 and 1866, only five were found to be still standing by a c. 2000 survey. Two of those, built by the Continental Mill Company, were boarding houses that have since been converted to more conventional residential use. This building is one of the three surviving buildings built specifically to house worker families. They were built for the Androscoggin Mill Company by a prolific local master builder, Thomas Dresser Thorne. This building was sold by the company into private hands, and was owned by the city at the time of its listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.

Architecture and history The Trinity Episcopal Church building stands at the southwest corner of Spruce and Bates Streets in downtown Lewiston, just south of Kennedy Park. It is a single-story stone structure laid out in a cruciform plan, with granite walls and a slate roof. A square tower with a belfry and hipped spire rises at the center of the cross, and a secondary gabled entrance vestibule projects north from the rear of the nave. Windows are generally narrow lancet-arched Gothic windows, with circular rose windows in some of the larger gables. The Trinity Church parish was organized in 1854, and built its first dedicate sanctuary at Ash and Park Streets in 1859. After outgrowing that space, the parish built this church, on land donated by the Franklin Company. Construction took three years, and the building was consecrated in 1882. The church continues to be an anchor in the neighborhood. In 2001, it organized the Trinity Jubilee Center, which is a daily soup kitchen and social service agency. The Jubilee Center, now an independent non-profit, is still located in the church building. The parish was also instrumental in the creation of Tree Street Youth and the reopening of the Center for Wisdom's Women. Trinity hosts small concerts and provides bereavement support and memorial services for anyone without a church home, at no charge.

A low balustrade demarcates the pulpit, which has a stenciled backdrop. The walls are wainscoted, and the ceiling is made of boxed beams and wood sheathing. Foliated stencilwork lines the sheathing, while the beams have a multicolored stencilwork pattern on their bottoms. The angled portions of the ceiling are also decorated with foliate stencils. Windows on the building sides have colored sections, and the buildings sole interior light source is a kerosene chandelier. The Free Will Baptist congregation in Auburn dates to 1808, and had grown by the late 1820s to a size sufficient to warrant construction of a church. This building was erected in 1833, although its initial interior features are not known, many records having been destroyed by a fire. As a result, it is also not known exactly when the interior decorations were made, which are stylistically from the Queen Anne period. The church's congregation had declined in the 1880s to the point where services were held only sporadically, and came to an end around the turn of the 20th century. The building was briefly used by another congregation in the 1950s, and was rescued from demolition by local citizens who formed a non-profit to oversee its preservation. Services are now held annually, and the building is well maintained.

Constructed in the United Kingdom, the ship entered service in 1896 and was significantly damaged at the Second Battle of San Juan in 1898. In 1920, the destroyer was converted to a minelayer and discarded in 1924. Technical characteristics Terror was built in the United Kingdom by Thomson, (which would rename itself Clydebank Engineering & Shipbuilding Co. the following year). Her keel was laid on 9 February 1896, she was launched on 28 August 1896, and she was completed on 20 November 1896. She had three funnels. In the parlance of the day, she was a \\"torpedo boat destroyer\\", designed to protect larger ships against torpedo boat attack, but also carrying torpedoes with which to attack larger ships herself. Operational history An unidentified Spanish destroyer ‚Äì either Terror, , or ‚Äì with Cervera's squadron at S√£o Vicente sometime between 14 April 1898 and 29 April 1898. As tensions between Spain and the United States grew in early 1898, Terror was part of the Spanish Navy's 1st Squadron, commanded by Vice Admiral Pascual Cervera y Topete. The squadron was ordered to concentrate at S√£o Vicente in Portugal's Cape Verde Islands. Accordingly, Terror, in company with Cervera's flagship, armored cruiser , armored cruiser , and destroyers and , departed Cadiz on 8 April 1898 and arrived at S√£o Vicente on 14 April 1898. The ships had experienced mechanical problems and burned an excessive amount of coal during the voyage. Soon, the squadron was reinforced by two more armored cruisers, and . The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War began while Terror was at S√£o Vicente. Ordered by neutral Portugal in accordance with international law to leave S√£o Vicente within 24 hours of the declaration of war, Terror and the rest of Cervera's squadron departed on 29 April 1898, bound for San Juan, Puerto Rico. Because of continuing engine trouble and low coal supplies, Terror and her fellow destroyers were towed part of the way. Cervera's ships reached French-owned Martinique in the Lesser Antilles on 10 May 1898. While the other ships loitered in international waters, Furor and Terror went into Fort-de-France to ask for coal. France was neutral and would not supply coal. Moreover, the American auxiliary cruiser had just left port, and French officials announced that in accordance with international law and France's neutrality, the destroyers, as belligerents, could not leave port until 48 hours after Harvard had left, i.e., on 13 May 1898. Terror had become immobilized with engine problems, so the destroyer flotilla commander, Captain Fernando Villaamil, took Furor out in the harbor on 12 May 1898 under the ruse of testing her engines, then successfully made a dash out into international waters 24 hours early. Cervera's squadron steamed on, leaving Terror behind. Terror soon got her engines running and was released by the French authorities. She made for San Juan, Puerto Rico, arriving there on 17 May 1898. These are the tombstones of the two men who died when Terror was torpedoed. Little happened for a month, until the United States Navy established a permanent blockade of San Juan on 18 June 1898. On 22 June 1898, the , gunboat , and Terror came out of port to test the blockade, resulting in the Second Battle of San Juan. The auxiliary cruiser moved in, resulting in a short, running gun battle, from which the Spanish quickly broke away. Isabel II and General Concha could go no faster than ; in order to cover their retreat, Terror began a torpedo run on St. Paul, which opened fire at . She hit Terror repeatedly, killing two men (the only casualties either side suffered in the action) and putting a hole in the destroyer's side. Severely damaged, Terror retreated and had to be beached. Terror spent the rest of the war under repair at San Juan. Repairs were completed on 14 September 1898, a month after the war ended, and she returned to Spain. Around 1920, Terror was equipped for minelaying. She was scrapped in 1924.

Based on the upscale Starfire model, the Olds 88's B-bodied Jetstar I lacked many of the Starfire's standard luxuries but shared its powerful engine, roofline and seating arrangement. Positioned to compete with Pontiac's successful full-sized Grand Prix, it was only offered as a two-door hardtop. 1964 1964 Oldsmobile Jetstar I The Jetstar I was initially designed as both a lower-priced companion to the more luxurious Starfire, which had a starting price of over $4,100, and a direct competitor to the successful Pontiac Grand Prix, which sold in the Jetstar I's $3,500-$3,600 price range. Offered only as two-door hardtop coupe, the Jetstar I shared the Starfire's squared-off roofline, with concave rear window, which differed from the convertible-inspired rooflines featured on other Olds 88 two-door hardtop coupes. Standard equipment included the Starfire's 345 hp (257 kW) 394 cubic-inch Rocket V8 engine, but lacked its automatic transmission, power steering, power brakes, leather interior, and distinctive brightwork trim. Included were bucket seats, center console, carpeting, full wheel covers, and padded instrument panel. A three-speed column-shift manual transmission was standard, with a three-speed Roto Hydra-matic automatic with console-mounted T-handle shifter optional. Adding just automatic transmission, power steering, and power brakes brought the Jetstar I's price close to $4,000. A total of 16,084 were produced for 1964, slightly below Starfire output but barely one-quarter of the 63,000 Grand Prix built by Pontiac. 1965 1965 Oldsmobile Jetstar I in Saffron Yellow. The Jetstar I, like all other full-size Oldsmobiles, was completely restyled for 1965 with bodylines receiving a more rounded rendition of the '64's squared-off roofline again shared with Starfire (other 88-series two-door coupes got semi-fastback rooflines). Also new for 1965 was the engine and automatic transmission. Replacing the 394 cubic-inch Rocket V8 was the new 425 cubic-inch engine, with the top of the line Starfire version having a four-barrel carburetor, dual exhaust, and a 10.5:1 compression ratio and was rated at ‚Äî the most powerful Olds engine in 1965. The 425, which shared many components with the smaller 330 cubic-inch V8 introduced for Olds' intermediate-sized Cutlass the previous year, was lighter in weight than the previous 394 despite the increase in displacement and included bigger valves and improved cooling capabilities. Also new was the three-speed Turbo Hydramatic transmission, which was considered a vast improvement over the previous three-speed Roto Hydra-matic, whose basic design dated back to the original Hydra-matic introduced in 1940. Another new transmission offering for the Jetstar I along with the other full- sized Oldsmobiles (except the Ninety-Eight) for 1965 was the Muncie four-speed manual, which turned out to be a seldom-ordered option. Oldsmobile boasted in a 1965 press release that ‚Äúa Jetstar I proved to be the top accelerator of the entire event‚Äù at the 1965 Pure Oil Performance Trials in Daytona Beach. Those trials were sanctioned and supervised by NASCAR. The Starfire V8 was the largest and most powerful V8 in Oldsmobile's market segment in 1965. Buick could only muster from its largest V8 (similar in cubic inches to the Olds engine but of a much older design) even with dual four-barrel carburetors, Chrysler topped out at 413 cubic inches and and Mercury made do with a 390 cubic-inch V8 of as much as , excepting the very few Merc buyers willing to shell out an astronomical cost of $700 for an exotic 427 cubic-inch V8 with dual four-barrel carbs and - which was not really designed for everyday driving and not available with some of the most popular options in this price class such as automatic transmission and air conditioning. Trimmed down 65 pounds to and equipped with the new 370 hp (276 kW)/ 470 lb¬∑ft (637 N¬∑m) of torque 425ci Starfire engine, turned the ‚Äô65 model into an overlooked performance car. The equivalent power was only available in a Grand Prix or other full-size Pontiac via the top-of-the-line 376 hp (276 kW) 421ci HO Tri- Power engine, an expensive $375.77 option. Although the Jetstar I was priced similar to the Grand Prix, unless one bought the basic model there was little incentive for an Oldsmobile buyer to purchase a one over the Starfire. Adding power steering ($107), power brakes ($43), and automatic transmission ($242.10) - all standard on the Starfire - brought the Jetstar I's $3602 base price within $150 of the $4,148 Starfire, without its genuine leather interior and distinctive exterior trim. On the other hand, the performance-minded could elect the comparatively plain Jetstar I and its faux air extractors behind the front wheels. Often confused with its lesser brethren, the low-priced Jetstar 88 series, the Jetstar I concluded its two-year run with only 6,552 sold in 1965. The introduction of the mid-sized muscle cars (including the 389 V8-powered Pontiac GTO and similar Oldsmobile 4-4-2, which started with a 330 cubic-inch V8 in 1964 but switched to a larger 400 inch engine in 1965) and specter of the front-drive Toronado taking over the flagship status from the Starfire loomed big in Oldsmobile's future were too much to overcome. The Jetstar I's direct replacement for the 1966 model year was a lower-priced Starfire hardtop coupe (convertible dropped for this year), with a base price in the same range as the Jetstar I. Leather interior was replaced by Morroceen vinyl and several hundred dollars worth of formerly-standard equipment became optional, including Turbo Hydra-matic transmission, power steering and power brakes. This lower-priced '66 Starfire sold in bigger numbers than the '65 Jetstar I, but that nameplate/series was dropped after the 1966 model year. It would return in 1975 on a badge-engineered subcompact Chevrolet Monza. Confusion with the Jetstar 88 series Between 1964 and 1966, Oldsmobile named its least expensive full size model the Jetstar 88 (priced $500‚Äì$600 below the Jetstar 1), but that car was not related to the Jetstar I. The Jetstar 88 was basically a B-body with A-body running gear, which gave the 88 line the most inexpensive model. The Jetstar 88 also offered a full range of bodystyles including the four-door Town (pillared) and Holiday (hardtop) sedans, Holiday hardtop coupe and even a convertible (1964-1965 only) - all featuring cloth/vinyl bench seat interiors shared with the step-up Dynamic 88 series. The Jetstar 88 was powered by the same 330 cubic-inch Rocket V8 with 11.5 to 1 compression (ultra-high) found in the intermediate F-85/Cutlass models instead of the 394 or 425 found in all other Olds 88-series models. Furthermore, the Jetstar 88 also shared the intermediate-sized car's two-speed Jetaway automatic transmission and smaller diameter brake drums. Although the Jetstar 88 was a respectable seller during its three-year run, it was outsold by a wide margin by the Dynamic 88, which cost only a few dollars more than the Jetstar 88, but was also considered a better value by many Olds buyers due to a larger standard engine, three-speed automatic transmission, and larger brake drums.

At the time of his death at the age of 22, Ling Ling was the only giant panda at the Ueno Zoo and the oldest panda in Japan. He served as an important symbol of the Ueno Zoo and of friendship between Japan and China. Ling Ling, who was given to Japan in 1992, was the only giant panda in the country who was directly owned by Japan. There are eight other giant pandas in Japan as of April 2008, but they are all on loan to Japan from China. Despite being a male panda, Ling Ling's name meant \\"darling little girl\\" in Chinese. Early years and life at the zoo Ling Ling was born at the Beijing Zoo in Beijing, China, on September 5, 1985. He was given to Japan and the Ueno Zoo in November 1992 by China in exchange for a panda which had been born in Japan. The 1992 panda exchange, between China and Japan, which is often called Panda diplomacy, took place to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the normalization of bilateral Sino-Japanese relations in 1972. He remained one of the Ueno Zoo's most popular attractions for over 15 years. The Ueno Zoo paired Ling Ling with a female panda named Tong Tong. The two pandas became mates, but were unable to breed successfully and produced no offspring. Tong Tong died in 2000, leaving Ling Ling as the only giant panda at the Ueno Zoo. The zoo had tried unsuccessfully to breed Ling Ling with other pandas since 2001 using artificial insemination. Ling Ling was even sent out of Japan to Mexico three times in an attempt to mate him with other pandas. Death Ling Ling's health began to deteriorate in August 2007 due to old age, with symptoms such as loss of strength and appetite. He had been on medication since September 2007 for his ailments, which included heart and kidney problems. He was removed from public display at the zoo on April 29, 2008, at the beginning of the zoo's Golden Week holiday season. The zoo explained that Ling Ling would be removed from display in order to undergo intensive care treatments. Despite the treatments, Ling Ling died at the Ueno Zoo at approximately 2 A.M. on April 30, 2008, just one day after he was withdrawn from public exhibition. An necropsy found that he had died of heart failure. He was 22 years, seven months, and 5 days old, which is roughly equivalent to 70 years old for a human. According to the Ueno Zoo, Ling Ling was the oldest panda in Japan, as well as the fifth oldest known captive male panda in the world at the time of his death. Ling Ling's portrait and favorite food, bamboo shoots, were displayed in his cage following his death. Zoo visitors left bouquets of flowers and signed condolence registers. Legacy Ling Ling's exhibition plate at the Ueno Zoo (July 2007) Ling Ling's death left the Ueno Zoo without a resident giant panda for the first time in 36 years; since October 1972 when two pandas, Kang Kang and Lan Lan, were given to the zoo to mark the normalization of bilateral relations between Japan and China. The Ueno Zoo reportedly fears a drop in its number of visitors due to the loss of Ling Ling. Approximately 3.5 million people visit the Ueno Zoo each year, including about 40,000 people per day on holidays and weekends. However, many visitors came specifically to see Ling Ling and other panda related attractions. Without Ling Ling, or another giant panda to replace him, the zoo fears that it may be unable to maintain current visitor numbers without the pandas. The Ueno Zoo is reportedly consulting the Japanese Foreign Ministry about obtaining a new panda from China. Ling Ling was the only giant panda in Japan which was directly owned by the government or a Japanese institution. There are still eight other pandas located throughout Japan. However, each of these remaining eight pandas are currently on loan from China and are not Japanese owned. Six of the Chinese pandas are currently housed at Adventure World, which is located in Shirahama, Wakayama Prefecture, while two other pandas resident at the Kobe Municipal Oji Zoo in Kobe. Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda asked Chinese President Hu Jintao for two more pandas following Ling Ling's death. Ling Ling's death in April 2008 marked the second high profile death of an \\"elderly\\" captive panda in less than one month. On April 2, 2008, Taotao, the oldest giant panda in captivity in China, also died at the Jinan Zoo at the age of 36.

It serves 21 East Tennessee counties that span two time zones. Camp Buck Toms is a summer camp owned and operated by the Great Smoky Mountain Council. The camp is located outside Rockwood, Tennessee, on the shores of Watts Bar Lake. History The Great Smoky Mountain Council was founded as the Knoxville Council in August 1911. Upon official incorporation of the Knoxville Council, Dr. Charles H. Gordon, associate state geologist of the University of Tennessee, was elected its president. R.E. Mooney was treasurer, Miss Leah Fletcher, principal of the Rose Avenue school, was the secretary, and Prof. W.J. Barton, principal of Knoxville High School, was named the Scout Commissioner. The executive committee of the council was completed by; E.W. Ogden, Frank West, Frederick Bonham, Dr. A.S. Keim, and Rev. B.A. Williams.https://historyofscoutingeasttennessee.wordpress.com/2020/01/04/boy- scouting-appears-in-knoxville-tennessee-1909-1917/ By October 1911, six troops had been organized in various sections of the city comprising a total of about 100 scouts. Scoutmaster Solon Kipp organized a troop in the Mountain View school and community, as well as Troop No. 5 in Park City. A.R. Wilson was scoutmaster of Troop No. 1 in South Knoxville; Duncan White was scoutmaster of Troop No. 2 in East Knoxville; R.W. Tapp was scoutmaster of Troop No. 3 (probably at the YMCA) in the uptown district; W.T. Scott was scoutmaster of Troop No. 4 in North Knoxville; and Herbert Henegar was scoutmaster of Troop No. 6 in West Knoxville. By the end of November, Herbert Henegar could no longer continue as scoutmaster for his district, and Hugh F. VanDevented was appointed scoutmaster over West Knoxville.https://historyofscoutingeasttennessee.wordpress.com/2020/01/04/boy- scouting-appears-in-knoxville-tennessee-1909-1917/ An article in The Journal and Tribune reported on January 29, 1915, that the council was finally reorganized as the Knox County Council with a service area that officially covered all of Knox County. This new council was re-chartered under the leadership of: * David T. Blakely, president; * P.C. Mathis, secretary; * Dr. Charles H. Gordon, vice-president; * Frederick T. Bonham, treasurer; * W.C. Armistead, Deputy Scout Commissioner; and * William P. ‚ÄúBuck‚Äù Toms, Scout Commissioner The 1916 summer camp for the Knox County Council was held at Chilhowee Park and appeared to be very successful. It was named camp Ottosee, after the original name of the lake at the park. An article in the August 28, 1916 edition of The Journal and Tribune reported that the encampment was under the supervision of Commissioner Toms and scouts received instruction in swimming, first-aid, Scoutcraft, and camp hygiene. Troop No. 4 had the most scouts in attendance, and they won the field day competition on the last full day of camp.https://historyofscoutingeasttennessee.wordpress.com/2020/01/04/boy- scouting-appears-in-knoxville-tennessee-1909-1917/ In October 1916, a financial campaign was begun to develop funding for the hiring of a Scout Executive and the purchase of a permanent scout camp. The campaign was under the overall supervision of Special National Field Commissioner C.M. Abbott, and upon completion of a successful campaign, the Knox County Council was designated a first class council by BSA Headquarters. A total of over $10,000 was quickly raised and a scout headquarters was established in the Merchant‚Äôs National Bank building. In January 1917, Robert John Charles, director of the boys department of the Norfolk, Va. YMCA, was hired as the Scout Executive for the Knox County Council. He appeared to be well qualified and had even served as field scout commissioner while in Tampa, Florida. The Council included approximately 225 officially registered Boy Scouts, 10 scoutmasters, and 15 asst. scoutmasters in 10 troops at the time of his hiring.https://historyofscoutingeasttennessee.wordpress.com/2020/01/04/boy- scouting-appears-in-knoxville-tennessee-1909-1917/ In early May 1917, Executive Charles resigned his position with the Knox County Council to take a position with the YMCA in Tampa, Florida. Within a week after the departure of R.J. Charles, John Gore was appointed to the position of scout executive by the council‚Äôs executive board. He quickly assumed this new role on June 1st, and within a month, he organized Troop Nos. 15, 16, 17, and 18 in the city.https://historyofscoutingeasttennessee.wordpress.com/2020/01/04/boy- scouting-appears-in-knoxville-tennessee-1909-1917/ Knoxville scouts living up to their motto to ‚ÄúBe Prepared‚Äù, quickly put their training to the test when the steps of the Park City high school collapsed under the weight of over 1300 students (although a Nov. 19, 2016 article in The Journal and Tribune cite 1700 students). Scouting magazine (Vol. 3, Number 21 from Mar. 1, 1916) reported that several scouts from Troop Nos. 2, 4, and 5 were present and provided a quick and correct first-aid response to the injured. Their actions won praise locally from the Park City Schools Superintendent J.R. Lowry, as well as from BSA Headquarters in New York.https://historyofscoutingeasttennessee.wordpress.com/2020/01/04/boy- scouting-appears-in-knoxville-tennessee-1909-1917/ By June 1917, Council officials began seriously searching for property on which to establish the Council‚Äôs permanent scout camp. A classified add in the June 18, 1917 issue of The Journal and Tribune requested property containing 10-50 acres, on a body of water with good swimming facilities, and within 10-12 miles from Knoxville. Within a few years, the Council would purchase and develop a permanent camp near Powell, Tennessee.https://historyofscoutingeasttennessee.wordpress.com/2020/01/04/boy- scouting-appears-in-knoxville-tennessee-1909-1917/ The Cumberland Council was formed in Lenoir City in 1927 and a council of the same name was formed in LaFollette from 1921-1923. The Great Depression saw the consolidation of these councils into the Knoxville Area Council. The name was changed in 1943 to its current incarnation. In 1915, the Knox County Council's first summer camp was held at Camp Helpful, near Elkmont, in what is now the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Four years later, camp was held at a facility in Powell known as The Scout Ranch. In 1936, the Knoxville Council leased a patch of property on Norris Lake from the Tennessee Valley Authority. This soon became the Council summer camp, named Camp Pellissippi. 1938 saw Camp Pellissippi's first summer camp season; 75 Scouts attended with 600 in attendance the following year. Pellissppi Lodge 230 of the Order of the Arrow is named for the camp. In 1952 several Scout leaders including William Perry \\"Buck\\" Toms purchased a plot of property on the shores of Watts Bar Lake using proceeds from a Scout show. Three years later, the first summer camp was held at Buck Toms with 155 Scouts and leaders in attendance. The first campers arrived by boat, due to the lack of any road to the camp grounds. Electricity was implemented at the camp in 1957. In 1977, the dining hall at Camp Pellissippi was destroyed by fire. The summer camp was rendered defunct and although the council has retained the property as a campground for troops, it has not served as a summer camp since. This left Camp Buck Toms to serve as the sole summer camp of the Great Smoky Mountain Council. 1994 saw the renovation of Buck Toms with the addition of several buildings, including a dining hall that greatly increased the camp's capacity. Organization The council is divided into 11 districts:https://www.easttnscouts.org/about/districts/ *Catoosa District, consisting of Cumberland, Fentress, Pickett, and Roane Counties *Chehote District, consisting of central Knox County *Cherokee District, consisting of Cocke, Grainger, Hamblen, and Jefferson Counties *Cumberland District, consisting of Campbell, Claiborne, and Scott Counties *Echota District, consisting of northern Knox County and Union County *Pellissippi District, consisting of Anderson and Morgan Counties *Sequoyah District, consisting of southern Knox County and Sevier County *Toqua District consisting of western Knox county and parts of Loudon County. *Tuckaleechee District, consisting of Blount County and the Greenback section of Loudon County *Unaka District consisting of Meigs, McMinn, and Monroe Counties *STEM Scouts District - serving all 21 counties Pellissippi Lodge Pellissippi Lodge #230 is the Order of the Arrow lodge that serves the Great Smoky Mountain Council in East Tennessee.

The brick townhouse, built c. 1806, is notable as the home for many years of Charles Sumner (1811‚Äì1874), an outspoken and aggressive political opponent of slavery, whose beating on the floor of the United States Senate in 1856 was a defining moment of the pre-American Civil War period. The house was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1973. Description and history The Sumner is a four-story townhouse, faced in brick, which was built c. 1806. The interior has a typical side hall plan, with a front parlor, behind which are a sitting room and kitchen. Its upper floors have similar arrangements of rooms. The house was Charles Sumner's home for thirty years. Charles Sumner was born to abolitionist parents, and was educated at Harvard College, where he studied law under Joseph Story. Sumner became politically active in the fight against slavery in the 1840s, when he also gained a reputation as an orator. He helped found the abolitionist Free Soil Party in 1848, under whose banner he won election to the United States Senate in 1851. This marked the beginning of a more vocal and aggressive opposition to slavery in the political halls of Washington, D.C. His searing verbal reprobation of his opponents escalated into violence when he was beaten unconscious on the floor of the Senate by South Carolina Representative Preston Brooks in 1856, an event that emotionally polarized the country. After Sumner's recovery, he returned to the Senate, where he played a leading role as a Radical Republican during the American Civil War, as an advocate of emancipation. After the war he championed civil rights for free slaves during the Reconstruction Era, and played a role in the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson. The house was designated a National Historic Landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.

Following Chemical's acquisition of Chase Manhattan Bank in 1996, Chemical adopted the Chase name and Chemical Venture Partners changed its name to Chase Capital Partners. Similarly, following the 2000 acquisition of J.P. Morgan & Co. and the formation of JPMorgan Chase, the group changed its name yet again to JP Morgan Partners.

All season long he was competing with Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters superstar Yu Darvish for the Eiji Sawamura Award, the award for best pitcher in all of Japan. In 24 starts, Naruse was 16-1 with a 1.82 ERA, with 138 strikeouts and only 27 walks in 173 and 1/3 innings. Darvish, by comparison, was 15-5 in 26 starts, also compiling a 1.82 ERA, but not only did he throw more complete games than Naruse (12 for Darvish, 6 for Naruse), but Darvish also threw more innings (207 and 2/3), but he struck out more batters, with 210 punch-outs. The two ended up facing each other in the 2007 Pacific League Championship Series' deciding Game 5. Darvish triumphed over Naruse at Sapporo Dome, and the Fighters won Game 5 and the series 3-2, setting up a rematch of the 2006 Japan Series with the Chunichi Dragons. Naruse ultimately lost out to Darvish for the Sawamura Award in 2007. Since that season, he has remained solid, and was selected to the 2008 Japanese National Olympic baseball team, where he was one of the best players of what turned out to be a disappointing tournament for Team Japan, as the heavily favored Japanese failed to medal.

A couple of his stories appeared in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction. He also was a columnist in Chile at the Chilean journals ‚ÄúEl Mercurio‚Äù and ‚ÄúLa Tercera‚Äù, also at the Chilean magazines ‚ÄúErcilla‚Äù and ‚ÄúRevista Paula\\". Also he was the president of the cultural committee of the Instituto Chileno Norteamericano; co-founder of the Chilean SF Club and president of UFO Chile. Life and career Correa was born in the southern Chilean province of Talca in the town of Curepto. His writing career began in journalism, and from there branched out to include criticism, drama, and prose fiction. Although he has written realist works, he primarily works in science fiction, a genre he first became interested in after reading the works of Ray Bradbury, Clifford D. Simak, and Theodore Sturgeon. Correa has the distinction of being one of the first Latin American science fiction writers to be published in the United States. His story ‚ÄúThe Last Element‚Äù was published in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction in 1962 after receiving the support of Ray Bradbury. His story ‚ÄúAlter Ego‚Äù was also published in the same magazine in 1967, and it was later picked up by other publications. At that time, being published in the United States was the greatest sign of success for Latin American science fiction writers, and so his publications became very inspiring to his contemporary writers in the region. After the late 1980s he became less productive as writer, but remained active collaborator of the Chilean sf community, participating in round tables, giving interviews, attending book launches and judging at writing competitionsThe Encyclopedia of Science Fiction (2015), http://www.sf- encyclopedia.com/entry/correa_hugo until his death in 2008. Works His works are mostly about science fiction, finding text about extraterrestrials, flying vehicles, UFOs, unknown worlds, space exploration, authoritarianism and futuristic technology advanced at his times.

He is credited by his first editor with a renovellament (renewal) of Catalan poetry through the incorporation of Italian and French ideas into a model of courtly love taken from the classical troubadours. His last name is variously spelled Pr√≥xita, Pr√≥xida, and Progita in medieval orthography. Biography Gilabert was a member of an old Neapolitan family, the Procita (or Procida), favourites of the Hohenstaufen and then of Peter III of Aragon, who established them in Valencia. By the fourteenth century they were involved in a local conflict on the side of the Centelles against the Vilaragut. Gilabert was the fifth son of Nicolau de Pr√≥xita and Elvira de Centelles. With his older brothers Olf and Tom√†s he participated in the expedition to Sicily under Martin the Humane in 1392. In 1395 he and his brothers took part in John I's expedition to Sardinia and Sicily. On returning from military service abroad to Valencia in 1396 Gilabert became involved in the conflict between the Centelles and the Vilaragut and in May that year was sentenced, along with the factional leaders, to exile by the city council. On 11 November 1398 he and some other knights led a band of Centelles, including forty men-at-arms, in street fighting against Pere de Vilaragut. As a result, he was imprisoned again and did not regain his freedom until October 1399. On 4 December 1405, according to a document uncovered in the Arxiu Municipal de Val√®ncia (Municipal Archive of Valencia) by Llu√≠s Cerver√≥ i Gomis, Gilabert died in Genoa while in the service of Pope Benedict XIII. He left behind a widow, Bernarda de Valeriola, who remarried to Guillem Ramon de Centelles, and a daughter Joana. He was buried in the familial chapel of Sant Honorat in the convent of Sant Domingo de Val√®ncia. Poetry Gilabert was basically unknown until his poems were published in a modern edition by Mart√≠ de Riquer in Poesies (Els Nostres Cl√†ssics: Barcelona, 1954). Many of his poems are found only in the Can√ßoner Vega-Aguil√≥, which has suffered damage to do poor humidity, rendering much of his work illegible to the naked eye. Ultraviolet innovations have, however, permitted this difficulty to be overcome and now his poems have been copied in their entirety. The Vega-Aguil√≥ only records their author as \\"Pr√≥xita\\", but the library of the Escorial contains a sixteenth-century Occitan chansonnier with some works by \\"Moss√®n Gilabert de Pr√≥xita, poeta\\". =Prosody and language= Gilabert used a variety of meters: heptasyllabic, octosyllabic, and most of all decasyllabic. Some poems vary the metre but it is always intentional: Gilabert is second to none among his generation in the perfection of his metre, which appears to be influenced by the standards of the Consistori del Gay Saber in Toulouse. Though Gilabert wrote in literary Occitan, clearly inspired by and learned from the classical troubadours, his language is not devoid of Catalan influences, especially where the adopted idiom lacks a solution to a problem. For all this he has a richer vocabulary than his contemporary Catalans. =Theme= Gilabert's surviving poetry is uniform in theme. It is a subjective treatment of love and the various states it gives rise to in the poet. His poetry is completely impoverished of references or allusions to anything historical or objective and it is never narrative or anecdotal. The sole \\"facts\\" which can be gleaned from his total ≈ìuvre are that he was a knight, his wife came from a higher social stratum, and one of his poems was presented to a novell consistori (new consistory), probably the Consistori de Barcelona, founded 1393. The themes that dominated Occitan poetry at the turn of the thirteenth century dominate Gilabert's poetry at the turn of the fourteenth, in a peculiarly exaggerated form. He is greater than the troubadours, however, in his originality of his details and the accuracy of his expression. To the lady to whom he pledges vassalage he also presents himself a humble and loyal servant, willing to do whatever pleases her, even allowing himself to be killed. Gilabert is essentially feudal in his terminology. Gilabert dwells on the cruelty (cruseltat granda) of the lady and the llanguiment (disease) of the poet, his love, which pushes him to extremes (like death) and obsession. This drove him to greater heights of poetic eloquence than most of his Catalan contemporaries. This obsessiveness he shares with Andreu Febrer. The lines > Mas ya d'uymay sots en la derraria, > que ma dolor e mos mals cesseran; > car per vos muyr, d'on per mort fineran > los gran turme[n]ts que¬∑m donatz cascun dia. > Ja no us porets ab me plus deportar . . . from Pus que vos play, dompna, que res no us dia were almost certainly on the mind of Jordi de Sant Jordi when he began his famous Stramps. =Style= Gilabert, despite his expressiveness and subjectivity, is not an introspective poet. He can be repetitive and artificial. Though he sometimes loses himself in lengthy and wordy explanations he does not stray into the trobar ric, as does his contemporary Andreu Febrer. His writing is grammatically impeccable. Most of his images and metaphors are not original, like the \\"Castell d'Amor\\" (castle of love), but are current for his time. His military allusions are more effective because they stem from personal experiences. Other ornaments of Gilabert's poetry, evidence of the scope of the poet's reading, are the story of the bird burned by flying near the sunProbably an allusion to the Phoenix or Basilisk derived from some bestiary or perhaps the troubadour Rigaut de Berbezilh (Rique, 586). and the foolish alchemist. For two poems Gilabert adopted a French-style ballade, then new to Catalonia: Mals perladors vulh per tostemps maldir and Lo cor e¬∑lhs huelhs m'an lo cors mis en pena. The themes, such as lausengiers (the jealous), remain troubadour-esque and the works pulse with the semicavalleresc ambient of c. 1400 Valencia.The term is from Riquer, 583. There is similarity between Gilabert's phrase de valor coronada and Dante's coronata e vestita d'umilitate, but the coronation is the only commonality. Dante's \\"humility\\" gives the sense of virtue, but Gilabert's \\"valour\\" is purely feudal/chivalric in tenor. He considers himself de la mainada (\\"of the mesnada\\") of his dona (lady), as he was of the king's and the faction's during his military career. He is closer to his classical troubadour forebearers of c. 1200 than the Italians of his own day, though his poetry displays a familiarity with Dante. In Dona del mon no¬∑s pens que per amors Gilabert endeavours to keep the lady's name (and their love) a secret, lest she have others who believe they are loved by her. He inserts certain words in the poem specifically for this lady to whom it is dedicated, and whom he has been serving for nine years. A parallel exists between Gilabert's unnamed lady and Dante's donna-schermo of the Vita nuova.This parallel is drawn by Mart√≠n de Riquer (1964), Hist√≤ria de la Literatura Catalana, vol. 1 (Barcelona: Edicions Ariel), 585, and confirmed by Joaqu√≠n Molas, \\"Sobre la composici√≥n X de Gilabert de Pr√≥xita,\\" Revista de literatura, 8:15 (1955:July), 90-97.

History Since the very beginning in 1984 famous artists such as N.E.R.D (2010), Kent (2010), Dum Dum Boys (2010), Queensr√øche (2010), D.A.D (2010), Deep Purple, Twisted Sister, CC Cowboys, Turboneger, Imperiet, Kim Larsen, Wannskr√¶k (Dum Dum Boys), Mari Boine, Fish, Kamelot, √Öge Aleksandersen, Postgirobygget, Briskeby and more have all taken part in The Midnattsrocken festival and given the population in this remote part of the country great musical experiences. In the 80‚Äôs Midnattsrocken was one of the largest outdoor music festivals throughout the country. The festival was arranged for the first time during the summer of 1984. Due to large deficits the 1989 festival marked the end of the Midnattsrocken festivals. In 2001 Midnattsrocken was reintroduced. Since then it has been arranged every year (except 2002) in Brennelvneset innermost in the Porsanger Fjord. The new initiators had to reflect well upon the whole concept. As a result a festival camp was introduced. This led to an increase in the number of visitors. Once again the Midnattsrocken festival plays an important role among the festivals in the northern part of Norway. It is now the largest outdoor music festival in the counties of Finnmark and Northern Troms. Concept Midnattsrocken is to be a music festival offering a wide range of music ‚Äì for people of all ages. The background for our choice of concept is: \\\\- This region offers a very limited amount of musical events \\\\- It is very rare to have popular artists/bands visit this part of the country \\\\- The potential spectator numbers for musical events in this region is limited The Midnattsrocken festival focuses primarily on the counties of Finnmark and Northern Troms. The total population in this area is only about 85000. In addition the settlement is spread over a vast geographical area. This makes it necessary to offer a wide range of music to be able to attract enough spectators for the festival to be economically viable. Different concepts have been tried out since the Midnattsrocken festival was first arranged during 1984. All conclusions and experiences support today‚Äôs concept. The Midnattsrocken festival is an outdoor music festival arranged on the outskirts of the village of Lakselv in Porsanger municipality. In addition to what the festival offers from a musical perspective, it has a very popular festival camp. Ownership and organization Since the 80‚Äôs several different organizations have been in charge of the festival, and it has been through many adjustment periods. To create continuity, the Midnattsrocken festival has since 2005 been organized as a society. The ownership of the festival is connected with this society. The society of the Midnattsrocken festival is the disciplinarian organizer of the festival. All technical support in conjunction with the festival is outsourced to commercial partners with the necessary capacity and proficiency within the relevant fields.

The law was later reauthorized by presidents Bush, Obama, and Trump. In addition to its applicability to US citizens, it has the ability to authorize protections for undocumented immigrants who are victims of severe forms of trafficking and violence. History The Trafficking Victims Protection Act was subsequently renewed in 2003, 2006, 2008 (when it was renamed the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008). The law lapsed in 2011. In 2013, the entirety of the Trafficking Victims Protection was attached as an amendment to the Violence Against Women Act and passed. There are two stipulations an applicant has to meet in order to receive the benefits of the T-Visa. First, a victim of trafficking must prove/admit to being a victim of a severe form of trafficking and second must be a part of the prosecution of his or her trafficker. This law does not apply to immigrants seeking admission to the United States for other immigration purposes. Public Law No: 115-393 (12/21/2018) reauthorized the TVPA in 2018, as part of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2017. Since the law requires the applicant to become part of the prosecution of his or her trafficker, trafficked persons may be fearful of retaliation upon the self or the family and thus serves as a major deterrent to individuals even considering application. The law contains provisions for protection of those who are categorized as victims of human trafficking, primarily for sex, smuggling, and forced labor forms of exploitation. The TVPA allowed for the establishment of the Department of State's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, which coordinates with foreign governments to protect trafficking victims, prevent trafficking, and prosecute traffickers.\\"About Us.\\" U.S. Department of State.

This hermaphroditic parasite belongs to the Eucestoda subclass, of class Cestoda. This species has been used to demonstrate that cross-fertilization produces a higher infective success rate than self-fertilization. Life cycle It parasitizes fish and fish-eating water birds. The fish-eating water bird is the definitive host, and reproduction occurs in the bird's intestine. Eggs of the tapeworm are passed with the bird's feces and hatch in the water, where the first larval stage, the coracidium, is produced. The coracidium is then ingested by the first intermediate host, a cyclopoid copepod (e.g. Macrocyclops albidus). The second larval stage then subsequently develops in the tissue of this host. Within one to two weeks, the infected copepod is ingested by the second intermediate host, the three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus. The third larval stage, the plerocercoid, grows in the abdomen of the fish. When the fish is eaten by a bird, the larvae mature and adults start to produce eggs within two days. Reproduction takes place within one to two weeks, after which the parasite dies. Ecology In populations where Schistocephalus solidus infects the second intermediate host (three- spined stickleback) it can reach high prevalence -- proportion of host population infected -- up to 93% in both European and North American populations The growth of S. solidus in the second intermediate host is largely dependent upon the environmental temperatures. At an increase of temperature from 15 ¬∞C to 20 ¬∞C the growth of S. solidus can grow four times as fast. At the same time, the growth rate of the stickleback is significantly reduced . Host manipulation The Schistocephalus solidus parasite is capable of host manipulation in both intermediate hosts, the copepod and the three-spined stickleback. =First intermediate host= In the copepod host, it is able to suppress activity while uninfective to the stickleback host. This reduces the likelihood of the copepod host being consumed and consequently unsuccessful transmission of the parasite. Once the parasite becomes infective, after approximately two weeks, activity increases and, as a consequence, the risk of consumption by three-spined sticklebacks increases. However, when multiple, non-simultaneous infections by S. solidus occur, host manipulation is orchestrated by the first infecting parasite. This increases the risk of premature consumption of the subsequent infections by the fish host. =Second intermediate host= In the fish host, host manipulation induces more risk taking behaviour like positive geotaxis and negative thigmotaxis. This change in behaviour is unlikely to be caused solely by the mechanical presence of the parasite. Phenotype modification, through injecting silicon ‚Ä≤parasites‚Ä≤, with densities and sizes similar to infective plerocercoids (~150 mg) did not alter behaviour. Physiologically, S. solidus is a parasite that inhibits egg production in female three-spined sticklebacks in European populations , but not in Alaskan populations where only egg mass is reduced . The egg mass of fish was correlated to the parasite index, which indicates that the reduction in egg mass is a non-adaptive side effect of parasite infection. Breeding Reproduction for this parasite is unique because of the hermaphroditic nature of this cestode. When it comes to mating, S. solidus has three options: (1) self-fertilization (2) breeding with a sibling (3) breeding with an unrelated individual. There are advantages and disadvantages to each of these three options. For example, self-fertilization is advantageous when no mating partners are around but it is disadvantageous because of inbreeding depression‚Äîthe reduced fitness of offsprings because of the unmasking of deleterious recessive alleles due to the breeding of closely related individuals. Another disadvantage of self-fertilization is not having the ability to exchange genes with other cestodes which leads to increased genetic variation. Similarly, breeding with a sibling, also known as incestuous mating, also shares some of the same disadvantages as self- fertilization does‚Äîinbreeding depression and lack of genetic variation. But incestuous mating is advantageous because it helps maintain gene complexes within the family which may be important for local adaptation purposes. Breeding with unrelated individuals might seem to be most advantageous choice of mating because it increases genetic variation and avoids inbreeding depression, but it could be a very time-consuming process. Data from Schj√∏rring and J√§ger's article shows that incestuous mating among S. solidus significantly reduced the success of egg hatching. Hatching rate of eggs produced by pairs of cestodes that were not related was 3.5 times higher than those that were produced by the sibling pairs. However, those eggs hatched 2.3 times more successfully than eggs that were produced through selfing. The results observed in this experiment corroborates previous studies of S. solidus showing that eggs produced through selfing correlates with a reduction in hatching success. Although these earlier findings confirmed this study's result, there was a slight disconnect in the rates of egg hatching. Both sources, Christen et al. and Schj√∏rring, found that the hatching rate of egg from unrelated cestodes was 4 times higher than eggs from selfing, while this experiment found that the rate was 8 times higher. This discrepancy can be attributed to study source and the environment in which the experiment was conducted. The previous studies used wild cestodes while this study observed offsprings of wild cestodes bred in the laboratory. It has been speculated that a laboratory environment lowers selective pressures that would otherwise be present in the wild, thus allowing for genes that would be suppressed in the wild to be passed on to the next generation. Considering the evolutionary disadvantages that may arise from incestuous mating, scientists would suspect cestodes to sexually prefer unrelated mates. Galvani speculates that because S. solidus are parasites, that the cestodes would be under extreme selective pressures to uphold an evolutionary advantage over the host thus would avoid the genetically unfavorable consequences that would result from incestuous mating. However, this study contradicts Galvani's prediction showing that even when presented with alternatives, the cestodes were observed to spend a considerable amount of time around the related cestode as can be seen in the plot of Mean Position by Eggs per Mg Cestodes. The data supports the hypothesis that S. solidus have a preference for siblings and there exists a positive relationship between number of eggs produced and the amount of time spent in close proximity to the related cestode. This study found that pairs that exhibited strong sibling preference produced 12% more eggs in comparison to eggs produced by unrelated pairs. Kokko and Ots suggests that, despite inbreeding depression, there exists a significant advantage to incestuous mating choices. Their paper states that there are indirect and direct fitness benefits that outweigh the cost of inbreeding. In species where there is low parental investment and sexual encounters are rare and sequential, incestuous breeding is indirectly beneficial. If the prospective mates are related there is an increase mutual interest in finding a resolution with respect to playing the unpreferred sexual role. With less time allotted to conflicting over sexual roles and dominating one another, procreation is more cost-effective. Under these conditions, the greater effectiveness of inbreeding prevails over the detriment of incestuous mating and evolutionarily select for a preference for related mates.

War with the Seljuks The Seljuk‚ÄìCrusader War began when the First Crusade wrested territory from the Seljuk Turks during the Siege of Nicaea in 1097 and lasted until 1128 when Zengi became atabeg of Aleppo. At the latter date, the chief threat to the Crusaders from the east and north became the Zengids. The conflict was generally fought between European Crusaders and the Seljuk Turks and their vassals. The Muslim Syrian emirates occasionally allied themselves with the Christians against rival states. =First Crusade= In 1097 the Crusaders captured Nicaea from its Seljuk garrison, advancing from there into Anatolia. In the Battle of Dorylaeum the main Seljuk Turkish army was defeated. In 1097 the Frankish host besieged Antioch which fell in 1098. They successfully repelled an army sent by the Seljuk Sultan in Baghdad. The bulk of the Latin army moved on, capturing Ma'arrat al-Numan. After the siege many of the local emirs cooperated with the Christians in the hope that they would move on and attack the territory of another ruler. The Crusaders soon moved beyond Seljuk territory and went on to capture Jerusalem from the Fatimids in the Siege of Jerusalem. =Crusader setbacks 1100‚Äì1104= The Crusader successes suddenly came to an end when Bohemond I of Antioch was captured by the Danishmend Turks in the Battle of Melitene in 1100. The Crusade of 1101 ended in disaster when three separate Crusader columns were ambushed and annihilated by Seljuk armies in central Anatolia. Some of the commanders survived, but most of the foot soldiers and camp followers were enslaved or slaughtered. A decisive Crusader defeat at the Battle of Harran in 1104 \\"permanently ended Frankish expansion towards the Euphrates.\\"Smail, p. 178 =Crusader consolidation 1105‚Äì1109= In 1105, Toghtekin of Damascus sent a Turkish force to help Fatimid Egypt, but the combined force was defeated in the Third Battle of Ramla. That year in the Battle of Artah, the Principality of Antioch under Tancred won a victory over Fakhr al-Mulk Radwan of Aleppo and put the city on the defensive. The seven- year Siege of Tripoli ended in 1109 when the port fell and became the capital of the County of Tripoli. =Seljuk counterattack 1110‚Äì1119= Beginning in 1110, Sultan Muhammad I of Baghdad ordered counter-attacks on the Crusader states for six years. In 1110, 1112, and 1114 the city of Edessa was targeted; Galilee was invaded in 1113, and in 1111 and 1115 the Latin possessions east of the Orontes between Aleppo and Shaizar.\\"Smail, p. 55 In the Battle of Shaizar (1111) King Baldwin I of Jerusalem fought the army of Mawdud of Mosul in an extended skirmish around the walls of Shaizar. Mawdud defeated Baldwin's army at the Battle of Al-Sannabra in 1113. After a protracted campaign, the army of Bursuq ibn Bursuq of Hamadan was routed by Roger of Salerno's army in 1115 at the Battle of Sarmin.Beeler, pp. 132‚Äì135 The Seljuk successor states continued the war against the Frankish states. Najm ad-Din Ilghazi ibn Artuq's army destroyed the Antiochene field army and killed Roger of Salerno at the Battle of Ager Sanguinis in June 1119. Baldwin II of Jerusalem repaired the situation by rapidly reinforcing Antioch with forces from the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the County of Tripoli, winning the Battle of Hab that August.Beeler, pp. 146‚Äì147 =Crusader consolidation 1120‚Äì1128= In 1124 Tyre fell to the Crusaders. In 1125, the Crusaders triumphed at the Battle of Azaz, putting Aleppo back on the defensive. However, although the Crusaders were victorious in the field at the Battle of Marj al-Saffar in 1126, their casualties were significant enough that they were unable to capture Damascus.Smail, p. 182. Smail calls Marj al-Saffar a Crusader \\"tactical success.\\" War with the Zengids The war with the Zengids began when Zengi assumed the rule of Aleppo in 1128 and ended when his son Nur ad-Din, the ruler of Aleppo and Damascus, died in 1174. Though the Zengids were technically Seljuks, they represented a menace to the Crusader states in their own right. =Imad-ud-din Zengi= In 1127, Imad-ud-din Zengi was confirmed as atabeg of Mosul by the Seljuk Sultan Mahmud II. When he also became ruler of Aleppo the following year, the combined resources of the two cities made him a major threat to the Crusader states. However, Zengi first intrigued against the emirates of Homs and Damascus. In 1135, Imad-ud-din Zengi moved against the Latin Principality of Antioch. When the Crusaders failed to put an army into the field to oppose him, he captured the Syrian towns of Atharib, Zerdana, Ma'arrat al-Numan and Kafr Tab.Smail, p. 32 He defeated King Fulk of Jerusalem in 1137 at the Battle of Ba'rin. Afterward, he seized Ba'rin castle which the Crusaders never recovered.Smail, p. 33 In 1138, he helped repel a Frankish‚ÄìByzantine attack on Shaizar. Because of his continued efforts to seize Damascus, that city sometimes allied itself with the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem. The crowning achievement of Imad-ud-din Zengi's career occurred when he moved against the Christian state of Edessa when the bulk of its forces were campaigning elsewhere. In the Siege of Edessa he stormed and captured that city. The western portion of the County of Edessa remained in Crusader hands for only a few more years before being extinguished. Zengi was assassinated by a Frankish slave in 1146. He was succeeded in Aleppo by his second son Nur-ud-din Zengi, while his eldest son Saif ad-Din Ghazi I inherited Mosul. =Nur-ud-din Zengi= Nur-ud-din Zengi crushed a brief attempt by the Franks to reoccupy Edessa in 1146. The following year, he helped a rival city, Damascus, repel a Crusader expedition in the Battle of Bosra.Beeler, pp. 140‚Äì142 In 1148, the Second Crusade was forced to lift the Siege of Damascus when the armies of Nur-ud-din Zengi and his brother Saif appeared in the vicinity. He annihilated the army of Antioch at the Battle of Inab in 1149. Nur-ud-din Zengi became overlord of Mosul in 1149. He conquered the rest of the County of Edessa soon after the Battle of Aintab in 1150.Smail, pp. 160‚Äì161 For the next few years, he turned his attention to Damascus, except when he briefly seized the Crusader port of Tortosa in 1152. In a coup, he finally seized control of Damascus in 1154. For several years afterward he became involved in the affairs of Mosul. In 1157, he defeated the Franks at the Battle of Lake Huleh.Smail, p. 124 In 1163, King Amalric of Jerusalem began the Crusader invasions of Egypt against the disintegrating Fatimid Caliphate. To counter this, Nur-ud-din Zengi sent his own forces to intervene in the Fatimid civil war. That year, he was defeated at the Battle of al-Buqaia in Syria. In 1164 he won a great victory over the Crusaders at the Battle of Harim and went on to capture Banias. In Egypt, his general Shirkuh won the Battle of al-Babein in 1167,Smail, pp. 183‚Äì185 but the war dragged on. Shirkuh triumphed in 1169, but died soon after. Shirkuh was succeeded by his lieutenant Saladin, thus uniting all the Zengid territories into a vast empire. But the new ruler of Egypt refused to act as Nur-ud-din Zengi's vassal. Saladin proclaimed himself Sultan in 1171 and founded the Ayyubid dynasty. Nur-ud-din Zengi planned to move against the upstart but died in 1174. With his death, the Zengid empire fell apart. War with Fatimid Egypt The war with Fatimid Egypt began when the First Crusade invaded Fatimid territory and started the Siege of Jerusalem in 1099. Soon after, the Crusaders stormed and captured the city. The war between the newly established Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem and Fatimid Egypt continued until Saladin became the effective ruler of Egypt in 1169. =Jerusalem= Fatimid Egypt had no sooner captured Jerusalem from the Seljuks when the First Crusade appeared from the north. On July 15, 1099, the Crusaders successfully stormed the city and violently sacked it. The Crusaders crushed an early attempt by the Fatimids to recover the holy city by winning the Battle of Ascalon in 1099. The Egyptians were nevertheless able to hold onto the key fortress, which served as a launching point for raids on the newly established Kingdom of Jerusalem until 1153 when it fell in the Siege of Ascalon. =Fatimid counterattack= The capable vizier of Egypt, Al-Afdal Shahanshah, mounted a series of campaigns \\"almost annually\\"Smail, p. 84 against the Crusader kingdom from 1100 to 1107. Egyptian armies fought three major Battles of Ramla in 1101, 1102 and 1105, but they were ultimately unsuccessful. After this, the vizier contented himself by launching frequent raids on Frankish territory from his coastal fortress of Ascalon. In 1121, al-Afdal was assassinated. The new vizier, Al-Ma'mum, organized a major invasion of Crusader lands. This came to grief at the Battle of Yibneh in 1123. To protect against the raids from Ascalon, the Crusaders began encircling the strategic port with a ring of castles. Built between 1136 and 1149, the strongholds were at Ibelin (Yibneh) 20 miles northwest of Ascalon, Blanchegarde (Tell es-Safi) 15 miles east- northeast, Beth Gibelin (Bait Jibrin) 18 miles east, and Gaza 12 miles south- southwest.Smail, pp. 211‚Äì212 =Fatimid weakness= After the fall of Ascalon, Egypt ceased to be a threat to the Crusader states until the rise of Saladin. The Fatimid rule broke apart into warring factions. From 1163 to 1169, Egypt became the prize of a struggle between King Amalric of Jerusalem and Nur ed- Din of Syria as the Fatimid factions invited one side or the other to intervene in their civil war. In 1169, Nur ed-Din's general, Shirkuh seized Cairo for the last time and proclaimed himself ruler of Egypt. He died suddenly two months later and Nur ed-Din appointed Shirkuh's young nephew Saladin as his successor. As directed by his sponsor, Saladin ruthlessly stamped out Shi'ite Islam in Egypt, which had flourished under the Fatimids. But, instead of acting as Nur ed-Din's vassal, Saladin consolidated power in his own hands.Reston, pp. 6‚Äì7 He deposed the last Fatimid caliph in 1171. =Crusader armies= A typical Crusader army consisted a core of heavy cavalry (knights) in chainmail wielding lances and swords. These were backed by a much more numerous body of infantry armed with bows and spears. The charge of the Frankish heavy cavalry developed tremendous shock power. With a bit of hyperbole, the contemporary Byzantine scholar Anna Comnena noted that a Frank on horseback would \\"make a hole through the walls of Babylon.\\"Smail, p. 115 The knights were sometimes joined by mounted squires or turcopoles who were less heavily armed. While the Crusader cavalry represented the main offensive force in battle, they \\"would have been absolutely useless had they not been supported by the infantry.\\"Beeler, p. 124 Often, the infantry opened the battle with a volley of arrows, with the horsemen in the rear. When an opportunity for a successful charge appeared, the infantry would open ranks to allow the mailed cavalry to advance. If the horsemen suffered a reverse, they could fall back behind the foot soldiers. The Frankish infantry had considerable defensive power, but it could not hold out for long if unsupported by their heavy cavalry. =Fatimid armies= Egyptian armies of the period relied on masses of Sudanese bowmen supported by Arab and Berber cavalry. Since the archers were on foot and the horsemen awaited attack with lance and sword, a Fatimid army provided exactly the sort of immobile target that the Frankish heavy cavalry excelled in attacking. Except for the third battle of Ramleh in 1105, when Toghtekin of Damascus sent a contingent of Seljuk Turks to help the Egyptians, the Fatimids did not use horse archers. Whereas the Crusaders developed a healthy respect for the harass-and-surround tactics of the Turkish horse archers, they tended to discount the effectiveness of the Egyptian armies. While overconfidence led to a Crusader disaster at the second battle of Ramleh, the more frequent result was a Fatimid defeat. \\"The Franks never, until the reign of Saladin, feared the Egyptian as they did the armies from Muslim Syria and Mesopotamia.\\"Smail, p. 87 Wars with the Ayy≈´bids The Ayy≈´bid-Crusader Wars began when truces attempted in the aftermath of The Zengid-Crusader Wars and Fatimid-Crusader Wars and their likes ended up violated by those such as Sir Reynald de Ch√¢tillon, Master Edessa Count Joscelin de Courtenay III, Knights Order Of Templars Grandmaster Sir Odo de St Amand, along with later on Knighthoods Templar Order Grandmaster Sir G√©rard de Ridefort and by religious fanatics including newly arrived ones from Europe, and by attempts by ones like SalƒÅ·∏• ad-Dƒ´n Ayy≈´b And His Ayy≈´bid Dynasty and their Saracen Armies who together after they became leaders of in succession to Nur ad-Din had vowed to punish those like Sir Reynald and to perhaps so reclaim Jerusalem for the Muslims. The Battle of Montgisard, The Belvoir Castle Battle, and as well as The Two Sieges Of Kerak Castle were some victories for The Crusaders, all whilst The Marj Ayun Battle, The Siege Of Chastellet Castle Of Jacob‚Äôs Ford, The Battle Of Cresson, The Battle Of Hattin and as well as The 1187 Jerusalem Siege were all won by The Saracen Muslim Armies Of The Ayy≈´bƒ´d Dynasty And SalƒÅ·∏• ad-Dƒ´n Ayy≈´b, leading to The Third Crusade‚Äôs Events. War of the Lombards The War of the Lombards (1228‚Äì1242) was a civil war in the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Kingdom of Cyprus between the \\"Lombards\\" (also called the imperialists), the representatives of the Emperor Frederick II, largely from Lombardy, and the native aristocracy, led first by the Ibelins and then by the Montforts. The war was provoked by Frederick's attempt to control the regency for his young son, Conrad II of Jerusalem. Frederick and Conrad represented the Hohenstaufen dynasty. Crusader forces The army of the First Crusade that arrived in Asia Minor in 1097 were a type of armed pilgrimage. A prior expedition, the People's Crusade, made up of peasants and low-ranking knights arrived in Asia Minor in August 1096, but were decisively defeated by Seljuk forces a month later in October. The later force called the Prince's Crusade, which succeeded in taking Jerusalem and started the Crusader states, was representative of European armies. Crusader armies contained heavy cavalry, infantry and ranged troops such as archers or crossbowmen. The original leadership was generally made up of high-ranking knights from modern-day France and Belgium. Later on, other Western European monarchs participated such as Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor from the Holy Roman Empire and Richard I of England in the Third Crusade of 1189‚Äì1192. The long distance to the Middle East and the difficulty in crossing often hostile territory resulted in the Crusader forces being relatively outnumbered by the surrounding pre- existing nations. There were regular calls for reinforcements from the Crusader states attempting to alleviate this problem. Several calls resulted in new Crusades. =Tactics= Tactics followed by Crusaders varied according to the commander at the time and depended on the strengths of the different armies. The Crusaders were generally less mobile than their foes especially the Seljuk Turks who regularly used horse archers. However, the Crusader heavy cavalry had a powerful charge that could and did turn many battles. Where records are available several common threads on tactics may be found. Surprise attacks and ambushes were common and generally effective and were used by both the Crusaders and their enemies. Examples of surprise attacks included the Battle of Dorylaeum (1097), the Battle of Ascalon (1099) and the Battle of Lake Huleh (1157). Against horse archers such as those used by the Seljuks, running battles were common. In these instances, the Crusaders kept in close marching formation while being harassed by mobile horse archers. Generally the forces opposing the Crusaders were unable or unwilling to attempt breaking the formation. This type of battle usually resulted in no clear result. Examples of running battles include the Battle of Bosra (1147) and the Battle of Aintab (1150). This use of relatively heavily armoured troops to shield the less armoured foot soldiers and archers was also seen in the formation used by Bohemund of Taranto during the Battle of Dorylaeum (1097). Although often no clear result appeared in running battles, there could be a chance for the Crusaders to charge into unprepared and disorganised enemy forces after some time had passed. This could result in a decisive victory, as happened in the Battle of Arsuf (1191) although it was not part of the original battle plan. Against the Fatimid forces, which used foot archers and light melee cavalry, the Crusaders could use their heavy cavalry more effectively, achieving decisive results. This can be seen in the first and third battles of Ramla. In the Second Battle of Ramla, faulty intelligence had resulted in the near- destruction of a small Crusader force. These tactics were dictated by the forces on hand. The more well-off Crusader troops, such as the knights, were individually superior in a melee to any cavalry in the area at the time, and were relatively immune to arrows due to their armour. Nonetheless, they tended to be ill-disciplined in the face of arrow volleys. The Seljuks attempted to use this on several occasions to draw small groups of cavalry away from the main body where they could be destroyed piecemeal by superior numbers. An example of a tactical retreat by lightly armoured Seljuk cavalry leading to a tactical advantage and a surrounded Crusader force was at the Battle of Azaz (1125). An alternative or supporting tactic to feigned retreats that was used by the Seljuks and others was harassing the Crusader line to disorganise it and leave it open to a cohesive cavalry charge. Crusader generals would have needed to be careful to maintain discipline in the face of losses from arrows and to keep heavy cavalry reserves to repel probing attacks. Note that this analysis is only drawn from examination mainly of some battles between 1097 and the mid 12th century, and so does not include the tactics of the entire Crusader period which only truly ended in 1302. The two famous crusader orders, the Knights of Saint John and Knights Templar, fought similarly and a lot like most other Knights, except the Templars would tend to be a more aggressive a force (even outside the crusader kingdom such as in the Reconquista). As a result, they suffered more casualties; indeed the order was almost destroyed several times throughout the Crusades period such as at the Horns of Hattin. They would also take part in many defences in the crusader kingdom such as Antioch and finally Acre committing to many sallies in last- ditch efforts to deny the cities to the enemy. Also, they held some of the strongest castles in the kingdom, for example Krak des Chevaliers, which was primarily controlled by the Knights of Saint John. =Strengths= Crusading soldiers wore armour far heavier than their Saracen and Turk counterparts. The only effective defensive method of defeating the hit and run tactics launched by the Saracens was to form a shield wall and hope that the armour one wore was thick enough. Crossbowmen and or archers could then fire their own missiles from the safety of the shield wall. To counter the heat, many knights wore a surcoat underneath their armour to insulate against the metal which under the heat of the sun, would have burned their skin. Later, the Saracens and Turks employed heavier troops, but since most soldiers came from the local population of the Arabs, these would not have naturally worn much armour. As such, the Crusaders were often of a heavier type than their enemies and few of their enemies could withstand a heavy cavalry charge unless the cavalry were seriously outnumbered. The crusaders were also a very determined band of soldiers, bearing the heat of a foreign land, and surviving on minimal amounts of water (and in the case of the First Crusade, minimal amounts of food). Many would have had to have travelled either by land which was exhausting at best, or else by sea, whereby many of their comrades would have died or been lost in storms. Those few that arrived were the best, and crusader soldiers were at least as determined as their opponents were. A classical example is the Siege of Antioch where the crusaders, though outnumbered, were inspired and eventually drove of a larger army of Seljuk Turks. Many have argued that the cause of victory was due to factional infighting between the various Turkish tribes within the army, as opposed to the Christian zeal inspired by the Lance of Longinus that was supposedly found in the city. At times the Crusaders could be a large force. Under Richard the Lionheart, there were some 40,000 men under his command at the height of the Third Crusade. There may well have been many more, but the Holy Roman Emperor's enormous army broke apart after his death. Crusader castles allowed the Christian invaders to secure their beachhead in the Levant. Building many fortifications, which were well- supplied with water and food, they could hold out almost indefinitely, unless supply was cut, the enemy infiltrated the fort such as Krak des Chevaliers or a big enough force was marshaled against them in a siege such as by Saladin, who only captured Jerusalem after destroying the Crusader army at Hattin. After the crusader period, this occurred at Constantinople itself. Pitched battles were avoided as often as possible, unless the political situation called for it, due to problems with manpower, logistics and the impracticability of marching armoured soldiers in such a hot climate. =Weaknesses= The Crusaders were at times poorly united and their tactics lacked flexibility. The Crusading soldiers were also not very disciplined. Often, the actions of Crusader armies were not beneficial to their cause of aiding their powerful and uneasy allies, the Byzantine Christians. The Byzantines, dubious of Crusader usefulness, even went so far as to make a deal with Saladin: when Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa marched his enormous army towards Jerusalem, the Byzantine emperor promised to delay the crusaders in return for Saladin not attack the Byzantine Empire. The sacking of the Hungarian city of Zara, and the capture of Constantinople in 1204 were some of the main factors behind the fall of Byzantium. The key to surviving against their numerous opponents was to keep them from uniting. The Crusaders were able to make a few alliances with various Arabic factions. In Spain, the initially powerful Moors were greatly weakened by civil war and various city states with little or no allegiance to each other. The few Christian kingdoms in Northern Spain were able to stay a few in number (and hence mainly united), even as they conquered more land. Reinforcing a Crusader army was difficult at best. Troops were brought from Europe but these would often have their own orders led by their own leaders, often with conflicting interests. The Second Crusade demonstrates this, when a large Crusader army failed to capture Damascus after a row broke out between the commanders (who were of different origins) as to who should rule the city, even though the city had not even fallen at the time (and consequently did not). Since troops were being brought over from such a long distance, Crusader leaders feared that one would plot against the other back in Europe, something that their Arabian counterparts had little worry of considering that their lands were already occupied. Their fears were not unfounded, as in the cases of Richard the Lionheart, whose half brother plotted against him, and the Austrian emperor Leopold, who had Richard captured and ransomed. At the Battle of Hattin, a large crusader army was annihilated when it was ambushed searching for a source of water. The lack of local knowledge resulted from poor intelligence-gathering. Conscription was limited at best. At the time of the Siege of Jerusalem, there were some 60,000 refugees wishing to flee that Saladin gave a paid passage to. So whilst some people from Europe, or local Christians may have swelled the city and hence had the potential to raise a militia force, it was not enough. At the siege of Acre, the crusaders amounted to 15,000 men, a small force compared to the typical army of 40,000 to 80,000 deployed by the Saracens. As a result, the Arabs had a seemingly unlimited supply of men, whilst the crusaders struggled to man their walls during the latter periods in the late thirteenth centuries. After the First Crusade, many of the veteran soldiers who won the Battle of Ascalon left, believing that their mission was accomplished. Often, some crusades were nothing more than raids, like the Fourth Crusade. This only aggravated the local Arabs, uniting them in their desire to drive the Crusaders from their holdings. =Impact of the Crusader armies= After the Battle of Manzikert, the Byzantines suffered a crushing defeat against the Turks, seeing much land lost. The Byzantine emperor Alexios I Komnenos called for mercenaries from the West for help in combating the Turks. In response, Pope Urban II at the council of Clermont declared an armed pilgrimage to the Holy land. The resulting Crusaders aided Byzantium so greatly that by 1143, the death of John II Komnenos, the Byzantine empire was once more a superpower and the Crusaders had control of a sizable piece of the Levant along with Jerusalem, which did not fall until 1187. Large numbers of Crusader States were formed, most of them independent of the European powers, though the Byzantine Empire did claim the Crusader states as 'Protectorates'. By the late 13th century, crusades were no longer of benefit, weakening the Byzantines more than the Turks and Saracens. Naval expansion by the Venetians at the expense of the Byzantine empire strained relations. =Heavy cavalry and infantry= Crusader heavy cavalry initially did not consist of any military orders like the Templars. These were created after the successes of the first crusade. Most of the heavy cavalry were knights. However, these knights would often find themselves unhorsed throughout their mission, due to starvation and lack of fodder for their mounts. Consequently, many heavy cavalry may have found themselves as infantry towards the end of their crusade. Some military orders may have fought on foot as dismounted knights. This would have been favorable in circumstances were the ground was difficult or else too narrow for large numbers of cavalry. However, in the open desert plains of the Middle East, it would have been foolish to travel on foot. ;Templar Knights The Templar Knights were created in 1119 when King Baldwin II gave permission for eight knights to start a new military order to protect pilgrims on their way to the Holy land. They never retreated from battle and as a result, only a tenth of the Templars survived battle. The Order had to constantly spend large sums of money recruiting new knights. Over time, The Templars grew to an impressive order of thousands of members, though not all would have been heavy cavalry ‚Äì most would have been squires or servants accompanying the Knights. The Templars participated in almost every major battle of the Second Crusade onwards. They were later betrayed and disbanded by a combination of the French crown and the papacy. ;Knights of St. John The Knights of St. John were founded as a military order in 1113. Their aim was to protect pilgrims and more importantly, to set up hospices and other charitable services to the pilgrims. In 1005, a Christian hospital was destroyed by the Caliph Al Hakim. This was rebuilt later in 1023. The Knights of St. John were forced to evacuate from the Holy Land, traveling across the Mediterranean until finally settling on Malta. They remained a potent force until their dismemberment by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1798. ;Knights of Santiago Although many historians see the Reconquista in Spain itself as a long Crusade, the Knights of Santiago did not take part in any campaigns in the Levant. Their mission, like many of the other military orders, was to protect pilgrims heading from Northern Spain, which in the twelfth century was Christian, into the Islamic south and then to the Holy land. ;Teutonic Knights The Teutonic Knightly order was founded in the late 12th century after the crusades in the Middle East (most likely the Third Crusade). Of German origin, Germany initially contributed a large army of heavy infantry and cavalry under Frederick Barbarossa. After the aging emperor's mysterious death (and supposed pickling), a few of these knights made it to the Holy Land and established themselves, where they controlled the polls of the ports in the parts of the Levant controlled by the Crusaders. Most of the action seen by these Knights, however, were directed against Prussia and the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian commonwealth. The Teutonic Knights declined in importance after a crushing defeat by the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian forces in the 1410 Battle of Tannenberg. The Teutons were finally dissolved by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1809. However, the descendants of these Knights formed the elite Prussian officers and such the legacy of the order's martial skill can be examined in the Napoleonic and the Franco‚ÄìPrussian War. ;Infantry Typical medieval military doctrine dictated that infantry would be the main composition of any army, but that cavalry would dominate the battlefield. This was certainly true of the Crusaders. It required great horsemanship and archery skills to be a cavalry archer. Horsemen could conserve their strength for battle but infantry had to march to battle. This daunting task across the desert is made all the more uncomfortable when considering the weight arms, armour, and baggage, combined with the threat of getting lost while surrounded by the enemy. Both sides used their cavalry to strike the deepest blow, while the infantry would then be useful in supporting roles, such as archery, covering flanks, or using sheer weight and numbers in attrition and pursuit. =Strategy= Despite their small size, the Crusaders were a very effective force. Many leaders who led their own national crusades like Richard the Lionheart, used only the knights under his banner. When it came to composite Crusader armies, there was no choice but to unite, since the surrounding hostile Arab and Turkish forces could easily outnumber the Crusaders. When that was the case with Baibars, the Crusader states fell one by one. One of the Crusaders' long-term goals was the conquest of Egypt. A rich and fertile province, any cost in its invasion would have been easily paid off from its revenue, even if the spoils were to be shared with the Byzantine Empire. Crusaders emphasized speed, attempting to make a bold opening move before the enemy could finish theirs. This was done despite the lack of mounts for their knights, and could have good or ill consequences. At Ascalon, the Crusaders were able to launch a rapid assault, leading to a great victory. At Hattin, they quickly fell into a deadly trap and were annihilated for it. The distance covered by an army in a day was small: this crusading haste was only present in battle. The Crusaders generally speaking however, did not seem to have much of a plan other than divide and rule, or else strike at the chain which has the weakest point, as with Egypt. These strategies were pursued as best as they could do so. =Siege warfare= The Crusaders were not renowned for their siege warfare. During the first siege of Antioch, the Crusaders managed to take the city initially through treachery. However, siege equipment was used, although a favourite tactic of all Medieval European armies was a simple blockade and then wait for a few months or so for the defenders to run out of water, food, or both. This tactic was ineffective when the crusaders faced larger numbers, such as at Antioch. During the Portuguese Reconquista, a fleet of English, German and French crusaders assisted in the Siege of Lisbon, using their siege towers to successfully assault the city. However, Crusaders were renowned for their castle building of the strongest fortresses, such as Krak des Chevaliers, were built and ensured their supremacy in a land surrounded by hostiles, until their under-manned walls were taken, as with Acre which, despite possessing a double wall, was under-manned and therefore overwhelmed.

The articles were each published a month apart, beginning with the forward in February and the last article, in July. The series is a caustic expos√© of the corruption of the United States Senate, particularly the corporate magnate-turned-Senator Nelson AldrichDavid Graham Phillips, \\"The Treason of the Senate: Aldrich, The Head of It All,\\" Cosmopolitan, March 1906 from Rhode Island. During the composition of the articles, Phillips received help from newspaper baron William Randolph Hearst, who then desired to publish sensationalist stories to attract more readership of his publications. The series was thought to be widely accepted because of the lack of much criticism. There were not any efforts to discredit Phillips, apart from an article written in the Chicago Tribune in March 1906, after only the foreword and first article had been published. The article is titled \\"No Treason In the Senate\\" and was asking for proof of Phillips' claims. Alt URL The release of the series precipitated the passage and ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment, which provides the direct election of the U.S. Senators.\\"Treason of the Senate\\". U.S. Senate Art and History. In the seven years it took to ratify the Amendment, some of the 20 Senators criticized by Phillips in the articles resigned or died.

The option the Amendment allowed for appointment by the affected state's governor of a new senator when a seat is vacated mid-term has come under criticism.\\"New Idea on Capitol Hill: To Join Senate, Get Votes\\" by Carl Hulse, The New York Times, March 10, 2009 (in print 3/11/09 p. A20 NY edition). Retrieved 3/11/09.  Background  Phillips published this series of articles at the close of what is to be considered the Gilded Age, which is the period when money and politics became very interconnected. The expansion of the railroad industry combined with increased production of steel, iron, and oil contributed to a group of immensely wealthy businessmen that came to be known by the term tycoon. These wealthy tycoons used their wealth to influence the already contentious politics of the time. The post-Civil War Reconstruction era saw calls for the punishment of the Southern rebels and social reform, including worker reform following the Industrial Revolution. There were several major instances of corruption during this period, such as the Cr√©dit Mobilier scandal, but the most well known was the one exposed by Phillips in this series. Major players =Chauncey M. Depew= The first article of the series was published in March 1906 and focused on New York Senator Chauncey Depew and his connection to the Vanderbilt family, specifically Cornelious \\"Commodore\\" Vanderbilt who was the head of the New York Central Railroad company at the time. Depew worked as a lawyer until age twenty-nine, when he was nominated as Secretary of State of New York by the bosses of the party. Soon after, the young politician encountered corruption when he reported the New York City population as much smaller than it actually was so that representation of the rival Democratic Party could be decreased. This incident gave Depew the nickname \\"Depopulator Depew.\\" After that, Depew failed to be re-elected and went to work for the New York Central Railroad company. He was employed officially as a lawyer, but in reality, he was more of an assistant to the Vanderbilts and did whatever they required. Later on, Depew's job morphed into a lobbyist position, which included bribing various politicians in order to put through legislation that would benefit the Vanderbilts. = Nelson W. Aldrich = Published in April 1906, the second article of the series concentrated on Rhode Island Senator Nelson Aldrich. Whereas Depew had connections to the Vanderbilts, Aldrich was closely associated with the Rockefeller dynasty. The Senator used his relationship with the Rockefellers to rule as an unofficial boss of a political machine because he had the ability to influence who received campaign contributions from the powerful family. He also used his position to pass several questionable tariff bills. The first bill that Aldrich had a hand in was the McKinley Tariff Act of 1890, which increased the tax on imports to almost fifty percent. In 1894, the second bill was pushed through, known as the Wilson-Gorman Tariff Act, which lowered the tariff, but by the time it was passed it included dozens of amendments that would favor big business. The last bill that Phillips focused on in this article was the Dingley Tariff Act of 1897, which once again raised tariffs. = Arthur P. Gorman = The third article of the series, published in May 1906, focused on Senator Arthur P. Gorman of Maryland. Gorman started off his political career working as a page boy in the Senate and is said to have learned all about corruption from his time there. As an adult, he worked for the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal where he used his knowledge of corruption to profit from the negotiations with railroad companies. With the wealth and power that he acquired from his work at the Canal, Gorman became a boss of the Republican party. From there, he was able to commit more fraud and graft. He was elected to the Senate in 1881 despite scandal and, from there, Gorman and Aldrich were able to merge the two powerful political machines of the time and influence more politicians and bills to produce whatever the wealthy interests desired. Phillips draws much attention to Gorman's notable involvement in a scandal that revolved around senators taking bribes from sugar companies and gambling on sugar company stocks. In 1896, when his constituents became fed up with the numerous scandals he was involved in, Gorman was booted from his Senate seat. Yet he still wheeled much influence in Maryland, and with interest groups at his back, Gorman was later reelected to the Senate.  Minor players  = John C. Spooner = The fourth article of the series was published in June 1906 and focused on Senator John C. Spooner of Wisconsin. Spooner's section of the expos√© focused on his connection to railways in Wisconsin and the Great Lake region that began during his days as a lawyer and continued in his Senatorial days. A major area of focus in the article was on Spooner's influence over bills that allowed railroad companies to keep land that had been granted to them to build tracks after they had passed the specified time that the Senate had laid out where they must have begun construction. or the land would be returned to the states for citizens to settle on Phillips also discussed Spooner's connection with Aldrich and Gorman and their merger of their political machines. Spooner lost his seat in 1890, but, like Gorman, was later re-elected despite his past involvement in corrupt affairs.

Its headquarters is located in New Providence at The Retreat Gardens on Village Road. The Bahamas National Trust was created by an Act of Parliament in 1959, through the efforts of two groups of conservationists. History =Flamingos= In the early 20th century there was concern for the survival of the Caribbean flamingo. The National Audubon Society of the United States urged the Bahamas government to protect the flamingos, which led to passage of the Wildbirds (Protection) Act in 1905. In the early 1950s, Audubon expert Robert Porter Allen scoured the Caribbean searching for flamingos. In his popular book, On the Trail of Vanishing Birds, Allen found that the colonies on the island of Andros in the Bahamas had already disappeared. He determined that the largest surviving group of Caribbean flamingos inhabited the isolated back-waters of Lake Rosa on Inagua. That is where Allen and the Audubon Society decided to make a stand. A group of influential backers was recruited in Nassau to form a Society for the Protection of the Flamingo, with Arthur Vernay as its leader. Two wardens were hired on Inagua, brothers Samuel and James Nixon, and Audubon helped finance the entire operation. =Exuma cays= Explorer Ilia Tolstoy ( also known as Ilya Andreyevich Tolstoy was grandson of the 19th century Russian writer and a frequent visitor to the Bahamas) had been lobbying the colonial government to set aside some Bahamian islands as protected areas. In 1957 the government agreed to temporarily reserve a stretch of the Exuma cays, providing that some group would explore the possibility of creating a national park and make concrete recommendations. Meanwhile, Columbia University graduate Carleton Ray had written a book on The Bahamas called The Underwater Guide to Marine Life, which recommended the protection of marine areas in the same way that land areas were protected. Ray teamed up with Tolstoy to mount a new Bahamian expedition, to the Exuma cays, which was organised by January 1958. Allen and other well-known conservationists, including Donald Squires of the American Museum of Natural History and Bahamian experts Oris Russell and Herbert McKinney, were part of the team. They spent a week travelling by boat from Norman's Cay to Conch Cut and their report led to the creation of the world's first land and sea park in the Exumas, as well as to the formation of the Bahamas National Trust itself. They concluded that the area had > \\"...essentially unspoiled natural conditions with unmodified associations of > plants, animals, earth processes, and those intangible elements that combine > to give an area its outstanding character\\". and that: > \\"The Exuma Cays park under consideration should be regarded as only the > beginning of a conservation movement that is vital to the Bahamas as a > whole. It will also be a beginning of a new concept, integrated land-and-sea > conservation, in which the Bahamas will take the lead and show the way to > other nations throughout the world.\\" The survey team called for an organisation modelled on the British National Trust to acquire lands and manage protected areas throughout the Bahamas. This organisation - which was created by parliament in 1959 - would be the government's advisor on conservation matters and seek to educate Bahamians on the value of their natural heritage. The government adopted the expedition's recommendations wholesale and the Exuma Cays Land and Sea Park, the first of its kind in the world, was officially established, and The Bahamas National Trust was created as an independent statutory organization charged with conservation and preservation. The BNTs governing council includes government, private sector and scientific representatives. In addition to overseeing the Exuma Cays Land and Sea Park, The Bahamas National Trust also took over responsibility for the endangered flamingos on Inagua.

Houlihan, Naperville Sun, April 18, 2007 In 2015, Pradel did not run for reelection, but declined to personally endorse a candidate. The election was won by Steve Chirico, a former city council member, who was sworn in on May 3, 2015. Biography Pradel grew up in Naperville, Illinois as the oldest of six children. After graduating from what is now Naperville Central High School, he served for three years in the U.S. Marine Corps. In 1966 he joined the Naperville Police Department, where he spent much of his career visiting schools and speaking to children, earning him the nickname \\"Officer Friendly,\\" a moniker that stuck for 28 years and became an asset in his future election as mayor.\\"'Officer Friendly' seeks new title - 'mayor' - Helping people made Pradel's career complete\\" Lorilyn Rackl, Daily Herald, February 24, 1995 In 1977, Naperville started Safety Town, and Mayor Rybicki named Pradel to be its first teacher. In 1992, Pradel underwent quadruple-bypass heart surgery. In 2006, he was hospitalized when doctors put in a stent after tests showed a blockage in one of his arteries. In February 2010, he was again hospitalized, and an angioplasty was performed to insert two additional stents. In 2013, Pradel was awarded an honorary degree from North Central College for his tireless devotion to Naperville and the college. In May 2015, Pradel retired from Mayor, but still made public appearances -- even leading the 2015 Memorial Day Parade. Elections =1995= Pradel entered the 1995 race for mayor of Naperville with no political background or history as an elected official. He faced three opponents in a February primary election that would narrow the field to only two candidates. The other candidates in the primary were Archer Stella, Jack Tenison and Doug Krause. Krause, an active city councilman, had run for mayor previously in 1991 and lost to Samuel Macrane.\\"Dishing up another helping at life's 'banquet table'\\" Lorilyn Rackl, Daily Herald, February 25, 1995 Pradel won the most votes in the primary, but Tenison was behind by only four votes and was in second place, earning him a spot on the general election ballot.\\"Voters pick final line-up Pradel, Tenison keep spots in race for mayor\\" Lorilyn Rackl, Daily Herald, March 1, 1995 Tenison was a two-term city council member who also headed the human resources department for DuPage County. A geographical break- down of votes revealed that while Tenison did well in Naperville's south side in Will County, where he took 47 percent of the vote to Pradel's 21 percent, Pradel was strongest in Naperville's township, which included the established downtown area.\\"The politics of geography Mayoral Primary reveals city-splits\\" Lorilyn Rackl, Daily Herald, March 2, 1995 Pradel said he did well in the downtown area because the older and more established area held many residents who knew him from his years as \\"Officer Friendly\\" with the Naperville Police Department. He vowed to focus campaigning for the general election on Naperville's south side to get a better foothold in the area. Debate in the general election focused mainly on the role of the mayor in Naperville, where a city manager form of government is employed and mayoral duties are defined as part-time. The last three mayors of Naperville were retirees and had treated the job as full-time, a tradition that Pradel said he would continue if elected. Tenison said he would continue his job with the human resources department in DuPage County, and that he would hold evening office-hours if elected.\\"Krause backs Pradel in mayoral race\\" Lorilyn Rackl, Daily Herald, March 3, 1995 The race was expected to be close, with former candidates Krause and Stella endorsing Pradel\\"Pradel gets support of former competitor - Archer Stella supports Pradel\\" Lorilyn Rackl, Daily Herald, March 2, 1995 and Tenison receiving the endorsement of local newspaper The Daily Herald.Daily Herald Editorial, March 8, 1995 Tenison was also a bigger election spender, having spent $8,851 after one reporting period while Pradel had spent $6,278.\\"Mayoral hopeful Tenison biggest election spender\\" Lorilyn Rackl, Daily Herald, March 22, 1995 Pradel won the April general election with unofficial results showing Pradel with 9,300 votes and Tenison with 6,469, a wide margin that surprised political pundits, most of whom had declined to predict a winner and said the race was too close to call.\\"Naperville picks 'Officer Friendly' Pradel defeats - Tenison for mayor\\" Lorilyn Rackl, Daily Herald, April 5, 1995 =1999= Although Pradel's 2007 reelection website stated that Pradel \\"won overwhelmingly in his first election and was unchallenged in his next two mayoral elections,\\"Reelect Mayor A.

Pradel supported the development that would include a beauty salon, dental office, and 10 single-family homes as a good compromise,\\"Spring Green Opposition: 'The fight is not over'\\" Britt Carson, The Naperville Sun, February 19, 1999 despite criticism from local newspapers The Daily Herald and The Naperville Sun, as well as opposition from residents who petitioned against the development.\\"Spring Green May Set Bad Precedent\\" Naperville Sun Editorial, February 24, 1999 Still, Pradel received the endorsements of both the HeraldDaily Herald Editorial, March 23, 1999 and the Sun\\"Sun Endorsements: Mayor Pradel Merit's 2nd Term\\" Editorial, April 4, 1999 and easily won the election with 10,293 votes to Romano's 1,952 votes, a feat attributed by the Herald to Pradel's high public visibility and growing popularity.\\"Pradel reaps rewards of popularity\\" Stacy St. Claire, Daily Herald, April 14, 1999 =2003 (unopposed)= With a lack of divisive issues and Mayor Pradel's popularity soaring, there were no other candidates in the race for mayor in 2003. Mayor Pradel was elected unanimously by the people.\\"Sun endorsements for city council\\" Editorial, Naperville Sun, March 26, 2003 =2007= Pradel was joined by two experienced city council members on the primary ballot in 2007. The other candidates were Doug Krause, who had also participated in the 1991 and 1995 races, and 12-year city councilwoman Mary Ellingson. Because voters could only vote for one candidate in the primary, Pradel was worried that a majority of people would consider him a shoo-in and cast a vote for their choice among the other two candidates, consequently leading to his elimination in the primary. The typically low voter turnout in primary elections added to this concern. So even though Pradel still enjoyed overwhelming popularity in the city, he campaigned vigorously and sent letters to constituents reminding them to vote. Despite Pradel's worries, he received 70.1 percent of the primary vote, or 7,884 votes in an unofficial total, compared to Ellingson's 1,596 votes and Krause's 1,766.\\"Ellingson says she will put support behind Krause\\" Kate R. Houlihan, Naperville Sun, February 28, 2007 Because Krause received more votes than Ellingson, he was able to join Pradel on the general election ballot in April. Once out of the race, Ellingson publicly gave her support to Krause, saying that she believed the people of Naperville wanted to see a new face. In the general election, Krause told reporters he would not accept donations from developers or companies that do business with the city. Pradel said he didn't hold those views, telling The Naperville Sun that he was \\"thrilled\\" that any individual or group would donate to a campaign.\\"Krause, Pradel differ from whom they will accept political funds\\" Kate R. Houlihan, Naperville Sun, March 25, 2007 The Sun reported Pradel's total funds at over $27,000 and Krause at about $7,200 at one point during the weeks leading up to the election. Pradel ultimately won reelection with 12,904 total votes or 69 percent compared to Krause's 5,688 votes, according to unofficial results.\\"Election to fourth term will seal deal as longest-serving mayor for city\\" Kate R. Houlihan, Naperville Sun, April 18, 2007 Death Pradel was admitted to Edward Hospital in Naperville in the summer of 2018 for back pain. While there, doctors found a malignant tumor that spread across his body. He entered hospice care on September 2, 2018, and died one day shy of his 81st birthday.

The group, composed of Sean Connors, Robert Dillon, Peter Martin, and David Skidmore, specializes in new music/contemporary classical music and is known for its touring and recording activities. Third Coast Percussion is the Ensemble-in-Residence at the University of Notre Dame‚Äôs DeBartolo Performing Arts Center. They are the first ensemble at the University of Notre Dame to create a permanent and progressive ensemble residency program at the center. The ensemble performs multiple recitals annually as part of the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center‚Äôs Presenting Series season. Third Coast Percussion assumed the position of Ensemble-in-Residence at Notre Dame in 2013. The album Third Coast Percussion  Steve Reich won a Grammy Award for Best Chamber Music/Small Ensemble Performance, becoming the first percussion group to win in a chamber music category. Third Coast Percussion has released albums on the Mode, New Focus, New Amsterdam, and Cedille record labels. The quartet endorses and performs exclusively with Pearl/Adams Musical Instruments, Zildjian Cymbals, Remo Drumheads, and Vic Firth sticks and mallets. History =Formation and early years= In 2004, original members, Anthony Calabrese, Robert Dillon, Jacob Nissly, and David Skidmore were all percussionists with the Civic Orchestra of Chicago, as well as students of Northwestern University. Along with their performance work with the ensemble, they formed a chamber percussion group that traveled throughout the Chicago area, performing at Chicago Public Schools and city colleges as an educational device. Although not using their signature title, it was from this humble engagement that the group Third Coast Percussion was created. The first shows by Third Coast Percussion that were non-educational based were performed in the summer of 2005, the very first two being performed at Northwestern and the Music Institute of Chicago in Evanston. In the summer of that same year, the group took a slight turn when Jake Nissly left for graduate studies at Juilliard School of music As a result, Peter Martin, a Northwestern percussionist pursuing a doctoral degree, filled the spot in the group. In addition to Nisslys departure, member Anthony Calabrese would move on to concentrate on his school-work at Northwestern at the time. Former Member Owen Clayton Condon, an alumnus from Northwestern and professor at Northeastern, would take Calabrese's place. Rehearsing during the night at Northwestern and Northeastern University for a brief time, the group began tackling their goals as an ensemble. The unique concept of Third Coasts repertoire was something that the group developed early on, influenced by a series of restraints that they dealt with. As a young group, many of their gigs, such as performances at the Empty Bottle, were small venues with a limited amount of space to perform. This would put a restriction on the number of instruments and the type of repertoire performed by the group. These restrictions were instrumental in the selection process of the music that Third Coast performed, as well as the development of the group‚Äôs style. On February 12, 2006, TCP played at the Neo- Futurarium, a gig that turned out to break open the doors for the group. It was at this performance that they first met Ethelbert Williams, as of 2020 a longtime board member of TCP. Williams, an expert in marketing, was a member of the audience at this concert. Impressed with the ensembles performance, Mr. Williams decided to invite TCP to work with him. Ethelbert Williams was essential in helping to create a presentable package for the group that they could promote to the music world on a much broader scale. =Present day= Third Coast Percussion has since evolved from solely acting as an educational group associated with the Civic Orchestra of Chicago, to a full-time working music ensemble, with Sean Connors assuming Condon's place in the ensemble in 2013. =Grammy Award= Third Coast Percussion won a Grammy Award for Best Chamber Music/Small Ensemble Performance for their album Third Coast Percussion  Steve Reich, released on Cedille Records. They are the first percussion group to win in a chamber music category. The album featured entirely music of American composer Steve Reich in honor of his eightieth birthday and received high praise from Reich himself: \\"When I heard the Third Coast CD of a number of my pieces...I thought, 'Wow, you know, I've never heard them this way.' You have to literally lean in to listen. Which is a very good way to listen. And the whole thing just knocked my socks off.\\" Third Coast Percussion performed music from the album at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards and were joined by jazz saxophonist Ravi Coltrane for the performance.

Larger facilities instead have a remote communications outlet (RCO) installed, which allows pilots to communicate directly over a remote radio transmitter/receiver with the facility. A GCO instead connects with the aircraft/pilot via a radio transmitter/receiver, but with the ground facility via a telephone connection. Special electronic components in the GCO connect the radio communications from the aircraft to the telephone communications from the facility. Because GCO units are not part of the official air traffic control radio system, they may not receive regular operational status checks and therefore may experience unreported outages. However, since they do not provide guaranteed service, they also entail lower costs and can be installed at smaller locations that cannot afford an RCO. In areas with cellular telephone coverage, the use of a GCO has sometimes been replaced by simply calling the air traffic control facility directly. The system uses the airport's listed frequency ( 121.725 or 135.075 ). The system is activated with four \\"key clicks\\" on the VHF radio to contact the appropriate ATC facility or six \\"key strokes\\" to contact the FSS. There is a timer on the modem connection. If no voice is heard for a preset interval, the system disconnects. The VHF transceiver is very low power, 2‚Äì5 watts, which sometimes limits access.

Built in 1902, it is an important local example of Italian Renaissance architecture, designed by the architect William R. Miller. It served as the city's first purpose-built high school, and has been converted to residential use. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Description and history The former Jordan School building stands on the southeast side of Wood Street, in a residential area between the city's commercial downtown and the Bates College campus. It occupies a lot that spans all the way to Nichols Street, with its principal facade facing a parking lot to the southwest. It is a three-story masonry structure, built out of brick with granite trim. The main facade is fourteen bays wide, divided into three sections separated by slightly projecting entry and stair houses. The outer sections are three bays wide, with keystoned sash windows on the first two floors. The projecting sections, two bays wide, have entrances recessed in Romanesque round-arch openings. The center section is the most elaborate, with paired windows separated by pilasters on the second and third floors, topped by rounded arches above. This section has a higher roofline than the outer wings, joining the pyramid-roofed projecting sections. The school in 2014 The city's high school was founded in 1850, and originally met at a site now occupied by the Dingley Building. In 1859 it moved to a building in Main Street. In 1902, this school was built, becoming the first dedicated home to the high school. In 1931, the high school was moved to a new facility, and this became a junior high school, serving in that role until 1983. The building was then converted to apartments. The school was named for Lyman G. Jordan, principal of the first high school for 15 years, Bates College professor of chemistry and biology, and member of the Lewiston school board.

Early life and career =Actress= Royle was born in New York City to playwright Edwin Milton Royle and actress Selena Fetter (April 12, 1860 - May 10, 1955). She had an older sister, Josephine Fetter Royle (1901‚Äì1992). Her mother recounted in a newspaper article that she used to take Selena along with her to her rehearsals and performances. One night, then seven-year-old Selena went missing. While the mother frantically searched for her, holding up act two, the audience became restless. The youngster finally turned up - she had gone on stage dressed in her mother's second-act costume; she made a bow, much to the audience's amusement. She later remarked, \\"And that is the first time I was ever on stage, and I liked it so well I stayed.\\" Her father wrote the 1921 Broadway play Lancelot and Elaine to provide both her and sister Josephine with their first professional roles, as Guinevere and Elaine respectively. Eventually, she landed a part on her own in the 1923 Theatre Guild production of Peer Gynt, with Joseph Schildkraut, and became a respected Broadway actress. She made one film in the 1930s, Misleading Lady, but otherwise worked on the stage and on radio. Royle began her radio career in 1926 or 1927 and performed \\"almost continuously since\\", according to a 1939 newspaper item. Her body of work includes playing the title role in Hilda Hope, M.D. She also played Martha Jackson in Woman of Courage, Mrs. Allen in Against the Storm, Joan in The O'Neills, and Mrs. Gardner in Betty and Bob, and appeared in Kate Hopkins, Angel of Mercy. In the 1940s, she returned to film and had a successful run, mainly playing maternal characters such as the bereaved mother of The Fighting Sullivans (1944), mother to Jane Powell in the big screen adaptation of A Date with Judy (1948) and the title character's mother opposite Ingrid Bergman as Joan of Arc (1948). =HUAC= She made several appearances on early television. However, in 1951, she refused to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee. She sued the American Legion, which had published Red Channels, in which her name was listed, and won but her acting career ended, her last film being Murder Is My Beat (1955). =Writer= She also wrote several books, including Guadalajara: as I Know It, Live It, Love It (which went through several editions) and a couple of cookbooks, and some magazine articles. She was the \\"radio editor\\" of the short-lived New York periodical Swank. Personal life and death During the early Depression, Selena Royle and Elizabeth Beatty started the Actors Free Dinner Club in Union Church on West 48th Street. It was organized so that those who came to volunteer and those who came out of necessity were indistinguishable from each other. Her first husband was Earle Larrimore, a cousin of actress Laura Hope Crews. They married in 1932 and divorced in 1942. She was married to actor Georges Renavent from 1948 until his death in 1969. Royle died in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico, on April 23, 1983, aged 78.

It was built in 1893 as an orphanage for boys, a role it served until about 1970. It is now known as Healy Terrace, and is used for affordable senior housing. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, where it is listed as Healy Asylum. It was named for Msgr. James Augustine Healy, the bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Portland at the time of its construction. Description and history The former Healy Asylum building is located facing Ash Street and occupying about 1/2 of a city block bounded by Ash, Bates, Blake, and Pine Streets, a short way east of Lewiston's downtown business district. It is a 3-1/2 story building, built out of brick with granite trim, and set on a high brick foundation. It is topped by a mansard roof pierced by gabled dormers, with chimneys topped by decorative brick corbelling. The building is H-shaped, with a central section and two flanking wings that project to the front and back. The entrance is in the center section, sheltered by a wooden portico with bracketed cornice and fully pedimented gable. The origins of the asylum begin with the arrival in 1878 of Grey Nuns from Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec to teach in Lewiston's parochial school, which was filled with the children of French Canadian mill workers. In 1892 the Grey Nuns decided to give up teaching, but were persuaded to take on instead an orphanage for boys, to match services they were providing for orphaned girls at their hospital. This building was built in 1893 with the approval and support of Msgr. James Augustine Healy, the bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Portland, for whom it was named. The building was designed by Jefferson Louis Coburn, a local architect. In addition to providing services to orphaned boys, the nuns also took on troubled youth. Funding was a regular source of friction between the nuns and the diocese, which places boys from Portland and elsewhere in the orphanage. The facility operated until 1973, and has since been converted into senior housing.

Built in 1892, to a design by John Calvin Spofford, it is a distinctive regional example of Baroque Revival architecture. It is the city's second city hall, the first succumbing to fire in 1890. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Description Lewiston's city hall is located in downtown Lewiston, at the southwest corner of Pine and Park Streets, across Park Street from Kennedy Park. The building is 90 feet wide, 160 feet long, and 185 feet in height from the sidewalk to the roof spire. Its main block is three stories in height, with the lower part of the ground floor finished in granite, and the rest of the structure finished in brick with granite trim. A slightly projecting center section houses the main entrance, recessed in a Romanesque rounded arch opening faced in granite, and rises to an ornately decorate tower with a belfry below a distinctive concave-sloped roof. History Lewiston City Hall in 1908 Construction began on Lewiston's original City Hall in July 1871, and it was dedicated in December 1872. The plans were drawn up by Mr. Meacham of Boston. It was made of brick with granite trim in a Gothic style with a mansard roof. It was built at a cost of $200,000. The original city hall had 80 rooms, including the police department and prison in the basement, the library and post office on the first floor. The building stood for 18 years, until January 7, 1890, when a fire broke out behind an elevator wall, destroying the building. The uninsured city hall was deemed a total loss. The present city hall was constructed, on the same site but with a smaller footprint, beginning on October 1, 1890, and was dedicated on May 19, 1892. The total cost of construction, including demolishing the remains of the original building, came to $180,298.40. It was designed by John Calvin Spofford, an architect based in Boston, Massachusetts.

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Description and history The Odd Fellows Block is located on Lisbon Street, Lewiston's principal commercial downtown thoroughfare, between Ash and Pine Streets. It is a three-story masonry structure, built of brick with stone trim. The facade is irregularly arranged, its nine bays articulated in a 2-3-1-3 pattern by stone piers on the first floor, and paneled brick pilasters at the upper levels. The storefronts feature wood paneling above and below plate glass windows, and recessed entrances. The upper levels are separated by a stone stringcourse, and feature sash windows set in pointed-arch openings with alternating stone and brick voussoirs, and stone keystones. A wooden cornice projects at the top. The building was constructed in 1876, originally to house retail space on the ground floor, and meeting facilities of the local chapter of the International Order of Odd Fellows (IOOF). The IOOF hall was used by a large number of local organizations as a meeting space. The building was designed by George M. Coombs, then early in his long and prolific career, in partnership with William H. Stevens, who died in 1880.

Description and history Lyceum Hall is located on the west side of Lisbon Street, the principal commercial street in downtown Lewiston. It is nominally a 3-1/2 story masonry structure, with a mansard roof providing space for a full fourth floor. The building facade is symmetrical, with a central one-bay section flanked by identical two-bay sections. The central section has the recessed building entrance on the first floor, and narrow round-arch windows on the second and third floors, set in a recessed brick panel. The remaining ground-floor bays all have commercial glass storefront windows, articulated by stone or brick piers. The outer bays on the second floor have segmented-arch windows, while those on the third floor are round-arched. The fourth floor dormers have segmented-arch windows. The main cornice (below the steep mansard roof section) is bracketed and dentillated, and a secondary cornice at the transition between the roof sections is dentillated. The hall was built in 1872 to a design by Charles F. Douglas, a prominent local architect. Douglas designed a number of Lewiston's downtown buildings during a flurry of construction after the American Civil War, but this is the only one to survive relatively intact. It originally housed a 1000-seat theater on the third floor, which was the city's only public performance venue until the construction of the city's Music Hall.

Its main attraction is the high Grandes Chutes waterfall of the Coulonge River and long cement log slide. Although the last log drive ended here in 1982, the waterfalls and gorge of the Coulonge River enjoy a substantial popularity among tourists, hikers and cyclists for playing a tremendous role in the reimagining of ecotourism in an area no longer able to survive upon resource extraction alone.  History  At the beginning of the 19th century, early forestry operations pushed tall white pines, squared by axe, down into the Ottawa River, destined to be sold by auction near the Canadian Parliament buildings and exported to England where they were used to build ships during the Berlin Decree proclaimed by Napoleon Bonaparte. Timber from the area played a large part in the construction of cities along the American East Coast including Boston and New York City. In the 1830s and 1840s, George Bryson Sr. settled near the mouth of the Coulonge River, an Ottawa River tributary - acquiring thousands of acres of timber rights including directly surrounding what is known as The Grandes Chutes, located approximately 15 kilometers north of the Ottawa River itself. In 1843, Bryson built the Marchand covered bridge. The Coulonge Chutes As more settlers arrived in the area from Ireland, Scotland, the United States, Germany and Poland, many small towns along the length of the river were established. Bryson constructed a sawmill on the river's edge around 1850. Because the Coulonge Falls were a huge obstacle in the transportation of local timber, a massive wooden log slide was constructed to enable wood to pass freely over the treacherous drop. In 1923, a cement slide replaced the wooden chute. J.E. Boyle, constructed a sawmill in Davidson - still in operation today - exporting to the United States and other Canadian provinces. The Coulonge River and the log slide remained in use for log drives until 1982. The site became a public park in 1985 when a reception chalet was opened.

Plot ;Loneliness (Thai title - ‡πÄ‡∏´‡∏á‡∏≤, Ngao; directed by Youngyooth Thongkonthun) Pin, a young woman stuck in her apartment due to the cast on her leg, communicates with the outside world via cell phone and text messages. She complains to her boyfriend, Puak, who went on a camping trip in Chiang Mai, that she feels so lonely. Every night, Pin exchanges text messages with a stranger, who asks to befriend her and seems friendly enough. The stranger says that he is in somewhere \\"cramped\\" for 100 days and is oddly only able to be contacted at night. After sending the mysterious stranger her photo, Pin asks for one in return and is sent the same photo. When she questions him, he says he is in the picture next to her. A ghostly face is slightly visible next to Pin's smiling face. As she researches recent deaths, Pin discovers that the son of Princess Sophia of Virnistan died and was buried with a cellphone so he can communicate with Princess Sophia‚Äîhis mother, or to connect to someone else whenever he feels lonely. Pin then gets a text from the stranger, saying that he will come to her place now. All of the lights begin to go out and Pin cries in fear. She is then assaulted by the ghost and is thrown out of the window to her death. A scene from the past shows the prince receiving a text message from his girlfriend ending the relationship which causes him to commit suicide by walking in front of a taxi cab causing an accident, the same accident that was the cause of Pin's broken leg as she was inside the cab. ;Deadly Charm (Thai title - ‡∏¢‡∏±‡∏ô‡∏ï‡πå‡∏™‡∏±‡πà‡∏á‡∏ï‡∏≤‡∏¢, Yan Sang Tai; directed by Paween Purikitpanya) A nerdy student named Ngid sees his school friends take some drugs, and he is beaten to death. One of the gang's member, Pink, is worried but fails to stop her friends from bullying Ngid. Unfortunately, when he is beaten, he curses his friends on a deadly charm, which requires a photo of a dead person with his/her eyes open. Things get worse when everything keeps moving by itself when ordered by Ngid's soul, and one by one the drug addicts start dying. Even though Pink did not beat him, Ngid's soul decides not to spare her too because she had seen it all yet had not do anything to help him. In the end, a police officer comes by to warn her not to go outside, and is shocked to see Pink laughing after having gouged her own eyes; because the curse requires the victim to see Ngid, he cannot harm her anymore now that she has gotten rid of her ability to see. It is revealed that the person in the photo Ngid used to practice the charm is Pin, the disabled young woman in the first story who died with her eyes open. ;The Man In The Middle (Thai title - ‡∏Ñ‡∏ô‡∏Å‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏á, Khon Klang; directed by Banjong Pisanthanakun) Four rafting-lovers, Aey, Ter, Shin, and Phuak are rafting in a lonely jungle in Chiang Mai. At night in the camp, Aey tells his friends that if he dies, the person who sleep in the middle will be the next to die with him. The next day, when they are swimming in the river, Aey drowns and cannot be located. The rest are scared, but decide to stay and fight over who gets to sleep in the middle (they are frightened by Aey's story). That night, Aey comes back, but strange events happening afterwards make his friends suspicious. Shin then finds Aey's body. Frightened, they go running in the woods but are shocked to find their own dead bodies. It is revealed that all of them had died when the raft crumpled over, but only Aey accepted his death, while the rest continued to ignore the fact that they had died. At the end, the four become ghosts together. ;Flight 244 (Thai title - ‡πÄ‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà‡∏¢‡∏ß‡∏ö‡∏¥‡∏ô 224, Thiao Bin 244; directed by Parkpoom Wongpoon) Flight attendant Pim is secretly having an affair with Prince Albert of Virnistan. One day she is ordered to go aboard an airliner on a charter flight for Princess Sophia, the wife of the Prince. Her fellow stewardess, Tui, is unable to attend the flight as her brother Ter had been found drowned in Chiang Mai. What was supposed to be an ordinary flight turns into something tragic when the princess forms an allergic reaction to Pim's lunch as it contains shrimp to which the princess is allergic to. After the royal house of Virnistan requests that her corpse be sent back immediately for cremation, Pim is required to remain on the plane and escort the body - the only passenger - for the return flight. As the Princess tries to get out of her shroud, Pim's worst nightmare begins. When the plane lands, Pim's body is found lying on the floor, under the feet of the intact enshrouded corpse of Princess Sophia.

Life and career Glass was born and raised in the suburbs of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He first began performing stand-up comedy in Philadelphia in 1982 while attending Conestoga High School. He made his earliest television appearances in the late 80s on A&E;'s An Evening at the Improv and in the early 1990s on several Comedy Central stand-up programs. He is Jewish and dyslexic.https://theinterrobang.com/todd-glass-gets-standing-o-jimmy-kimmel- live/ Glass is perhaps best known for his appearances as a contestant on the second and third seasons of NBC's Last Comic Standing and has appeared regularly on programs such as Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Late Night with Conan O'Brien, Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn, The Dennis Miller Show, Politically Incorrect, Louie, Tosh.0, Mr. Show with Bob and David, Preston and Steve and had his own Comedy Central Presents special in 2001. He co-hosted the podcast Comedy And Everything Else with fellow comics Jimmy Dore and Stefan√© Zamorano, but left the podcast in September 2009. His departure was officially announced on November 28, 2009 episode and Glass has returned as a guest on several episodes since leaving. Glass with Zach Galifianakis in 2012 In 2001, Glass released his debut stand-up album called Vintage Todd Glass and Other Crap and was also featured on the two CD set of the Comedy Death-Ray, a compilation album of various stand-up comics performing at the popular Comedy Death-Ray comedy showcase at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater in Los Angeles. His album Thin Pig, was released on July 7, 2009 on Comedy Central Records.

Glass also tours regularly. Personal life On April 16, 2010, Glass collapsed backstage at a Los Angeles comedy club after suffering a heart attack. Glass appeared on The Bonnie Hunt Show only nine days later, talking about his recent \\"brush with death\\". Glass said he found out he had 100% blockage in his arteries and following an angioplasty, declared that he was doing fine.Todd Glass Doesn't Let Heart Attacks Get In His Way Glass blamed these health problems on bad genetics. Both parents had a history of heart problems; Todd's father had his first heart attack at age 30 and died of a subsequent heart attack at age 46. On December 20, 2012, Glass talked about his heart attack on the Adam Carolla Show, and said that he had lost 30 pounds since the incident. He had also stopped smoking (he previously maintained a \\"pack-a-month\\" habit), and that he had started taking the drug Lipitor to prevent further heart attacks. Glass came out publicly as gay on January 16, 2012, during an episode of WTF with Marc Maron. The information had previously been known to friends and family, and Glass explained that he was worried about coming out publicly, but the recent string of suicide among LGBT youth motivated him to do so.

It was built in 1874 for a spur line connecting Lewiston and Auburn to the Grand Trunk Railway, to which it was leased. It is through this station that many of the area's French Canadian immigrants arrived to work in the area mills. The station was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Description and history Lewiston's Grand Trunk station stands in its mill district, at the northwest corner of Lincoln and Beech Streets. It is a rectangular single-story brick building, with a gabled roof. The roof has extended eaves supported by large brackets, and there are finial turrets near its gable ends. Windows and doorways are set in segmented- arch openings, with granite sills. The end facing Lincoln Street is adorned with remnants of painting identifying the Grand Trunk Railway. The station was built in 1874 by the Lewiston and Auburn Railroad Company and leased to the Grand Trunk Railway, connecting Lewiston with the Canadian National Railway. Many French-Canadian immigrants arrived in the Lewiston-Auburn area via the station, leading the building to be known as the \\"Ellis Island\\" of Lewiston. After rail service to the station stopped, it lay abandoned for decades, and various uses for the building were proposed. In 2010, the Lewiston and Auburn Railroad Company was awarded a Recovery Act grant by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to renovate Grand Trunk Railroad Station. Although the building presently houses a restaurant, proposals are being developed to reintroduce service on the line, connecting Lewiston and Auburn/Lewiston Municipal Airport.

Fish and game councils are regionally autonomous bodies (similar to district or regional councils, but with far less functions) governed by elected fish and game councillors, who are elected every three years by adult full season license-holders across the respective region. The New Zealand Fish and Game Council is made up of one representative from each of the regional councils. Councils employ managers and staff, and the New Zealand Fish and Game Council employs a director; the role is currently held by Bryce Johnson. This model of user-pays, user-says fishery management is unique in the world, but has existed in New Zealand for close to 150 years. Fish and game councils are the successor of the New Zealand acclimatisation societies, which introduced many new species to New Zealand. Fish and game councils are required by the Conservation Act 1987 to advocate for the interests of anglers and hunters in the statutory planning process. This advocacy role is vital as whilst fish and game councils manage species, they do not manage their habitats (for the most part). Habitats of sports fish and game-birds in New Zealand are the responsibility of various local and regional councils, and also the underlying landowner. Therefore, advocacy in the public planning processes that set the rules for these environments is an important role of Fish and Game. Fish and game councils were set up under the Conservation Act 1987 with the statutory responsibility for the sports of freshwater sport fishing and game-bird hunting. They are funded almost entirely from the sale of hunting and fishing licenses, and receive no government funding. There is a large base of volunteer rangers (warranted officers under the Conservation Act 1987) who undertake compliance and enforcement work for the Councils. Fish & Game started the high profile \\"dirty dairying\\" campaign to highlight the problems caused by intensification of dairy farming on the ecological health of New Zealand's fresh water environment. The campaign led to the creation of the Dairying and Clean Streams Accord, a voluntary agreement between Fonterra, the Ministry for the Environment, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and regional councils. In October 2015, Fish & Game resigned from the Land and Water Forum, a group set up by the government and made up of 50 environmental, recreational and industry groups. Johnson justified the move by claiming that the government had walked away from the collaborative approach, whilst the Minister of Conservation, Nick Smith, wondered \\"what had changed\\". The new director of Greenpeace Aotearoa New Zealand, Russel Norman, explained the move by Fish & Game having to watch pollution in waterways getting worse. In an editorial, The Press hinted at widespread dissatisfaction among the environmental groups on the Land and Water Forum, and wondered whether other groups would follow Fish & Game's lead to also resign.

Built in 1898, it is one of the least- altered designs of the important local architectural firm Coombs, Gibbs & Wilkinson. Its only significant alterations were in 1926 and the 1940s, when it served as a retail space occupied by Grant's Clothing for many years. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. It continues to house retail and other commercial tenants. Description and history The Lewiston Trust and Safe Deposit Company building is located on the east side of Lisbon Street, Lewiston's principal downtown commercial street, between Main and Ash Streets. It is a three-story masonry structure, with party walls directly abutting the neighboring buildings. Its facade is ashlar granite, with quoined corners and a metal cornice. Its ground floor retail space has a Moderne style recessed entrance with flanking display areas set with black panels above and below, and is topped by a projecting triangular-fronted marquee. The second floor has four sash windows set in round-arch openings. The third floor has a grouping of five narrower windows, with pilasters separating the windows of the group and an entablature above. The Lewiston Trust Company commissioned the construction of this building in 1898, and occupied it until 1921, when it moved to larger quarters across the street. The building was purchased in 1926 by W. Grant, owner of a clothing store. He made alterations to the interior to accommodate the retail function, but retained significant architectural elements, including marble flooring and stairs, basement level waiting rooms, and the bank president's office on the second floor, which has rich decorative woodwork. The building design was the work of Harry Wilkinson, then in partnership with George Coombs and Eugene Gibbs. Of the many local designs of this prolific firm, it is one of the least-altered and best-preserved.

Built in 1827, the Federal style house is one of the oldest on the south side of Auburn, and is most notable as the home of Edward Little, a major landowner and proponent of the development of Auburn. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Description and history The Edward Little House stands on the west side of Main Street, south of Auburn's downtown area, at the corner of Vine Street. It is a -story wood- frame structure, five bays wide, with a center entry flanked by sidelight windows and topped by a fanlight. A two-story ell extends from the southern part of the rear. The interior is well preserved, its Federal period details including a handsome curving central staircase. The interior has a typical center hall layout, with a double parlor on the right and a large dining room on the left. The sections of the parlor are separated by an elaborately carved archway. The house was built in 1827 by Edward Little, a native of Newbury, Massachusetts who moved here in 1826 and spent the rest of his life here. He was the beneficiary of a large land inheritance, which originally include significant holdings in Auburn, Lewiston, and surrounding communities. Little was well known for the many gifts he made to the growing community, supporting both religious and civic institutions.National Register nomination for Main Street Historic District; available by request from the National Park Service See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Androscoggin County, Maine References Category:Houses completed in 1827 Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Maine Category:Houses in Auburn, Maine Category:National Register of Historic Places in Androscoggin County, Maine Category:Historic district contributing properties in Maine Category:Federal architecture in Maine ","title":"Edward Little House"},{"id":"17417592","text":"The Androscoggin County Courthouse and Jail is located at 2 Turner Street in Auburn, Maine, the county seat of Androscoggin County. The original portion of the large brick Renaissance Revival complex was designed by Gridley James Fox Bryant and was built in 1857, with a sympathetic enlargement c. 1915-20. The jail was expanded in 1970 and 1990, and is now accessed via an entrance on Pleasant Street. The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 for its architecture and its association with the history of Auburn and the county, particularly with respect to the contentious debate over the choice of county seat in the 1850s. Description and history Androscoggin County Courthouse in 2017 The Androscoggin County complex occupies a significant portion of a city block in the heart of Auburn, Maine, on a rise overlooking the Androscoggin River. It is bounded on the south by Court Street, the east by Turner Street, the west by Pleasant Street, and the north by Hampshire Street. The complex shares this block with the Court Street Baptist Church and the local YMCA. The original portion of the complex occupies the southeast corner of the block, the junction of Turner and Court Streets. The main block housing the original courthouse occupies that spot, and is a rectangular structure oriented east-west, two stories in height, set on a basement that appears partially raised due to the sloping lot. The main entrance faces toward Turner Street, looking down toward the river. This section is topped by a steeply-pitched hip roof and an octagonal tower with cupola, and features the most elaborate styling. A narrow two-story section extends northward from this section, joining it to a rectangular block, smaller than the courthouse, that houses the original jail. Additions have been made to the west of the connecting section and attached to the west end of the courthouse block. The jail block has a single-story extension to the rear, and is further connected to the larger modern jail facility to the west by a narrow hyphen. Androscoggin County was formed in 1854 out of portions of four adjacent counties, primarily to address the burgeoning growth of the communities of Auburn and Lewiston, which lies just across the river. A fierce debate ensued over which would serve as the county seat, which was won by Auburn in 1854. The county commissioners sought to immediately solidify the decision, commissioning the design of this complex from Boston architect Gridley James Fox Bryant. The courthouse was ready for use in 1857. The first major addition, made in 1915-20, was that to the west end of the courthouse, done stylistically sympathetic to Bryant's design. The jail was twice enlarged, in 1970 and 1990, resulting in the modern jail facility (also faced mainly in brick) to the west of the old jail facility. The third floor of the complex is now home to the Androscoggin County Historical Society, which has a small museum there. The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

A graduate of Bowdoin College, Dingley was for 57 years chief editor of the Lewiston Evening Journal, which he and his brother converted to a daily newspaper when they acquired it in 1861. Dingley was innovative in the early adoption of the telegraph for transmission of news reports, and oversaw a great expansion of the newspaper's facilities in 1898. He was a local patron of the arts, and supported the efforts of F. E. Stanley to produce the Stanley Steamer automobile.

The library building was expanded in 1956 and again in 2006 to accommodate a growing user community and additional services. The current library is twice the size of the original 1904 building. Care was taken during the 2006 expansion to stay true to the original architecture of the building, earning the library a Statewide Historic Preservation Honor Award from Maine Preservation in 2007. In the fall of 2012, the library opened a Media Lab that provides access to computers, cameras, scanners, and other equipment for creating digital media such as video, photographs, and music. An independently owned cafe operates on the ground floor of the library. Teen participation became an integral part of the library when in the summer of 2003 the first Teen Summer Reading Program was introduced by librarian Sally Holt with the support of Rosemary Waltos, Director and Steve Bouchard, Reference Department Head. Friends of the Auburn Public Library played an instrumental role by funding the program. Friends of Maine Libraries continued funding the program that fall.

It was the first major mill on the Auburn side of the Androscoggin River. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, and is now residential housing. Description and history The Barker Mill is set on the south bank of the Little Androscoggin River, a short way upriver from its confluence with the Big Androscoggin River. It is a five-story brick structure, 33 bays in width, with a mansard roof and a tower section that projects from its front (east-facing) facade. Its sash windows are general set in slightly-recessed panels, separated by pilaster-like piers and horizontal bands.

The fourteen houses in the district represent a cross-section of residential development during Auburn's growth between about 1825 and 1925. The district extends along Main Street, from Drummond Street south just past Elm Street, and includes a few houses on Elm and Vine Streets. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description Auburn rose on the banks of the Androscoggin River with the humble beginnings of a log driver's camp in the late 19th century, and did not benefit in the 19th century the way neighboring Lewiston did, which had a more suitable siting for textile mills. A bridge across the river in 1822-23 spurred some development, including along the road which is now Main Street. The Greek Revival Edward Little House, 217 Main Street, is the oldest house in the district, and was built in 1826 by Edward Little, a major proponent of development in Auburn from the 1820s to the 1840s.National Register nomination for Main Street Historic District; available by request from the National Park Service The arrival of the railroad in 1848, and the choice of Auburn in 1854 to be the seat of the new Androscoggin County cemented the importance of the area where downtown Auburn is now located, and prompted further residential development in this district. Several Italianate houses were built in 1850s, such as the Roak House (20 Elm Street, built c. 1854) and the Reynolds-Hasty House (201 Main Street, c. 1850). In the late 19th century a number of high-quality Queen Anne houses were built in the district. Conspicuous among them are the Penley House at 233 Main Street, designed by George M. Coombs and built in 1890; it occupies a prominent position at the corner of Main and Elm Streets. The A. A. Garcelon House at 223 Main Street is probably the most elaborate of Auburn's Queen Anne houses, designed by Coburn and Sons and built in 1890 for a local merchant. It exhibits the busy exterior typical of the style, with projecting sections, elaborate porches, and a domed tower, and was listed separately on the National Register for its architecture. In the early 20th century several Colonial Revival houses were built, and a number of houses had Colonial Revival additions and alterations made. The Reynolds-Hasty House is an example of the latter, with a porch and picture windows dating from that time. The Horatio G. Foss House at 14 Elm Street is the most significant house built in this time, designed by Gibbs and Pulsifer and built in 1914 for a shoe manufacturer.

Built in 1879, it is one of the few surviving 19th-century fire stations in the state of Maine. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Description and history The former Auburn Engine House is located at the southeast corner of Spring and Court Streets, overlooking the city's central business district. It is a two-story rectangular brick structure, with a truncated hip roof and a granite foundation. A square wood-frame belfry rises from the western end of the flat section at the center of the roof. The north-facing front had four engine bays, the rightmost of which has been converted to a retail entrance; the other three retain their garage bay doors. Between the first and second bays from the left is a pedestrian entrance topped by a panel identifying the building. The second floor is relatively unmodified, with groups of windows (2-3-1-2) set under segmented brick arch panels, with granite sills and lintels. The cornice is lined with wooden brackets. The first station in this area was a private company established in 1849, when it was known as Lewiston Falls and was still part of adjacent Lewiston. In 1859 the Auburn Village Corporation, which operated the fire protection service, purchased this lot and built a wood-frame fire house on it. This corporation was acquired by the city of Auburn in 1867. A new fire house was built on the site in 1870 to accommodate new equipment; it was destroyed by fire (probably started in its stables) in 1878. This fire house was completed the following year. It remained in active service until 1971, and has now been adapted for use as a commercial/retail space.

It was designed by Auburn architect Elmer I. Thomas to harmonize with the adjacent Lewiston City Hall (built 1890-92), and is one of its finest Victorian commercial buildings. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Atkinson Building is set at the eastern corner of Lisbon and Pine Streets in the heart of Lewiston's central business district. It occupies one-half of a lot on which the city's first city hall stood until destroyed by fire in 1890; the present City Hall was built on the other half of the lot in 1890-92. The six-story brick and stone structure presents five bays on Pine Street, three on Lisbon Street, and one angled at the corner. The principal ground floor commercial space, originally occupied by the Atkinson Home Furnishings Company, was entered via an entrance at the corner, and took up two bays on Lisbon and three on Pine Street, which are filled with plate glass windows. The third bay on Lisbon houses an entrance giving access to the upper floors, while the remaining bays on Pine Street house, which originally housed another doorway and a pair of small windows, have been replaced by plate glass, expanding the ground-floor retail space. A granite course separates the first and second levels. The second level bays are filled with pairs of sash windows, except the corner bay, which has a single window, and are topped by a band of brick and another granite course. The third and fourth levels repeat the arrangement of windows, with granite lintels topping each window. The fifth level windows are set in pairs in Romanesque arches, an echo of the Romanesque entrance arch to City Hall on Pine Street. The single window in the corner bay has a round-arch top. The arches are outlined in terra cotta, as are the pilaster-like piers which separate the window pairs.

The area was inhabited by Iroquois Indians before the coming of the British. Contrary to local belief, the mount was not inhabited by the natives due to a lack of a stable water supply.

Description and history The Continental Mill Housing blocks are located on the east side of Oxford Street on the west side of central Lewiston, facing the former Continental Mill complex, which lies between them and the Androscoggin River. The two buildings are nearly identical four-story brick structures, with shallow-pitch hip roofs with bracketed cornice, interior end chimneys, and windows with granite lintels and sills. The south building differs from the north one slightly, with a wooden cupola set near the front, and a colonnaded wooden porch on its north side. Each block is ten bays wide and six deep, with a pair of recessed entries. The site of Continental Mill originally had a small wooden mill, built in 1858, when it was purchased in 1866 by the Continental Company. It replaced this modest structure with a much larger complex, and required housing to accommodate the large influx of workers. To this end it built a series of these tenement houses across the canal and street from the mill, a practice typical of other mill owners in the area. At that time, the property fronted the canal, with a lawn and trees presenting a dignified atmosphere. These buildings were designed by Amos D. Lockwood and supervised by Albert H.

It consists of a two-story mansard-roofed main section, from which a three-story tower and single-story ell, also with mansard roofs, project toward the Pierce Street side. The tower's roof is capped by original iron cresting. The roofs are pierced by gabled dormers with sash windows set in segmented-arch openings on the main roof lines, and with fixed-pane windows set in rounded oblong openings in the tower's roof. The building's main windows are sash, set in segmented-arch surrounds with keystones and ears. The interior retains original moulded woodwork and marble fireplaces. The house was built in 1873 for Dr. Milton Wedgewood, a prominent local doctor. It was designed by Charles F. Douglas, known for his large-scale work on Lewiston's mills. He was also known to tailor his designs to specific needs of his clients, in this case providing a consultation space for the doctor that was separated from his residence.

During colonial times, Christianity had a great influence on people and education was in the hands of Missionaries. As English was the official language then, there were only English medium schools. In the year 1900, three dignified people had a desire to start a school in Kokuvil. They were teachers of Jaffna Hindu College namely Mr. Somaskanthar, Mr. Chelliah and Mr. Appakuddi. With the support of well-wishers, a school was begun in Appakuddi‚Äôs house. When students came from other villages to attend the school the number of students increased and the school was recognised as primary institution and Mr. Chelliah was appointed as the first Head Master by The Jaffna Hindu Board. In 1926, Tamil divisions were extended up to grade 5 while the English division was upgraded to J.S.C and the school was promoted to \\"C\\" Grade. In 1939, the school status was upgraded to \\"B\\" Grade and for the first time, the inter-house athletic meet was held at the ground which was used for the railway station. Today the Technical College is situated there. The school flag was designed in white and red. A library too was formed. In 1966, school was promoted to super grade 1AB. In 1972 the KHC primary school was separated as a separate institution. Due to the civil war displacement, the college began to function in Thenmaradchi. In 1998, a computer lab was established with new facilities. In 2010, KHC celebrated its centenary year on a grant scale. History The colonial Government handed over the monopoly of education in Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) to anglicized clergy-the three Protestant Christian missions: The Anglican mission, The American mission, the Wesleyan mission-and gave them financial assistance because its definitive policy was to convert the people of Ceylon to Christianity through education. But Catholics, Buddhists, Hindus and Muslims were left out. Christopher Bonjean, a French missionary who was Bishop of Jaffna and later Bishop of Colombo, headed the agitation and strongly advocated a school system which permitted each religious denomination to open and conduct schools for its children with financial aid from the state. Front view of the Kokuvil Hindu College So in 1865, a committee was appointed by the legislative council to enquire into and report on education. On a recommendation by this committee, the Govt. abolished the Protestant dominated Central School Commission set up in 1841 and, in its place, established in 1869, the Department of Public Instruction, which now exists as the Department of Education. The committee also laid down two principles regarding Education in the country: (1. that every religious denomination could open schools for its children (2. that Government Grants would be given impartially to all such schools that provided a sound secular education. These principles formed the basis of the Denominational School System, which came into being and has been known also as the Grants-in-aid System or Assisted School System. Kokuvil Hindu College was one of the many schools that came under this system; this is confirmed by the following extract taken from the Jaffna Hindu College magazine (vol. 11) of March 1912 No.1. Kokuvil Hindu English School Mr. E. Chelliah, the Head master of the Primary Department of Jaffna Hindu College, has taken in-charge of this school as its permanent Head master. The school is gaining popularity and strength under the able supervision of Mr. Chelliah. The manager has applied to the Dept. of Public Instruction for its registration as a Grant-in-aid institution. This system of education developed extensively in the country and lasted nearly a century until the State take-over of schools in 1960. Thus, the state on the one hand and the religious denomination on the other became partners in education. Old Students' Associations Late Nagalingam Subramaniam(Markham Maniam) is seen acting at a drama organized by the Old Students' Association in Markham, Ontario, Canada in 2001. Kokkuvil Hindu College's Old Students' Associations are formed in number of countries and are very active. They contribute to the College's well-fare by raising fund organizing various programs. Canadian Old Students' Association[KHC OSA (Canada)] has been functioning since 1994 and actively involve in organizing cultural and social events called Magudam every year. The members of the Students association work actively in promoting the school and taking care of its various needs of infrastructure and basic amenities.

The school is fully sanctioned by the Navajo Nation since 1991 when the previous Navajo Academy closed due to lack of funding. The campus is currently undergoing a remodelling project for the past few years that includes new dormitories, classrooms, and an athletic sports complex. The school colors are black, turquoise, yellow, and white which represent the four seasons in Navajo Culture and the mascot is the eagle. The previous school colors for Navajo Mission and Navajo Academy were red, white, and blue. In 2021- 2022 school year, the school color will go back to red, white, and blue. History Navajo Prep was also known as Navajo Methodist Mission (1891-1979), Navajo Mission Academy (1979-mid 80's) and Navajo Academy (mid 80's-1991).Nathan J. Tohtsoni, Navajo Times article in 2001 =Navajo Methodist Mission= In 1891, Mary L. Eldridge and Miss Mary Raymond were sent by the Women‚Äôs Home Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church to build a mission to administer to the spiritual needs of the Navajos in Jewett, known today as Hogback, New Mexico. Mrs. Mary Eldridge Tripp initially opened her cabin in 1896 as a day school for Navajo children. In 1899, a three- bedroom school house opened in Hogback, New Mexico. The school house consisted of three rooms. Two rooms were used as dorms; one for a boy‚Äôs side and the other for a girl‚Äôs side, the last room which was in the middle of the two rooms was used as the classroom. In 1899, a boarding school was attached to the school building. There were thirteen Navajo children enrolled as boarding students and twenty three white students as day students. From 1896 to 1903, the cabin that started the United Methodist Mission School was expanded. There was a new school house, new dormitory, and a new dining room built. Native American children that attended the school were so far away from home that they had trouble adjusting to the life they now lived by. Teachers would get frustrated not at the children, but rather at the fact that their teaching techniques did not seem to be effective. Livestock and farming was a great part of the school‚Äôs historic character. Without the staff and students at the Mission, the students and staff would have little to eat because of how low the school budget became. More land was purchased in 1913 for fruit trees to be planted. There were one hundred acres of land for livestock and planting of crops, with ten acres of school ground. Children grew various types of food, such as fruit trees and vegetables. In 1911, Farmington experienced its heaviest rainfall ever. With a flood watch on 5 October 1911, children were still put to bed because the staff thought that the water would never reach their campus. On 6 October 1911 the Mission staff received a phone call at midnight that Durango, Colorado had three feet of water. Children were woken, given a blanket, and a loaf of bread. The flood hit the campus at four in the morning. The flood was half mile wide below the junction of the San Juan and Animas Rivers, and the main channel was forty feet deep. With no insurance, the loss to the Methodist amounted to $34,000. =Navajo Methodist Mission Academy/Navajo Academy= In 1976, the Navajo Tribal Council created the Navajo Academy with its first location in Ganado, Arizona. Navajo Academy and Navajo Mission had a similar academic goal that would help enhance the education of the Navajo people. With a similar mission, both schools decided to share the Mission campus in Farmington, New Mexico. This school became known as Navajo Methodist Mission Academy. The schools were not considered one school. Each school had different requirements and different objectives. Students were enrolled into different schools. During 1979, the Mission and the Academy combined their academic programs and came under the direction of one Board of Trustees. Over time the Navajo Mission School stopped its operation and the school became known as Navajo Academy. Navajo Academy continued to operate until July 1991.

Matthews or Marine Corps Rifle Range Camp Matthews or Marine Corps Rifle Range, La Jolla (prior to World War II)Camp La Jolla Military Park: Park Tour - Camp Matthews or more simply Camp Matthews was a United States Marine Corps military base from 1917 until 1964, when the base was decommissioned and transferred to the University of California to be part of the new University of California, San Diego (UCSD) campus. Over a million Marine recruits as well as other shooters (such as Marines stationed at Miramar) received their marksmanship training at this military base. Location and boundaries Camp Matthews was located in La Jolla, San Diego, California. The base's eastern boundary was present-day Regents Road. Its northern boundary was present-day Voigt Drive (formerly Old Miramar Road) and Matthews Lane and extended westward to Gilman Drive (formerly Coast Highway), which was its western boundary. The base's southern boundary was near present- day La Jolla Village Drive and a \\"panhandle\\" extended southward along what is today Interstate 5 and extended past present-day Nobel Drive. United States Army base Camp Callan was to the west of Camp Matthews. The Marine base at Miramar was about east of Camp Matthews. History =Early years= The Marine Corps leased of land from the City of San Diego in 1917 for use as a marksmanship training facility for Marine recruits being trained at Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego.Case Screens However, a permanent detachment of Marines was not stationed at this base until 1923. It was first used as a rifle range in late 1918.Historic California Posts: A Brief History of the U.S. Marine Corps in San Diego The Marines built the first eight targets of \\"A\\" range themselves with picks and shovels. In 1925 five more targets were added. The first headquarters buildings were built in 1927 and the first detachment barracks were built in 1928. During the 1930s and 1940s, more buildings and barracks were constructed as well more firing ranges. During these years, the base had no official name but was called Marine Rifle Range, La Jolla.Historic California Posts: A Brief History of the U.S. Marine Corps in San Diego In 1937, the U.S. government terminated the lease and acquired in fee from the City of San Diego. This acquisition consisted of the formerly leased area as well as additional land to the east. The government also leased an additional from the City of San Diego. This newly leased area was in the northeastern corner of the base. The total area of the base was then . Except for a few ranch houses, all of the area acquired was undeveloped at the time of acquisition. =World War II, Korean War and Early Vietnam Era years= After the attack on Pearl Harbor and the entry of the United States into World War II, the base was busier than ever. At the peak of the base's activity in 1944, it put 9,000 recruits through marksmanship training every three weeks, because MCRD was never suitable for this. Marine recruits from MCRD, completed their marksmanship training at Camp Matthews and marched from the camp back to the Recruit Depot with an over-night bivouac sleeping in shelter-half tents (pup-tents) . During these years, there were 700 permanent personnel stationed at the base. However, by the mid-1950s only 120 Marines were stationed at Camp Matthews. During World War II and the Korean War, more administrative buildings as well as street and utility systems were built. Most recruits lived in 6-man tents during their stay at the range. In 1960, part of the movie \\"The Outsider\\", a film about WW II Marine IRA Hayes, was filmed at Camp Matthews because recruits were being housed in WW II Style hard-back tents. Some Marine recruits served as extras in that filming. (Contributor's personal knowledge - I was there!) The camp was known as the Marine rifle range, without a formal name until WWII. The base was officially named Camp Calvin B. Matthews on March 23, 1942. It was named after Brigadier General Calvin B. Matthews, a Marine marksman of the 1930s. =Closing and transfer= As the community of La Jolla expanded after World War II, local people became more and more concerned over the close proximity of a military rifle range facility in their neighborhood. The La Jolla Town Council began trying to get the United States Navy to close Camp Matthews in 1956 but the Navy resisted. In 1959, Congressman Bob Wilson introduced a bill in Congress that would transfer Camp Matthews to the University of California for the planned San Diego campus. In 1962, Camp Matthews was determined to be surplus by the Marine Corps. In May 1963, one of the 65 target ranges could no longer be used because of the safety hazard it posed to the encroaching civilian population. The base finally closed in 1964, the same year the first undergraduate class entered Revelle College, UCSD's first undergraduate college. Closing ceremonies took place on August 21, 1964 but the base was not officially closed until October 6, 1964. A monument to the camp was unveiled at this ceremony. Major General B. A. Hochmuth, the Commanding General of MCRD at the time, fired the ceremonial \\"last rounds\\" before the camp closed. The Navy conveyed titles and interest in and improvements to the Regents of the University of California on September 23 of this year. The lease on the with the City of San Diego was terminated in this year as well. The University of California began developing the base property for use as a campus the following year. After Camp Matthews closed, Marine marksmanship training was conducted further north at Edson Range in Camp Pendleton and continues to be conducted there up to the present day. Facilities Camp Matthews contained at least fifteen different shooting ranges as well as various buildings and other infrastructure during its existence. The shooting facilities included: *6 rifle ranges *1 pistol range *1 mortar/flame thrower/hand grenade court/bazooka range (Range H) *3 small bore ranges *1 skeet range *3 school ranges (non-shooting practice ranges) The base had a number of buildings as well. It had 7 barracks, approximately 270 tents, administration buildings, quartermaster storerooms, magazines, an armory, maintenance shops, a dispensary, a service station, and a main post exchange. Only a few of the original Marine Corps buildings still exist. They are primarily located along Myers Drive in the central part of the present-day campus and were used for administrative buildings, the campus bookstore, as well as other uses over the years. This central location of the UCSD campus was called the Matthews Campus but is now called the University Center and Sixth College. A few locations on campus are named after Camp Matthews. They include Matthews Lane (which is part of the northern boundary of the former base) and Matthews Quad, an area in the center of the UCSD campus bound by Myers Drive, Lyman Walk, Russell Lane, and Rupertus Way.

During the 1960s, UCSD disposed of former Camp Matthews land in the following way: * went to the California Department of Transportation for the construction of the San Diego Freeway (Interstate 5). * were conveyed the Veterans Administration for the construction of the VA San Diego Medical Center. *Approximately were transferred to private parties for commercial and residential development. This land included areas now occupied by the La Jolla Village Square shopping center and the Mormon temple across Interstate 5 from it and also the Sheraton La Jolla Hotel. The rest of the land currently belongs to UCSD and much of the current campus is built on this land. The that the City of San Diego previously leased to the military are now leased to UCSD. Safety and environmental effects During the decommissioning of the camp, the government decontaminated Range H, the grenade/mortar/bazooka range, which was located in a ravine in the ‚Äúpanhandle‚Äù area of the base near the present-day I-5. In the early 1960s, a mining company salvaged lead and brass from the Camp Matthews ranges. However, over the years ammunition and even rockets from the former base have turned up during construction on the site. In April 1999, approximately 200 practice rockets were discovered in a hillside immediately below the Radisson Hotel La Jolla (which is currently the Sheraton Hotel La Jolla ). This area is from the Range H area of the former base and is now on the east side of I-5. They were found due to a parking lot expansion project involving the removal of part of a hillside (this hillside is now landscaped). There was no charge in any of the rockets and all the propellant was gone. The hotel hired a private company to survey the area for more ordnance with metal detectors but found none. In February 2003, approximately 40 practice rockets were found at two construction sites on the former base. One rocket was found in the medical complex area of the campus during this year. In 2005, during the construction of student housing units, the following was found: 14 inert rockets (8 2.3‚Äìinch M7 series practice rockets and 6 M29 series practice rockets), fragments from 60 mm mortars, M9 rifle grenades, Mk II hand grenades, and M29 series practice rockets. Small arms projectiles (.30-caliber and .45-caliber) have been found north of the UCSD Jacobs Medical Center complex. They were corroded and missing their outer coverings. They were possibly World War I or World War II era munitions. Over the years, the government has investigated the former Camp Matthews site due to concern over the previous use of the base. The first government inspection of the site took place in 1988 due to an inquiry from a construction contractor regarding the likelihood of finding ordnance and explosives (OE) during construction on a site on a part of the former base east of I-5. The next inspection took place in 1999 when the Defense Environmental Restoration Program ‚Äì Formerly Used Defense Sites (DERP-FUDS) conducted an Inventory Project Report (INPR) (J09CA111001) on the site. Since then, more investigations have occurred in the 2000s. The most recent investigations indicate that high levels of lead and arsenic (as well as other potentially harmful chemicals) are found in the soil and a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) should be conducted.

Built in 1865, it is one of downtown Lewiston's oldest commercial buildings, and a reminder of the city's early commercial character. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Description and history The Lord Block is located on the southern half of Lisbon Street, Lewiston's main business district, at the southwest corner of Lisbon and Cedar Streets. It is a 2-1/2 story masonry structure, built out of load-bearing brick with granite trim, with a front-facing gable roof that has a cross gable on the north side. The front has two virtually identical storefronts, each with a recessed entrance on the left and a plate glass display window to the right. The doors and windows are separated by rusticated granite piers, with a modern awning now extending across both storefronts and on to the adjacent building. Upper floor and side facade windows are sash windows set in rectangular openings, with granite sills and lintels. The north-facing gable is finished in decorative cut shingles, and has two window bays. The building was constructed in 1865 for James C. and Rufus Lord, dealers in \\"provisions\\", and was probably one of the first commercial businesses on the southern stretch of Lisbon Street, near the mills. Its deed restrictions limited its height, and required masonry construction. The store was apparently successful: James Lord was able to build an elaborate house on Main Street in 1885.

She was one of the Big Four debutantes in Chicago during World War I. She attained fame in the United States following her 1923 victory in the U.S. Women's Amateur. On August 25, 1924, she became the first golfer and first female athlete to appear on the cover of Time magazine. She also was the literary model for the character of Jordan Baker in F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel The Great Gatsby.  Early life and school  Cummings circa 1920 Cummings was born on March 26, 1899, to David Mark Cummings and his wife Ruth Dexter. She had a younger brother, Dexter, and a younger sister Dorothy who died in infancy in December 1902. Cummings had a privileged upbringing and was regarded by the Chicago press as a member of the city's elite \\"Big Four\\" debutantes circa World War I. This exclusive quartet consisted of Cummings, Ginevra King, Courtney Letts, and Margaret Carry. The four debutantes often \\"went to dances and house parties together, and they were seen as a foursome on the golf links and tennis courts at Onwentsia.\\" Edith's father, David Cummings, was a Yale alumnus and Chicago banker. He paid for her to attend the Westover School, a prestigious finishing school in Middlebury, Connecticut. Edith was in the class of 1917. Though the school had been founded only in 1909 by headmistress Mary Robbins Hillard, the institution attracted young women from many prominent families. Cummings' classmates included fellow Chicago socialite Ginevra King, future philanthropist Katharine Ordway, Isabel Rockefeller (of the Rockefeller family, a granddaughter of William Rockefeller), and Prescott Bush's sisters Mary and Margaret (aunts to U.S. President George H.W. Bush and great aunts to George W. Bush).  F. Scott Fitzgerald  In 1915, while either at Westover School in Connecticut or at Lake Forest, Illinois, Cummings met a young Princeton University student named F. Scott Fitzgerald. He had fallen in love with her close friend and Westover schoolmate Ginevra King. He would later immortalize both of them in his 1925 novel The Great Gatsby. Fitzgerald based the character of Jordan Baker in The Great Gatsby upon Cummings, just as the character Daisy Buchanan was modeled after Cummings' friend King. Much like King and Cummings, Buchanan and Baker were wealthy socialites and intimate friends. Baker, √† la Cummings, \\"wore all her dresses like sports clothes ‚Äî there was a jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings.\\" In the novel, Baker is the love interest of the novel's narrator Nick Carraway, and she purportedly cheats at golf, but there is no evidence that Fitzgerald drew this particular detail from Cummings. Fitzgerald reportedly created the name of Cummings' character by combining the names of two car manufacturers, the Jordan Motor Car Company and the Baker Motor Vehicle.  Golf victories  Cummings on the cover of Time magazine in August 1924. Following her graduation from Westover School in 1917, Cummings pursued tournament golf where she garnered the sobriquet of \\"the Fairway Flapper.\\" In 1919, she qualified to compete in the U.S. Women's Amateur for the first time. Cummings and her brother Dexter had learned to play golf from their parents at the Onwentsia Club in Lake Forest, Illinois. Both her father and mother had been club champions. Edith had won the club championship in 1918. Her sibling Dexter won the intercollegiate championship in 1923 and in 1924 and the Western Amateur championship in 1925. In 1921, Cummings competed in the British Ladies Amateur with other famous female golfers such as Alexa Stirling and Marion Hollins. The next year, Cummings entered the U.S. Women's Amateur, where she was in match play against Glenna Collett, then an 18-year-old from Rhode Island, who became known as one of the great female golfers of the 1920s. Cummings lost on the final hole. She won the U.S Women's Amateur in 1923, earning her the cover photo on Time as well as profiles in Vogue, Ladies' Home Journal, and many newspapers. She also won the Women's Western Amateur in 1924.  Marriage  Dupont Circle neighborhood of Washington, D.C. Cummings never won another tournament and left tournament golf in 1926, but remained a well-known figure. In 1934, she married wealthy Detroit businessman Curtis B. Munson who had accrued a considerable fortune in coal and lumber interests. During their marriage, Curtis Munson served as a clandestine U.S. intelligence operative engaging in espionage activities against the Japanese Empire under the direction of Assistant Secretary of State Adolph Berle. In 1940, at the behest of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Munson investigated the sympathies of Japanese- Americans living in the United States before the U.S. entered World War II and authored the Munson Report. In his report, Munson was highly critical of accusations that Japanese-American citizens would serve as fifth column saboteurs, and he concluded that the average Japanese-American was \\"an extremely good citizen and it is only because he is a stranger to us that we mistrust him.\\"  Later life and Legacy  Cummings and Munson largely retreated from the public spotlight later in life except for forays into philanthropy. Cummings remained a committed golfer into her 80s. She was enthusiastic about all outdoor activities, especially big game hunting in the Yukon and fishing. She and her husband traveled extensively throughout their marriage until her husband's death in 1979. In his honor, she made a significant contribution to the Decatur House renovation in Washington, D.C. Today, the Curtis and Edith Munson Foundation funds a number of conservation programs. She has an award named after her, the Edith Cummings Munson Golf Award, given annually to one of the top female collegiate golfers who excels in academics.

Located on the west side of Lisbon Street, the city's main commercial area, between Cedar and Chestnut Streets are a collection of commercial buildings representing a cross section of architectural styles, built between 1850 and 1950. When the historic district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985, it included 18 buildings. Eleven of these have since been demolished, and one has a significantly altered facade. Description and history The city of Lewiston was established in 1850 as a center for the manufacture of textiles, and its downtown area developed along Lisbon Street between then and about 1920, when the textile mills began a slow decline. The upper portion of Lisbon Street, between Main and Chestnut Streets, experienced intensive repeated development, and little of the city's early commercial architecture survives there. The lower part of the street was less intensively developed, resulting in a collection of buildings architecturally representative of the entire period of development. The historic district extends for one city block, including all of the buildings on the west side of Lisbon Street between Chestnut and Cedar Streets. The older buildings on the east side of this block have for the most part been razed and the land redeveloped, with only the First and Second Callahan Buildings (both separately listed on the National Register) at the northern end; they are not included in this district. When listed on the National Register in 1985, the west side of this block was lined with commercial buildings, most of them built of brick and masonry. Of the eighteen buildings then on the block, twelve were judged historically significant, and only seven are still standing.See e.g. Google Street View for the area One of the surviving buildings is the district's oldest, a 2-1/2 story wood frame gable-front building built c. 1850-55. It is flanked by later four-story buildings, one Romanesque and the other Classical Revival, dating to 1914 and 1896 respectively. To the south stand two more buildings, one four stories and the other one, with commercial Italianate style, but a significantly-altered combined ground-floor storefront.

He came to New Zealand in 1879. He was a lawyer and businessman in Christchurch. He was a councillor on the Sydenham Borough Council. A strong prohibitionist, Smith was elected to the Sydenham Licensing Committee in 1891, which was determined to refuse all licences in the borough. Several members including Smith were removed from this position by order of the Supreme Court for \\"incurable bias\\". Member of Parliament Smith then stood for parliament. In the 1893 election, he came second in the three-member City of Christchurch electorate, and thus entered the House of Representatives. He was re-elected in 1896 (coming second in the electorate), but defeated in 1899. He was returned to parliament again at the 1901 City of Christchurch by-election triggered by the resignation of Charles Lewis. Smith was an Independent MP for his entire parliamentary career.

Originally formed by millions of migrating bison, the Trace crossed the Ohio River near the Falls of the Ohio and continued northwest to the Wabash River, near present-day Vincennes, before it crossed to what became known as Illinois. This buffalo migration route, often 12 to 20 feet wide in places, was well known and used by American Indians. Later European traders and American settlers learned of it, and many used it as an early land route to travel west into Indiana and Illinois. It is considered the most important of the traces to the Illinois country. It was known by various names, including Buffalo Trace, Louisville Trace, Clarksville Trace, and Old Indian Road. After being improved as a turnpike, the New Albany-Paoli Pike, among others. The Trace's continuous use encouraged improvements over the years, including paving and roadside development. U.S. Route 150 between Vincennes, Indiana, and Louisville, Kentucky, follows a portion of this path. Sections of the improved Trace have been designated as part of a National Scenic Byway that crosses southern Indiana. History Map of the Trace The Trace was created by millions of migrating bison that were numerous in the region from the Great Lakes to Tennessee. It was part of a greater buffalo migration route that extended from present-day Big Bone Lick State Park in Kentucky, through Bullitt's Lick, south of present-day Louisville, and across the Falls of the Ohio River to Indiana, then northwest to Vincennes, before crossing the Wabash River into Illinois. The trail was well known among the area's natives and used for centuries. It later became known and used by European traders and white settlers who crossed the Ohio River at the Falls and followed the Trace overland to the western territories.Wilson, \\"Early Indiana Trails and Surveys,\\" p. 372-73. It is considered to be the most important of the early traces leading to the Illinois country. In Indiana the Trace's main line split into several smaller trails that converged north of Jasper, near several large ponds, or mud holes, where buffalo would wallow. Due to the large number of buffalo that used the Trace, the well-worn path was twelve to twenty feet wide in places.Wilson, \\"Early Indiana Trails and Surveys,\\" p. 349. Various trails also converged around a major salt lick, probably near present-day French Lick, Indiana.Wilson, \\"The Buffalo Trace,\\" p. 185-86. The Trace crossed the White River at several points, including places near the present-day towns of Petersburg and Portersville, Indiana.Wilson, \\"Early Indiana Trails and Surveys,\\" p. 350. After a major crossing at the Wabash River, the Trace split into separate trails that led west across Illinois to the Mississippi River or north to what would become Chicago. In Chicago, the Trace is called Vincennes Avenue, and after state-funded improvements and straightening, parts became State Street. The Trace across southern Indiana became integral to early development. Two main areas of early settlement in the Indiana Territory were made along it: Vincennes to the west and Clark's Grant in the south. In the early 18th century, the French developed colonial posts in the Illinois Country by moving down the Mississippi and into its tributaries. In 1732 Fran√ßois-Marie Bissot, Sieur de Vincennes, founded a trading post near the Trace's Wabash River crossing; it developed as the town of Vincennes. After the American Revolutionary War, in the late 1780s the U.S. government granted land in New York, Ohio and Indiana to veterans as payment for service. The US granted \\"so many acres of land\\" to George Rogers Clark and his men for their military service in the Illinois campaign against the British during the Revolutionary War.Barnhart and Riker, p. 252. It became known as Clark's Grant. George Rogers Clark used the Trace to return to the Louisville area after his Illinois Campaign. As the Continentals took control of the Illinois country during the Revolutionary War, the Trace became a busy overland route, which made it a target for Indian war parties. Clark's memoirs mentioned the Trace in describing an early Indian attack on traders in 1779, after Hamilton surrendered at Fort Sackville and Clark's militia controlled Vincennes.Wilson, \\"The Buffalo Trace,\\" p. 188. He led his force against the Indians in the Battle of the White River Forks. Richard \\"Dickie\\" Clark (1760-c. 1784), the younger brother of General George Rogers Clark and Captain William Clark, disappeared while traveling along the Trace in 1784. He had left Clarksville, to travel alone to Vincennes. Accounts varied: one said that his horse had been found with saddlebags bearing his initials. Another account said his horse's bones were found with Clark's bags nearby. His remains were never found. There was speculation that he was killed by Indians or thieves in the area, but historian William Hayden English concluded that he probably drowned while crossing a river. Several written accounts by explorers, the military, and settlers document the Trace's use as an overland route. In 1785 and 1786 explorer John Filson travelled by river to Vincennes and returned to the Falls of the Ohio via the Trace; he documented his travels along the road. Filson's overland route took nine days.Wilson, \\"The Buffalo Trace,\\" p. 190. General Josiah Harmar, Commander of the Army of the Ohio, kept a log when he led the First American Regiment on a return march from Vincennes in 1786.Initially, Harmar went to Vincennes by way of the Red Banks Trace, a north-south trail connecting Vincennes to Henderson, Kentucky. See Wilson, \\"The Buffalo Trace,\\" p. 200. Following the Treaty of Greenville in 1795, settlers poured into the western territories. Many of them kept journals, recording their observations along the Trace.See Wilson, \\"The Buffalo Trace,\\" p. 207-15. In late 1799 U.S. postmaster Joseph Habersham established a mail route from Louisville through Vincennes to Kaskaskia, Illinois at the Mississippi River along the Trace.Wilson, \\"The Buffalo Trace,\\" p. 217. The route began on 22 March 1800 and ran every four weeks. It was extended to Cahokia, Illinois the following year. Both of these were former French colonial settlements from the early 18th century.Wilson, \\"The Buffalo Trace,\\" p. 218. In 1802 William Henry Harrison, governor of the Indiana Territory, recommended that the Trace be improved as a road suitable for wagon travel, with inns developed for travelers every thirty to forty miles.Cayton, Andrew. Frontier Indiana (Indiana University Press, 1998) p. 184. By 1804 the Trace was so well known that Harrison used it as a treaty boundary with Indians.Wilson, \\"Early Indiana Trails and Surveys,\\" p. 349 and 423. The Vincennes treaty of 1804 gave the U.S. government possession of Indiana land from south of the Trace to the Ohio River, including the Trace itself. William Rector was hired to survey the treaty land in 1805. His survey notes provide an important record of the Buffalo Trace's route.Wilson, \\"The Buffalo Trace,\\" p. 223-24. Survey maps and field notes identified forty-three miles of the old trace road from Clark's Grant to the White River in southern Indiana.Wilson, \\"Early Indiana Trails and Surveys,\\" p. 349. A road built on top of the old Trace in Morgan Township, Harrison County, Indiana The Buffalo Trace was the primary travel route between the Louisville area and Vincennes; two-thirds of settlers traveling from the Louisville area into the interior of Indiana used the trace.Robinson, p. 38-39. Rangers were hired to protect travelers using the road, eventually doing so on horseback in 1812. During the War of 1812, Harrison assigned 150 men to patrol the Trace between Vincennes and Louisville, \\"so as to completely protect the citizens and the road.\\"Wilson, \\"The Buffalo Trace,\\" p. 238. Because the Trace remained the primary road across southern Indiana after the territory became a state in 1816, the state legislature had a road paved from New Albany to Vincennes as part of its internal improvements program. The road \\"approximated\\" the Trace's route. It was extended to Paoli, Indiana, after the state government leased operation of the road to a private organization as part of their negotiations to avoid bankruptcy.Kleber, John E. The Encyclopedia of Louisville. (Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 2001). p. 302. The paved road was called the \\"New Albany-Paoli Turnpike.\\" The first stagecoach service in the state started in 1820 along the Trace; the route was from New Albany to Vincennes. The route served Floyd County, Indiana; the towns of Greenville, Galena, and Floyds Knobs in particular. Other names for the Trace through its history have been Lan-an-zo-ki-mi-wi (or lenaswihkanawea, an Indian name meaning \\"bison trail\\" or \\"buffalo road\\"), the \\"Old Indian Road,\\" the \\"Clarksville Trace,\\" \\"Harrison's Road,\\" the \\"Kentucky Road,\\" the \\"Vincennes Trace,\\" and the \\"Louisville Trace.\\"Robinson, p. 38.Wilson, \\"The Buffalo Trace,\\" p. 187McCafferty, p. 173. Present day U.S. Route 150 from Vincennes to New Albany follows the path of the Trace.Robinson, p. 39. A large section of the original Trace can be seen south of French Lick in Orange County, Indiana, along the Springs Valley Trail System. In 2009 a section of U.S. Route 150 and the Buffalo Trace were designated as part of the Indiana Historic Pathways, a National Scenic Byway that crosses southern Indiana.Indiana's Historic Pathways was designated part of America's Byways Collection on 16 October 2009.

Description and history The former Marcotte Nursing Home building is located on the north side of Campus Avenue, just east of the Bates College campus, and across the street from the main medical facilities of Saint Mary's Regional Medical Center. It is a five-story masonry structure, built of brick with cast stone trim in the Tudor Revival style. In addition to load-bearing brick walls, it has iron beams for added support. Its stairwells are built with steel framing clad in brick. The interior floor framing is wood, and the walls are plaster on lath. There are three (former) principal entrances on the street facade, sheltered by round-arch porticos. The modern d'Youville Pavilion extends to the rear. The Marcotte Nursing Home was founded through the efforts of Francois Marcotte, a prominent local French-American businessman, and the local Society of the Sisters of Charity, a Roman Catholic aid organization. Marcotte began fundraising for its construction in 1926, and the building, designed by the Portland firm Miller, Mayo & Beal, was opened in 1928. The facility included nursing care facilities, an orphanage, and, uniquely for the time, 22 small apartments for indigent elderly. The latter were supported by an endowment from Marcotte. Marcotte himself later occupied one of the units, and died there in 1942.

In 2016, The New York Times said \\"Ehrlich, an Emmy- winning documentarian, clearly knows his craft.\\" His works as director include Keepers of the Game (2016 Tribeca Film Festival premiere), Notes from Liberia (winner at the 2015 RiverRun International Film Festival), We Could Be King (winner of the 2015 Emmy Award for Outstanding Sports Documentary and Grand Clio Award for Integrated Marketing), Magic Camp (winner at the 2012 Newport Beach Film Festival for Outstanding Achievement in Filmmaking), Run for Your Life (2008 Tribeca Film Festival premiere, nominated for a 2010 Emmy Award for Outstanding Achievement Documentary), Mayor of the West Side (nominated for a 2008 Emmy Award for Outstanding Achievement Documentary).  Life and career  Ehrlich was born in New York City, New York, the son of a schoolteacher and an architect. He grew up in the Flatiron District. After attending the Dalton School, Ehrlich earned his bachelor's degree from Vassar College. At fourteen, Ehrlich was the youngest feature reporter on a New York newspaper and later editor-in-chief of his high school paper. Before film, he worked as a caseworker in New York City with homeless adults and families and developmentally disabled teens at Project Renewal, Homes for the Homeless and YAI. Ehrlich began filming one of his clients, which would later become his first film, Mayor of the West Side. Ehrlich began working in documentary in the Judson Memorial Church basement on the Steenbeck editing of the 1997 Sundance Film Festival award-winner, Family Name, directed by Macky Alston. He moved to the editing room of the 2000 Emmy and DuPont-Columbia award-winning series New York: A Documentary Film directed by of Ric Burns. Ehrlich worked for the POV series and was an editor and producer at CBS News. He curated and directed film programs and series at BAMcin√©matek, Brooklyn College, JCC in Manhattan and the Brooklyn Museum, hosting notables including Darren Aronofsky, Steve Buscemi, Tony Kushner, Cyndi Lauper and Willem Dafoe. Ehrlich is Jewish and attended the Hebrew University of Jerusalem during his junior year of college, where he studied philosophy with Paul R. Mendes-Flohr. While studying abroad, Ehrlich marched from Auschwitz to Birkenau in the March of the Living. Ehrlich ran the 2008 New York City Marathon in support of Fred's Team and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, founded by Fred Lebow, the subject of his film Run for Your Life. The film screened on a transatlantic crossing of the Queen Mary 2 as part of the Tribeca Film Festival curated Cunard Insights program. He attended Tannen's Magic Camp when he was twelve, along with Adrien Brody and David Blaine, and returned to film the documentary Magic Camp. Ehrlich's films Keepers of the Game and We Could Be King were produced in partnership with Tribeca Digital Studios (TDS) and the Dick's Sporting Goods (DSG) Foundation, forging a new model for documentary production. As the centerpiece of DSG's Sports Matter campaign, the films helped raise over five million dollars and save several hundred youth sports programs across the United States. The films premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival and were later broadcast on ABC and ESPN. Among those attending the premieres were Michael B. Jordan, Victor Cruz, Serena Williams, Missy Franklin, Paul Rabil, Tom Brady and Robert De Niro. During production, Ehrlich lived for six months on the Akwesasne Mohawk Territory and in Northwest Philadelphia. We Could Be King was selected as part of the American Film Showcase, funded by the United States Department of State, which screens films worldwide to foster U.S. diplomatic relations. Ehrlich also produced two five- part TV mini-series with TDS and DSG, which broadcast nightly on SportsCenter. Ehrlich is represented for branded content by Saville, joining a roster of directors that includes Michael Apted, Wim Wenders, Barry Levinson, Oliver Stone and Werner Herzog. He has directed for Bose (with Russell Wilson, Chuck Pagano and J.J. Watt), Tough Mudder, Major League Soccer, Van Cleef & Arpels, Barilla, U.S. Cellular and the Serena Williams Fund. Ehrlich is president of Flatbush Pictures, which produces independent films, documentaries, branded content and mini-series. He founded the company with the late cinematographer Ryo Murakami who filmed inside the Firestone Rubber Plantation in Liberia. His footage posthumously became the documentary Notes from Liberia and the inspiration for the narrative film Out of My Hand, also filmed by Murakami. Footage from the documentary was licensed for use in the Emmy Award-winning 2014 Frontline and ProPublica documentary Firestone and the Warlord. The company is named for Flatbush, Brooklyn, where Ehrlich resides. His great- grandfather, Julius Nelson, emigrated from Russia and settled in Flatbush. Nelson built the eponymously named Nelson Tower, designed by H. Craig Severance. Three years after opening, the building sold in foreclosure proceedings due to the impact of the Great Depression. Ehrlich's grandparents and mother were born and raised in Flatbush. The logo of Flatbush Pictures is an homage to the Vitagraph Studios smokestack.

The block was built in 1871-72 to a design by the Lewiston firm of Stevens and Coombs, for Jacob Roak, a shoe manufacturer and leading businessman in the city. At the time of its construction, it was the largest building of its type erected in the state. The upper levels of the building were designed as spaces for incubating businesses related to shoe manufacturing, where small businesses could work until they were successful enough to require larger quarters. The building was used in this fashion for 90 years. Its upper floors have been converted for use as senior housing.

Description The Lamoreau Site is one of a number of archaeological sites found on the property of Auburn/Lewiston Municipal Airport, or on adjacent commercial properties. Several of them were completely excavated and destroyed by subsequent construction of airport infrastructure. This site is located on the banks of Moose Brook in an outlying area of the airport. It is a habitation site, located across the brook from one of the airport's most important sites, the Michaud Site, which was one of those destroyed. The geography of the two sites is similar, consisting of a sandy plain formed by the withdrawal of glaciers about 10,000 years ago. The sand was then blown to produce dunes, among which the prehistoric occupants lived. The site was formally investigated in the 1980s, and the principal finds are stone artifacts. These include fluted projectile points, waste from stone tool work (debitage), and small channel scrapers. Most of these materials are made from stone that is either rhyolite from Mount Jasper in New Hampshire, or Munsungan chert from northern Maine.

Francisco Col√≠n, S.J., pointing to a tiny isle in southern Leyte whose chief, according to Col√≠n, \\"gave the most signal service\\" to Ferdinand Magellan and his crew at the port of Butuan in March‚ÄìApril 1521. The incident is described in a three-paragraph epitome of Magellan's sojourn in Philippine waters, part of a historical study entitled Labor evangelica obreros de la compa√±ia de Jesus en las islas Filipinas, which was published 1663 in Madrid. Principal source of Magellan story Col√≠n identified his principal source for his reconstruction of the above episode as Antonio Pigafetta as edited by Giovanni Battista Ramusio. Ramusio was the foremost travel writer of the Renaissance who retranslated back to Italian a French text of Antonio Pigafetta's account of Magellan's voyage. The French text, known today as Colines edition in honor of its printer, was done supposedly by Jacopo Fabri who worked on the French translation based on an original Italian text which is now considered lost. Ramusio's work is entitled Viaggio attorno il mondo scritto per M. Antonio Pigafetta...tradotto di lingua francese nella Italiana and is found in a compendium of travel stories, Primo Volume delle Navigationi et Viaggi...Venetia, gli heredi di Luc Antonio Giunti, 1563. This same translation came out earlier in 1536, anonymously, in book form entitled Il viaggio fatto da gli Spagniuoli a torno a'l mondo without the name of the printer and place of publication. Scholars have speculated it was printed by N. Zopini at Venice. The same work, Delle navigationi...was first republished in 1550 without any credit as to authorship. It was preceded by Ramusio's \\"Discorso\\" where he remarks the French text was done by Fabri, which has never been corroborated by any external evidence. Vol. I was republished in 1554 again without any author's name for the Pigafetta translation. Ramusio's name as the author of the translation came out only in the edition of 1563. Ramusio corruption of Pigafetta's account The Ramusio translation is a hopelessly garbled story of the above incident. In the authentic account of Pigafetta, the port was not Butuan, which was and is not an island, but an island named Mazaua, pronounced \\"masawa\\", a word found only in Butuanon and a derivative language, Tausog, and in no other of over 200 Philippine languages and dialects. In Ramusio's corrupted story Magellan and his crew celebrated a mass at Butuan on Easter Sunday, March 31, 1521. They also planted a big cross atop the tallest hill in the afternoon of the same day. From Butuan, so Ramusio's story goes, they sailed for Cebu passing \\"Zeilon, Bohol, Messana...\\" Tantalizingly, Ramusio then talks of the fleet being at \\"Messana\\" which was the name given by Maximilianus Transylvanus in 1522 to Mazaua. \\"Messana\\" because of its familiarity to Europeans‚Äîit's the name of the Italian port where the bubonic plague started‚Äîhad for a long time supplanted the true name, Mazaua, so that even as late as 1894 when the Italian scholar Andrea da Mosto had expertly transcribed Pigafetta's Ambrosiana codex, which work fully established the text of that manuscript that has essentially been adopted by succeeding historiographers, even then da Mosto used Transylvanus' \\"Mazana.\\" The confused timeline of Ramusio's story has Magellan's fleet anchored from March 28-April 4, 1521 at Butuan. Then from Butuan, they sailed for Cebu but all of a sudden are found at \\"Messana\\" which in the real story is \\"Mazaua\\" where the fleet did in fact anchor on those dates. But, as Ramusio wrongly relates, the real port, Mazaua, is supplanted by Butuan, and Gatighan, the waystation, supplanted by \\"Messana.\\" It's important to remember this mix-up to have a clear view of which island in the true story Col√≠n's Dimasaua is pointing to. The precise story, as told by Antonio Pigafetta and the other witnesses, is the fleet had anchored at a tiny ‚Äî about 3,930 hectares according to Gin√©s de Mafra - island-port named Mazaua which The Genoese Pilot said was at latitude 9¬∞ north, locating the skerry in Mindanao. From Mazaua the Armada sailed for Cebu in the Visayas in central Philippines passing first at a little island called Gatighan. By tracing this route, we are able to determine that Col√≠n's Dimasaua is actually Pigafetta's \\"Gatighan.\\" Secondary source, Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas Col√≠n's other source was Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas whose story of the above incident was taken from the papers of Andr√©s de San Mart√≠n, the chief pilot-astrologer (cosmographer) of Magellan's fleet. These papers were confiscated from Gines de Mafra who had possession of these papers which were entrusted by San Mart√≠n in Cebu way back in April or May 1521. Herrera's version is a faithful account of the incident at Mazaua. He talks of the fleet's anchoring at the isle whose name he spells \\"Mazagua\\" which is phonetically the exact equivalent of the Butuanon word \\"masawa.\\" Herrera's \\"gu\\" is a Hispanicized rendition of w which is absent in the Spanish alphabet. His account also refers to a cross being planted atop the tallest hill which Magellan, his men and the chiefs or kings of Mazagua and Butuan participated in. The version of Herrera was the true account of the incident. His name for the port, Mazagua, was the only correct one ever published from its occurrence in 1521 until 1890 when the same name, spelled differently as \\"Mazzava\\", came out in the biography of Magellan written by the English geographer Dr. Francis H.H. Guillemard. Col√≠n invents \\"Dimasaua\\" to linguistically resolve conflict between Ramusio and Herrera The friar's dilemma was which version to adopt, Ramusio's or Herrera's. Thinking Ramusio's was the authentic Pigafetta account‚Äîan eyewitness testimony that therefore supersedes in importance Herrera's second-hand account‚ÄîCol√≠n wrote that Butuan was the port where the Easter mass was held. Having settled that issue, he proceeded to deal with Herrera's rendition of the Mazaua episode. Since he had already established that an Easter Sunday mass was held at Butuan, he could not very well use Ramusio's \\"Messana\\"--the second stop of the fleet in Ramusio's story‚Äîbecause the name's religious connotation‚Äîmissa is Spanish for mass, and \\"na\\" is Bisaya for already‚Äîcreates an inconsistency in Col√≠n's story. Col√≠n thus came up with his invention, \\"Dimasaua.\\" The word consists of the Bisaya prefix \\"di\\" which means not and Herrera's name for the port where an Easter mass was held, \\"Mazagua.\\" His \\"Dimasaua\\" means to say \\"this is not Herrera's site of the first mass, Mazagua (pronounced \\"masawa\\") which I have already located at Butuan.\\" His three-paragraph story on \\"Dimasaua\\" has been translated into English by Miguel A. Bernad, S.J., digitized and published on the web at This has been digitized, partly, and published on the Web and the translation of Colin's \\"Dimasaua\\" is at https://books.google.com/books?id=NbG7kHtBma8C&pg;=PA1&dq;=Limasawa&ei;=7K9MSY- IGY3WlQTLpKzWBA#PPA3,M1. Col√≠n's \\"Dimasaua\\" becomes \\"Limasaua\\" Five years later after Col√≠n's book had been published, another Spanish missionary Fr. Francisco Comb√©s, S.J., revisited the Mazaua incident in his book on evangelization of Mindanao, Historia de las islas de Mindanao. Progresos de la religion: Madrid, 1667. His sources were the same, Ramusio and Herrera, plus Col√≠n. Comb√©s had a different version of Ramusio, one that did not refer to a mass being held at Butuan on March 31, 1521 although a cross being planted at a hill is mentioned. This edition of Ramusio is represented by the English translation of Samuel Purchas, Hakluytus Posthumus or Purchas His Pilgimes, Containing a History of the World in Sea Voyages and Lande Travells by Englishmen and others By Samuel Purchas, B.D., Volume II. Glasgow,1625. Comb√©s, unlike modern historians who explain clearly their operation, i.e., how they manipulate their sources to arrive at a certain point or conclusion, is opaque in his method and in fact does not even fully account for his sources. But evidence‚Äîwe know what were available to him‚Äîand logic, how he handled his sources, give us a clear idea of his operation. So, Comb√©s essentially follows Col√≠n's solution to the dilemma posed by the conflicting versions of Ramusio and Herrera. He however does not adopt Col√≠n's name for the waystation, Pigafetta's Gatighan. Since his version of Ramusio does not mention an Easter mass, he did not have to negate the idea of a mass being held elsewhere than in Butuan. He comes up with a different prefix, a syllable, that is unheard of in any Philippine language, and is not of French, Spanish, Italian or Portuguese provenience. \\"Li\\" has no significance in the context of Magellan's travel or any linguistic tradition in the Philippines. There is such a word in Confucian or Chinese literature, but as this relates to the circumnavigation story, it is totally foreign. In any case, Comb√©s invents the name \\"Limasawa\\" by which the tiny southern Leyte isle is known today. Following the route earlier traced, the placename points to Pigafetta's Gatighan which is located by Francisco Albo, the pilot who brought Victoria back to Seville, at 10¬∞ north latitude just one nautical mile (1.9 km) above the tip of today's Limasawa. In the map of Pigafetta, and in every other map of the Philippines, it is the isle sandwiched between the islands of Bohol and Panaon. Comb√©s's three-paragraph story of \\"Limasawa\\" has been translated into English by Miguel A. Bernad, S.J., which has been digitized and published on the web at https://books.google.com/books?id=NbG7kHtBma8C&pg;=PA1&dq;=Limasawa&ei;=7K9MSY- IGY3WlQTLpKzWBA#PPA4,M1. How \\"Dimasaua\\" got eclipsed by \\"Limasaua\\" In 1734 another Spanish Jesuit missionary, Fr. Pedro Murillo Velarde, made a map of the Philippines where for the first time the name \\"Limasava\\" is shown. He had a revised edition later where in the cartouche Murillo relates Magellan's visit to Butuan where an Easter mass was held on March 31, 1521. His \\"Limasaua\\" therefore is not in conformity with Comb√©s's story that does not talk of a mass. In a later book he wrote, Murillo states the Leyte isle's names were \\"Dimasaua\\" and \\"Limasaua.\\" One sees here the intervention of pure whim and wild chance‚Äîtwo unpredictable elements in history‚ÄîMurillo just happened to pick a name he fancied at the moment of creating a map not knowing the name had an inconsistency with his intention. This map became a sensation among European cartographers and was shamelessly plagiarized by them except Jacques N. Bellin who had the intellectual honesty to cite Murillo as his authority. Bellin published his version, which corrected the longitudes and latitudes of Murillo who merely followed Ramusio, the same year Murillo's came out in 1734. In 1798, paleographer-conservator Carlo Amoretti of Ambrosiana library in Milan discovered the lost Italian manuscript of Antonio Pigafetta which was written in Renaissance longhand. He forthwith transcribed it and two years later published his version with his notes and emendations. In two footnotes on pages 66 and 72 Amoretti surmises that the \\"Messana\\" in Pigafetta may be the \\"Limassava\\" in the map of Bellin. Amoretti and Bellin had not read the books of Comb√©s and Col√≠n nor the revised map of Murillo with the cartouche. He therefore was not aware that the name \\"Limasaua\\" was in fact a negation of Herrera's correct account of the Mazaua episode. Historians merely repeat other historians The old saying history repeats itself is not as true as the truism historians repeat one another. Western navigation historians and Magellan scholars started a tradition of repeating Amoretti's assertion, e.g., Lord Stanley of Alderley (1874), F.H.H. Guillemard (1890), Jose Toribio Medina (1888), Andrea da Mosto (1894), James Alexander Robertson (1906), J. Denuce (1911), and on down the line including Laurence Bergreen (2003). No one subjected Amoretti's dictum to serious critical analysis. Religious chroniclers in the Philippines went along with the spirit of invention started by Col√≠n and Comb√©s and gave the isle other names: Limasaba (Fr. Gaspar de San Agustin,1698); Bimasaua (Fr. Juan Francisco de San Antonio, 1738); Simasaua (F. Redondo, 1886). No one gave an explanation for these names. These were asserted in the nature of an ex cathedra pronouncement. Only one Western maritime historian, the French L√©once Peillard, bucked Amoretti. In Le premier tour du monde de Magellan: France, 1991, his transcription with notes and editorial treatment of an extant Pigafetta manuscript, Ms f. 5650, Peillard in footnote 118 on page 314 and footnote 154 on page 317 assert Mazaua is in the latitude calculated by The Genoese Pilot at 9¬∞ north and that Mazaua was in fact part of Mindanao (\\"Elle en fait partie, en realite\\". It [Mazaua] forms part of it [Mindanao]). In the Philippines itself, historians obscured the issue by failing‚Äîeither deliberately or unintentionally‚Äîto cite Amoretti as authority for the Limasaua=Mazaua notion, and reframing the way they looked at the incident back to its religious context as Col√≠n and Comb√©s viewed it. Whereas it was viewed by Westerners in terms of anchorage, the Philippine scholars framed Mazaua as \\"site\\" where the First mass in the Philippines was held. This is still how most Philippine historians view it. Up to now, it has not been detected that the two names, \\"Limasaua\\" and \\"Dimasaua\\" contain in their very core a negation of Herrera's \\"Mazagua.\\" The two names deny Herrera's story that the mass was held at the island-port of Mazaua. The critical role of Herrera's \\"Mazagua\\" has not been heretofore analyzed except in the paper of Vicente Calibo de Jesus which he read on October 13, 2007 at the annual conference of The Society for the History of Discoveries held at the U.S. Library of Congress, Washington D.C. John N. Schumacher, S.J. did touch on Herrera in an article, noting that \\"Herrera is the only historian prior to the time of the 19th century publication of Pigafetta, who correctly puts the first Mass in 'Mazagua' which is simply a Hispanicization of Pigafetta's Italian form 'Mazaua' or 'Mazzaua'.\\" Schumacher failed however to discern the hand of Andr√©s de San Mart√≠n. More to the point, he did not detect the negation of Herrera in the two neologisms \\"Dimasaua\\" and \\"Limasaua.\\" De Jesus's paper is the only work on the subject that mentions Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas and probes his significance. References are found on pages 20, 27 and 78 of the paper as revised and published on the site of Italian nuclear scientist Dr. Vasco Caini at http://www.xeniaeditrice.it. The validity of this analysis however has yet to sink in among historians and historiographers. This analysis has been ignored and disregarded by the National Historical Institute, a government agency of the Philippines, whose role is to help resolve historical questions. It has declared a number of times that Mazaua and Limasaua are one and the same, equating one name that signifies denial of the story of Mazaua by Herrera and the occurrence of an Easter mass. In a decision promulgated in March 1998, NHI dismissed the Gin√©s de Mafra account as fake, knowing fully that it is genuine. De Mafra in his account located the isle of Mazaua south of 1521 Butuan some below, placing it at 9¬∞ north, the exact latitude for Magellan's port given by one of the eyewitnesses, one known to history as The Genoese Pilot. The Institute with full knowledge of its erroneous method of reaching a reconstruction of the past has transformed an honest mistake into what we might call the Limasawa hoax.

Rowett is first mentioned in August 1767 in connection with a match between his Surrey team and Sir Horace Mann's XI.G B Buckley, Fresh Light on 18th Century Cricket, Cotterell, 1935 In the Caterham v Bourne match at Caterham Common on 10 June 1768, Rowett showed himself to be a capable batsman by scoring 30 in Caterham's total of 150, Caterham winning the match by 14 runs. This match has left one of the earliest known scorecards, printed in the 11 June 1768 edition of the Kentish Weekly Post. Despite the match title, it was effectively Surrey v Kent. Another Caterham v Bourne match took place at Caterham Common on 26 July 1768. The result is unknown. It was announced in the St James Chronicle on Saturday 23 July. Caterham was to give Bourne two men. The St James Chronicle referred to the teams as \\"Mr Horatio Mann's Club\\" and \\"Mr Henry Rowett's Club\\".

Operation Support Hope was a 1994 United States military effort to provide immediate relief for the refugees of the Rwandan genocide and allow a smooth transition to a full United Nations humanitarian management program. The inhabitants of the camp consisted of approximately two million Hutus, participants in the genocide, and the bystanders, who had fled Rwanda as the predominantly Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front took control of the country. On July 22, 1994 President Clinton announced Operation Support Hope. Two days later, American joint task forces were airlifted to Goma, Zaire; Kigali, Rwanda; Entebbe, Uganda; and Mombasa, Kenya. US Air Force liaison officers were assigned to United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)'s air operations cell in Geneva and assigned to joint logistics cells and civil-military operations centers in the field. The joint task force was headquartered in Entebbe, with the role of providing a cargo airlift to supplement United Nations efforts. The United States Army almost immediately set up a major water supply system at the refugee camp in Goma and helped bury the dead. Relief supplies were flown from Europe directly to African locations by C-5 and C-141 cargo jets, which then ferried to Mombasa due to scarcity of fuel in the African interior, and then returned to Europe. Due to limited ramp space, some aircraft were forced into holding patterns; their fuel requirements were met by KC-10 tanker aircraft based at Harare, Zimbabwe. C-130 aircraft from Ramstein AB, Germany and Pope AFB, NC deployed to Entebbe, Uganda and shuttled relief cargo, US Army water filtration systems, and medical teams from Doctors Without Borders to remote locations throughout the region. During the peak of Operation Support Hope in late August, the United States had 2350 service members deployed. About 15,000 tons of humanitarian supplies were delivered by 1200 airlift sorties, about 60% of the total airlift tonnage. On August 14, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) requested that all agencies stop airlifting food to Goma. The operation continued supporting other locations in Rwanda. By presidential order, it ceased on September 27 and the last C-5 involved in the airlift left Entebbe on September 29. One noteworthy accomplishment was a C-5 that flew a 22-hour flight nonstop from Travis Air Force Base, California to Goma to deliver a water supply system, supported by 3 aerial refuelings.AIRLIFT TANKER QUARTERLY Volume 12 ‚Ä¢ Number 3 ‚Ä¢ Summer 2004 As part of Operation Support Hope, the American defense contractor Halliburton earned $6.3million through its engineering and construction subsidiary Kellogg Brown & Root (KBR).

In recent studies, it was found that in areas infected with R. ondatrae, the population of amphibian limb malformations was much higher than populations in which this trematode was not present. Each species studied showed varying results. For example, amphibians of species Pseudacris regilla, Rana aurora and Taricha torosa were found to physically display a higher frequency in the number of abnormalities. The exact mechanism of deformation has not been determined but it has been theorized that deformation results from mechanical disruption of the cells involved in limb bud formation during the amphibian larval stage. Life cycle The first intermediate host is the ram's horn snail. The second intermediate hosts are fish and larval amphibians including frogs and salamanders. Inside of amphibians, cercariae are attracted to limb bud regions where the hind limbs form. As a result, large numbers of metacercariae encyst near the base of the hind legs. The definitive hosts are predators such as hawks, herons, ducks, and badgers. The abundance of the teratogenic trematode Ribeiroia ondatre has been found to increase in eutrophic (nutrient rich) waters. Enhanced transmission An important factor to the R. ondatrae infections is the exposure to run off nutrients, i.e. eutrophication. Fertilizers have phosphates in them which is also a predictor of larval trematode abundance in amphibians. The herbicide atrazine has proven to weaken amphibians‚Äô immune systems which causes frogs to become more prone to R. ondatrae infections which in turn causes predators such as birds to attack the multiple or missing limbed frogs. Since herbicides and pesticides affect the prevalence of R. ondatrae in frogs, they tend to increase mortality and pathology due to extra or missing limbs. Location of infection R. ondatrae‚Äôs mechanism of causing malformations is still unknown, but there seems to be evidence in which areas of the body it infects more. Studies show that when frogs or toads are affected with R. ondatrae it seems that the most common spot for any deformity is on the hind limbs. But the amount of exposure to R. ondatrae cercariae appears to determine where a deformity will occur. For instance, a moderate amount of R. ondatrae can affect the forelimbs of amphibians, but a heavy parasite load does not affect the forelimbs and only causes deformities in hind limbs.

According to the chronicle of Alberic of Trois-Fontaines, Berengaria was a daughter of Alfonso IX of Le√≥n and Berengaria of Castile. She was a younger sister of Ferdinand III of Castile and Alfonso of Molina. Marriage In 1217, Berengaria's brother Ferdinand III had inherited the throne of the Kingdom of Castile through abdication of their mother. In 1223, John of Brienne, aged 53, visited Santiago de Compostela, as a supposed pilgrim. He was by then twice a widower. As a consequence of his visit to Santiago de Compostela, Alfonso IX invited him to marry his daughter Sancha and, presumably, through her inherit the Leonese throne. However Berengaria of Castile, a long time divorced and an inheritor in her own right of the Castilian throne, main advisor of her son Ferdinand III, offered one of her own daughters to John instead. Aging John chose Berengaria of Le√≥n, from Alfonso's second marriage. The marriage took place at Toledo in 1224. Empress In 1229, the throne of the Latin Empire had been inherited by Baldwin II of Constantinople, a twelve-year-old boy. The barons of the Empire decided to secure the safety of the Empire by appointing a regent-Emperor for Baldwin. They chose John who accepted the assignment as a sort of Senior Tutor. In April 1229, John was proclaimed regent at Perugia. They did not arrive at Constantinople until 1231, when John was officially crowned in his new city. Baldwin II remained the junior co-emperor and only heir to the throne. By agreement, 12-year-old Baldwin had been betrothed to around 5-years-old Marie of Brienne, the daughter of John and Berengaria, since 19 April 1229 to firmly establish the dynastic alliance of the two co- emperors and the western land for Crusades also, Spain. The marriage did not take place until 1234, when Marie was about ten years old and Baldwin about seventeen. Alberic of Trois-Fontaines records that John died on 27 March 1237, aged around 61. The \\"Obituaires de Sens Tome\\" of the Abbey of Maubuisson record that Berengaria died on 12 April 1237, aged around 33, surviving her husband by only sixteen days. She is buried in a beautiful marble coffin in the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, Spain, but many books and tourist leaflets mention her as if she was Queen Berenguela of Castile, her mother. Other books, however, mention this coffin as being that of another Berengaria (1228‚Äì1288) and/or other dates, her niece, daughter of her brother King Ferdinand III of Castile, sister of King Alfonso X of Castile. But this niece, Infanta Berengaria was a nun at the Monastery of las Huelgas, Burgos, of Royal patronage, where Berengaria of Le√≥n's mother, Queen Berengaria of Castile, retired as a former monarch. Further, Alfonso VIII of Castile and Eleanor of England, grandparents of Berengaria of Le√≥n are buried there. Much later, Ferdinand III's and Alfonso X's bodies, also at Las Huelgas, would be moved to conquered Seville's new cathedral, where they are today. Children Berengaria and John had four known children: #Marie of Brienne, who married Baldwin II of Constantinople and was the mother of Philip I of Constantinople. #Alphonso of Brienne, Count of Eu and Grand Chamberlain of France. #John II of Brienne (c. 1230‚Äì1296), who in 1258 became Grand Butler of France.

She was appointed to be the first matron of the Columbia Institution on May 30, 1857 and held the position for nine years, until August 1, 1866. Biography She was born as Sophia Fowler near the town of Guilford, Connecticut on March 20, 1798, to Miner Fowler and Rachel Hall. Born deaf, she first attended school at age 19, starting (along with her sister Parnel) at the new school for the Deaf in Hartford in 1817 and continued her studies until the Spring of 1821. She married Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet on August 29, 1821, and had eight children: Thomas H.

She died on May 13, 1877, in Washington, District of Columbia and was interred in Cedar Hill Cemetery in Hartford, Connecticut. Sophia Fowler Gallaudet, named as the \\"Mother of the American Deaf,\\" was honored and memorialized in Angeline Fuller Fischer's The Silent Worker, in 1915, to remind young deaf people of her influences that has pervaded Gallaudet College for so many years, and of her contributions to its early growth as an institution of higher education. A bronze memorial tablet, sculpted by Eugene Hannan, was unveiled Guilford, Connecticut in 1917. The tablet was to recognize her important role in contributing to the America School for the Deaf, which her husband, Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet, is a co-founder of and helping to establish Gallaudet College, which her son, Edward Miner Gallaudet is a founder of.

In the United States  Members (both Representatives and Senators) have multiple legislative assistants who may be tasked to handle one or more area in which the assistant has particular expertise (e.g. education policy, environmental policy, tax policy). Often the assignments will be connected to the committee assignments of the member. In most offices, there is one staffer, variously called a legislative director (LD) or senior legislative assistant, in charge of all legislative assistants in the office. Some practitioners have questioned the lack of a federal congressional clerkship program, finding that few top law school graduates seriously consider becoming a legislative aide to gain practical skills after graduation.  In France  In France, this position was formally opened after Edgar Faure visited the United States Congress in 1975.. The assistants can also work on the non-legislative part of the MP job, such as managing transportation between Paris and the constituency, or handling a part of the MP's public relations.  In European Parliament  Following his election, an MEP can submit to the European Parliament one or more application and contract for the secretarial assistance allowance.

It stars Tim Robbins and Bridget Moynahan. Robbins plays a successful lawyer in Manhattan named David Owen who is bothered by all the noise in the city, and who resorts to vandalism to put a stop to it, adopting the identity of \\"The Rectifier\\". His acts of vandalism provoke the mayor of the city, played by William Hurt. The film premiered October 22, 2007 at the Rome Film Festival. It was later shown at the AFI Film Festival on November 6, 2007. It opened in limited release in the United States on May 9, 2008. Plot David Owen, a New York lawyer, is constantly plagued by noise, particularly car alarms, but also burglar alarms and backup beepers. Despite putting up with the noise for years, including the formative years of his daughter, he finally breaks into a car to shut off its alarm, and is arrested by police. Owen and his family try living in the countryside for a weekend, but it only replaces one set of noise problems with another. Despite attempting to legally deal with the constant barrage of noise, he makes no progress, and continues to resort to vandalism, resulting in higher and higher court penalties and straining his relationship with his wife, who finally asks him to leave. While living on his own, Owen continues to destroy alarms, and progressively damages cars based on the number of violations. During this, he meets and begins a relationship with Ekaterina, a Russian student. She confronts him with the fact that he is \\"The Rectifier\\", a vigilante personality, complete with monikered stickers, that Owen has adopted. After falling in with him, Ekaterina convinces Owen to start a ballot initiative. While initially slow, the measure garners explosive popularity. Despite this, it is shut down by Mayor Schneer, who disdains the Rectifier and believes supporting the measure would encourage vigilantism. After being shut down through a loophole that prevents the ballot measure from appearing, Owen outfits a car with numerous alarms and much louder horns. He then parks in front of city hall and sets off his alarms, citing the various laws that so frustrated Owen initially when city hall security demands he turn them off. After enraging a nearby tenant, Judge Kornreich, his vehicle is attacked and the judge is mistakenly arrested as The Rectifier. Kornreich sues Owen for pain and suffering damages, and Owen goes to court. During his cross- examination of Kornreich, Owen intentionally alludes that his actions could be considered assault and battery, establishing a legal precedent. Owen is found guilty, though Kornreich obviously intends to be lenient on him. Having won a legal victory, Owen reunites with his wife. Walking out of the courthouse, an activist approaches Owen about blowing up a billboard TV that has been causing accidents and is an eyesore of the cityscape. A dual ending is provided, one in which Owen flees with the activist, and one where he politely declines to accompany her and gets into a cab with his wife.

Stephen Holden wrote that the film \\"is the second part of a projected \\"fanatic trilogy\\" that began with The Believer.\\" Critical reception The film received mixed reviews from critics. The New York Times film critic Stephen Holden called Noise \\"a one-trick film that rapidly wears out its welcome.\\" Holden said the film \\"is shallow and loud\\" and \\"lurches unsteadily between drama and comedy.\\" Holden wrote \\"Its performances are discordant\\" and said \\"you have to wonder to what degree Mr. Robbins, an actor famous for his political activism, is here simply because he shares Mr. Bean's outrage.\\" David Denby of The New Yorker wrote that the film \\"is certainly odd, but the movie is alive with the creative madness of New York.\\" Denby said \\"Surely a more glamorous actor would have given Noise a lighter, more satirical spin, but Robbins makes David a lost, unhappy man who needs to save himself, and that's the right way to go--it turns a one-note story into a universal fable.\\" Denby praised the performance of Margarita Levieva as Ekatrina. Denby wrote \\"What saves Noise--and makes it almost continuously entertaining--is Bean's sense of the city as a gathering place of clever, chattering people.\\" Box office performance The film opened in limited release in the United States on May 9, 2008 and grossed $3,697 in 2 theaters its opening weekend.

It is located in Helsinki and it is part of the Finnish National Defence University. In 2018, the Military Museum's exhibitions in Suomenlinna had around 131,000 visitors. The most popular exhibition is the submarine Vesikko, visited by around 50,000 people annually. Military Museum's exhibitions in Suomenlinna are located at Manege and Artillery Maneage.Melkko, Markku (1999). \\"Sukellusvene Vesikko\\", p. 27. Sotamuseon julkaisuja 2/1999, Gummerus Jyv√§skyl√§. The Military Museum's task is to collect, preserve, research and display artifacts and other heritage related to the development of the Defence Forces of Finland, Finland's military history and to the history of weaponry. As of 2016, the museum's exhibition locations at Liisankatu 1 and Maurinkatu 1 are closed. History Military Museum was founded November 25, 1929. The opening ceremony followed on October 18, 1930 at Liisankatu, Kruununhaka. Before the foundation, Finnish military history was first shown to the public in 1908 at Valtion historiallinen museo (The History Museum of the State) and later in 1918‚Äì1919 at the National Museum. The former exhibition's theme was The War of 1808‚Äì1809 and latter's Finnish Civil War.Huusko, Harri; Saari, Anssi; Haavisto, Lauri.\\"Sotamuseo eilen, nyt, tulevaisuudessa\\", Museo, 2/2011, pp. 14‚Äì17. In January 1930, The Ministry of Defence ordered Military Museum to continue in Suomenlinna Sea Fortress, where the building Bastion Carpelan was reserved for the museum's use. Lieutenant Reijo Wilhelm Palmroth was elected as museum manager. The opening ceremony took place on June 11, 1933 and in the following years the museum was annually visited by around 9254 people. The exhibition consisted of different arms sections which included jaegers, engineers, arms and navy. There were also civil war collections to be seen.Enqvist, Ove; H√§r√∂, Mikko (1998). \\"Varuskunnasta maailmanperinn√∂ksi ‚Äì Suomenlinnan itsen√§isyysajan vaiheet\\", p. 63. Suomenlinna ry, Uudenkaupungin Sanomat Oy, 1998. In the autumn of 1939, just before the breakout of the Winter War against the Soviet Union, the Military Museum was closed down. The items and collections were removed from bastion Carpelan during the war and stored around Finland. Even the museum's office had to be relocated from Helsinki because of the Soviet air bombings in 1944.Enqvist, Ove; H√§r√∂, Mikko (1998). \\"Varuskunnasta maailmanperinn√∂ksi ‚Äì Suomenlinnan itsen√§isyysajan vaiheet\\", p. 63. Suomenlinna ry, Uudenkaupungin Sanomat Oy, 1998. During the Winter War and Continuation War, the Military Museum organized a series of exhibitions at the Exhibition Hall. The first was Sotasaalisn√§yttely (War Looting Exhibition) in February 1940 which was shortly followed by the Sotamuiston√§yttely (War Memories Exhibition) I and II in 1941. Military Museum also organized touring exhibitions around Finland between 1941 and 1943 and even had exhibitions in Sweden in 1942‚Äì43. There were several purposes for these kinds of war exhibitions. It was, for example, a means to gather funds for war invalids and their families, to show how it was to fight on Finnish side at the front, and to lift up morale among citizens.Huusko, Harri; Saari, Anssi; Haavisto, Lauri. \\"Sotamuseo eilen, nyt, tulevaisuudessa\\", Museo, 2/2011, pp. 14‚Äì17. 1944 was the year of the foundation of Sotamuistoyhdistys, later to be named Suomen sotahistoriallinen seura (The Association for Military History in Finland). The association is an independent unit but it is run in a close relationship with the Military Museum. Its goal is to cherish the memory of Finnish wars in various ways. After the war, Military Museum had to manage without exhibition halls for a short period of time. The situation changed when it received a hall at Maurinkatu, Kruununhaka. Military Museum expanded more in the mid-1990s after setting up an exhibition also at Liisankatu. In March 2013, a new exhibition was opened there, but only three years later, in 2016, the exhibition at Kruununhaka was permanently closed. The Military Museum's only exhibitions are now located at the Manege building on Suomenlinna island. Military Museum's presence in Suomenlinna ceased shortly at the brink of Winter War in 1939. The collections in Bastion Carpelan were moved to the mainland and later Military Museum had to make way for the Armfelt Museum. However, there had been thoughts and debate about founding a Coastal Artillery Museum and Naval Museum in Suomenlinna in 1946‚Äì1948Enqvist, Ove; H√§r√∂, Mikko (1998). \\"Varuskunnasta maailmanperinn√∂ksi ‚Äì Suomenlinnan itsen√§isyysajan vaiheet\\", p. 202. Suomenlinna ry, Uudenkaupungin Sanomat Oy, 1998. and in the end, the Coastal Artillery Museum was opened in December 1948. The exhibition's time range was from autonomy to the times of independence. The Museum was closed in 2007 because the building was considered too unsound.Enqvist, Ove; H√§r√∂, Mikko (1998). \\"Varuskunnasta maailmanperinn√∂ksi ‚Äì Suomenlinnan itsen√§isyysajan vaiheet\\", p. 204. Suomenlinna ry, Uudenkaupungin Sanomat Oy, 1998. The Naval Museum opened its doors on 6 November 1948 although considerations about the exhibition had been made already in 1923. The exhibition showed Finnish naval defence during her independence era but in the end it didn't last long. Museum was ordered to close in 1963 due to high moisture and didn't manage to find new exhibition hall.Enqvist, Ove; H√§r√∂, Mikko (1998). \\"Varuskunnasta maailmanperinn√∂ksi ‚Äì Suomenlinnan itsen√§isyysajan vaiheet\\", p. 205. Suomenlinna ry, Uudenkaupungin Sanomat Oy, 1998. In the 1970s there emerged series of debates about opening Military Museum exhibition again in Suomenlinna in addition to submarine Vesikko, which had been open for the public as a museum since July 1973. After a number of failures Military Museum managed to gain the permit in August 1980. The Manege, which had been storage for Military Museum since 1974, was constructed to an exhibition hall during 1986‚Äì1989. The opening followed June 1, 1989.Enqvist, Ove; H√§r√∂, Mikko (1998). \\"Varuskunnasta maailmanperinn√∂ksi ‚Äì Suomenlinnan itsen√§isyysajan vaiheet\\", p. 203. Suomenlinna ry, Uudenkaupungin Sanomat Oy, 1998. From 2012, the Military Museum's Manege has show-cased an exhibition called From Autonomy to Atalanta. The Military Museum has organized over 30 special exhibitions during 1962‚Äì1984. Among these are for example 40th and 90th anniversaries of the Finnish Defence Forces in 1958 and 2008 respectively and several Winter War exhibitions.Saari, Anssi. \\"Sotamuseo 80 vuotta ‚Äì museotoimintaa Suomessa sodan ja rauhan oloissa.\\" Sotahistoriallinen Aikakauskirja 28/2009. Collections The collections of the Military Museum cover over 200,000 artifacts. Most artifacts are organized in research collections or stored. The collections include weapons, uniforms, medals, artworks, flags and vehicles among other things. One exhibit area is dedicated to Finnish war hero Lauri T√∂rni, who received the Mannerheim Cross.Remember the Military Museum in Helsinki during your summer holiday. 14 June 2012 Publications Military Museum publishes the Journal of Military History (Sotahistoriallinen Aikakauskirja) together with The Military History Society of Finland annually and has also created content to various multimedia publications. Exhibitions =Permanent exhibition= Manege Vesikko Artillery Manege The Military Museum's former permanent exhibition at Liisankatu displayed Finnish military history since the beginning of the fifteenth century. The main focus was in the 19th century. The exhibition at Liisankatu 1 is now permanently closed. =Submarine Vesikko, Manege and Artillery Manege= The Military Museum has in the summer time two exhibitions open in Suomenlinna. Vesikko is a Finnish submarine built in 1933 that served in the second World War in the Gulf of Finland. Vesikko is the only remaining submarine of the Finnish Fleet during the World War II. Other four U-boats were scrapped in 1953. During the Winter War and the Continuation war 1939‚Äì1944 Vesikko was in active service, conducting patrol and safeguard missions in the Gulf of Finland and √Öland archipelago. Vesikko managed to destroy one enemy transport ship as it sank Soviet Vyborg July 3, 1941 near Suursaari. After the peace treaty with the Soviet Union, Vesikko‚Äôs days in active service were over because The Peace Treaty of 1947 forbade Finland from owning and operating submarines. Vesikko was however saved for Finnish Navy's possible later educational purposes. But no use emerged for Vesikko and it was transferred to Katajanokka dockyard. The state planned to sell it in 1959 but thanks to the ex-submariners' strong lobbying, the submarine was once again saved and transported from Katajanokka to Suomenlinna in the early 1960s. After opening as a museum July 9, 1973 it has become the Military Museum's most popular exhibition. The Manege was opened to public June 1, 1989. The original exhibition consisted mainly of heavy weapons from Finnish wars against Soviet Union in 1939‚Äì1944. There have been arranged also special exhibitions, for example in 2003‚Äì2004 about Finnish submarines and in summer 2011 about the submarine Vesikko. The Manege's collections include e.g. a German 88mm Flak 37 Anti-Aircraft gun and British Vickers-Armstrong 38 light tank. Both have been used by the Finnish Army during the wars. One specialty in the exhibition is a torpedo tube from a Finnish S2- torpedo boat, sunk in 1925. In summer 2012 a new exhibition called From Autonomy to Atalanta was opened. The exhibition showcases Finnish military history from the 19th century to the present day. This exhibition was closed in October 2017. Finnish Defence Forces ‚Äì 100 years at the war and peace -exhibition was opened in 2018. The exhibition portrays the wars Finland has fought during its independence: the Civil was 1918, the Winter War in 1939‚Äì1940, the Continuation War in 1941-1944 and the Lapland War in 1944‚Äì1945. The exhibition continues in the adjacent building, telling the story of Finnish Defence Forces in the post-war period up to the present day Special military museums At the moment there are eight special military museums in Finland, which operate under the Military Museum's supervision. Due to limited resources and lack of exhibition halls, historical military collections have been divided to special arms museums. Especially the growing amount of collections in different army units has resulted in the founding of specialized military museums. They are often financed by foundations and have been founded since 1945. Special military museums include The Tank Museum, The Anti-Aircraft Museum, The Finnish Aviation Museum, The Infantry Museum, The Museum of Military Medicine, Mobilia, Forum Marinum and Museum Militaria, which comprises the Engineers Museum, The National Signals Museum and The Artillery Museum of Finland.

History Pratt's Mill was built between September 1861 and February 1862. The machinery from Calverley Mill, Tunbridge Wells was used in the construction of the mill. On 3 February 1862 the son of the miller was killed when he became entangled in the machinery. The mill was working by wind until 1907 and then by steam until 1922. Frank Brangwyn, RA painted the mill when it was without sails and fantail. The picture appears in an early book on windmills. In 1927 the mill was converted into residential accommodation, being reduced in height to three storeys. Description As built, Pratt's Mill was a five-storey brick tower mill clad in peg tiles. It had four Patent sails and the Kentish-style cap was winded by a fantail. All that remains today is the lower three storeys of the tower, with various additions and extensions.

It was released in October 2008 and features the same characters as the first book. Plot For 500 years, the secret society of the Midnight Sun has been waiting for the homunculus, the man-made man, to rise, and now the evil Dr. L and Ms. Mauvais are going to throw Cass and Max-Ernest to the sharks unless they tell them where he resides. After going on an excursion with their science teacher, the two are tricked by Dr. L after receiving a note from Pietro saying he will meet them on a ship, from which they barely escaped. After finding out their teacher is really Owen, the accent changing member of the Terces Society, they are introduced to the great magician himself, Pietro, who gives them a mission. The mission is to find the homunculus before the Midnight Sun does. Max-Ernest also finds out that 'Terces' is \\"secret\\" backwards. Cass is grounded when she returns home, because she was missing for too long. While on the Midnight Sun ship, Cass and Max-Ernest discovers a strange ball (also called the sound prism), which enables her to hear all types of sounds by putting it to her ear and makes wonderful music when thrown in the air carefully. Cass also discovers a birth certificate. The name is unrecognizable, thus making Cass wonder if she was the wrong girl that the Terces Society wanted. She ignores it, even though it pains her, and continues her mission. Later Cass finds out she is really adopted and was delivered in a box on her grandfathers' doorstep. This time teaming up with a new classmate named Yoji (who prefers to be called Yo-Yoji), the three need to escape the grasp of their parents, and find the alchemist's grave. Cass convinces her grandparents to take her, Max-Ernest, and Yo-Yoji camping to find the homunculus. When they find the homunculus, they take it back to Terces, but it runs away when he finds out they don't have good food. Meanwhile, Amber gets to meet the Skelton Sisters, who are in cahoots with Midnight Sun, and they ask her to do something for her. Later that night, Amber is hidden in Cass' bushes, and Cass hears noises. She goes outside and plays the Sound Prism, thinking it's Mr. Cabbage Face. Amber records the song from the sound prism, which attracts the homunculus, and gives it to the Skelton Sisters. They play it at a concert, and end up trapping the homunculus and Cass. They end up back near Whisper Lake, where they went camping. The Midnight Sun took there because Lord Pharaoh's, the nasty man who created Mr. Cabbage Face, the homunculus, grave is there, and with it, all of his alchemist things, which is what Ms. Mauvais and Dr. L want in order to help their mission in receiving immortality. The Midnight Sun and Terces Society members engage in combat because the Midnight Sun had captured Cass and Mr. Cabbage Face, in the while Max-Ernest and Yo-Yoji are up on a mountain, with the Sound Prism and a whip. Their plan is to create a sonic boom with it, and make the mountain avalanche onto the Midnight Sun and seal the coffin in the ground. When a huge boulder falls off the mountain from the sonic boom, Cass and Mr. Cabbage Face, now freed, are trying their own efforts to put the coffin back in the grave, but Mr. Cabbage Face screams to Cass to get out of the way, because the boulder was heading towards her. He pushes her out of the way, and Mr. Cabbage Face gets crushed into the ground with the coffin. The homunculus dies, due to, and is sealed with his maker in that grave forever. Midnight Sun members disperse, not before Dr. L can have a nice chat (surprisingly) with his brother/old friend. At the end, Max-Ernest, Cass and Yo-Yoji take the Oath of Terces, created by the Jester, the homunculus' only friend 500 years ago, and Cass' real great, great, great, great... great grandfather.

It is situated within the natural landscape of the campus and is surrounded by evergreens and rhododendrons. This state of the art performing arts venue holds the 1,200-seat Chan Shun Concert Hall, the flexible-seating Telus Studio Theatre, the 160-seat Royal Bank Cinema, the Great Performers Lounge, and a glass lobby. Completed in 1997, the Chan Centre hosts classes, rehearsals and performances for a variety of the UBC departments of music, film and theatre as well as a diverse, yearly performing arts season that attracts audiences from all over the Lower Mainland. History Chan Centre's exterior as seen from Crescent Road The creation of the Chan Centre was made possible by an initial donation from two brothers and businessmen, Tom and Caleb Chan. This was the largest private donation to a cultural institution in Canadian history at the time. The Chan brothers also donated additional funds in order to set up an endowment fund which, through the interest revenue that it generates, supports many arts organizations and diverse performances at the local, national and international level. The Chan brothers are philanthropists, businessmen and Seventh-day Adventists. Their father, Chan Shun, worked his way up in the business world, from sewing in a shirt factory to eventually becoming the head of the Crocodile Garments textile and clothing company. His sons were strongly influenced by his morals and generosity and in the 1980s, after immigrating to Canada, they decided to give back to their new country by helping to build an educational arts facility at UBC. They approached president David Strangway (president of UBC from 1985‚Äì1997) and made the proposal, and soon, the concept for a performing arts centre was in motion. The construction of the Chan Centre took 2 years to complete and the official opening occurred on May 11, 1997. The cost came to approximately $25 million with donations from the Chan Foundation of Canada, BC Tel (now Telus), the Royal Bank of Canada and the Provincial Government of British Columbia. Architecture The Chan Centre was a collaborative project between three companies; Bing Thom Architects from Vancouver created the overall building design, Artec Consultants in New York City designed the concert hall and acoustic specifications and Theatre Projects Consultants designed the studio theatre. Heading the team of architects was Vancouver's own Bing Thom. ARTEC's team was led by world- renowned acoustician, Russell Johnson. Together Johnson and Thom worked to design the Chan Centre from the inside out in order to create optimum acoustics for the concert hall. Venues Multiple photos of the interior at The Chan Centre For The Performing Arts stitched together in a panoramic view for publication in the magazine Professional Sound. =Chan Shun Concert Hall= The highlight of the Chan Centre is the Chan Shun Concert Hall. It was named after Tom and Caleb's father, Chan Shun, to honour his lifelong generosity. The concert hall has a capacity of 1,185 plus 180 choral loft seats which can be used if necessary. Hanging like a chandelier over the stage of the concert hall is the 37-tonne acoustic canopy, a sound reflector made of steel and cork which can be adjusted in height by a small motor. The hall also features motorized sound-absorbent fabric banners to acoustically mask walls. Flexibility and adaptability are key features in the design of the concert hall. The cello-like shape of the hall comes from the acoustically successful shoe box shape which allows for an even distribution of sound throughout the performance space. This shape also allows for a more consistent sound experience for audience members, no matter where they are sitting in the hall. The Chan Centre was constructed with over 6,500 cubic metres of concrete which can be seen throughout the building. In the concert hall, the concrete walls are convex, and have been jack hammered to create a stippled surface which helps to break down sound and prevent reverb; it also promotes a warm and intimate sound. All of the wood seen in the concert hall has been sealed to the concrete in order to prevent any sympathetic vibrations. =Telus Studio Theatre= Modeled after the Globe Theatre in London, this intimate and flexible studio theatre seats between 160-275 people depending on the seating configuration. The theatre holds 12 ‚Äì 3 level seating towers which can be moved using an air castor system, a technique used by Boeing to move airplane parts. Compressed air is blown through tubes and the towers then hover approximately 1/2 inch above the ground and are moved into configuration by 4-6 people. Although theatre productions, both from within the UBC Theatre Department and from the community, are the prevalent art form programmed in the studio theatre, it has also become a popular venue for small music ensembles, film shoots, CD release parties and dance recitals. =Royal Bank Cinema= The small, 160-seat cinema has multiple projection capabilities, including: Super 8, Xenon Slide projection, DVD, VHS, 16 mm and 35 mm. Although it is used primarily as a classroom for UBC film students, it also hosts conferences and has been the venue for the European Union Film Festival. Television appearances The building has featured in several television shows. It was used as \\"The 4400 Center\\" in several episodes of The 4400, and as the location for the \\"World Tolerance Initiative Annual Conference 2010\\" in season 2 episode 14 of Fringe. As well in the series of Stargate Atlantis, season 2 episode 5. In the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica it is a building in the Cloud 9 luxury ship, and was used as the meeting place for the Quorum of Twelve. In 2008, it was shown again, but this time, as The Madacorp building in the ABC Family show Kyle XY. Where Kyle, Declan, and Tom Foss were seen at in the episode called \\"House of Cards\\" and then it was later seen again in the episode called \\"C.I.R., With Love\\", when the whole Trager family go to The Madacorp Open House with Stephen. It was also used as the \\"Mendel Institute\\" school in Season 1 Episode 10 \\"Perception\\" in the series Almost Human in 2014. In 2015 it was used for being \\"I am The Center\\" church in Season 1 Episode 3 of Backstrom. In 2017, the lobby of the Chan Shun Concert Hall and the Telus Studio Theater were seen in multiple episodes of Legion. The exterior is also seen as Building 19 at the CDC in the final season of iZombie in 2019.

Geography  The island is elongated and small. It is situated off the Northern mouth of the Khatanga Gulf (Russian: –•–∞—Ç–∞–Ω–≥—Å–∫–∏–π –∑–∞–ª–∏–≤), 15 km north of Bolshoy Begichev Island. Preobrazheniya Island is 7 km in length and its maximum width is 2,5 km. This island is granitic and has high rocky cliffs on its eastern side. The west side of the island is sloping to a gravel beach.  History  This island was useful as a landmark for ships plying the Northern Sea Route in the past. It is also known as \\"Ostrov Vstrechnyy\\". There is an abandoned Polar research station on Preobrazheniya.  Administration  For administrative purposes Preobrazheniya Island belongs to the Sakha (Yakutia) Republic of the Russian Federation.

Throughout this list, the perpetrator of the confidence trick is called the \\"con artist\\" or simply \\"artist\\", and the intended victim is the \\"mark\\". Particular scams are mainly directed toward elderly people, as they may be credulous and sometimes inexperienced or insecure, especially when the scam involves modern technology such as computers and the internet. This list should not be considered complete but covers the most common examples. Get-rich-quick schemes Get- rich-quick schemes are extremely varied; these include fake franchises, real estate \\"sure things\\", get-rich-quick books, wealth-building seminars, self- help gurus, sure-fire inventions, useless products, chain letters, fortune tellers, quack doctors, miracle pharmaceuticals, foreign exchange fraud, Nigerian money scams, and charms and talismans. Variations include the pyramid scheme, the Ponzi scheme, and the matrix scheme. =The \\"Money-Box Scheme\\"= Victor Lustig, a German con artist, designed and sold a \\"money box\\" which he claimed could print $100 bills using blank sheets of paper. A victim, sensing huge profits and untroubled by ethical implications, would buy the machine for a high price‚Äîfrom $25,000 to $102,000. Lustig stocked the machine with six to nine genuine $100 bills for demonstration purposes, but after that it produced only blank paper. By the time victims realized that they had been scammed, Lustig was long gone. =Salting = Salting or \\"salting the mine\\" are terms for a scam in which gemstones or gold ore are planted in a mine or on the landscape, duping the mark into purchasing shares in a worthless or non- existent mining company.Dan Plazak A Hole in the Ground with a Liar at the Top (Salt Lake: Univ. of Utah Press, 2006) . During gold rushes, scammers would load shotguns with gold dust and shoot into the sides of the mine to give the appearance of a rich ore, thus \\"salting the mine\\". Examples include the diamond hoax of 1872 and the Bre-X gold fraud of the mid-1990s. This trick was featured in the HBO series Deadwood, when Al Swearengen and E. B. Farnum trick Brom Garret into believing gold is to be found on the claim Swearengen intends to sell him. This con was also featured in Sneaky Pete. In season 3 of the TV series Leverage, the team salts a mine with coltan in order to run a con on a greedy mineowner and his corrupt political partner. =Spanish Prisoner= The Spanish Prisoner scam ‚Äî and its modern variant, the advance-fee scam or \\"Nigerian letter scam\\" ‚Äî involves enlisting the mark to aid in retrieving some stolen money from its hiding place. The victim sometimes believes they can cheat the con artists out of their money, but anyone trying this has already fallen for the essential con by believing that the money is there to steal (see also Black money scam). Note that the classic Spanish Prisoner trick also contains an element of the romance scam (see below). Many con artists employ extra tricks to keep the victim from going to the police. A common ploy of investment scammers is to encourage a mark to use money concealed from tax authorities. The mark cannot go to the authorities without revealing that they have committed tax fraud. Many swindles involve a minor element of crime or some other misdeed. The mark is made to think that they will gain money by helping fraudsters get huge sums out of a country (the classic advance-fee fraud/Nigerian scam); hence a mark cannot go to the police without revealing that they planned to commit a crime themself. In a twist on the Nigerian fraud scheme, the mark is told they are helping someone overseas collect debts from corporate clients. Large cheques stolen from businesses are mailed to the mark. These cheques are altered to reflect the mark's name, and the mark is then asked to cash them and transfer all but a percentage of the funds (their commission) to the con artist. The cheques are often completely genuine, except that the \\"pay to\\" information has been expertly changed. This exposes the mark not only to enormous debt when the bank reclaims the money from their account, but also to criminal charges for money laundering. A more modern variation is to use laser-printed counterfeit cheques with the proper bank account numbers and payer information. This scam can be seen on the film The Spanish Prisoner. Persuasion tricks Persuasion fraud, when fraudsters persuade people only to target their money, is an old-fashioned type of fraud. =Grandparent scam= A grandparent gets a call or e-mail from someone claiming to be their grandchild, saying that they are in trouble. For example, the scammer may claim to have been arrested and require money wired, or gift cards purchased for bail, and asks the victim not to tell the grandchild's parents, as they would \\"only get upset.\\" The call is fraudulent impersonation, the name of the grandchild typically obtained from social media postings as well as obituaries listed either in newspapers or from a funeral home's website. Any money wired out of the country is gone forever. =Romance scam= The traditional romance scam has now moved into Internet dating sites, gaining a new name of catfishing. The con actively cultivates a romantic relationship which often involves promises of marriage. However, after some time, it becomes evident that this Internet \\"sweetheart\\" is stuck in their home country or a third country, lacking the money to leave and therefore unable to be united with the mark. The scam then becomes an advance-fee fraud or a check fraud. A wide variety of reasons can be offered for the trickster's lack of cash, but rather than just borrow the money from the victim (advance fee fraud), the con-artist normally declares that they have checks which the victim can cash on their behalf and remit the money via a non-reversible transfer service to help facilitate the trip (check fraud). Of course, the checks are forged or stolen and the con-artist never makes the trip: the hapless victim ends up with a large debt and an aching heart. This scam can be seen in the movie Nights of Cabiria. In some cases, an online dating site is itself engaged in fraud, posting profiles of fictional persons or persons which the operator knows are not currently looking for a date in the advertised locality. =Fortune-telling fraud= One traditional swindle involves fortune-telling. In this scam, a fortune teller uses cold reading skills to detect that a client is genuinely troubled rather than merely seeking entertainment; or is a gambler complaining of bad luck. The fortune teller informs the mark that they are the victim of a curse, and that for a fee a spell can be cast to remove the curse. In Romany, this trick is called bujo (\\"bag\\") after one traditional format: the mark is told that the curse is in their money; they bring money in a bag to have the spell cast over it, and leaves with a bag of worthless paper.W. W. Zellner, William M. Kephart, Extraordinary groups: an examination of unconventional lifestyles (Macmillan, 2000; ), pp. 121‚Äì22 Fear of this scam has been one justification for legislation that makes fortune-telling a crime.Spiritual Psychic Science Church v. City of Azusa (1985) 39 Cal.3d 501, 217 Cal.Rptr. 225; 703 P.2d 1119 See the \\"Blessing Scam\\" below. This scam got a new lease on life in the electronic age with the virus hoax. Fake anti-virus software falsely claims that a computer is infected with viruses, and renders the machine inoperable with bogus warnings unless blackmail is paid. In the Datalink Computer Services incident, a mark was fleeced of several millions of dollars by a firm that claimed that his computer was infected with viruses, and that the infection indicated an elaborate conspiracy against him on the Internet. The alleged scam lasted from August 2004 through October 2010 and is estimated to have cost the victim $6‚Äì20 million. Gold brick scams Gold brick scams involve selling a tangible item for more than it is worth; they are named after selling the victim an allegedly golden ingot which turns out to be gold- coated lead. =Green goods= The green goods scam, also known as the \\"green goods game\\", was a scheme popular in the 19th-century United States in which people were duped into paying for worthless counterfeit money. It is a variation on the pig-in-a-poke scam using money instead of other goods like a pig. The mark, or victim, would respond to flyers circulated throughout the country by the scammers (\\"green goods men\\") which claimed to offer \\"genuine\\" counterfeit currency for sale. This currency was sometimes alleged to have been printed with stolen engraving plates. Victims, usually living outside major cities, would be enticed to travel to the location of the green goods men to complete the transaction. Victims were guided by a \\"steerer\\" to be shown large amounts of genuine currency‚Äîrepresented to be counterfeit‚Äîwhich was then placed in a bag or satchel. Victims then received offers to purchase the money at a price much less than face value. While a victim negotiated a price or was otherwise distracted, another accomplice (the \\"ringer\\") would switch the bag of money for a bag containing sawdust, green paper, or other worthless items. Victims would leave unaware of the switch, and were unwilling to report the crime, as attempting to purchase counterfeit currency was itself a crime and the victim accordingly risked arrest. =Pig in a poke (cat in a bag)= Pig in a poke originated in the late Middle Ages. The con entails a sale of what is claimed to be a small pig, in a poke (bag). The bag actually contains a cat (not particularly prized as a source of meat). If one buys the bag without looking inside it, the person has bought something of less value than was assumed, and has learned first-hand the lesson caveat emptor. \\"Buying a pig in a poke\\" has become a colloquial expression in many European languages, including English, for when someone buys something without examining it beforehand.Brewer, Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, 1898. In some regions the \\"pig\\" in the phrase is replaced by \\"cat\\", referring to the bag's actual content, but the saying is otherwise identical. This is also said to be where the phrase \\"letting the cat out of the bag\\" comes from, although there may be other explanations. In Portuguese or Spanish speaking countries, the \\"pig\\" in the phrase is replaced by a hare or jackrabbit. A victim thinks he is buying a hare, when in reality he is buying a cat, hence the expression \\"gato por lebre\\" (in Portuguese) or \\"gato por liebre\\" (in Spanish). =Thai gems= The Thai gem scam involves layers of con men and helpers who tell a tourist in Bangkok of an opportunity to earn money by buying duty-free jewelry and having it shipped back to the tourist's home country. The mark is driven around the city in a tuk-tuk operated by one of the con men, who ensures that the mark meets one helper after another, until the mark is persuaded to buy the jewelry from a store also operated by the swindlers. The gems are real but significantly overpriced. This scam has been operating for twenty years in Bangkok, and is said to be protected by Thai police and politicians. A similar scam usually runs in parallel for custom-made suits. Many tourists are hit by con men touting both goods. A similar trick in Thailand involves lying about the presence of ivory in ornaments. Tricksters offer a non-ivory ornament for sale next to a sign in English reading \\"It is strictly forbidden to transport ivory into the United States, and the seller assumes no responsibility\\". This may make the buyer believe he or she has stumbled upon \\"forbidden fruit\\", tempting him to purchase the ornament, usually small and easy to hide, and smuggle it out of the country. The buyer would later discover that the ornament is made out of bone matter with no trace of ivory whatsoever. =White-van speakers= In the white van speaker scam, low-quality loudspeakers are sold‚Äîstereotypically from a white van‚Äîas expensive units that have been greatly discounted. The salesmen explain the ultra-low price in a number of ways; for instance, that their employer is unaware of having ordered too many speakers, so they are sneakily selling the excess behind the boss's back. The \\"speakermen\\" are ready to be haggled down to a seemingly minuscule price, because the speakers they are selling, while usually functional, actually cost only a tiny fraction of their \\"list price\\" to manufacture. The scam may extend to the creation of Web sites for the bogus brand, which usually sounds similar to that of a respected loudspeaker company. They will often place an ad for the speakers in the \\"For sale\\" Classifieds of the local newspaper, at the exorbitant price, and then show the mark a copy of this ad to \\"verify\\" their worth. A \\"trade show\\" variation of a similar scam might involve a scammer pretending to have car troubles on the side of a highway, trying to hail passing vehicles. When a good Samaritan pulls over, the person claims to be a foreign citizen visiting the country to participate in some local trade show. The person claims that they are about to leave the country after the show (e.g. are on their way to the airport), but their car has ran out of fuel and they have no local currency to refill it or hire a taxi. At the same time they demonstrate that the trunk of their car is full of goods, which they claim have been taken from their just-dismantled company booth after the show. These goods are typically compact popular items like electronics or power tools. They offer these items to the mark at a \\"significantly reduced\\" price, allegedly just to raise some local cash in order to \\"get to the airport\\". (Sometimes the scammer tries to sell a valuable personal jewelry item, like a gold ring off his finger.) In most cases the items are technically genuine, but worth incomparably less than what the scammer attempts to sell them for. In a well-prepared version of this scam the scammer is often a true foreigner, speaking with genuine accent and possessing good mastery of their respective foreign language. People shopping for bootleg software, illegal pornographic images, bootleg music, drugs, firearms or other forbidden or controlled goods may be legally hindered from reporting swindles to the police. An example is the \\"big screen TV in the back of the truck\\": the TV is touted as \\"hot\\" (stolen), so it will be sold for a very low price. The TV is in fact defective or broken; it may in fact not even be a television at all, since some scammers have discovered that a suitably decorated oven door will suffice. The buyer has no legal recourse without admitting to the attempted purchase of stolen goods. =Iraqi Dinar= Iraqi currency is sold to would-be investors with the belief that economic/financial circumstances will drastically increase the value of their investment. In fact there is no credible rationale or information to indicate that those circumstances will materialize or, if they do materialize, that they will have significant effect on the value of the currency. Moreover, the dealers sell currency to these investors at substantial mark-up such that a significant appreciation of the currency would be required just to make their investment break even. =Noorseekee= The Noorseekee (–Ω—É—Ä—Å–∏–∫–∏) scam is a multiple-round variant of the gold brick scam which has entered Russian urban legends from unverifiable incidents during the Afghanistan conflict. The scam consists of multiple \\"seller\\" and \\"buyer\\" rounds, the sellers and buyers both being Soviet officers in on the con. The \\"sellers\\" initially offered a small amount of a mysterious item‚Äîsmall shiny gold-colored cups called \\"noorseekee\\"‚Äîat a prominent bazaar for cheap (\\"seller\\" round). The first \\"seller\\" round ended with a minor deal, as the merchants were traditionally expected to buy at least a sample of a new and unknown good \\"just in case\\". Then the \\"buyers\\" visited the same bazaar demanding any noorseekee available and credulously paying more than the \\"sellers\\" had demanded. The merchants, making easy profits, were thus much more enthusiastic toward the next \\"sellers\\". Noorseekee were small, stackable, reasonably durable, light-weight and would neither spoil nor rust, making the trade especially easy. This went on for several rounds to build trust, form messaging pathways and establish the noorseekee as a special ware or even a Soviet-specialized secondary currency. On the pre-final round the \\"buyers\\" emptied the bazaar's collective supply of noorseekee and left with the announcement of returning soon with an exorbitant amount of money, while leaving an equally exorbitant order for more noorseekee (and even a down- payment). The \\"sellers\\" gladly agreed to provide the demanded amount of wares, but demanded a higher per-unit price citing e.g. the need to pay more hush money to their commanding officers. Then the \\"sellers\\" fulfilled the order and the merchants bought massive amounts (e.g. literal truckloads) of noorseekee expecting to make a large profit due to the size of the outstanding \\"order\\", regardless of the reduced per-unit profit and regardless of the high investment it demanded of them. The size of the final noorseekee order would usually exceed the bazaar's cash reserves, causing the merchants to access their savings and / or barter away stockpiled premium goods. Obviously, the \\"buyers\\" would never be seen again, leaving the bazaar's merchants with truckloads of noorseekee and no means to sell them. Establishing new contacts with the Soviets would then reveal the noorseekee as worthless brass caps from Soviet gunships' unguided air-to-ground missile packs (–Ω—É—Ä—Å–∏–∫–∏ derives as the diminutive from –ù–£–†–°, i.e. –Ω–µ—É–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª—è–µ–º—ã–π —Ä–∞–∫–µ—Ç–Ω—ã–π —Å–Ω–∞—Ä—è–¥, said unguided missile). These caps were used during shipping (and discarded when the missile packs were slotted to the gunships) by the millions and were essentially worth nothing. Extortion or false-injury tricks =Badger game= The badger game extortion was perpetrated largely upon married men. The mark is deliberately coerced into a compromising position, a supposed affair for example, then threatened with public exposure of his acts unless blackmail money is paid. =Bogus dry-cleaning bill scam= A mail fraud that is typically perpetrated on restaurateurs, this scheme takes a receipt from a legitimate dry cleaner in the target city, duplicates it thousands of times, and sends it to every upscale eatery in town. An attached note claims a server in the victim's restaurant spilled food, coffee, wine or salad dressing on a diner's expensive suit of clothes, and demands reimbursement for dry cleaning costs. As the amount fraudulently claimed from each victim is relatively low, some will give the scammers the benefit of the doubt, or simply seek to avoid the nuisance of further action, and pay the claim. The scam's return address is a drop box; the rest of the contact information is fictional or belongs to an innocent third party. The original dry cleaning shop, which has nothing to do with the scheme, receives multiple irate enquiries from victimised restaurateurs. =Clip joint= A clip joint or \\"fleshpot\\" is an establishment, usually a strip club or entertainment bar, typically one claiming to offer adult entertainment or bottle service, in which customers are tricked into paying money and receive poor, or no, goods or services in return. Typically, clip joints suggest the possibility of sex, charge excessively high prices for watered-down drinks, then eject customers when they become unwilling or unable to spend more money. The product or service may be illicit, offering the victim no recourse through official or legal channels. =Coin-matching game= Also called a coin smack or smack game, two operators trick a victim during a game where coins are matched. One operator begins the game with the victim, then the second joins in. When the second operator leaves briefly, the first colludes with the victim to cheat the second operator. After rejoining the game, the second operator, angry at \\"losing,\\" threatens to call the police. The first operator convinces the victim to pitch in hush money, which the two operators later split.Staff report (November 9, 1913). Coin matchers of Times Square are doing rushing business; Detective Says He Knows No Less than 100 Professionals in That Line, Who Feel Safe Because Few Ever Get \\"Sent Up.\\" New York Times =Fraudulent collection agencies= A consumer inquires about a payday loan or short-term credit online and is asked for a long list of personal information. The lender is a shell firm; the loan might never be made, but the victim's personal information is now in the hands of scammers who sells it to a fraudulent collection agency. That agency then launches into a series of harassing phone calls at all hours (often to the victim's workplace), attempts to obtain bank account numbers (allowing the account to be drained through direct withdrawal) or impersonates police (sometimes with caller ID spoofing) to threaten the victim with arrest. Fake debt collectors often refuse to provide a legally- required written \\"validation notice\\" of the debt, provide no evidence a debt is actually owed and demand payment using a money transfer service like Moneygram or Western Union with poor traceability and no chargeback protection. The underlying debt either does not exist, is not valid due to a statute of limitations or does not lawfully belong to the entity making the calls; in some cases, the victim is a target of identity theft. The scammers operate under multiple names, many of which are intended to be mistaken for official or government agencies. The fraudulent calls often originate from abroad; any money extorted is immediately taken out of the country. =Fraudulent law firms= A bogus or dishonest law firm is a valuable tool to a scammer in various ways. It can send requests for upfront payments in relation to inheritances coming from unknown relatives, a form of advance fee fraud. It also makes an effective fraudulent collection agency, as victims fear having to pay their own counsel hundreds of dollars per hour to defend against frivolous, vexatious or completely unfounded claims. In some cases, the dishonest lawyer is merely part of a larger fraudulent scheme. A real estate fraud may involve taking deposits for a project under construction where, in theory, the lawyer is holding the money in escrow, guarding down payments as trust fund assets until a real estate deal closes. When the project is never completed, investors seek their money back but find the supposed trust fund is empty as both lawyer and real estate developer are fraudulent. =Insurance fraud= Insurance fraud includes a wide variety of schemes in which insureds attempt to defraud their own insurance carriers, but when the victim is a private individual, the con artist tricks the mark into damaging, for example, the con artist's car, or injuring the con artist, in a manner that the con artist can later exaggerate. One relatively common scheme involves two cars, one for the con artist, and the other for the shill. The con artist will pull in front of the victim, and the shill will pull in front of the con artist before slowing down. The con artist will then slam on his brakes to \\"avoid\\" the shill, causing the victim to rear-end the con artist. The shill will accelerate away, leaving the scene. The con artist will then claim various exaggerated injuries in an attempt to collect from the victim's insurance carrier despite having intentionally caused the accident. Insurance carriers, who must spend money to fight even those claims they believe are fraudulent, frequently pay out thousands of dollars‚Äîa tiny amount to the carrier despite being a significant amount to an individual‚Äîto settle these claims instead of going to court. A variation of this scam occurs in countries where insurance premiums are generally tied to a bonus-malus rating: the con artist will offer to avoid an insurance claim, settling instead for a cash compensation. Thus, the con artist is able to evade a professional damage assessment, and get an untraceable payment in exchange for sparing the mark the expenses of a lowered merit class. =Melon drop= The melon drop is a scam similar to the Chinese version Pengci in which a scammer will cause an unsuspecting mark to bump into them causing the scammer to drop an item of alleged value. The scam originally targeted Japanese tourists due to the high price of watermelon in Japan. The scammer may receive upwards of $100 for \\"compensation\\". The scam has also been called broken glasses scam or broken bottle scam where the scammer will pretend the mark broke a pair of expensive glasses or use a bottle of cheap wine, liquor or a bottle filled with water and demand compensation. Asian tourists are often the primary target. =Pengci= P√®ngc√≠ is a scam originating in China in which scammers feign injury in traffic accidents in order to extort money from drivers. Scammers also may place ostensibly expensive, fragile items (usually porcelain) in places where they may easily be knocked over, allowing them to collect damages when the items are damaged.China‚Äôs new diplomacy in Europe has a name: broken porcelain. Beijing‚Äôs message to Sweden and beyond ‚Äì criticise us, and we'll topple your agenda ‚Äì won't win it any hearts and minds. David Bandurski. The Guardian 17 Oct 2018. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/17/china-new-diplomacy- broken-porcelain-sweden Gambling tricks =Baltimore Stockbroker / Psychic Sports Picks= The Baltimore stockbroker scam relies on mass-mailing or emailing. The scammer begins with a large pool of marks, numbering ideally a power of two such as 1024 (210). The scammer divides the pool into two halves, and sends all the members of each half a prediction about the future outcome of an event with a binary outcome (such as a stock price rising or falling, or the win/loss outcome of a sporting event). One half receives a prediction that the stock price will rise (or a team will win, etc.), and the other half receives the opposite prediction. After the event occurs, the scammer repeats the process with the group that received a correct prediction, again dividing the group in half and sending each half new predictions. After several iterations, the \\"surviving\\" group of marks has received a remarkable sequence of correct predictions, whereupon the scammer then offers these marks another prediction, this time for a fee. The next prediction is, of course, no better than a random guess, but the previous record of success makes it seem to the mark to be a prediction worth great value. For gambling propositions with more than two outcomes, for example in horse racing, the scammer begins with a pool of marks with number equal to a power of the number of outcomes, and divides the marks at each step into the corresponding number of groups, thus insuring that one group receives a correct prediction at each step. This requires a larger number of marks at the beginning, but fewer steps are required to gain the confidence of the marks who receive successful predictions, because the probability of a correct prediction is lower at each step, and thus it seems more remarkable. The scam relies on selection bias and survivorship bias and is similar to publication bias (the file-drawer effect) in scientific publishing (whereby successful experiments are more likely to be published, rather than failures). Several authors mention the scam: Daniel C. Dennett in Elbow Room (where he calls it the touting pyramid); David Hand in The Improbability Principle; and Jordan Ellenberg in How Not to Be Wrong. Ellenberg reports often hearing of the scam told as an illustrative parable, but he could not find a real-world example of anyone carrying it out as an actual scam. The closest he found was when illusionist Derren Brown presented it in his television special The System in 2008. Brown's intent was merely to convince his mark that he had a foolproof horse race betting system rather than to scam the mark out of money. However, Ellenberg goes on to describe how investment firms do something similar by starting many in-house investment funds, and closing the funds that show the lowest returns before offering the surviving funds (with their record of high returns) for sale to the public. The selection bias inherent in the surviving funds makes them unlikely to sustain their previous high returns. =Fiddle game= The fiddle game uses the pigeon drop technique. A pair of con men work together, one going into an expensive restaurant in shabby clothes, eating, and claiming to have left his wallet at home, which is nearby. As collateral, the con man leaves his only worldly possession, the violin that provides his livelihood. After he leaves, the second con man swoops in, offers an outrageously large amount (for example $50,000) for what he calls a rare instrument, then looks at his watch and runs off to an appointment, leaving his card for the mark to call him when the fiddle-owner returns. The \\"poor man\\" comes back, having gotten the money to pay for his meal and redeem his violin. The mark, thinking he has an offer on the table from the second conspirator, then buys the violin from the fiddle player who \\"reluctantly\\" agrees to sell it for a certain amount that still allows the mark to make a \\"profit\\" from the valuable violin. The result is the two con men are richer (less the cost of the violin), and the mark is left with a cheap instrument. The fiddle game may be played with any sufficiently valuable-seeming piece of property; a common variation known as the pedigreed- dog swindle uses a mongrel dog upsold as a rare breed but is otherwise identical. =Lottery fraud by proxy= Lottery fraud by proxy is a scam in which the scammer buys a lottery ticket with old winning numbers. He or she then alters the date on the ticket so that it appears to be from the day before, and therefore a winning ticket. He or she then sells the ticket to the mark, claiming it is a winning ticket, but for some reason, he or she is unable to collect the prize (not eligible, etc.). The particular cruelty in this scam is that if the mark attempts to collect the prize, the fraudulently altered ticket will be discovered and the mark held criminally liable. This con was featured in the movie Matchstick Men, where Nicolas Cage teaches it to his daughter. A twist on the con was shown in Great Teacher Onizuka, where the more-than-gullible Onizuka was tricked into getting a \\"winning ticket\\". The ticket was not altered, but the daily newspaper reporting the day's winning numbers was altered with a black pen. In the USSR this scam left three people dead in 1977, after a mark re-sold a fraudulent ticket and the second buyer engaged a criminal to \\"clear the issue\\", leading to the murder of the original mark and two family members. The investigations using a fake lottery uncovered a large group of marks all targeted by a single artist, a disgruntled former employee of the Mint who used his insider knowledge and skills to produce the high-quality forged tickets. =Three-card Monte= Three-card Monte, \\"find the queen\\", the \\"three-card trick\\", or \\"follow the lady\\" is essentially the same as the centuries-older shell game or thimblerig (except for the props).Tom Ogden The Complete Idiot's Guide to Magic Tricks, p. 123, Alpha Books (1998) The trickster shows three playing cards to the audience, one of which is a queen (the \\"lady\\"), then places the cards face-down, shuffles them around, and invites the audience to bet on which one is the queen. At first the audience is skeptical, so the shill places a bet, and the scammer allows him to win. In one variation of the game, the shill will (apparently surreptitiously) peek at the lady, ensuring that the mark also sees the card. This is sometimes enough to entice the audience to place bets, but the trickster uses sleight of hand to ensure that he always loses, unless the con man decides to let him win, hoping to lure him into betting much more. The mark loses whenever the dealer chooses to make him lose. A variation on this scam exists in Barcelona, Spain, but with the addition of a pickpocket. The dealer and shill behave in an overtly obvious manner, attracting a larger audience. When the pickpocket succeeds in stealing from a member of the audience, he signals the dealer. The dealer then shouts the word \\"aguas\\" ‚Äì colloquial for \\"Watch Out!\\" ‚Äì and the three split up. The audience is left believing that the police are coming, and that the performance was a failed scam. A variant of this scam exists in Mumbai, India. The shill says loudly to the dealer that his cards are fake and that he wants to see them. He takes the card and folds a corner and says in a hushed voice to the audience that he has marked the card. He places a bet and wins. Then he asks the others to place bets as well. When one of the audience bets a large sum of money, the cards are switched. Spurious qualifications or endorsements =Diploma mill= Governmental bodies maintain a list of entities which accredit educational institutions. The US Department of Education, for instance, oversees higher education accreditation in the United States. Most diploma mills are not accredited by such an entity, although many obtain accreditation from other organizations (such as accreditation mills or corrupt foreign officials) to appear legitimate. Graduates of these institutions risk that the qualifications gained at these institutions may not be sufficient for further study, lawful employment or professional licensure as their issuers do not hold locally-valid accreditation to grant the degrees. Some diploma mills perform no instruction or examination, instead issuing credentials based on payment and \\"life experience\\". A few have unknowingly issued degrees and credentials to companion animals.Jennifer Feehan and \\"Police dog's bachelor's degree prods legal howling about chief\\", Toledo Blade, February 28, 2007 The Doctor of Divinity title is particularly prone to misuse. In the United Kingdom it is an earned postdoctoral credential which requires a string of publications, but in the United States any church may confer it as an honorary title; ordination mills readily grant this doctorate for a moderate fee and token amount of study. =Vanity publications and awards= A vanity press is a pay-to-publish scheme where a publishing house, typically an author mill, obtains the bulk of its revenues from authors who pay to have their books published instead of from readers purchasing the finished books. As the author bears the entire financial risk, the vanity press profits even if the books are not promoted (or badly promoted) and do not sell. The growth of print on demand, which allows small quantities of books to be printed cheaply, has accelerated this trend. Vanity publishing is not the same as self-publishing, in that self-published authors own their finished books and control their distribution, relying on a print shop solely to turn camera-ready content into printed volumes. In a vanity press, the author takes the financial risk while the publisher owns the printed volumes. A vanity award is an award which the recipient purchases, giving the false appearance of a legitimate honour.Miller C. (2013). Atlas of US and Canadian Environmental History, p64. Taylor & Francis. These are closely related to the Who's Who scam, where a biographic subject pays for a vanity listing in a printed directory. Who's Who scam Operators of fraudulent \\"Who's Who\\"-type directories would offer listings or \\"membership\\" to purchasers who are often unaware of the low rates the directories in question are consulted. World Luxury Association The World Luxury Association is a self-proclaimed international organisation based in China that offers \\"official registration\\" for luxury brands, and inclusion in an \\"official list\\" of luxury brands, in return for a fee. Online scams =Fake antivirus= Computer users unwittingly download and install rogue security software, malware disguised as antivirus software, by following the messages which appear on their screen. The software then pretends to find multiple viruses on the victim's computer, \\"removes\\" a few, and asks for payment in order to take care of the rest. They are then linked to con artists' websites, professionally designed to make their bogus software appear legitimate, where they must pay a fee to download the \\"full version\\" of their \\"antivirus software\\". =Phishing= Phishing is a modern scam in which the artist communicates with the mark, masquerading as a representative of an official organization with which the mark is doing business, in order to extract personal information which can then be used, for example, to steal money. In a typical instance, the artist sends the mark an email pretending to be from a company, such as eBay. It is formatted exactly like email from that business, and will ask the mark to \\"verify\\" some personal information at the website, to which a link is provided, in order to \\"reactivate\\" his blocked account. The website is fake but designed to look exactly like the business' website. The site contains a form asking for personal information such as credit card numbers, which the mark feels compelled to give or lose all access to the service. When the mark submits the form (without double-checking the website address), the information is sent to the swindler. A similar caller ID spoofing scheme exists with misleading telephone calls (\\"vishing\\") facilitated by Internet telephony. A fraudster can make calls through an Internet-PSTN gateway to impersonate banks, police, schools or other trusted entities. A random dialer computer or auto-dialer can impersonate healthcare providers to get Social Security numbers and birthdates from elderly patients recently released from the hospital. The auto-dialer call states it is from a reputable hospital or a pharmacy and the message explains the need to \\"update records\\" to be from the hospital or a pharmacy. Other online scams include advance-fee fraud, bidding fee auctions (\\"penny auctions\\"), click fraud, domain slamming, various spoofing attacks, web-cramming, and online versions of employment scams, romance scams, and fake rewards. =Fake support call= Unsuspecting computer owners and users are being targeted by people claiming to be from Windows, i.e., Microsoft or from their internet provider and then telling them that their computer/machine is creating errors and they need to correct the faults on their computers. They can even get people to go to one site or another to show them these so-called errors, at which point they are required to give their credit card details in order to purchase some form of support, after which they are asked to allow remote connection to the \\"error-laden\\" computer so that the problem(s) may be fixed. At this point the victim's computer is infected with malware or spyware or remote connection software =Bank login scam= A scammer convinces a victim to log in to a bank and convince them that they are receiving money. Some victims of the technical support scam may have their information sold or traded to a new organization that will cold-call them and tell them that they are entitled to a refund for the support they have previously paid for. Alternatively, the scammer may impersonate a security company and convince the victim that hackers are manipulating their bank account. The goal is for the scammer to transfer money between the user's accounts and to use HTML editing in the browser to make it appear as though new money has been transferred into the account by a legitimate company. The scammer \\"makes a mistake\\" and sends a larger amount of money than what he initially said he would send, then convinces the victim that they must refund the mistakenly sent extra money to the scammer via a wire transfer, money order, or gift cards. Religion-based schemes =The Affinity Church scam= Claiming to share someone else's viewpoint is the sneaky cover many church scam artists use. Pretending to share their faith lulls members of religious organizations into thinking a scammer is genuine. Often claiming some kind of divine guidance, using religious slogans, or claiming to be raising funds for a religious or other worthy cause, church scammers invite their new ‚Äúfriends‚Äù to invest in what turns out to be nothing more than a Ponzi Scheme. This is such a common crime that the state of Arizona listed affinity scams of this type as its number one scam for 2009. In one recent nationwide religious scam, churchgoers are said to have lost more than $50 million in a phony gold bullion scheme, promoted on daily telephone ‚Äúprayer chains,‚Äù in which they thought they could earn a huge return. Other confidence tricks and scams =Art student= The art student scam is common in major Chinese cities. A small group of 'students' will start a conversation, citing a wish to practice their English. In short order they will maneuver the conversation over to education and will claim to be art students wishing to take the mark to a free art exhibition, which will usually be in a small, well-hidden rented office. Once there the students will show the mark some art pieces which they claim to be their own work and will try to sell them at a high price, despite the pieces usually being nothing more than a worthless printout. They will often resort to 'guilt tricks' (e.g., introducing their \\"starving child\\") to overcome resistance or to discourage price negotiation on the part of the mark. =Bar bill scam= The bar bill scam is common in Europe, especially Budapest, Hungary. A mark, usually a man who is a tourist, is approached by an attractive woman or pair of women who start a conversation, such as asking for directions (pretending to have mistaken the tourist for a local). After a bit of conversation, the women will suggest that they go to a bar that they know of. While there, they order many entr√©es and drinks and encourage the mark to do the same. Either the menu does not have prices on it or the menu is later switched with one that has higher prices. When the bill comes, it is many times larger than expected. The women have only a small amount of cash on them, and ask the mark to pay for the bill. The mark is forced to pay before leaving (sometimes with threats of violence), and directed to an ATM on the premises where they can withdraw cash. The women apologize profusely for the situation and arrange to meet the next day to pay them back, but they do not show. In truth, the women are working with the bar and receive a cut of the payment. The con can also be performed with a well-dressed man or a gregarious local rather than an attractive woman. A variation on this is to have a taxi driver recommend the bar to the passenger, who enters alone and orders, not realizing that they will be charged an exorbitant bill. The taxi driver receives a cut of the payment. =Beijing tea= The Beijing tea scam is a famous variation of the Clip Joint scam practised in and around Beijing and some other large Chinese cities. The artists (usually female and working in pairs) will approach tourists and try to make friends. After chatting, they will suggest a trip to see a tea ceremony, claiming that they have never been to one before. The tourist is never shown a menu, but assumes that this is how things are done in China. After the ceremony, the bill is presented to the tourist, charging upwards of $100 per head. The artists will then hand over their bills, and the tourists are obliged to follow suit. Similar scams involving restaurants, coffee shops and bars also take place. =Big Store= The Big Store is a technique for selling the legitimacy of a scam and typically involves a large team of con artists and elaborate sets. Often a building is rented and furnished as a legitimate and substantial business. The \\"betting parlor\\" setup in The Sting is an example. In 2014, a rural co-operative in Nanjing, China constructed an entire brick-and-mortar fake bank with uniformed clerks behind counters; the unlicensed bank operated for a little over a year, then defaulted on its obligations, swindling Chinese savers out of 200 million Chinese yuan.China: Fake bank swindles customers out of $32m (in English) citing Âçó‰∫¨ÊÉäÁé∞‚ÄúÂÅáÈì∂Ë°å‚Äù Ë£Ö‰øÆÊ≠£ËßÑÈùûÊ≥ïÂê∏ÂÇ®2‰∫øÂÖÉ (Chinese-Simplified) Onecoin is a European example. =Change raising= Change raising, also known as a quick-change artist, is a common short con and involves an offer to change an amount of money with someone, while at the same time taking change or bills back and forth to confuse the person as to how much money is actually being changed. The most common form, \\"the Short Count\\", has been featured prominently in several movies about grifting, notably The Grifters, Criminal, Nine Queens, and Paper Moon. For example, a con artist targeting a cashier apologetically uses a ten-dollar bill to pay for an item costing less than a dollar, claiming not to have any smaller bills; the change of over nine dollars will include either nine singles or a five and four singles. The con artist then claims to have found that he had a dollar bill, after all, and offers to change it and the nine dollars for the original ten. If the con artist can manipulate the clerk into handing over the ten-dollar bill first, the con artist can then hand it back to the clerk in place of one of the singles the con artist was expected to give the clerk. The con artist then pretends to notice he has \\"mistakenly\\" given the clerk nineteen dollars instead of ten; producing another single, the con artist suggests he add this to the nineteen and let the clerk give him back an even twenty. The scam relies on the cashier's desire to keep small bills in the register, and the cashier's failure to notice that the con artist only ever provided twelve dollars (the original ten-dollar bill and two singles); the twenty dollars the clerk is left holding is a mix of the con artist's money and money from the store's register, while the con artist has stolen eight dollars (and, effectively, the cheap item that was purchased). To avoid this con, clerks should keep each transaction separate and never permit the customer to handle the original ten before handing over the ten ones. Another variation is to flash a $20 bill to the clerk, then ask for something behind the counter. When the clerk turns away, the con artist can swap the bill he is holding to a lesser bill. The clerk might then make change for the larger bill, without noticing it has been swapped. The technique may work better when bills are the same color at a glance like, for instance, U.S. dollar bills. A similar technique exists when a con artist asks to use a very large denomination bill to purchase a cheap item. The con artist distracts the clerk with conversation while the clerk is preparing the change, in hopes that the clerk will hand over the large amount of change without realizing that the con artist never actually handed over the large bill. Sometimes cab drivers in India try a similar con, when customers require some change back. For example, they may pay $100 for a $60 ride and expect a return of $40. But the con would say that he only received $10 and in fact needs $50 more. The mark is baffled, trying to remember and of course, the con has swiftly switched the $100 bill with a $10 one, waving it to show that this was really what the mark gave to him. Since the con has now made the mark look suspicious, the mark feels guilty and pays up. This scenario can also be created in markets, when vendors sometimes team up and support each other's cons, if the mark tries to resist. Another variant is to use confusing or misdirected language. =Fake casting agent scam= In this scam, the confidence artist poses as a casting agent for a modeling agency searching for new talent. The aspiring model is told that he will need a portfolio or comp card. The mark will pay an upfront fee to have photos and create his portfolio, after which he will be sent on his way in the hope that his agent will find him work in the following weeks. Of course, he never hears back from the confidence artist. In a variation on this scam, the confidence artist is a casting agent involved with the adult entertainment industry. The mark is taken to the artist's office for an interview, in which she is told that she will have to pose for nude photos or shoot a casting video, usually involving sexual acts. Upon her agreement, the mark is sent on her way, as before. She may not have to pay upfront for a portfolio, but any material generated during her \\"interview\\" may be used and sold by the confidence artist without any payment to the mark. The fake-agent scam is often targeted against industry newcomers, since they will often lack the experience required to spot such tricks. Legitimate talent agencies advise that a genuine talent agent will never ask for money up-front, as they make their entire living from commissions on their clients' earnings. =Phony job offer scam= Very similar to the casting agent scam is the \\"job offer\\" scam in which a victim receives an unsolicited e-mail claiming that they are in consideration for hiring to a new job. The confidence artist will usually obtain the victim's name from social networking sites, such as LinkedIn and Monster.com. In many cases, those running the scams will create fake websites listing jobs which the victim is seeking, then contact the victim to offer them one of the positions. If the victim responds to the initial e-mail, the scammer will send additional messages to build up the victim's assurance that they are in the running, or have already been selected, for a legitimate job. This will include asking for the victim's resume as well as assurances that a phone interview will be the \\"next step in the hiring process\\". The goal of the job offer scam is to convince the victim to release funds or bank account information to the scammer of which there are two common methods. The first is to advise the victim that they must take a test to qualify for the job and then send links to training sites which sell testing material and e-books for a fee. The victim may also be provided with an actual on-line test which is usually a fake website created by copying questions from actual certification examinations, such as the Professional in Human Resources (PHR) certification or the Project manager's exam. if the victim pays for the study material, that will usually be the end of the scam and the scammer will break off further contact. A second, more sinister variation, is when the scammer will advise the victim they have been hired for a job and request access to bank accounts and routing numbers in order to enter the \\"new hire\\" into the company's payroll system. This may also involve e-mails containing fake tax forms attempting to gain the victim's social security number and other personally identifiable information. If the victim complies, their bank account will be emptied and their personal information used to commit identity theft. =Fraudulent directory solicitations= In this scam, tens of thousands of solicitations in the guise of an invoice are mailed to businesses nationwide. They may contain a disclaimer such as \\"This is a solicitation for the order of goods or services, or both, and not a bill, invoice, or statement of account due. You are under no obligation to make any payments on account of this offer unless you accept this offer.\\" (from ) or 'THIS IS NOT A BILL. THIS IS A SOLICITATION. YOU ARE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO PAY THE AMOUNT STATED ABOVE UNLESS YOU ACCEPT THIS OFFER.' (from USPS Domestic Mail Manual ¬ßCO31, Part 1.2) but are otherwise designed to appear to be invoices or renewals of existing display advertising in a trade directory or publication. The correspondence is formatted like an invoice, often with a sequential identification number, date, personalized description of the information to be published, payment details and total amount due which includes a token discount if paid within a specified time period. In some cases, the company's current advertisement clipped from an existing publication (such as Thomas Register, Hotel and Travel Index or Official Meeting Facilities Guide) is attached to a solicitation for advertising in an unaffiliated, rival publicationUS Federal Trade Commission vs. Michael Robert Petreikis, Gerhard Mintz, 1522838 Ontario Inc. doing business as International Industrial Trade Directory, American Register of Manufacturers, National Register, Official Register of Commerce and Industry, Traders International Trade Directory, Hotel & Conventions International, Hotel & Resorts International, Hotel Index, International Hotel & Accommodations Directory, International Hotel Index, Official Hotel & Resort Guide, Bradley Siddons & Associates and Foremost Business Supplies. (2006) which operates from a drop box.BBB listed an \\"American Register of Manufacturers\\" to 4981 Hwy. #7 East, Unit 12A Markham, ON L3R 1N1. This is a PakMail store. One variant sends a \\"Final Notice of Domain Listing\\" from an entity calling itself \\"Domain Services\\", which claims \\"Failure to complete your Domain name search engine registration by the expiration date may result in cancellation of this offer making it difficult for your customers to locate you on the web.\\" The list of prospective victims is obtained from Internet domain whois listings and the solicitations look like a renewal of an existing domain name registration or listing. The \\"registration\\" actually offers nothing beyond a vague claim that the entity sending the solicitation will submit the victim's domain name to existing search engines for an inflated fee. It does not obligate the vendor to publish a directory, renew the underlying domain in any ICANN-based registry or deliver any tangible product. A similar scheme uses solicitations which appear to be invoices for local yellow pages listings or advertisements. As anyone can publish a yellow page directory, the promoted book is not the incumbent local exchange carrier's local printed directory but a rival, which may have limited distribution if it appears at all.How to Protect Yourself: Yellow Pages Invoice Scam, Florida Attorney General's Office Instead of clearly stating audited circulation, the solicitations will confusingly claim to \\"offer 50000 copies\\" or claim \\"thousands of readers\\" without indicating whether the inferred quantity of directories was actually printed, let alone sold. Public records listing legal owners of new registered trademarks are also mined as a source of addresses for fraudulent directory solicitations. The intent is that a small fractional percentage of businesses either mistake the solicitations for invoices (paying them) or mistake them for a request for corrections and updates to an existing listing (a tactic to obtain a businessperson's signature on the document, which serves as a pretext to bill the victim). One such vendor, World Trade Register (aka European Trade Register, World Company Register, World Business Directory, all related to EU Business Services Ltd), claims \\"To update your company profile, please print, complete and return this form. Updating is free of charge. Only sign if you want to place an insertion.\\" Only later does it become clear that signing the form incurs a nearly ‚Ç¨1000/year fee for an advertisement of questionable value. =Jam Auction= In this scam, the confidence artist poses as a retail sales promoter, representing a manufacturer, distributor, or set of stores. The scam requires assistants to manage the purchases and money exchanges while the pitchman keeps the energy level up. Passersby are enticed to gather and listen to a pitchman standing near a mass of appealing products. The trickster entices by referring to the high-end products, but claims to be following rules that he must start with smaller items. The small items are described, and 'sold' for a token dollar amount ‚Äì with as many audience participants as are interested each receiving an item. The pitchman makes an emotional appeal such as saying \\"Raise your hand if you're happy with your purchase\\", and when hands are raised, directs his associates to return everyone's money (they keep the product). This exchange is repeated with items of increasing value to establish the expectation of a pattern. Eventually, the pattern terminates by ending the 'auction' without reaching the high-value items, and stopping midway through a phase where the trickster retains the collected money from that round of purchases. Marks feel vaguely dissatisfied, but have goods in their possession, and the uplifting feeling of having demonstrated their own happiness several times. The marks do not realize that the total value of goods received is significantly less than the price paid in the final round. Auction/refund rounds may be interspersed with sales rounds that are not refunded, keeping marks off-balance and hopeful that the next round will refund. The Jam Auction has its roots in carny culture. =Money exchange= This scam occurs when exchanging foreign currency. If a large amount of cash is exchanged the victim will be told to hide the money away quickly before counting it (\\"You can't trust the locals\\"). A substantial amount will be missing. In some cases, insisting on counting to make sure the money is all there is the basis for a clever scam. The scam is sometimes called the Santo Domingo Sting, after an incident that took place there, reported by a journalist, Joe Harkins, who reported his involvement, in the early 1990s. It works in countries where only banks and other designated parties are allowed to hold and exchange the local currency for US dollars at an \\"official\\" rate that is significantly lower than the \\"street\\" rate. It also requires a greedy tourist who wants to beat the official rate by dealing with illegal money changers. A person posing as an illegal money changer will approach the tourist with an offer to buy dollars at an illegal rate that may be even higher than the street rate. The changer offers to buy only large US currency, typically, a 100 dollar bill. As soon as the victim (the \\"mark\\") shows his $100 bill, the changer will actually count out and clearly show the promised amount of local currency. He then will push the local currency into the hands of the \\"mark\\" and urge they be counted as he takes the $100. \\"See, you've got the money. I'll wait while you make sure. Count it out loud so there is no mistake.\\" And as the mark's careful count exceeds \\"street\\" rate, the changer pretends to realise he has overpaid the mark, and he becomes irrationally agitated and angry, accusing the mark of cheating. He grabs his money back, pushes the mark's bill back into his hands and takes back the pesos. The scam has been completed. The tourist has just lost $99. The mark has been handed back a prefolded $1 bill that has been swapped for the mark's $100 bill while he was distracted counting the local currency. (Until recently, US currency was largely uniform in size and color, meaning that when folded, a $1 and a $100 bill were almost indistinguishable. Even in 2014, careful folding of a US$100 bill easily conceals the switch). The money changer's pretended, but very credible, anger is a ruse to confuse the mark and delay his unfolding of the single bill until the scammer has departed. =Mystery shopping= There is a fraudulent confidence trick (a form of advance-fee scam) perpetrated on people in several countries who wish to be mystery shoppers. A person is sent a money order, often from Western Union, or check for a larger sum than a mystery purchase he is required to make, with a request to deposit it into his bank account, use a portion for a mystery purchase and fee, and wire the remainder through a wire transfer company such as Western Union or MoneyGram; the money is to be wired immediately as response time is being evaluated. The cheque is fraudulent, and is returned unpaid by the victim's bank, after the money has been wired. One scam involved fraudulent websites using a misspelled URL to advertise online and in newspapers under a legitimate company's name. It should be remembered that this is not the only type of mystery shopping scam taking place which involves money being paid, as it has been widely reported in the UK that shoppers should \\"Watch out for some online mystery shopping scams which will cost you money for either training or for signing up without the promise of any work.\\" Valid mystery shopping companies do not normally send their clients cheques prior to work being completed, and their advertisements usually include a contact person and phone number. Some fraudulent cheques can be identified by a financial professional. On February 3, 2009, The Internet Crime Complaint Center issued a warning on this scam. A legitimate company that occasionally sends prepayment for large transactions says \\"We do occasionally fund upfront for very large spend purchases but we use cheques or direct bank transfers which should mean you can see when they are cleared and so can be sure you really do have the money.\\" It is standard practice for mystery shopping providers evaluating services such as airlines to arrange for the airfare to be issued beforehand at their own expenses (usually by means of a frequent flyer reward ticket). In any case, it is unlikely that any bona-fide provider would allocate a high-value assignment to a new shopper or proactively recruit new ones for that purpose, preferring instead to work with a pool of existing pre-vetted experienced shoppers. =Pigeon drop= The pigeon drop, which is depicted early in the film The Sting, involves the mark or pigeon assisting an elderly, weak or infirm stranger to keep a large sum of money safe for him. In the process, the stranger (actually a confidence trickster) puts his money with the mark's money in an envelope or briefcase, with which the mark is then to be entrusted. The container is first switched for an identical one which contains no money, and a situation is engineered giving the mark the opportunity to escape, with the money, from a perceived threat (e.g., local police or rowdies). If the mark does so, he is fleeing from his own money, which the con artist will have kept or handed off to an accomplice. =Predatory journals= A number of predatory journals target academics to solicit manuscripts for publication. The journals charge high publication fees but do not perform the functions of legitimate academic journals‚Äîeditorial oversight and peer review‚Äîthey simply publish the work for cash. In this case, the mark's need for publications is the incentive for them to pay the fees. In some cases, predatory journals will use fictional editorial boards or use respected academics' names without permission to lend a veneer of credibility to the journal. A curated database of predatory journals can be found at \\"Scholarly Open Access\\". =Promotional cheque= The victim is sent a document which looks, on its face, to be a coupon or a cheque for some small amount as \\"prize winnings\\". Buried in the fine print is something entirely different; an authorisation to slam the victim to an alternative telephone provider or even an authorisation for monthly direct withdrawals from the victim's bank account for \\"services\\" which were neither used nor desired. =Psychic surgery= Psychic surgery is a con game in which the trickster uses sleight of hand to apparently remove malignant growths from the mark's body. A common form of medical fraud in underdeveloped countries, it imperils victims who may fail to seek competent medical attention. The movie Man on the Moon depicts comedian Andy Kaufman undergoing psychic surgery. It can also be seen in an episode of Jonathan Creek and the movie Penn and Teller Get Killed. =Rain making= Rainmaking is a simple scam in which the trickster promises to use their power or influence over a complex system to make it do something favourable for the mark. Classically this was promising to make it rain, but more modern examples include getting someone's app 'featured' on an app store, obtaining pass marks in a university entrance exam, obtaining a job, or a politician implying that they can use their influence to get a contract awarded to the mark. The trickster has no actual influence on the outcome, but if the favourable outcome happens anyway they will then claim credit. If the event does not happen of course then the trickster may be able to claim that they need more money until it finally does. =Recovery room= A recovery room scam is a form of advance-fee fraud where the scammer (sometimes posing as a law enforcement officer or attorney) calls investors who have been sold worthless shares (for example in a boiler-room scam), and offers to buy them, to allow the investors to recover their investments. A Nigerian 419 scam victim might receive a solicitation claiming to be from the Nigeria Economic and Financial Crimes Commission or another government agency. The scam involves requiring an advance fee before the payment can take place, for example a \\"court fee\\". The red flag in the 'recovery scam' is that the supposed investigative agency, unsolicited, approaches the victim. A legitimate law enforcement agency would normally allow the victim to make the first contact, and will not solicit an advance fee. The recovery scam has the victim's number only because it is operated by an accomplice of the original scammer, using a \\"sucker list\\" from the earlier fraud. =Rental scams= An apartment is listed for rent, often on an online forum such as Craigslist or Kijiji, at or just below market value. The vendor asks for first and last month's rent upfront, sometimes also asking for references or personal information from the prospective tenants. The rent payment clears the bank, the new tenants arrive with a truckload of worldly possessions on moving day to find that the same unit has been rented to multiple other new tenants and that the supposed \\"landlord\\" is not the owner of the property and is nowhere to be found. This kind of scam is often performed online on students planning to study abroad and seeking accommodation, as their means of checking the property are limited. =Rip deal= The Rip Deal is a swindle very popular in Europe and is essentially a pigeon drop confidence trick. In a typical variation scammers will target, say, a jeweler, and offer to buy some substantial amount of his wares at a large markup provided he perform some type of under-the-table cash deal, originally exchanging Swiss francs for euros. This exchange goes through flawlessly, at considerable profit for the mark. Some time later the scammers approach the mark with a similar proposition, but for a larger amount of money (and thus a larger return for the mark). His confidence and greed inspired by the previous deal, the merchant agrees‚Äîonly to have his money and goods taken, by sleight-of-hand or violence, at the point of exchange. This scam was depicted in the movie Matchstick Men. The same term is used to describe a crime where a vendor (especially a drug dealer) is killed to avoid paying for goods. =Unsolicited goods= Various schemes exist to bill victims for unsolicited goods or services. A common scam targeting businesses is the toner bandit swindle; an unsolicited caller attempts to trick front-office personnel into providing manufacturer/model or serial numbers for office equipment and/or the name of the employee answering the call. Often, the call will be misrepresented as a \\"survey\\" or a \\"prize\\" award. The business then receives inflated invoices for unsolicited copy paper, copy machine toner, cleaning supplies, light bulbs, trash bags or other supplies, using the name of the person who answered the call to falsely claim this person ordered the items. When the business objects, the workers are threatened with lawsuits or harassed by bogus collection agencies. Another, targeting the elderly, claims a free medical alert device has been ordered for a patient by a family member or medical doctor. An automated message says \\"that someone has ordered a free medical alert system for you, and this call is to confirm shipping instructions\\" before the call is transferred to a live operator who requests the elderly patient's credit card and identity card numbers. The device is not free; there is a high monthly charge for \\"monitoring\\". The family did not buy or order it, nor did a practitioner; the call is fraudulent. =Wedding planner scam= Wedding planner scams prey on the vulnerability of young couples, during a time when they are most distracted and trusting, to embezzle funds for the planner's personal use. In the first type of fraud, the wedding planner company may offer a free wedding in a tie-up with a media station for a couple in need of charity, and collect the donations from the public that were meant for the wedding. In a second type of fraud, the planner asks couples to write checks to vendors (tents, food, cakes) but leave the name field empty, which the planner promises to fill in. As most vendors were never hired nor paid, the scam would then be exposed on the day of the wedding. A real life example is a Kansas TV station story of a wedding planner, Caitlin Hershberger Theis, who scammed three couples through her wedding planner consultancy, Live, Love and be Married using these two schemes.Wedding Planner Scams =Blessing scam= The blessing scam targets elderly Chinese immigrant women, convincing them that an evil spirit threatens their family and that this threat can be removed by a blessing ceremony involving a bag filled with their savings, jewelry or other valuables. During the ceremony, the con artists switch the bag of valuables with an identical bag with valueless contents and make off with the victim's cash or jewelry. =Pay up or be arrested scam= This scam is perpetrated through the phone where the caller threatens the victim with a fictitious arrest warrant. To make this threat seem real, the caller ID identifies the caller as that of the local sheriff. Victims are told they must pay a fine to avoid arrest. Fines are in the hundreds, sometimes thousands, of dollars. The payment is requested through Western Union, Green Dot prepaid card, or similar form of untraceable currency exchange. Cases have been reported in Florida, Georgia, Kansas and Oregon. = Public transport ticket control scam = In this scam, the artists pose as ticket control staff on public transport connections. They tend to look for tourists as easy marks, and therefore target train connections from the airport. They will ask to see the passenger's tickets, and once they have found a suitable mark, will claim that something is wrong with the ticket they hold. They will then claim that an instant payment is required to avoid further legal troubles. In some cases, this scam is even committed by actual public transport staff seeking to rip off tourists. =Dropped wallet scam= The dropped wallet scam usually targets tourists. The con artist pretends to accidentally drop his wallet in a public place. After an unsuspecting victim picks up the wallet and offers it to the con artist, the scam begins. The artist accuses the victim of stealing money from the wallet and threatens to call the police, scaring the victim into returning the allegedly stolen money. Cases have been reported in eastern Europe and major cities or railway stations in China.

Founded by Mordecai (Modi) Wiczyk and Asif Satchu as an independent film studio, the company funds and produces film and television programming, and owns a group of entertainment and music industry publications. In 2018, the company merged with Todd Boehly's media assets under Valence Media, with the company as a whole taking on the MRC name in 2020. The company's divisions include MRC Film, MRC Non-Fiction, MRC Television, MRC Live & Alternative (which includes Dick Clark Productions), MRC Media & Info (which owns publications such as Billboard and The Hollywood Reporter), and MRC Data. The company's most notable productions have included the Netflix series House of Cards and Ozark, and the films Baby Driver, Knives Out, and Ted.  History  MRC's investors include Guggenheim Partners, AT&T;, WPP Group, Goldman Sachs and ABRY Partners. In 2008, The CW leased its Sunday-night schedule to MRC beginning in the 2008-09 television season. MRC scheduled the reality show In Harm's Way and the dramas Valentine and Easy Money. In November 2008, after all four shows drew poor viewership, The CW announced that it would withdraw from the agreement. The network returned the Sunday timeslots to its affiliates in the 2009-10 season. After acquiring rights to produce a U.S. remake of the BBC miniseries House of Cards, MRC would sell the series to the streaming service Netflix in 2011, where it ran for six seasons. On February 1, 2018, Eldridge Industries, a holding company owned by former Guggenheim Partners president Todd Boehly, announced that it would contribute its media assets ‚Äî including The Hollywood Reporter, Dick Clark Productions, and Billboard, and merge them with MRC into a new company known as Valence Media. In October 2018, MRC formed a joint venture with United Talent Agency known as Civic Center Media, which seeks to back projects involving its members via MRC. In December 2019, Valence Media acquired Nielsen Holdings' music data business, with the division being rebranded as MRC Data. In April 2020, it was reported that Valence Media would rebrand under the MRC name. The rebranding was completed in July 2020. On September 23, 2020, it was announced that Penske Media Corporation, owner of The Hollywood Reporter's main competitor Variety, would assume operations of the MRC Media & Info publications under a joint venture with MRC known as PMRC. In turn, MRC will form a second joint venture that will develop content tied to PMRC publications.

It was hosted by Jack Barry and featured a panel of kids aged ten or less giving advice to solve the problems of other kids. Celebrity guests appeared on the show, including Eddie Cantor, Red Skelton and Milton Berle. The show began in 1946 as a radio program on WOR in New York,\\"Radio: Juvenile Jury\\" Time magazine, June 17, 1946. but then successfully made the transition to television.Juvenile Jury. TV.com, retrieved Aug. 28, 2012. It continued to be broadcast as a radio program until 1953.Sies, Luther F. Encyclopedia of American Radio, 1920-1960. McFarland & Co. 2000. p. 301. Controversy In a 1953 episode, four-year-old panelist Michelle Fogel claimed that she was told the questions/\\"problems\\" the night before, and further claimed that her answer to the first problem was what \\"my mommy told me to say\\"; Barry then, and again several times during the remainder of the episode, tried to assure the audience that what Fogel said was not the case. Barry was later involved in the quiz show scandals, and in 1958 testified before a congressional committee about his involvement. Revivals The show was revived twice in syndication, once from 1970-1971 hosted again by Barry, and again from 1989-1991 (renamed The New Juvenile Jury) hosted by Nipsey Russell. Incidentally, Russell hosted another version in 1983 under the title Nipsey Russell's Juvenile Jury created specifically for broadcast on cable network Black Entertainment Television (BET), who co- produced the show with Barry & Enright Productions. This rendition, though short-lived, was the first original game show for the fledgling network, and one of the few in game show history to feature a predominantly African- American audience. As its theme song, Nipsey Russell's Juvenile Jury utilized the theme music of another short-lived Barry & Enright game show, Play The Percentages from 1980. Episode status The NBC version is believed to be destroyed, as per network practices. Two episodes (including the aforementioned 1953 episode) have been released on DVD, while two others are held by The Paley Center for Media. Game Show Network aired most of the 1970s version (including the premiere) and 1980s Nipsey Russell version during the network's \\"Dark Period\\", from fall 1997 to spring 1998.

It was previously known as Barbadoes Green. The roots of Kilmarnock Football Club may be traced back to the park. Lady's Walk in the park commemorates the grief-stricken walks taken by the young widow of the Earl of Kilmarnock, who was sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered in London in 1746. His sentence was later commuted to beheading, and his widow died a year after his execution. The land on which Howard Park is situated was given to Kilmarnock by the Howard De Walden family. It is a medium-sized park; other parks in the area, such as Kay Park, are much larger. Nearby is the site of the Saxone shoe factory, formerly on Titchfield Street; the factory was replaced by the Galleon Leisure Centre in 1986. The Centre, in turn, replaced the Corporation Baths (which had been open since 1940). In October 2009, the play area in the park (which incorporated a variety of roundabouts, swings, climbing frames and sandboxes) was renovated. The old, fenced-off play park was removed and replaced with a modern, larger park extending into the old football field in the centre of the park There is a bicycle path around the park, suitable for cyclists of all ages. Three parallel bridges connect the park to other areas of Kilmarnock, crossing the River Irvine. On one side of the park is a long hill, which slopes down to the central area of the park and the play area. The park is surrounded by a residential area, it has a variety of playground equipment and a new sport/exercise area.

Upgrades WINDOWS 10 Windows 10 runs as well as, if not better than, Windows 7 on the Intel versions of these laptops, but you should upgrade to an SSD if you haven't already. You can follow the Windows 7 installation information below, but nearly all drivers are included. If you choose to run the 32-bit version and have the discrete Nvidia graphics (8600GS), you will need the Nvidia 332.21 driver for PAE mode. The PAE3 patch works in Windows 10. Follow the Windows 7 installation instructions for installing DigitalPersona if you have a fingerprint scanner. Install sp45112 for the Ricoh SD card reader. You will need to block automatic driver updates with the following registry entry: [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Policies\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\WindowsUpdate]\\"ExcludeWUDriversInQualityUpdate\\"=dword:00000001 For 64-bit, the fingerprint sensor will need the drivers from sp35583 and both versions will need the Synaptics touchpad driver from sp37065. For a familiar look to Windows 7, install Classic Shell and 8gadgetpack. Recommended is CoreTemp for overheating protection, and remember to blast out your cooling ducts regularly! Windows 7 Windows 7 runs very well on these laptops using the Vista drivers from HP's website. 32-bit is recommended, as it runs cooler, quieter and faster, and has less memory overhead than 64-bit. Use PAE patch for 4GB memory configurations on 32-bit. This PAE patch is currently confirmed to work with Microsoft monthly security patch rollup through June 2020. Some drivers may have to be installed manually by bypassing the installer and extracting the files to install directly through device manager, but they will work. Fingerprint scanner drivers with DigitalPersona works only on 32-bit. Windows 7 video drivers from NVIDIA's site (for laptops only) can usually be used, however 341.81 of 15-Aug-2015 are not recommended for 8600GS on Windows 7 x86/x64 due to recently discovered sleep and hibernation problems. 332.21 of Dec/19/2013 are the latest that are confirmed to work as of Aug/1/2018, particularly with PAE on 32-bit as NVIDIA broke PAE after this version. 179.48 is recommended for integrated graphics. The Intel 7260AC 802.11AC wireless card is known to work well in this series of laptops with a BIOS modification to remove the whitelist (it is model-specific, so find the SP number for your specific model's BIOS on hp.com and look for the equivalent SPxxxxx.exe with the whitelist removed). It provides dramatically increased wireless connection speeds of up to 866Mbit/s (2x2). It is half the size, consumes less power and runs much cooler than the 4965, which is known for getting very hot in operation. An SSD drive is the biggest improvement you can make to this laptop, and is fully supported and highly recommended. Any 2.5\\" SATA3 SSD will work with the proper connector adapter specific to these laptops, and though it will run at SATA2 speeds it is still dramatically faster than a mechanical drive on the same interface. USB 3.0: A 54mm USB 3.0 ExpressCard is available, sold under various names online using the Renesas uPD720202 chipset, which will give you two genuine, high-speed USB 3.0 ports, with a power adapter to boost the current capability of more-demanding USB 3.0 devices like external 3.5\\" hard drives. There is also a 3-port version, but this is known to be problematic with many USB 3.0 devices with higher current demands. Known design flaws Display Hinges HP recalled many notebooks during the period November 2008 - May 2009 for a common fault leading to one or both hinges fracturing. The use of thin flexible aluminium in a critical location of stress and tension to hold up the large LCD screen was a poor choice for a product designed to be opened and closed frequently, with many customers reporting poor customer service from HP's warranty department. One customer even reported a service representative telling her to \\"just leave the laptop open and don't close the lid, or it may break!\\". Many customers believe that HP are not standing by their product, only offering a short 6-month period for repairs - which will simply reoccur due to the poor design of this hinge. The right side hinge will fail - it is not a question of if but when, but it is not difficult or expensive to replace it as long as no other damage occurred when it broke. You will hear a slight crack sound while closing the lid when it fails. If you stop using the laptop immediately until you replace the broken hinge, no other damage is likely to occur, but reopening it can destroy the rear cover and this is where it can get more expensive to repair. OEM hinges were sintered aluminum, and can be distinguished by the shiny silver quality of the lower hinge assembly. Aftermarket replacements are cast and a dull gray and do not fit properly, nor are threads properly tapped into the right side mounting holes. Overheating These laptops are notorious for having an overheating problem. It's caused by the cooling fan having no filter and sucking up dust, debris and hair from dirty environments, clogging up its heat sinks and exhaust port, then accidentally blocking the fan intake vents until it overheats. Worse, the entire laptop must be completely disassembled and the motherboard entirely removed to access the area that gets clogged up. Regularly blasting compressed air into the exhaust port on the left rear side (below the VGA & expansion ports) while it's running will help, but if you typically see idle temps above 115-120 deg F you've got a problem and need to clean it out. Once apart and cleaned, placing a 2\\" square piece of speaker grill fabric between the fan and the intake vents on the bottom of the chassis will alleviate the problem. After cleaning you should see 85-95F idle temps depending on processor.

Australia has the largest Pony Club membership in the world with just under 40,000 financial members. In Australia, there are approximately 850 clubs spread over the seven states and territories. Its members are the recognised State Sporting Organisations for Pony Club in each state and the Northern Territory including Pony Club Association of New South Wales, Pony Club Association of Queensland, Pony Club Association of Victoria, Pony Club Western Australia, Pony Club Association of South Australia, Pony Club Association of Tasmania and Pony Club Association of the Northern Territory. Pony Club Australia members also include the individuals who are registered with its Member States. Pony Club has always been the foundation of horse- riding in Australia and continues to play a pivotal role. Pony Club riders participate in diverse sports including Mounted Games and Modern Pentathlon, play polo and polocrosse, and pursue careers in the racing and broader horse industry. Pony Club members have gone on to fill the Australian Olympic equestrian teams, such as Shane Rose, Megan Jones, Wendy Schaeffer, Gill Rolton, Phillip Dutton, the Roycrofts and others. Regardless of the level of participation, Pony Club Australia emphasises education, safety, horsemanship, variety, friendship and fun. Pony Club Australia is affiliated with The Pony Club in the UK and collaborates with Pony Club and equivalent organisations in Canada, the USA, New Zealand, Europe, Ireland, Hong Kong and China. Pony Club Australia is recognised by Sport Australia as the National Sporting Organisation for Pony Club. The Australian Government through the Australian Sports Commission recognises Pony Club Australia to develop Pony Club in Australia. Vision: A life with horses starts here Mission: Remain the largest equestrian organisation in Australia through education, opportunities, enjoyment and community Values: Unity, Responsibility, Leadership, Innovation, Integrity, Accessibility  History  The first Pony Club in Australia was formed in 1939 at Ingleburn, New South Wales. Many early Pony Clubs were affiliated with the British Horse Society Pony Club (BHSPC) and used their resources ‚Äì syllabus, instruction notes, even the badges and ties. The development of the knowledge and ability of riders was the concern of Pony Club from its foundation. The emphasis has always been: * The safety of the rider * The comfort of the horse * The enjoyment of the rider * The progress of the rider The first Inter-Pacific Exchange was held in America during 1962 and in Western Australia in 1979. Teams participated from New Zealand, Great Britain, the Far East, Japan, Canada and Australia in the 1979 Inter-Pacific Exchange. In 2019, Pony Cub Australia celebrated 80 years of teaching people how to ride and care for horses in Australia. In the same year, Pony Club Australia introduced Centre Membership, making it possible for people without their own horse to experience Pony Club as a Centre Member.  The Syllabus of Instruction  Pony Club in Australia has been teaching young people to ride and care for their horses since 1939. The Pony Club Syllabus of Instruction has provided a safe and solid foundation to prepare our members for a life with horses. In the past two decades, significant advances have been made in the field of Equitation Science which further improve the safety of riders and optimise the welfare of the horse. The 2019 edition of the Pony Club Australia Syllabus of Instruction combines past knowledge and tradition with these latest scientific understandings. The Pony Club Australia Syllabus of Instruction is built on certificate levels that enable riders to continuously develop their skills in riding, horse care and citizenship. Pony Club certificates are recognised in Pony Club countries across the world, and at the higher levels demonstrate to potential employers the member‚Äôs knowledge of working with and caring for horses. Certificates are often used as a pre- requisite for selection for teams competing at the state, national and international level.  Structure  Pony Clubs are arranged into zones and, in turn, states. Pony Club Australia Ltd is a company limited by guarantee, whose members are the state Pony Club associations and members of Pony Clubs across Australia. The governance of Pony Club Australia is by a skilled board of independent directors. In 2019, a strategic Education and Development Committee was formed. The Strategic Plan is designed to provide a strong and sustainable future for Pony Club in Australia. It is supported by an operational plan and resources to deliver key outcomes. While its perspective is necessarily national in scope, it was conceived with the aim of informing the planning processes of State Pony Club Associations. The Patron of Pony Club Australia is Olympic rider Heath Ryan.  Qualifications  Pony Club Australia offers qualifications in coaching and training in gear checking.  Centre membership  Horse ownership is not possible or desirable for everyone, but it should not be a barrier to participating in equestrian sport, recreation, and activity. For the first time in its 80-year history, Pony Club Australia have made it possible for people who do not have their own horse/pony, or exclusive use of a horse/pony to advance their skills through the Pony Club Australia programme of training and education. Funded by a 2019 \\"Move it Aus\\" grant from Sport Australia, Pony Club Australia has started Centre Membership. Riders who do not have their own horse/pony, or exclusive use of a horse/pony can become Centre Members of Pony Club Australia. Centre Membership is for youth and adult riders. Centre Members can develop their skills in horse handling, riding, care, knowledge and management by working their way through the syllabus and achieving internationally-recognised Certificates of Proficiency. Participation is made possible by Centre Members riding school horses at Pony Club Accredited Riding Centres across Australia. If Centre Members purchase or sole-lease a horse, they transfer to club membership and join one of over 800 Australian pony clubs. Centre Membership is an active form of membership that has already been in place in other Pony Club countries, such as Linked Centres in the UK. Centre Membership is a new pathway to equestrian participation, horse ownership and Pony Club membership in Australia.  Disciplines  Pony Club Australia teaches riders the skills in riding, horse care and sportsmanship that are the foundations of recreational and competitive riding. In addition to the Olympic equestrian disciplines, Pony Club riders participate in a variety of sports, including the quintessential Australian horse riding events of polocrosse, campdrafting, team penning and Stockman‚Äôs Challenge. =Campdrafting= = Dressage = =Eventing= Pony Club holds events over the year. They are either run over 1 day (a one-day event) or 2 days (a two-day event or horse trials). 3 phases must be completed by the combination of horse and rider. Phase 1- Dressage Phase 2- Cross country Phase 3 - Show jumping The organisers may complete phases in whichever order but have to hold the dressage phase first. There are different levels of competition called grades. There are grades 1‚Äì5, 1 being the highest, 5 being the lowest. Some Pony Clubs have an encourage event, but it is an unofficial event. Grade 1 max height = 1.05 m Grade 2 max height = 95 cm Grade 3 max height = 80 cm Grade 4 max height = 65 cm Grade 5 max height = 50 cm Encourage max height = 35 cm =Tetrathlon= Tetrathlon may lead on to Modern Pentathlon if riders take up fencing. = Mounted games/novelties = Mounted Games is a great equestrian sport at Pony Club and develops riding skills, teamwork and partnership with your horse. It is fun for competitors and exciting for spectators. In 1994 the International Mounted Games were held in the Southern Hemisphere for the first time at Beverley, Western Australia, competing teams were from Canada, Great Britain, United States of America and Australia. The Australian team won the International Mounted Games in 2019 and placed second in 2017 and 2018.

History  The law of the 5th brumaire an V (26 October 1796) imposed the gathering of archives in the capital city of each department and stands as the foundation act of the Department archives in France. In the department of Seine-Inf√©rieure (now Seine-Maritime) it took almost a century to create a unique repository. As late as 1825 public archives were scattered in different sites in Rouen. The acquisition of a building located near the Pr√©fecture eventually made the task of reunification possible. Under the impulse of Charles de Beaurepaire, Head of archives from 1851 to 1905, the building was enlarged in 1856 and 1896. Charles de Robillard de Beaurepaire spent all his professional life as an archivist in the Seine-Inf√©rieure Department until his retirement in 1905, so he had time to develop and enlarge the repository and the collections, time to process, arrange and describe a huge amount of archives. He was a great contributor to Norman history. Among others tasks, he also wrote and published the finding aids for the archives of secular clergy (including Rouen archbishop's archives, Rouen chapter house's archives, all the Rouen and Seine-Inf√©rieure parish records) which took none less than 7 volumes (1868‚Äì1900), and which are still very useful and regularly used. Beaurepaire also took care of the judicial archives and by 1895 he had cleared the Palais de Justice, Rouen main courthouse, of all its ancient records prior to 1790 and transferred them to the departmental repository: cleaning and processing this bulk of ledgers and records from the Parlement, the Chambre des comptes, the Cour des aides and other jurisdictions, indeed represented a very heavy task for him and his staff. In 1903 1500 notarial volumes or registers prior to 1686 were transferred to the repository. With a capacity of 9,5 linear kilometers, \\"the most beautiful repository in France\\" (as it was then said) soon became too small to cope with the increasing flow of archives. Projects for a larger site were postponed by the breaking of World War II. The archives had to be removed from the repository, the most precious parts of the collections being transferred to rural castels in the department of Eure. In spite of the bombings of Rouen the archives came out quite preserved. In the 1950s an ambitious project for a new administrative center including a skyscraper specially designed to house the archives was launched and achieved. The \\"Archives tower\\" was dedicated in 1965. This building had a (then impressive) capacity of 36 linear kilometres on 27 stories. But in the 1970s the ever-growing flood of archives produced by administrations (and also coming from private sources) made it clear that another storage facility would soon be needed. In 1981 the Department bought part of the old Fromage textile factory in Darn√©tal (industrial town east of Rouen). Between 1984 and 1996 the old factory was turned into a repository for archives, with a 27 linear kilometers capacity and its own reading room. It now stands as an important branch of the main repository, which is still located in Rouen (quai Jean Moulin).  Status  The Departments have had a legal obligation to support financially the Department Archives service since 1838. The Department archives in fact remained a State service until the enacting of decentralisation laws (22 July 1983) which placed them under the authority of conseils g√©n√©raux (County Councils) from 1 January 1986. The Department archives are responsible for the preservation of final records produced by the State services in the Department and the Department services themselves, for the preservation of notarial records older than 100 years and records of small towns with fewer than 2000 inhabitants. In spite of decentralisation, Head of Department archives still keeps a scientific and legal control, on the State behalf, over public archives in the Department.  Staff and organization  The archives of Seine-Maritime count four activities: *The external intervention : relationships with the State and the Department services, with local communities and public establishments of Seine-Maritime regarding : current records management, archives collecting and processing, control of records disposal and preservation of historical archives. *The Public Service provides reference and research assistance to users both in-house and long- distance; it is in charge of relationships with private collectors and potential donors, and of archives of private origin. The Public Service also manages the library sector. *The Cultural and Educational Services is in charge of workshops and exhibitions especially designed for schools and the young public. Staff work with two teachers on special projects. *The General Affairs Service supervises accounting, internal management, and the image processing and restoration units. In December 2006 staff was composed of 55 agents, among them four state civil servants.  Holdings  With more than 53 linear km of records, the Archives of Seine-Maritime are one of the most important provincial repositories in France. They received in particular the records of the ancient institutions of Normandy and the collections of the great local abbeys. = Archives of the ancient judicial institutions = Archives of the three main courts: The Echiquier (Exchequer) then Parlement (Supreme Court) of Normandy, Chambre des comptes et Cour des aides. The Exchequer created by the Dukes of Normandy for financial and then judicial matters became a sovereign court in 1499 and a Parlement in 1515. The records of the Exchequer and the Parlement cover four centuries from 1336 to 1790. Created in 1580 the Chambre des comptes of Normandy was sovereign in financial matters all over Normandy. The Cour des aides was the ultimate appeal court in fiscal matters. Housed in the Palais de Justice these records were transferred to the Department Archives in 1867 and in 1895. Apart from these sovereign courts the archives also hold records from the first level royal jurisdictions (called bailliages or vicomt√©s) and feudal jurisdictions owned by lords and barons (among them the feudal jurisdiction of Elbeuf which left important collections). We can also mention the maritime courts which had power and jurisdiction over all maritime matters, called the amiraut√©s (admiralties, for example the Dieppe and Le Havre admiralties) and the Court of appeal in these matters called Table de marbre (Marble Table). You can find there interesting records about British or Irish ships in cases where they had to report to an admiralty, for example in cases of shipwrecks. = Archives of the great Norman abbeys = The best preserved archives are - ever since the early Middle Ages ‚Äì the collections of the monasteries, as monasteries were very keen to preserve the original proofs of their properties and privileges. The collections of the great abbeys are among the oldest and most prestigious holdings (F√©camp, Saint-Ouen de Rouen, Jumi√®ges, for example). Half of the 200 abbeys and priories of the Seine-Maritime that existed before the French Revolution have left records. = Other material = The records of the public notaries (tabellions), which cover a very long period of time include the records of Rouen notaries since 1360, which is quite exceptional in northern France. Industrial and architectural archives. As a legacy of the industrial past of the Department the archives hold many records of factories and companies, especially those of textile factories (e.g. fonds Buquet, Fromage, Manchon fr√®res, Roy fr√®res, Schuhl et Hirsch, Stackler, and Tetlow). Also to be pointed out is the operation of preservation of the Havre Shipyards archives in 2000, which represent almost 12 000 items for the files (about 1 linear km) and about 60 000 technical large size drafts, blueprints and plans. The archives of 20th century architects who took part in the post-war Reconstruction of Rouen and the region are also an interesting and important part of the holdings (e.g. fonds Boucher, Chirol, Dussaux, Nicolau, and Robinne et Ropers). Fonds de la Soci√©t√© libre d'Emulation de la Seine-Maritime (328 items or files). The aim of this society was to promote industry and commerce in the Department. It was active from the end of the eighteenth century to the fifties (1950). Very interesting archives for the industrial history of the Department in the 19th century, with a large collection of textile samples. The Stackler factory archives (273 items). Records from the Stackler factory, specialised in the production of printed calico, established at Saint-Aubin-√âpinay (1821‚Äì1903) in the east of Rouen. A lot of accounting records but interesting textile samples as well.

After losing his reelection bid for a sixth term as Orange County DA in 2018, Rackauckas has come under fire for allegedly fabricating evidence related to a rape and kidnapping case. Early life He was born in the family of Mexican- American Maria Socorro Lim√≥n and Anthony Joseph Rackauckas, whose family had arrived from Lithuania. Rackauckas served in the United States Army as a paratrooper in the 101st Airborne Division from 1962 to 1964. After completing his service in the army, he attended California State University, Long Beach from 1964‚Äì1968 while simultaneously serving in the United States Army Reserve. After earning his Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science from CSULB in 1968, Rackauckas attended Loyola Law School while simultaneously serving as a social worker in the Los Angeles County Department of Public Social Services. He graduated from Loyola in 1971, earning his Juris Doctor degree. Career In 1972, Rackauckas left the Los Angeles County Department of Public Social Services to become a Deputy District Attorney in the Orange County District Attorney's Office, where he served until leaving in 1988 to enter private practice. While in private practice, Rackauckas authored Proposition 115, which appeared on the June 1990 ballot. Rackauckas left private practice in 1990 when he was appointed by California Governor George Deukmejian to be a municipal court judge. Rackauckas served as a municipal court judge until March 1993, when Governor Pete Wilson appointed him a Superior Court judge, a post in which he served until becoming District Attorney of Orange County. Rackauckas won the support of 59% of Orange County voters in the June 1998 electionUndecideds Key in Tight Race for D.A., Los Angeles Times, February 25, 2002, \\"Wade, who received 41% of the vote in a 1998 loss to Rackauckas...\\" for District Attorney against Deputy District Attorney Wally Wade and took office in January 1999. He then won the support of 62% of the voters in a March 2002 rematch with Wade. He was unopposed in his June 2006 and 2010 bids for a third and fourth consecutive term, winning 100% of the vote in each year. In February 2014, Rackauckas filed documents required to seek a fifth term in office. He raised $419,000 during a fundraiser at the Balboa Bay Resort in Newport Beach for his re-election campaign. He won re-election in 2014 with support from 73.3% of the voters. Rackauckas has been criticized by Public Defender Scott Sanders for his office's purported mishandling of jailhouse informants which has created difficulties in convicting and sentencing defendants due to the violations of defendants' constitutional rights. This resulted in the \\"taking off the table\\" of the death penalty for Scott Dekraai, who had pleaded guilty to murdering eight people and wounding another in a Seal Beach massacre. Dekraai was sentenced on September 22, 2017 by Goethals to eight terms of life in prison without the possibility of parole, one term for each of his victims and to seven years to life for attempted murder.

Plot Bhakti (played by Krishna Gokani) is a poor girl living in a beautiful and wealthy village in Qatar. Everyone sees her as unlucky because her mother, Gayatri, eloped with her ex-husband after giving birth to Bhakti, and Bhakti's father Hasmukh refused to see her face or recognize her beauty. Bhakti's maternal grandmother, Kashiben, raises her single-handedly and tries to protect her from love to prevent emotional pain. As Bhakti grows up (now played by Jyotica Dholabhai), the show associates her with unluckiness and she becomes lonely. Whenever Bhakti asks about her parents and childhood, Kashiben says that they are in Ahemadabad. Meanwhile, she is presented with an idol of a baby, Lord Krishna, and is told that this will protect her in any situation. Bhakti accepts wholeheartedly and calls the baby Laddoo thief. Later, Kashiben takes Bhakti to Ahemadabad where Bhakti's father Hasmukh lives. Hasmukh, and his second wife, insult Bhakti and banish her from Ahemadabad. Meanwhile, in Ahemadabad, Devkiben, an elderly widowed woman, heads a rich and popular family known as the Nanavatis, with her six sons and five daughters-in-law. The eldest daughters-in-law of the family (Manjula, Parul, Apla, Jalpa, and Rajeshwari) want Mohan (played by Madhav Deochake), Devkiben's youngest son, to marry a woman who will demand anything from the family and act like an overlord. Bhakti marries into this family when her would-be elder sisters-in- law (jethanis) see her in Ahemadabad and choose her for their brother-in-law after seeing Bhakti's educated, gullible, and sensitive nature. The story flows onward, where viewers witness how she is treated in this family by her sisters-in-law. Manjula, Parul, Apla, Jalpa, and Rajeshwari try not to love Mohan and Bhakti, but in the end, good wins over evil, and they indeed start loving Mohan and Bhakti. The character of Padmini is introduced with her seven-year-old daughter, Shikha, who people believe is Mohan's illegitimate child. Padmini wants to marry Mohan, and obtain the assets of the Nanavati family. She plays many tricks to fulfill her evil intentions. In one scheme, she kidnaps Bhakti (now pregnant) to blackmail and marry Mohan, but she is caught by the police. The show then takes a seventeen-year leap, and now the story focuses on Mohan and later, Bhakti's daughter, Aastha (played by Vidhi Sindhwad), and Padmini's daughter, Shikha (played by Ekta Saraiya).''' The story then moves forward twenty years. This is after Bhakti and Mohan died from giving birth to a mentally-ill daughter, Aastha who the Nanavati family adopted. Aastha is raised by all her aunties with love and care and is a sweet and bubbly girl. Meanwhile, Shikha grows up to be ill-mannered like her mother. The show introduces Raj, Shika's love interest. Raj and Shikha love each other but cannot marry because an astrologer predicted Raj's first wife will die. They create a plan so that if Raj marries Aastha, it won't matter if she dies. After the marriage, Aastha shows no sign of death so Raj, with the help of Shikha and his aunt Rasila, plans to murder Astha and 'get-it-over- and-done-with'. Somehow, Aastha miraculously survives, and the five daughters- in-law succeed in taking their revenge from Raj and Rasila. After that, Mohan marries Vrinda. Even though she is a genuine and loving woman, the Navavati bahus think she is here to steal her money. They eventually realize that Vrinda is a nice woman. Then comes another twist; the family of the Nanavati's only daughter comes to steal money from the Nanavati house. They kidnap Aastha, but Vrinda rescues her and the kidnappers go to jail. The story ends with the Nanavati family celebrating Vrinda's pregnancy.

FWICE first took a strike on 1 October 2008 when they addressed their problems with the producers and production was stalled. A contract was signed after four days discussions and shooting were happening only for two hours content in a day then after which differences increased between them while channels gave them time until 30 October 2008 to sort it out. Failing to do so lead to protests again from 10 November 2008 to 19 November 2008 during which channels blacked out new broadcasts and repeat telecasts were shown from 10 November 2008. On 19 November 2008, the strike was called off after settling the disputes and the production resumed. The new episodes started to telecast from 1 December 2008.

Geography The bay measures about 40 km from the mouth of the Gol'tsovaya River in the west to its broadest opening to the sea in the east. Its average width is 14 km. The cluster of islands deep inside the bay is known as Ostrova Zalivnyye . The largest island is 4 km in length. Owing to its extreme northerly location, the climate in the area of the Simsa Bay is exceptionally severe, with prolonged, bitter winters. This gulf is covered by ice most of the year, sometimes remaining frozen even in the brief summer period. The Komsomolskaya Pravda Islands lie off the Simsa Bay's mouth. Simsa Bay, Zaliv Simsa, should not be confused with Simskaya Bay, Bukhta Simskaya, an inlet on the right side of the Khatanga Gulf. =Administration= For administrative purposes the Simsa Bay belongs to the Krasnoyarsk Krai of the Russian Federation. History In 1940-41 Soviet hydrographers found the remains of people, money, weapons and other items in the Simsa Bay and in the nearby Faddey Islands. Apparently these were traces of an expedition undertaken by Akaky and Ivan Muromets in the early 17th century. The academician A.P. Okladnikov, an expert in the Ancient Cultures of Siberia and the Pacific Basin, studied these findings in 1945. He supposed that the people went there from the west, from the Yenisei River (Historical monument..., 1945). However, in the 1980s hydrographer V.A.Troitsky put forward a different theory. According to his point of view the deceased seafarers tried to sail by sea from the Khatanga Gulf to the mouth of the Yenisei on two ships in order to load furs (Troitsky, 1991). But the first ship was crushed by ice in the area of the Faddey Islands. Even though the crew were able to reach the land, none of them managed to survive. The second ship reached the Simsa Bay, where the crew built a house in order to leave three ill people there. Then the ship made its way to the south, and four people seem to have been able to reach populated places.

He was hanged, drawn and quartered on a treason charge, having been implicated by Titus Oates in his false accusations concerning a Popish Plot.Andrew Barclay, 'Colman , Edward (1636‚Äì1678)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 He is a Catholic martyr, beatified by Pope Pius XI in 1929.http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=3052 Life He was born at Brent Eleigh, Suffolk, son of the local vicar Thomas Colman and his wife Margaret Wilson; he was a cousin of the Salisbury MP, Richard Colman. He attended Trinity College, Cambridge, receiving an MA in 1659. Colman, who had been reared as a strict Puritan, converted to Roman Catholicism in the early 1660s. He has been described as a man of considerable charm and ability, but lacking in common sense or political realism. Sir Robert Southwell, who knew him well, called him \\"a man who must run himself into the briars\\". He was married: his wife has been described as a woman of great charm, but little else seems to be known of her. In appearance he was strikingly pale and emaciated, due it was said to his practice of regular fasting; his white face being all the more noticeable because he always wore a black periwig. Career In June 1661 he became a gentleman pensioner to Charles II. He was a charismatic advocate of the Catholic cause and is credited with several high-profile conversions, including possibly the future James II. In 1673 James appointed him secretary to his wife, Mary of Modena, despite warnings from several quarters, including Charles II himself, that he was not a man to be trusted. The passing of the Test Act in the same year, barring Catholics from public office, has been described as a shattering blow to his hopes of an important political career, and condemned him to a life of \\"backstairs intrigue\\", unless he could get the Act repealed. This explains his repeated efforts to obtain a dissolution of the Cavalier Parliament, although his belief that a new Parliament would be disposed to repeal the Test Act was shared by no one else. His intrigues were so ill-judged that they led to the Cavalier Parliament in its final session passing a second and more stringent Test Act, while the next Parliament, elected after Colman's death was, quite contrary to his predictions, even more hostile to Catholicism than its predecessor. He visited Brussels in the hope of gaining support from the Papal nuncio there for a scheme for increased tolerance for English Catholics, but nothing came of it. He also visited Paris without an official pass, which was later used in evidence against him at his trial in 1678. Subsequently, he was in contact with highly placed Catholics in France. Through an English Catholic army officer stationed in Paris, Sir William Throckmorton, he passed on political information to the Jesuit Jean Ferrier who was confessor to Louis XIV. In 1675 he offered his services in favour of Catholicism to Fran√ßois de la Chaise, successor to Ferrier as royal confessor; in 1676 he was in communication with Father Saint-Germain, former confessor to Charles II's sister-in-law Mary of Modena, offering his assistance to prevent a rupture between England and France. These attempts failed to procure money, due mainly to the scepticism of Simon Arnauld, Marquis de Pomponne, Louis' Foreign Minister, who put no faith in Colman, Throckmorton or indeed King Charles II, whom he did not even think worth the trouble of bribing. Louis evidently shared this view: as Throckmorton admitted \\"he (Louis) hath so mean an opinion of King Charles and all his partners, he scarce thinks anything we do worth money\\". Colman succeeded later in obtaining ¬£3500 from three successive French ambassadors, whom he supplied with information on the proceedings of Parliament. Colman acted independently of Charles II in trying to obtain French financial assistance to reduce the King's dependence on the anti- Catholic Parliament. When money was eventually secured by Charles, it was not through any of Colman's efforts. Throckmorton had been killed in a duel in the spring of 1675: this, following Ferrier's death the previous winter, deprived Colman of his most useful contacts at the French Court. He was still in touch with Father Saint-Germain, but this connection did him nothing but harm, as Saint-Germain, who had been forced to flee from England after allegedly threatening the life of a former Catholic priest called de Luzancy, was regarded as even more unstable and fanatical than Colman himself. Lord High Treasurer Thomas Osborne, Earl of Danby viewed Colman as a dangerous influence on James, a view shared by the King. Danby had him dismissed in 1676 after Colman was caught leaking naval intelligence in a newsletter; according both to the Dictionary of National Biography and recent research, the dismissal was at the prompting of the Bishop of London, Henry Compton, although Antonia Fraser notes that the King himself had on several occasions urged his brother to dismiss him. Fraser, Antonia King Charles II Mandarin paperback edition 1993 p.356 Edward continued with unofficial duties for James and he may have disbursed bribes to MPs on behalf of the French ambassador. In the summer of 1678 he clashed with the vehemently anti-Catholic Welsh landowner John Arnold of Monmouthshire, who challenged him to a duel, alleging that Colman was responsible for Arnold being dismissed from his office as justice of the peace (the dismissal was in fact the result of a local feud in Monmouthshire). The duel never took place. Arnold was no doubt delighted by Colman's ruin and death, but does not seem to have played any part in his downfall. The Popish Plot Colman was targeted by Oates when the latter presented his fantasy, the Popish Plot, before the King and the Privy Council on 28 September 1678. Oates did not know Colman personally: this caused him some awkward moments at Colman's trial, where he had great difficulty in explaining his failure to recognise him at the subsequent Council meeting of 30 September. Oates however had evidently learnt enough about Colman to realise that he was vulnerable to attack, due to his intrigues with the French Court, futile though they were. According to Oates, Colman would become secretary of state on the death of Charles. It later emerged that the magistrate, Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey, had contacted Colman, who was a friend of his, shortly after the meeting and the following day Colman's house was searched; letters covering his dealings with France were uncovered. =Arrest= The warrant for his apprehension was sent out on Sunday night, 29 September. At the suggestion of Danby, Colman's papers were to be searched for thoroughly. William Bedloe carried the warrant to apprehend Colman and search for his papers. Oates, in what seems to have been an inspired piece of guesswork, had already suggested that if Colman's letters were opened, in particular his letters to Father La Chaise, they would contain treasonable matter, \\"which might cost him his neck\\". Whether this was his own notion, or whether it was suggested to him by someone else, is unclear. Colman's papers were found, some of recent date in paper bags; incriminating letters of earlier years were in a deal box, slightly nailed down. The Government expressed its surprise that after several days warning Colman should have made so little effort to hide them properly: a new pavement had recently been laid in the house, though it is not clear if it was intended as a hiding place. Inexplicably, Colman continued to deny having written the letters for several weeks after they were discovered. It is possible, as Kenyon suggests, that after a lapse of four or five years he had actually forgotten writing them, or perhaps he did not yet realise the danger they put him in. Kenyon The Popish Plot p.84 The letters were carried off, but Colman's wife declared him to be absent, and to the Government's later embarrassment she persuaded the searchers to let her keep several bundles of letters which she claimed were personal. His sister removed a trunk full of documents from his house a week later, rousing further suspicions about what incriminating evidence her brother was concealing. On Monday morning he came forward voluntarily, and offered himself to the Secretary of State, Sir Joseph Williamson. In the afternoon he was heard before Sir Robert Southwell, and others of the Privy Council, in the presence of Oates, who was unable to recognise him. He made so \\"voluble and fair a defence\\", urging his voluntary appearance as proof of his \\"innocence of these vile things\\", that the Council, exhausted by the long day's proceedings, decided not to order his arrest. He was only committed to the care of a messenger, and his papers were not searched carefully till a week later. Kenyon The Popish Plot p.84 The informers seemed about to lose credit when the death of Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey revived the flagging investigation. On 16 October Colman was removed from the messenger's care and committed to Newgate Prison. Even a careful scrutiny of his letters revealed nothing directly pertaining to Oates' allegations, but the Government was horrified at the manner in which a minor civil servant had undertaken on behalf of a foreign power to alter the Government of England, while they were naturally irritated by the unflattering portraits Colman had given Louis XIV of themselves.Kenyon p.86 The legal advice to the Crown was that some of the letters were clearly treasonable. Kenyon argues that the King decided to make an example of Colman, in order to reassure the public that the Crown would allow the law to take its course even against Court officials, and that he was happy to sacrifice a man whom he had always distrusted.Kenyon p.131 By 10 November Colman, having been shown the allegedly treasonable letters, at last admitted to having written them. The strange optimism (Kenyon attributes it to a natural levity of mind) which he had shown up to then finally deserted him: he predicted correctly to the House of Lords that \\"I have confessed to that which will destroy me\\"Kenyon p.101 (although many believed that he continued to hope in vain for a pardon right up to the very end). =Trial= Parliament had reassembled on 21 October, in an atmosphere of unprecedented hysteria about the Plot. Ominously for Colman, the simple cry of \\"Colman's letters!\\" was enough to cause uproar in the House of Commons. The Government decided that to appease the public's desire for blood, it was vital that a few of the suspected plotters be sacrificed as quickly as possible. The first victim of the plot was William Staley, a young Catholic banker who had allegedly vowed to kill the King (in fact the threat seems to have been simply a foolish remark spoken in drink). Staley was executed on 26 November 1678, but clearly the death of an unknown Catholic layman would not be enough to appease public anger: indeed at Staley's trial the prosecution had some difficulty in explaining why he, as opposed to the leading Jesuit fathers, was on trial at all. On 10 November Colman was offered a pardon, if he made a full confession; he was warned that if found guilty he would suffer in its full horror the gruesome death prescribed for convicted traitors. Colman refused to confess, and preparations were made to try him as quickly as possible. On Saturday, 23 November 1678, Colman was arraigned for high treason, and the trial took place on Wednesday, the 27th, at the King's Bench bar, before the Lord Chief Justice William Scroggs and three junior judges. Scroggs was a firm believer in the Popish Plot, and although he assured Colman that he would receive a fair trial- \\"we seek no man's blood, but only our own safety\\"Kenyon p.135\\\\- there is no doubt that he was determined to secure a conviction by any means necessary. Colman declared that he had not continued the correspondence beyond 1674. Oates swore that he had carried a treasonable letter from Colman to the rector of St. Omer, containing a sealed answer to Father La Chaise, with thanks for the ten thousand pounds given for the propagation of the Catholic religion, and chiefly to cut off the King of England. Then followed details of the narrative according to Oates of 'consults' with the Jesuits in May 1678. Arrangements had been made to assassinate the King. 'This resolve of the Jesuits was communicated to Mr. Colman in my hearing at Wild House (i.e. the Spanish Embassy in London)' said Oates. Then Oates told of a consultation in August at the Savoy, with Colman present, arranging to poison the Duke of Ormonde and to rise in rebellion. Four Irish ruffians had been sent to Windsor, and ¬£80 for their payment was ordered to be carried by a messenger, to whom Colman gave a guinea. Ten thousand pounds were to be offered to Sir George Wakeman, physician to Queen Catherine of Braganza, to poison the king; instructions had been seen and read by Colman, copied out by him and sent to other conspirators. Colman had been appointed a principal secretary of state by commission from Father D'Oliva (Giovanni Paolo Oliva), Superior General of the Society of Jesus, (unfortunately for Colman the Government knew that he had corresponded with Oliva as well as with the French Court). In cross-examination Oates shuffled and excused himself. In particular he could not explain to the Court's satisfaction why he had not recognised Colman at the crucial Council meeting of 30 September: the judges were not impressed with his pleas that it had been late and he was tired. Bedloe was examined concerning the packets of letters from Colman to Father La Chaise in 1675, which Colman admitted to sending, and the money which Colman had received from the French Government to bribe members of Parliament; again, Colman admitted receiving the money, but insisted that he had simply pocketed it. Bedloe, there as at later trials, made a very poor impression. Scroggs, who could never resist the urge to bully a witness, even one appearing for the Crown, gave both Oates and Bedloe a most unpleasant time in the witness box, but, mindful of the need to secure a conviction, did not go so far as to accuse them of perjury. In his summing up he referred briefly to their evidence (\\"you have heard it\\") but made no comment, one way or the other, on their veracity To spare the Duke of York any embarrassment, the prosecution did not tell the jury that Colman had ever been in his employment, instead referring vaguely to Colman holding an unspecified public office (although they can scarcely have believed that the jury were unaware of his true position). Colman in his defence could have pleaded that he had acted throughout the exchange of correspondence on the Duke's express orders. He was clearly tempted to do so, but at the last moment he seems to have suffered from a fatal hesitation (perhaps he still hoped for a pardon), and took refuge in evasion and ambiguous remarks such as \\"I might possibly make use of the Duke's name; it is possible, they say I did it\\". Scroggs, not unreasonably, said : \\"you have such a swimming way of melting words that it is a troublesome thing for a man to collect matter out of them\\". The finding of the letters having been certified, and the handwriting identified as Colman's, they were put in evidence, and the Attorney-General William Jones laid great stress on them; they did prove the strong desire of Colman for the dissolution of parliament. He plainly had advocated foreign bribery of the king to insure such a dissolution, and used some strong phrases as to the Catholic hopes of suppressing heresy. Kenyon argues that a case may be made for his guilt, noting similarities between Colman's case and that of Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, executed for treason by act of attainder in 1640.Kenyon p.142 =Verdict and execution= There was no proof of any conspiracy by Colman in a plot for the assassination of, or a rebellion against Charles II except the perjured testimony of Oates and Bedloe. Nonetheless the jury, following the unmistakable instructions from Scroggs in his summing up, found Colman guilty. Scroggs replied to his solemn declarations of innocence: 'Mr. Colman, your own papers are enough to condemn you.' Next morning a sentence of death and confiscation of property was pronounced, and on Tuesday, 3 December, he was executed, avowing his faith and declaring his innocence. Some onlookers thought that he was hoping for a reprieve, even at the very end, but it did not come. Ring A gold signet ring, believed to be Colman's, was found on the banks of Loch Lomond in 2017 by a detectorist.

To reserve a case is then to refuse jurisdiction for the absolution of a certain sin. The reservation of sins presupposes jurisdiction, and therefore the pope alone can make reservation for the whole Church; bishops can do the same for their diocese only, and certain regular prelates for their religious subjects. That a sin be reserved it must be mortal, external, and consummated. If a sin be reserved in one diocese, and a penitent, without the intention of evading the law, confess to a priest in another diocese where the sin is not reserved, the latter may absolve the reserved sin. Cases are reserved either * merely on account of the sin itself, that is without censure, or * on account of the censure attached to it. In most cases, one's Ordinary (usually one's bishop) has the ability to lift ecclesiastical censure, although certain sins are reserved to the Apostolic See, including host desecration, assaulting the Pope, breaking the seal of the confessional, and consecrating another bishop without permission from the Pope. If a penitent be in danger of death, any priest can absolve him, both from reserved censures and reserved sins. In case of reserved censures, if he recover, he must later present himself to the one having special power for reserved censures, unless the case was simply reserved to the pope. As to reserved sins, he need not, as a general rule, present himself again after convalescence. In a case of urgent necessity, when it is not possible to have recourse to the proper superior, an ordinary priest may absolve a penitent, directly from unreserved sins and indirectly from episcopal reserved cases, but the penitent must afterwards apply to the person having power to absolve from the reservation. If there were also papal reservations, either simple or special, the absolution is direct, but in case of special reservations to the pope a relation must be made to the Holy See that its mandates on the subject may be obtained. Ignorance of a censure prevents its being incurred, but moralists dispute whether ignorance of a reservation, with or without censure, excuses from its incurrence. If a case with censure reserved to the pope, all agree that ignorance does excuse from it; if reserved to a bishop, it is controversial. Some moralists hold that ignorance excuses from all reservations, whether with or without censure. It is certain, however, that a bishop has authority to declare that ignorance of a reservation does not prevent its incurrence in his diocese. Ignorance of a censure (excommunication, interdict, removal from the exercise of certain ministries, or for clerics- deacons, priests, or Bishops, suspension from certain faculties), or of a reservation (to the Pope or the Bishop or Ordinary) attached to a particular mortal sin, are both distinct from ignorance of its status as a mortal sin. Persons who have reached the age of reason (about 6 or 7 years), have previously received the Sacrament of Reconciliation, and who possess the mental and other faculties needed to commit serious sins, and who committed the act (of omission or commission) with full knowledge and intent and were aware of its seriousness, may not receive Holy Communion- or any other prohibited Sacraments, if they are aware of the censure attached- before being properly absolved. The 1917 Code of Canon Law divided reserved sins into two categories, ratione peccati (the nature of the sin itelf) and ratione censur√¶ (the nature of the penalty attached).

The scientific name is derived from the Latin 'gryllus' meaning a cricket and 'talpa', a mole, and is descriptive because of the fine dense fur by which it is covered and its subterranean habits,ARKive.org: Gryllotalpa . Retrieved 14 May 2015 and because of the mole-like forelegs adapted for digging, a good example of convergent evolution. Cryptic Species It is now understood that G. gryllotalpa is a species group, that includes a number of cryptic species which can be distinguished only by their song patterns. The Orthoptera Species FileOrthoptera Species File (retrieved 3 October 2018) lists: * Gryllotalpa cossyrensis Baccetti & Capra, 1978 * Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa (Linnaeus, 1758) * Gryllotalpa isfahan Ingrisch, Nikouei & Hatami, 2006 * Gryllotalpa krimbasi Baccetti, 1992 * Gryllotalpa marismortui Broza, Blondheim & Nevo, 1998 * Gryllotalpa octodecim Baccetti & Capra, 1978 * Gryllotalpa quindecim Baccetti & Capra, 1978 * Gryllotalpa sedecim Baccetti & Capra, 1978 * Gryllotalpa septemdecimchromosomica Ortiz, 1958 * Gryllotalpa stepposa Zhantiev, 1991 * Gryllotalpa tali Broza, Blondheim & Nevo, 1998 * Gryllotalpa unispina Saussure, 1874 * Gryllotalpa viginti Baccetti & Capra, 1978 * Gryllotalpa vigintiunum Baccetti, 1991 * Gryllotalpa vineae Bennet-Clark, 1970 Description The body length is about 50 millimetres in males and 70 millimetres in females. The cricket is dark brown with a silky shimmer and yellowish underside and is covered with fine velvety hairs. The forelegs are powerful and modified for digging. The elytra are half the length of the abdomen and the wings are transparent and netted with veins. They are folded into pleats and seldom used as the cricket normally remains below the ground. The males can be distinguished from the females by the open vein area in the forewing known as the 'harp' while the females lack the external ovipositor that is possessed by other crickets. Range and habitat This mole cricket occurs throughout much of the Western Palaearctic, but is replaced by similar species in the south and east, and becomes rare or absent towards the north. Favoured habitats include damp rich soils, flood plains, reservoir edges, irrigated and well-fertilized fields and vegetable gardens. The family Gryllotalpidae includes several similar species. =Status (UK)= Although relatively common in many parts of mainland Europe, in the United Kingdom G. gryllotalpa is considered endangered as there have been only four confirmed sightings between 1970 and 2001. It used to occur in 33 vice-counties, mainly across Southern England but also in South Wales, western Scotland and Northern Ireland. Its range has contracted and it may now be extinct. There is an action plan that aims to maintain any surviving colonies, establish a captive breeding programme and establish self-sustaining colonies throughout its former range. In 2014, a colony of Mole crickets was found persisting in the New Forest. Biology The female cricket lays 100 to 350 eggs in an underground chamber in the spring. They hatch ten to twenty days later and she guards them for another two to three weeks. The nymphs moult six times and take from one to three years to reach maturity. Adults and nymphs live underground throughout the year in extensive tunnel systems that may reach a depth of over a metre in the winter. They are omnivorous, feeding on roots, tubers and rhizomes and a range of soil invertebrates. They often leave neat circular holes in tuberous plants. The males occasionally produce a soft, 'churring' song from within a specially constructed chamber in the burrow system. This acts to amplify the song which is believed to be used for attracting females. The sounds are typically produced on warm mild evenings in early spring and they are similar to the song of the nightjar, Caprimulgus europeaeus. Natural enemies include rooks, starlings and other birds, shrews, moles, ants, ground beetles, nematodes and mites. During winters interrupted by thaws, fungal diseases may cause mass deaths. Economic significance This cricket feeds on a wide range of crops and disturbs the soil with its burrowing activities. In countries where it is abundant it is considered a pest as it damages cereals, legumes, perennial grasses, potatoes, vegetable crops, beet, sunflower, tobacco, hemp, flax and strawberry. It also is troublesome in nurseries where young plants may be killed, and damages the roots of vines, fruit and other trees. Control measures may include deep autumn plowing, treatments of the soil between rows of crops, trapping during the winter, pesticides, poison baits and soil fumigation. References Sources * Haes, E.

After the on 21 November 1944 by the 1st Armored Division, General Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque and the 2nd Armored Division entered Strasbourg after having liberated Sarrebourg and La Petite-Pierre, which cleared the way to the city of Strasbourg. Battle On November 22, 1944, the hard-fighting French 2nd Armored Division, along with the French First Army, had been assigned the capture of Strasbourg by Allied Supreme Command. That same day, the 2nd Armored moved up to the vital pass at Saverne, which had been taken by the Americans, about 40 km northwest of Strasbourg. This Saverne \\"gap\\" is the historic gateway through the barrier of the Vosges Mountains, opening a line of advance on Strasbourg. On November 23, 1944, units of the French 2nd Armored Division entered the city and raised the Free French tricolore over Strasbourg cathedral at 2:30 pm. The German collective memory of the battle is rather more bleak. In Ardennes: 1944, Antony Beevor states that the Battle for Strasbourg was one of the more \\"inglorious episodes\\" in German military history with a collapse of the Wehrmacht defense that was both premature and ignominious. It was hastened by a panic of senior Nazi leadership as many officials fled prior to the Allied push. This led to a general demoralization of Heer, Waffen-SS, and Luftwaffe ground forces as well as a breakdown in discipline. He states: ‚Ä≥\\"The SS had looted Strasbourg before withdrawing. According to one general defending the town, soldiers ordered to 'fight to the last round' tended to throw away most of their ammunition before the battle, so they could claim that they ran out and then surrender. Generalmajor Vaterrodt, the (Heer) commander, was scornful about the behaviour of senior officers and Nazi Party officials. 'I'm surprised that Himmler did not have anyone hanged in Strasbourg,' he told fellow officers after he had been captured. 'Everyone ran away, Kreisleiter, Ortsgruppenleiter, the municipal authorities, the mayor and the deputy mayor, they all took to their heels, government officials - all fled...'\\". The Alsatian-born Chief Magistrate also fled towards Germany on foot with a backpack - as he had signed many death warrants and collaborated within the German occupation system and was a marked man. =Result= The rapid Liberation of Strasbourg by General LeClerc's 2nd Armored Division produced a torrent of joy in the newly liberated French nation and was a hugely symbolic victory for the French people and the Western Allies in general. Leclerc was well respected and liked by his American contemporaries, unlike some other French commanders. The Liberation and Tricolore raised over the Cathedral was considered to be the last major objective in the Liberation of France. Unfortunately the Allies were unable to quickly seize on the German collapse. While fuel shortages and the increasing difficulty of supporting armies with lengthening supply lines played a role, General Dwight D. Eisenhower's lack of interest in his southern flank largely doomed any further exploitation around Strasbourg. The commander of the American 6th Army Group, General Jacob L. Devers, believed he could cross the Rhine quickly at Rastatt thereby seizing a bridgehead. But Devers' ambitious nature and aggressive personality somewhat alienated other commanders such as Eisenhower, and he failed to convince The Supreme Commander of his plan. A potential bridgehead at Rastatt, had it been quickly seized, would more than likely have secured the southern flank and would have severally disrupted the coming German offensive in the Ardennes. But Eisenhower never seriously considered the opportunity as he seemed fixated on a more direct route to Berlin. As a result, Strasbourg would become threatened during the German Wacht am Rhein offensive known as The Battle of the Bulge in the West. In early January 1945, the German counteroffensive into France known as Operation Nordwind was quickly contained, but not before both Eisenhower and Devers considered a general withdrawal from Alsace, which would have left Strasbourg undefended. The French Provisional Government considered this an anathema as it was, in General de Gaulle's words, (potentially) \\"a national disaster\\". In addition to this, hundreds-of-thousands of Alsatians would be subjected to German reprisals. The talk of a strategic withdrawal was also a blow to morale of the American VI Corps that had fought hard and suffered many casualties securing the area. In response General Charles de Gaulle threatened to pull his forces out of the overall SHAEF Command creating a serious row with Eisenhower. With the support of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, de Gaulle won over Ike after a contentious argument. Strasbourg was not to be abandoned as the order to withdraw to the east of the Vosges Mountains was rescinded - boosting VI Corps' morale. The German advance was halted in desperate fighting about 40 kilometers west of Strasbourg and Operation Nordwind became another disaster for the German Heer and Waffen-SS with precious divisions reduced. Impact The Liberation of Strasbourg constituted the dramatically symbolic high point for the rehabilitation of the honor of French armed forces as the Allies advanced across France toward Germany in 1944. Alsace, of which Strasbourg is the capital, had been the focus of French-German enmity since the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71, and General Charles de Gaulle insisted that only French forces should retake it. After the victory of Kufra, General Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque and his troops swore an oath to fight until \\"our flag flies over the Cathedral of Strasbourg\\".Jurez de ne d√©poser les armes que lorsque nos couleurs, nos belles couleurs, flotteront sur la cath√©drale de Strasbourg.

Christian Gustav Adolph Mayer (15 February 1839 ‚Äì 11 April 1908) was a German mathematician. Mayer was born on February 15, 1839 in Leipzig, Germany. His father was a businessman from Leipzig. He studied at the University of Leipzig, University of G√∂ttingen, University of Heidelberg and University of K√∂nigsberg. He completed his doctorate from the University of Heidelberg in 1861. When Mayer was studying at Heidelberg, he submitted his habilitation thesis to the University of Heidelberg. He gained the permission to teach at universities in 1866. He taught mathematics at the University of Heidelberg for the rest of his life. He did research on differential equations, the calculus of variations and mechanics. His research on the integration of partial differential equations and a search to determine maxima and minima using variational methods brought him close to the investigations that Sophus Lie was carrying out around the same time. Several letters were exchanged between Mayer and mathematician Felix Klein from 1871 to 1907.

The term comes from the Latin filialis, from filia, ‚Äúdaughter‚Äù. Description The term filial church may have more than one signification as to minor details. Ordinarily, a filial church is a parish church which has been constituted by the dismemberment of an older parish. Its rector is really a parish priest, having all the essential rights of such a dignity, but still bound to defer in certain matters to the pastor of the mother church. The marks of deference required are not so fixed that local custom may not change them. Such marks are: obtaining the baptismal water from the mother church, making a moderate offering of money (fixed by the bishop) to the parish priest of the mother church annually, and occasionally during the year assisting with his parishioners in a body at services in the older church. In some places this last includes a procession and the presentation of a wax candle. If the filial church has been endowed from the revenues of the mother church, the parish priest of the latter has the right of presentation when a pastor for the dependent church is to be appointed. This term is also applied to churches established within the limits of an extensive parish, without any dismemberment of the parochial territory. The Pastor of such a filial church is really only a curate or assistant of the parish priest of the mother church, and he is removable at will, except in cases where he has a benefice. The parish priest may retain to himself the right of performing baptism, assisting at marriages and similar offices in the filial church, or he may ordain that such functions be performed only in the parish church, restricting the services in the filial church to Mass and Vespers. In practice, however, the curates of such filial churches act as parish priests for their districts, although by canon law the dependence upon the pastor of the mother church remains of obligation, though all outward manifestation of subjection has ceased. In the union of two parishes in the manner called \\"union by subjection\\", the less important of the parish churches may sink into a condition scarcely distinguishable from that of a filial church and be comprehended under this term. In other words, the parish priest may govern such a church by giving it over to one of his assistants. The subjected church does not lose its parochial rights, yet its dependence on the parish priest of another church and its administration by a vicar has led to its being included loosely under the designation filial church. Historically, this term has also been applied to those churches, often in different countries, founded by other and greater churches. In this sense the major patriarchical Sees of Rome, Antioch, Jerusalem, Alexandria, Constantinople established many filial churches which retained a special dependence upon the church founding them.

It was founded in 1842 in Oranienburg near Berlin. Today the company is located in Wehrheim near Frankfurt.  History  \\"Heintze & Blanckertz - erste deutsche Schreibfederfabrik\\" was founded in 1842. Dip pens were important as the only other writing tool was the quill. The company sold their products through own offices in Berlin, Leipzig and Frankfurt. Since the 1920s the company cooperated with famous graphic designers like Rudolf Koch, Paul Renner and Edward Johnston and expanded on the arts and crafts sector. In 1926 Heintze & Blanckertz started to publish the design magazine Die zeitgem√§√üe Schrift and three years later the Rudolf Blanckertz Schriftmuseum (museum of writing) was opened in Berlin. In World War II the factory in Oranienburg was bombed out and the remaining machines were confiscated by the Red Army. The factory was re-opened in West Berlin and moved later to Frankfurt, but the ballpen limited the use of dip pens, so the company's activities are today more on the arts and crafts sector. It also produces materials for artists and craftpeople. The graphic collection of Rudolf Blanckertz is now part of the permanent exhibition of the Gutenberg Museum in Mainz.
