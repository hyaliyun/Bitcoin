The electoral campaign was used to support and raise awareness about the independentist prisoners and to call for abstention. At the end of the campaign the party announced its withdrawal from the elections.http://www.primeiralinha.org/paraumhagzindependente/foz2.htm Despite the withdrawal and their calls for abstention, Galicia Ceibe gained 1,433 (0.15%) votes.

In the elections of 1983 formed with the PCOE and independents the Popular Unity Candidates (Candidaturas de Unidade Popular), that presented lists in Vigo and Pontevedra.Only 814 votes in Vigo and 182 in Pontevedra The party also supported and participated in the Unidade dos Vici√±os list in Melide, that gained 4 town councillors and the 26,71% of the vote (1,073 votes); and supported, but not participated, the Uni√≥n Galega list in Cambados (that gained 11 town councillors and the mayor) and the Agrupaci√≥n Nacionalista Galega de Nar√≥n in Nar√≥n (6 town councillors and the mayor). Due to the poor results achieved Xos√© Lu√≠s M√©ndez Ferr√≠n proposed later this year in the VI National Assembly the dissolution of the organization, which was rejected by the majority. After that assembly part of the militancy left the organization. The National Assembly also decided to rename the organization as Galiza Ceive-OLN and adopt reintegrationism. Antom √Årias CurtoTown councillor in Monforte de Lemos between 1979 and 1980, when he was arrested by the police and accused of terrorism. became the most prominent leader. The organization gave ideological and political support to the Ex√©rcito Guerrilheiro do Povo Galego Ceive (EGPGC, Guerrilla Army of the Free Galician People). Galiza Ceibe called for abstention in the 1985 autonomic elections, criticizing the BNG for taking the oath of the Spanish constitution.RIOS BERGANTINHOS, Noa.

Usernames could contain only emoji and users could only communicate using emoji within the app.  History  Tom Scott and Matt Gray were inspired to create the app after seeing the success of Yo and the release of new emoji characters by the Unicode Consortium. During a talk at Electromagnetic Field Festival, the developers commented that the app originated largely as a joke, but that by the time of launch 70,000 unique usernames had been reserved. The app was launched on 29 August 2014. After press coverage the developers began receiving offers for venture capital. Due to the cost and effort of maintaining the application, the developers closed the app on 30 July 2015.  Development  The back end of the app was coded by Tom Scott in PHP and MySQL and the front end was designed and programmed by Matt Gray in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The pair remarked that they ran into problems as not all web browsers supported emoji, and mobile operating system support for them varied. All work on the app was done in their spare time and took a little over a month. An Android version was released on 30 January 2015.

It attempts to recreate the module replay and user experience of the popular DOS program FastTracker, with special playback modes available for improved Amiga ProTracker 2/3 compatibility. Module tracking Module composition or \\"tracking\\" is done through the control of multichannel sample playback. An instrument is created by arranging one or more audio samples across a keyboard range. The instrument is then sequenced on a monophonic track that contains note, volume and effect data. A pattern is a series of tracks that are played back simultaneously. A song is then created by arranging the patterns. Features MilkyTracker is able to open several legacy music module formats and is able to save in .xm and .mod formats. Like FastTracker, MilkyTracker contains a sample editor and an instrument editor. The envelope editor of the instrument editor allows the creation of many envelope points and user definable envelope loop points. MilkyTracker also supports basic (velocity sensitive) note input via MIDI. Platform support MilkyTracker supports several operating systems and hardware platforms. These include: * Microsoft Windows: MilkyTracker runs on Windows 9x & Me, NT, Windows 200x, XP, Vista & Windows 7. * Unix-like: MilkyTracker is available for Linux, Android, macOS, OpenBSD, and FreeBSD. * Amiga: A port of MilkyTracker exists for AmigaOS and MorphOS. * Windows Mobile: MilkyTracker can be run on Windows Mobile smartphones, PDAs, Pocket PC and a VDO Dayton car navigation system running Windows CE 4.2. * Xbox * GP2x History MilkyTracker is not based on any existing module replay engine. Its core MilkyPlay has been in development since the mid-90s, originally as a Digitrakker .MDL player. MilkyTracker development started a decade later for the Pocket PC and it still fully operates on rather humble PDAs. MilkyTracker is and will stay a 2nd generation tracker. There are no plans to add modern tracker features that would break compatibility with FastTracker.

Location Ousdale Broch is located near the small settlement of Ousdale near the A9 coastal road. It is 3.5 miles northeast of Helmsdale, and about 1 mile southwest of the ruined hamlet of Badbea. The broch stands on a narrow terrace at the foot of a long shallow slope. The terrace is bounded to the east by a deep ravine containing the Ousdale Burn flowing down to the sea and, on the south, by a shallower ravine containing the Allt a Bhurg (). Description Ousdale Broch has an external diameter of around 16 metres. The main entrance is on the southwest and is 4.3 metres long with nearly all the roofing lintels still in position. The entrance passage is 1.78 metres high and 75 centimetres wide. The entrance passage contains two sets of door-checks, and there is also a guard-cell. The interior of the broch has a diameter of around 7 metres, and there is a doorway to the intramural stairway. Excavations The site was excavated in 1891 by James Mackay, and the interior was thoroughly cleared out. Layers of ashes and charcoal were found on the floor, with many broken animal bones. There were also large quantities of common periwinkle and limpet shells, and many wild hazel nuts. A series of stone tanks were set into the floor. Finds included a metalworking crucible. Stone artifacts included a damaged \\"hatchet\\", a granite mortar, several querns, stone discs, and several whetstones. There were large quantities of pottery. A segment of a jet bracelet was also found, and a fragment of a wooden dish or scoop.

The lakes are in the Great Lakes Basin, and Lower Shebandowan Lake is the source of the Shebandowan River. The primary inflows are Greenwater Creek at the southwest; the Kashabowie River at the north; and the Swamp River at the northeast. The primary outflow is the Shebandowan River, which leaves Lower Shebandowan Lake over a weir at the east at the community of Shebandowan, and flows via the Matawin River and the Kaministiquia River to Lake Superior. Ontario Highway 11, at this point part of the Trans-Canada Highway, follows the north shore of the lakes. Ontario Highway 586 branches from Highway 11 along an isthmus between Middle Shebandowan Lake and Lower Shebandowan Lake.

He was the 9th-generation owner of Riedel Crystal, an Austrian glassware manufacturer that was established in 1756. Riedel is best known for creating and producing grape variety-specific glassware designed to enhance types of wines based on specific properties of individual grape varieties. He was among the first glassware experts in history to recognize that the taste of wine is affected by the shape of the glass from which it is consumed, and is credited with first discovering the concept of variety-specificity in glassware, developing variety-specific glassware shapes and bringing these glasses to the consumer market. Riedel served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Riedel Crystal from 1957 until 1994., Claus Riedel, Wineglass Innovator, Dies at 79. Biography Claus Riedel was born in Polaun, now part of Ko≈ôenov, Bohemia (present-day Czech Republic), to Walter Riedel, a glassmaker, and Claudia Prollius Riedel. Claus Riedel was drafted by the German Army in World War II, where he fought Italian partisans in Tuscany and Liguria. In March 1945 he was captured by American forces and sent to a prisoner-of-war camp near Pisa, Italy for ten months. In January 1946, while being returned to Germany for repatriation, Riedel escaped by jumping from a train entering Austria., Claus Josef Riedel, Crystal Maker Who Suited Glass to Wine, Is Dead at 79. Riedel remained in Austria, finding a job with glassmaker Daniel Swarovski, who had once been an apprentice to Riedel‚Äôs great-grandfather Josef Riedel. He also enrolled in the University of Innsbruck in Tyrol, where he studied chemistry. After graduating, he spent five years working various jobs throughout Europe. In 1955 he was contacted by The Austrian People‚Äôs Party Prime Minister, Reinhard Kamitz, who invited him to take over the bankrupt Tiroler Glash√ºtte glassware factory. Restarting the Riedel company Walter Riedel had been employed during World War II by the Germans to blow vacuum tubes for electronic equipment. In that capacity he had been captured by the conquering Russian army in 1945, and taken to the USSR as a prisoner of war. After ten years he was released, and found his way to Austria, where he joined Claus. With assistance from Swarovski, the two Riedels were able to reopen the glassware factory by 1957, turning it into today‚Äôs Riedel Glass Factory in Kufstein, Austria. Prior to World War II, the factory had produced heavy industrial glass, but upon reopening, Claus Riedel changed its focus to fine hand-made glass. Claus Riedel served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Riedel Crystal from 1957 until 1994, when he turned the reins over to his son Georg Josef Riedel, who later was succeeded by his son Maximilian Riedel, who is the current President and CEO of Riedel Crystal. Design Innovations As a glassmaker, Riedel was interested primarily in function over appearance, and broke away from the traditional richly cut, heavy and thick glass designs of the time. He spent 16 years studying the physics of wine delivery to the mouth and taste buds and experimenting with different glass configurations, matching them with wines of different regions, grape origin and age to create stemware that would match and complement specific wines and spirits. He was among the first glassware experts in history to recognize that the taste of wine is affected by the shape of the glass from which it is consumed. From these experiments, Riedel created the Burgundy Grand Cru glass in 1958, made to enhance the flavors and aromas of the Pinot Noir and Nebbiolo grape variety, specifically for Burgundy, Barolo, and Barbaresco wines. This creation was first exhibited at the World Exhibition in Brussels, Expo 58 (The Brussels Worlds Fair), where it received a Gold Medal for its creative and striking design. It was acquired by the Museum of Modern Art in New York for the museum‚Äôs permanent collection. In 1961, Riedel Crystal introduced the first full line of wine glasses created for different wines. Riedel perfected these variety-specific wine glasses in 1973 with the introduction of his most notable glass collection, the Sommeliers Series, the world‚Äôs first gourmet glasses. Awards and nominations Claus Riedel was honored with 28 design prizes and awards for his creations. Notable honors include: *1958: World Exhibition, Expo 58, Brussels ‚Äì Gold Medal *1958: Museum of Modern Art, Burgundy Grand Cru glass selected for permanent collection *1959: Sommeliers Series Burgundy Grand Cru glass awarded Most Beautiful Glass in the World, Corning Museum of Glass *1960: La Triennale di Milano, Silver Medal *1966: American Institute of Interior Designers Award Personal life During his lifetime, Claus Riedel was married five times to four different women (he married Ute two separate times). On 17 March 2004, Riedel died in Genoa, Italy from heart failure while visiting family. He was survived by his fourth wife Ute, by two children from previous marriages (Georg Riedel and Barbara Riedel Orehounig), and a son (Wenzel Riedel) by Ute Riedel.

Dad Rocks! signed to UK record label in 2010 when they released the debut EP Digital Age. The debut album Mount Modern was released on a wider range of labels such as Big Scary Monsters (UK), Paper Garden Records (US), Friend of Mine Records (JP), les disques Normal (FR) and Father Figure Records (Scandinavia). The band's second album, Year of the Flesh, was first released in Denmark, and was released internationally in September 2014. History Dad Rocks! came into being after singer and songwriter Sn√¶var Nj√°ll Albertsson became a father in 2009. Being an active member and lyricist in the Danish math-rock band Mimas, he found himself writing songs that did not fit Mimas' style. In 2010 Dad Rocks! recorded Digital Age with his friends in Danish label Kanel Records, who also released the EP in Denmark. In August that year Dad Rocks! signed to UK label Big Scary Monsters Records, who released Digital Age in the UK in August 2010. After touring as Dad Rocks! along with Mimas in 2010 Albertsson recorded his debut album Mount Modern in the winter of 2011. This time Albertsson brought more musicians to the studio and decided to record in Aarhus Lydstudie. Many of these musicians would later become his backing band when performing live. The record was released by a handful of record labels in Asia, America and Europe. Dad Rocks! toured extensively and performed at festivals such as Iceland Airwaves, SPOT Festival, Reeperbahn Festival and Berlin Music Week. Dad Rocks! also asked fans to make remixes of the album, and later released Mount Remix for free. Mount Modern was later released in (Germany) in September 2012, where Dad Rocks! toured extensively, and supported label mates Tall Ships for 15 gigs in United Kingdom. Albertsson also released a mash-up EP called AC!D DORKS, on his own label Father Figure Records. He stated that a man called Jack had sent him a mash-up of his music, and thought it was so good that he had to release the EP. In the beginning of 2013, Dad Rocks! went to Aarhus Lydstudie again to record his sophomore record, Year of the Flesh. This time he brought in even more collaborators, including a female choir and a full brass band. The album was expected to be released internationally in September 2014.

Typically the beam dynamics is broken down into single particle dynamics and collective effects. Sources of collective effects include single or multiple inter-particle scattering and interaction with the vacuum chamber and other surroundings, formalized in terms of impedance. The collective effects of charged particle beams in particle accelerators share some similarity to the dynamics of plasmas. In particular, a charged particle beam may be considered as a non-neutral plasma, and one may find mathematical methods in common with the study of stability or instabilities. One may also find commonality with the field of fluid mechanics since the density of charged particles is often sufficient to be considered as flowing continuum. Another important topic is the attempt to mitigate collective effects by use of single bunch or multi-bunch feedback systems. Types of collective effects Collective effects can include emittance growth, bunch length or energy spread growth, instabilities, or particle losses.A. Chao, Physics of Collective Beam Instabilities in High Energy Accelerators, Wiley Publishers, 1993. Available here. There are also multi- bunch effects. Formalisms for treating collective effects The collective beam motion may be modeled in a variety of ways. One may use macroparticle models, or else a continuum model. The evolution equation in the latter case is typically called the Vlasov equation, and requires one to write down the Hamiltonian function including the external magnetic fields, and the self interaction. Stochastic effects may be added by generalizing to the Fokker‚ÄìPlanck equation. Software for computation of collective effects Depending on the effects considered and the modeling formalism used, different software is available for simulation. The collective effects must typically be added in addition to the single particle dynamics, which may be modeled using a tracking code. See article on Accelerator physics codes.

The Jasie≈Ñ is a regulated river throughout most of its course, the river flowing both underground and in overground canals Starting with the late 1830s, with the advent of steam engines in the city's factories, the river ceased to function primarily as a source of water power and became a recipient of waste water.Kobojek 2017, p. 10. The situation deteriorated throughout the nineteenth and into the twentieth century as the river continued to receive significant amounts of polluted waters.Bartnik and Moniewski 2015, p. 64.

It was only after the fall of communism in 1989 and after the collapse of the textile industry that the production of waste was reduced by 60%.Bartnik and Moniewski 2015, p. 64. The contamination levels in the waters of the Jasie≈Ñ have been systematically dropping since then.Jƒôdruszkiewicz and Moniewski 2015, p. 45.

Historical sources date the existence of the pond back to the early sixteenth century.Jƒôdruszkiewicz and Moniewski 2015, p. 42. Enlarged in the early nineteenth century to boost hydropower production, the pond had an area of 5 ha, but by the end of the century its function was only recreational.Jƒôdruszkiewicz and Moniewski 2015, p. 43. The residence of Edward Herbst, Karl Scheibler's son-in-law, was built on its northern side between 1875 and 1877, and the pond became part of the residential complex.Jƒôdruszkiewicz and Moniewski 2015, p. 43. In the 1970s the area of the pond was reduced to 3.46 ha due to the construction of a nearby road.Jƒôdruszkiewicz and Moniewski 2015, p. 45. A pond on the Jasie≈Ñ river in W≈Çadys≈Çaw Reymont Park Another pond is located near the city's main thoroughfare, Piotrkowska Street, and adjacent to Ludwig Geyer's White Factory; there were originally here several ponds with islands, which were later connected to form one large body of water, with the islands inporporated into the park mainland.Wycichowska 2012, p. 219. Originally formed within the current of the Jasie≈Ñ between 1825 and 1827 in order to power the local factories, the pond currently serves a recreational function as part of W≈Çadys≈Çaw Reymont Park and is maintained with water from the municipal waterworks rather than the polluted river.Jƒôdruszkiewicz and Moniewski 2015, p. 44.

He is the 10th-generation owner of Riedel (glass manufacturer) established in 1756 and best known for its production of grape variety- specific glassware designed to enhance types of wines based on specific properties of individual grape varieties. Georg Riedel joined the family business in 1973 serving as accountant, before rising to co-CEO of Riedel Crystal alongside his father, Professor Claus Josef Riedel, from 1987 until 1994. He served as Chief Executive Officer from 1994 until 2013. Georg Riedel succeeded his father, who first developed the concept of wine-enhancing glassware in 1958, and is best known for bringing variety-specific wine glasses to a global audience. Early life Georg Josef Riedel was born in 1949 in Innsbruck, Austria to Claus J Riedel and Adia Rosa Riedel (n√©e Parodi). Career In 1973, Georg Riedel joined his family's company as an accountant. In 1982, he expanded Riedel's product-development process, founding the Glass Workshop based at the company headquarters in Kufstein, Austria, with an increased focus on the development of new glassware shapes to enhance the flavors of alcoholic beverages on the palate Riedel History & Generations. In 1987 Riedel was named co-CEO of the company alongside his father Claus. In this role, Georg Riedel worked directly with industry experts and leading winemakers, including Robert Mondavi and Angelo Gaja, inviting them to taste their wines in Riedel glasses of different shapes and sizes to determine the glass that best expressed the flavors and aromas of their single variety wines. As a result, Riedel Crystal earned the endorsement of industry experts and influential winemakers, who insisted that their wines be served exclusively in Riedel glasses. To that end, in 1991, Robert M. Parker, Jr. who described Riedel glassware in The Wine Advocate, claimed: ‚ÄúThe finest glasses for both technical and hedonistic purposes are those made by Riedel. The effect of these glasses on fine wine is profound.‚Äù, About Riedel Crystal. In 1994 Georg Riedel took over as sole Chief Executive Officer of Riedel Crystal. In 2013, Riedel stepped down as CEO and named his son, 11th-generation Maximilian Riedel, President and CEO of Riedel Crystal and its worldwide subsidiaries. Today, Riedel is managed jointly by Georg Riedel and Maximilian Riedel. The two travel the world to educate over 20,000 people annually on variety specific stemware. Acquisition of Subsidiaries & Expansion In 1979 Georg Riedel established Riedel Crystal of America in New York. He continued the company's expansion, opening Riedel offices in Canada (1992), Germany (1996), Japan (2000), the UK (2001), Australia (2007), and China and Japan (2011). In 2004, Georg Riedel bought the German-based F.X. Nachtmann, which included both the Nachtmann decorative and wine glassware brand and the Spiegelau beer and wine glassware brand. The three brands (Riedel, Nachtmann, Spiegelau) operate under ‚ÄúRiedel Glass Works‚Äù as one of the largest producers of fine glass in Europe., Press Release. Design Innovation Timeline * 1986: Developed the Vinum Series, the first variety-specific glassware made by machine. The Vinum Series expanded on the mouthblown Sommeliers Series, Riedel Crystal's first line of variety-specific glassware, and provided an affordable glassware alternative to a growing segment of wine-drinkers in the United States, which increased by 12% between 1980 and 1990., UC Davis. * 1989: Developed the Ouverture Series, positioned as the entry level variety-specific glass for wine drinkers who appreciate good, reasonably priced wine. * 2000: Developed the Vinum Extreme Series, Riedel's first collection of glasses designed specifically for New World wines. * 2007: Developed Tyrol, Riedel's first variety-specific glassware line with a stout, solid base. The collection was created to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Riedel family's Kufstein factory located in the Tirol province of Austria. * 2011: Developed the Escargot decanter, whose shape was inspired by a snail and was designed to double-decant wine, a Riedel-developed technology that achieves hours of decanting in a matter of minutes.

The site of the Acropolis would have been a low-lying island in the Morava, which has now been canalised. The Acropolis, was surrounded by a stone faced rampart, which would have been reached by a wooded bridge from the Outer bailey. The ramparts of the Acropolis enclosed an area of about 6 hectares.\\"Poulik J\\". 1963, 71. There are further extramural settlements surrounding the site. Settlement started possibly in the 8th century A. D. and continued until the demise of the Great Moravia Empire into the early part 10th century.)The excavations started 1955 and have progressed, almost continuously, until the present time.Pol√°ƒçek L. The Archaeology of Mikulƒçice Vol 1, pp. 6‚Äì7 Brno/Mikulƒçice, 2006 The Archaeopark is a branch of the Masaryk Museum in Hodonin http://www.masaryk.info/slovanske-hradiste-mikulcice/ and an archaeological research institute of Czech Academy of Science in Brno is also on the site. Mikulƒçice is currently being considered by Unesco for designation as a World Heritage Site. History of the excavations and research Avar type Mikulƒçice, hillfort maquette The excavations commenced in 1954, when Joseph Poul√≠k:cs:Josef Poul√≠k discovered the 2nd church in the curve of the rampart close to the western entrance of the acropolis. The church was surrounded by a cemetery of about 200 graves, including three burials with swords (nos 90, 265 and 280) and rich grave goods in other burials including spurs, buttons and earrings and elaborately ornamented belt fitting.\\"Pol√°ƒçek\\",2006, 4. Excavations of the adjacent ramparts showed that they were built in two phases. To the East another stone building was found, originally thought to be a church, but this interpretation is not now accepted. In 2011 the new Exhibition Pavilion was opened which incorporates the foundations of Church 2. =The 3rd basilica church= In 1957 excavations moved to the 3rd or basilica church. This doubled aisled church with an eastern apse and western atrium and narthex, is by far the largest church to have been found at Mikulƒçice. It may have served as a cathedral. It was surrounded by a graveyard of about 550 burials, some of which were very rich and included five burials with swords (nos 341, 375, 425, 438, 500 and 580). 580 was a particularly rich burial, placed in the Nave of the church, and is likely to have been a member of the ruling elite. It contained a sword, an axe, a dagger with decorated hilt, a bucket, belt fittings and a golden button. The body had been placed in a coffin made from forged iron panels.\\"Pol√°ƒçek\\",2006, 6.note 3. =The palace building= Mikulƒçice Iron Styli used for writing from the area of the Palace In 1958 the excavations moved to the palace building, to the west of Church 3. The palace had been built of stone, but the stone had been removed and the rectangular outline was preserved by the robber trenches.\\"Pol√°ƒçek\\",2006, 8 The building was 26 m long and 10 m wide, with a hall with a fireplace, at the west end and a smaller chamber at the east end.\\"Pol√°ƒçek\\",2006, 30 Some rich burials were found in the area and there was extensive evidence of metalworking including goldsmithing.\\"Pol√°ƒçek\\",2006, 8. There was some evidence of settlement that pre-dated the Greater Moravian Empire including a hoard of clay animal figurines. A number of iron styli for writing on wax tablet were discovered, suggesting that the building would have been used for administrative purposes. =The 4th and 11th churches= Also excavated in 1958 was the 4th church, which was almost rectangular with an apse. It was surrounded by about 100 burials. The graves were more poorly furnished, possibly reflecting Christianisation. In this cemetery there were more female burial than male. Close to this church was the largely destroyed 11th church, associated with a much richer cemetery. This included the burial (no. 821) of a six-year-old child with a cast bronze Avar horse head fitting, pottery vessels, a bucket and a bell.\\"Pol√°ƒçek\\",2006, 11, note 7. apsides rotunda =The 5th church and timber hall= Excavation of the 5th church followed in 1959, together with a timber hall building with wattle and daub infill panels. The fifth church had a rectangular nave with an almost rectangular chancel. Adjacent to the church, which was next to a roadway leading to a gateway in the rampart, was a metalworking workshop producing high quality goods.\\"Pol√°ƒçek\\",2006, 12‚Äì13. =The 6th church and river deposits= Mikulƒçice 6th, rotunda church, with two semi-circular apses. In 1960 excavation moved to an extramural settlement outside the rampart, which had been reached over the river course by a wooded bridge. Extensive remains of wood were recovered including a logboat. Also discovered was a circular stone rotunda church with two semi-circular apses.\\"Pol√°ƒçek\\",2006, 14‚Äì15. Also in 1961 the 8th church was excavated, which had a rectangular nave and chancel. The graves of surrounding cemetery were relatively poorly furnished, but in the nave of the church was found a large hoard ironwork, including axes, ploughshares sickles and iron ingots.\\"Pol√°ƒçek\\",2006, 14 notes 3‚Äì4. Also excavated was the bridge leading into the Outer bailey and the surrounding rampart. Finds from river-bed included another longboat, an archery bow, identified as being made from English yew, wicker fish-traps, ladles, spoons, buckets and vats. = Kostelisko Island and pre-Great Moravian finds in the outer bailey= In 1962, the extramural settlement, on a former island, known as Kostelisko, was excavated. The church was a round structure with four apses or niches set within the thickness of the walls of the rotunda. The church had survived into the 15th century, when it had been fortified during the Hussite wars. The cemetery associated with the church contained about 80 burials of the Great Moravian period, but also early medieval burials. The Moravian burials were very rich and contained a number of warrior burials with iron axes and spurs.\\"Pol√°ƒçek\\",2006, 16‚Äì17. In 1963‚Äì4 Excavation moved to investigating the interior of the Outer bailey and also church no 10, which was outside the ramparts and over the other side of the former river. In the outer bailey there were numerous wooden dwellings and a number of these building had rich graves cut through their floors. Below this level on the bedrock there was an ashy layer with Avar cast metalwork, suggesting an 8th-century settlement that predated the Great Moravian Empire. =Second and third phases of excavation programme= From 1964 to 1974 the second phase of excavation explored the outer bailey and oxbow lakes with preserved woodwork and bridges. This was followed by the third phase from 1975 to 1990, which concentrated on area excavation within the ramparts of the acropolis which ended previous work. Also between 1984 and 1990 the Kostelisko cemetery was excavated to the west of the 9th church. This contained approximately 415 graves which were accompanied by rich grave goods. In 1990 the yearly excavations were suspended. In 1993 a series of limited excavations, mainly to confirm the stratigraphy on the main sites were started. Also the Research Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences started rescue excavations in the vicinity of Mikulƒçice. These include the Pansk√© Cemetery, excavated in 1999‚Äì2000, when the railway to Prerov was widened. This cemetery revealed 128 burials from the 9th to the 11th centuries.\\"Pol√°ƒçek\\", 2006, III-II. =The stone churches= The stone used for the building of the church would have been quarried from the White Carpathian Mountains and brought a distance of about 8 kilometres. The churches were rendered on the outside and plastered internally. There is evidence for wall painting, which appears to have been mainly geometric designs in the 4th and 6th churches. The lack of evidence for roofing materials, makes it likely that the roofs were covered with split wooden tiles or shingles.\\"Polacek\\",2006, 28. The churches discovered at Mikulƒçice belong to the general tradition of Pre-Romanesque church architecture but the design and layout can be seen as being derived from various areas of Europe; from Byzantine architecture, Italian architecture, Germanic and Anglo-Saxon and Celtic of the British Isles. This mixture of styles is not surprising. Initially the bishop of Passau was charged with the Christian mission in mission in the area north of the Danube in the 8th century. In this he was assisted by Hiberno-Scottish Monks. The first Moravian ruler known by name, Mojmir I of Moravia was baptised in 831 by Reginhar, bishop of PassauPhilip Schaff. History of the Christian Church, Volume IV: Mediaeval Christianity. A.D. 590‚Äì1073.. CCEL. pp. 161‚Äì162. . Retrieved 15 June 2013. Mojmir was deposed by Rastislav in 846; as Mojmir was aligned with the Germans and the Catholic Church, Rastislav asked for support from the Byzantine Empire and aligned himself with the Eastern Orthodox Church. This was followed in 863 by the mission of Cyril and Methodius and for the remainder of the century there was a power struggle over the Christianization of Moravia. This is clearly reflected in the church architecture at Mikulƒçice. =The cemeteries and grave goods= Silver cross from the Basilica area, probably from a disturbed grave Over 2,500 inhumation burials, mainly in cemeteries of the Great Moravian period, have now been found at Mikulƒçice. The largest and richest of these cemeteries were those associated with the Basilica church (no. 3) and the Kostelisko site. The detailed study of the chronology and typology of grave goods is yet to be completed.\\"Pol√°ƒçek\\", 2006, 31. A degree of social stratigraphy can be distinguished in the with the √©lite warrior burials who are accompanied by their swords and the horse-men who are equipped with gilded bronze spurs and battle axes. Mikulƒçice Globular buttons orgombik Very typical of Great Moravian metalworking is the hollow globular metal buttons or gombik that were used, often in pairs, to hold a cloak or garment around the neck, They occur with both male and female burials and were almost certainly made in local workshops.\\"Pol√°ƒçek\\",2006, 6‚Äì7, noe and fig.6. =See also= Church of St. Margaret of Antioch, Kopƒçany which lies c 2 km to the east and dates to the 9th century A.D. Comparable sites to Mikulƒçice in Moravia Map showing Mikulƒçice at the centre of the Greater Moravian Empire Modr√° Archeopark or Skanzen is a reconstruction of a village of the Great Moravian Empire, drawn from examples of buildings with have been excavated on neighbouring sites in the valley of the Morava. Considerable care has been taken to use original building techniques in the re-constructions. The Archaeopark lies to the south of Modr√° village and immediately to the south of the foundations of the Great Moravian church, which was uncovered Jan Nevƒõ≈ôil (1911) and by V Hruby (1935‚Äì1936).J Poulik pg 63‚Äì66 The Church at Modra. The church was surrounded by 37 burials, which were studied by J Cibulka in 1958. A replica of the stone church was built close to the original foundations in 1998‚Äì2000. The site is very close to the Velehrad monastery, which is associated with Saints Cyril and Methodius and to the west of Uhersk√© Hradi≈°tƒõ and Star√© Mƒõsto. Reconstructed gateway at Modr√° The Archaeopark is partly surrounded by a wooden box framed rampart and the park is entered through a wooden framed gateway. Inside the enclosure there are reconstructions of the Palace (presumably based on that at Miculcice), Houses, and sunken floored buildings, used as workshops. There are stalls and byres for the animal on the site.

Originating from a tropical wave, the system first became a tropical depression late on September 1 while situated over the Bay of Campeche. Dolly struggled against strong wind shear for the duration of its existence. The large system featured multiple circulations, sometimes becoming a new dominant center and other times simply rotating around a mean vortex. As a result, multiple center relocations occurred along its general west-northwest track. Dolly eventually made landfall in Tamaulipas on September 3 before degenerating into a remnant low. The system subsequently dissipated the following day. Prior to Dolly's landfall, schools suspended classes and officials opened shelters across Tamaulipas and Veracruz. The storm produced widespread moderate to heavy rain in Mexico, with accumulations peaking at in La Encantada, Tamaulipas. Subsequent flooding caused damage amounting to 290.5 million pesos (US$22.2 million). One fatality was indirectly attributed to the storm. Moisture from Dolly also brought scattered storms to southern Texas. Meteorological history On August 19, 2014, a tropical wave emerged off the west coast of Africa. The system traversed the Atlantic over the next week with no signs of development. Convection finally increased once the wave entered the Caribbean Sea on August 27; however, it was not until August 30 when interaction with a Kelvin wave spurred organization. An area of low pressure consolidated within the system as it crossed the Yucat√°n Peninsula on August 31. Formation of a banding feature along the southeastern portion of the circulation on September 1 marked the system's transition into a tropical depression by 18:00 UTC while over the Bay of Campeche. Although situated over warm waters of , strong wind shear created an unfavorable environment and hindered intensification. During this formative stage, the depression tracked northward as its center relocated before turning to the northwest and later west. It was uncertain if a closed circulation truly existed due to conflicting data and the depression could have remained a trough until the afternoon of September 2. Early on September 2, the depression acquired gale- force winds and became the fourth tropical storm of the 2014 season; accordingly, it was assigned the name Dolly at this time. A tight pressure gradient between Dolly and a ridge over the Gulf of Mexico created a large area of tropical storm winds along the east side of the cyclone. Data Hurricane Hunters investigating the system indicate that Dolly achieved its peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) around 12:00 UTC. Winds up to 70 mph (110 km/h) were found within the deep convection to the storm's east but considered to be inflated by heavy rains and thus not representative of its actual strength. Slight weakening took place shortly thereafter as the center relocated to the south. During this relocation, multiple circulations were observed rotating around a mean position with yet another vortex located well to the southeast. Around 01:00 UTC on September 3, Dolly's pressure fell to 1000 mbar (hPa; 29.53 inHg) marking the storm's peak intensity. Maintaining a due west course, Dolly made landfall just south of Tampico at 04:00 UTC with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). Radar observations depicted a secondary center to the north that moved ashore near Altamira an hour later. Once onshore, Dolly's circulation separated from all remaining convection and the storm degenerated into a remnant low later that day. The system subsequently dissipated early on September 4. Preparations and impact Tropical Storms Norbert (left) and Dolly (right) straddling both coasts of Mexico at 17:30 UTC on September 2 The remnants of Dolly brought widespread moisture to southern Texas by September 5\\\\. Scattered thunderstorms developed across the region, with some producing damaging winds. More than of rain fell in Brownsville, causing street flooding. Dozens of Mexican fishing vessels sought refuge in the Port of Brownsville; however, two ran aground in the shipping channel and a third on South Padre Island. The United States Coast Guard attributed the mishaps to the sudden influx of numerous ships. Southerly flow from Hurricane Norbert over the Pacific brought moisture from Dolly over the Southwestern United States, resulting in possible life-threatening flash flooding. =Mexico= Coinciding with the first advisory on Tropical Depression Five late on September 1, the Government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning for areas between Tuxpan and La Pesca. This was soon expanded northward to include areas between La Pesca and . Public schools and the Autonomous University of Tamaulipas suspended classes on September 2 and 3 in Tamaulipas and Veracruz. Officials opened 53 shelters for potential evacuees. Pemex temporarily suspended operations of two oil production plants. Between September 1‚Äì4, Dolly brought widespread heavy rains to Mexico. Accumulations of were common across the states of Hidalgo, Nuevo Le√≥n, San Luis Potos√≠, Tamaulipas, and Veracruz, with a peak value of in La Encantada, Tamaulipas. Flooding in Tamaulipas prompted residents to evacuate and utilize public shelters. A roof collapse at a ballpark injured two people. Losses from heavy rain in El Mante reached 7 million pesos (US$535,000), prompting a state of emergency. Total damage in the state amounted to 290.5 million pesos (US$22.2 million). Some residences temporarily lost power across Tamaulipas. Road collapses in Veracruz City damaged ten homes and four cars. One of these further threatened 40 homes in Infonavit Buena Vista within the city. A rockslide occurred in the remote community of El Tecomate. Flooding in Guanajuato caused notable disruptions and some damage. No observations of sustained tropical storm-force winds were received, though a gust of was observed in Barra del Tordo. Accordingly, wind damage was limited to Cabo Rojo. One death was indirectly attributed to Dolly.

She was one of the leaders of the German branch of the International Abolitionist Federation, which sought to abolish regulations and criminal laws directed against prostitutes, and proposed instead to eliminate prostitution through moral education of young men and women, and through providing alternative ways by which young women could earn a living. Pappritz became one of the most prominent members of the women's movement in Germany. Early years Anna Pappritz was born in Radach, Drossen, Neumark on 9 May 1861 to a Protestant family from Dresden. Her father was a landowner, and she grew up on the Radach estate at Drossen. She was the only girl in the family, but had three brothers who were educated at the Klosterschule in Rossleben and then went to university. Anna was given sufficient education at home by governesses and the local pastor for a future career as a wife and mother. As a girl she was interested in poetry. Her father died in 1877. At the age of nineteen she suffered serious injuries in a riding accident, and had to undergo surgery in a gynecological clinic in Berlin. She never fully recovered from the accident, and she was told she would have to live a quiet and secluded life. In 1884 Anna Pappritz and her mother moved to Berlin, where she took private lessons in philosophy, history and literature. In the 1890s she published several books of short stories and three novels. Her first work was a collection of short stories From the mountains of Tyrol (1893). She next published the novel Prejudices (1894), which dealt with the prejudices of her social class in their outlook on life and was based on her own experience. She was a student of Georg Simmel, and she and Simmel often contributed to the Freie B√ºhne theatrical review. Activist A major turning point in Pappritz's life came in 1895 when she traveled to England for health reasons. There she learned of the existence of prostitution and its regulation by the state, and also of the women's movement. After her return to Berlin she became involved in the German women's movement, attended lectures of the Women's Welfare Association that Minna Cauer had established in 1888, and subscribed to Cauer's magazine Die Frauenbewegung (The Women's Movement). In 1898 Pappritz learned from an article by Cauer about the London-based International Abolitionist Federation (IAF). The IAF had been founded by Josephine Butler in England, who chose the term \\"abolitionism\\" to refer to freeing prostitutes from forced registration and testing for venereal diseases. Pappritz immediately became involved in the campaign for abolition of regulation of prostitution. In 1899 Pappritz met Butler in person at the International Women's Congress in London. That year she founded and became chairperson of the Berlin branch of the IAF. Anna Pappritz and Katharina Scheven became the two most influential leaders of the German branch of the IAF (Deutzcher Zweig IAF, DZIAF). From 1902 to 1914 Pappritz worked with Scheven as editor of the DZIAF magazine Der Abolitionist. After the 1905 the controversy about the New Ethic split the DZIAF. The moderates led by Scheven and Pappritz further consolidated their control. Some of the radicals turned to the cause of suffrage, and others to the sex-reform movement. Pappritz joined the League of German Women's Associations (Bund Deutscher Frauenvereine: BDF) and was secretary from 1907 to 1914. She belonged to the board of directors of the German Society for Combating Venereal Diseases (DGBG) from 1902. Pappritz met with the Prussian minister of the interior in 1907, and as a result a circular was issued to the police to treat suspected prostitutes more leniently and to ensure that advice or free treatment of sexually transmitted diseases was available. However, the pre-war morality campaign was largely ineffective. Pappritz described a draft of a new criminal code published in 1909 as expressing \\"unconscious male sexual egotism\\" and said she feared \\"our 25 years of work has been for nothing.\\" Fresh drafts were issued, but the project to revise the code was abandoned with the outbreak of World War I (1914‚Äì18). In the fall of 1911 a new Prussian law on cremation was reported, which contained a provision that female corpses must be examined to determine if they were virgin. This caused outrage among the women of Berlin. Pappritz said the experts could not produce any valid reason for this violation of this most intimate and private aspect of a woman's life, at a time when the dead woman was helpless and had no way to defend her reputation. Pappritz organized an emergency IAF meeting to protest the law, which had a huge turnout and was followed by petitions. By early January 1912 the Prussian secretary of the interior had repealed the offending clause, but the effect of the scandal was to increase agitation for suffrage in the women's press. Pappitz continued to play a central role in the movement for reform of prostitution during the Weimar Republic (1919‚Äì33). This culminated in the 1927 Law to Combat Venereal Disease, which abolished state regulation of prostitution. She remained head of the Berlin chapter of the IAF, later called the League for Protection of Women and Youth (Bund f√ºr Frauen- und Jugendschutz) until it was dissolved in 1933, despite suffering from ongoing health problems. Anna Pappritz died in Radach on 8 July 1939 at the age of seventy-eight. Views =Social change= The BDF took the position that capitalist consumerism and advances in production techniques had removed the ability of middle-class women, particularly single women, to contribute to the economy of the home. Pappritz wrote, \\"the living conditions of the female youth have changed enormously in the last fifty years. In earlier times, the largest majority of girls out of school stayed as daughters of the house in the protection of their parent's house, where they found occupation as helpers to their mothers until they created their own household by marriage... Now many of those chores ... have moved into the factories, and thus the female youth are pushed from the protection of the parents' house into independent employment. =Prostitution= There was fierce debate among feminists in Germany about how to handle prostitution, seen as the source of venereal diseases and thus a major health problem. Helene St√∂cker (1869‚Äì1943) thought sexual freedom for women would remove demand. Hanna Bieber-B√∂hm (1851‚Äì1910) favored stronger legal action by the state against the clients of prostitutes. Pappritz thought the solution was moral education of young people and encouragement of abstinence outside marriage. Pappritz felt concern for the prostitute as an exploited woman, but despised prostitution as an institution. She had no sympathy for registered prostitutes who considered themselves to be workers providing a useful service. In a 1903 article in the BDF journal Pappritz argued that regulation of prostitution meant the state was declaring that some people were a target for other people's diversion. They were second-class beings, or slaves. Pappritz said that regulators were \\"only motivated by the desire to secure 'healthy goods' for the young men of their own circles, for propertied, educated men.\\" In 1907 Pappritz published a collection of case studies of women in the sex trade, with commentary, in which she concluded that the idea of \\"born whores\\" was completely wrong, and in almost all cases women were driven to prostitution by economic necessity. She portrayed the vice squad as serving the interests of male clients, while punishing prostitutes but making no effort to help them. In 1909 Pappritz and Scheven issued a pamphlet giving the DZIAF position on criminal law reform. They wrote that, \\"prostitution is primarily called forth by demand from the side of men, and that it is often social distress that forces women to meet this demand with the corresponding supply.\\" The solution, which was at odds with the leaders of the men's morality movement, was legislation that protected women workers and \\"organization of women workers, in order to secure for them a living wage, and better access for women to education and vocational training.\\" They stated that regulation of prostitution was an unjustified restriction of civil liberty, and was unjust in affecting only the woman and not her client. Criminalization would also be unjust in punishing only the woman, and letting the man go free. The state should be involved in cases such as coercion, abuse of minors, procuring and aggressive soliciting, but otherwise sex was a private matter and state interference would be an outrageous violation of individual freedom. Concerned about the spread of venereal disease, during World War I the military organized its own brothels with \\"safe and clean\\" women, and cracked down on illegal prostitution. Even Pappritz agreed that the growing numbers of informal prostitutes were a grave threat to the welfare of soldiers, and therefore to the nation. =Other views= Abstinence was a key part of the abolitionist belief. At the DGBG conference in 1903 Pappritz described at length expert medical opinion that there were no physical or psychological risks to those who abstained from sexual activity. Pappritz was in favor of education for youth of both sexes, teaching abstinence until marriage. She proposed special homes or programs for vulnerable young women to provide a moral education and train them for work in domestic service, religious work or the textile industry. She said, \\"Every girl longs one day to find the man with whom she can devote her love and trust, who will become her refuge and support for life. Her own household, husband and children are not only the goal of each girl's desires, but they are also her natural life's work.\\" However, \\"not every girl's fate turns in such a way that it leads to a happy marriage.\\" Pappritz supported eugenics. In 1906 she said that \\"those with hereditary diseases (above all venereal diseases) [should] voluntarily renounce having progeny. She wrote in 1913, \\"raising a healthy, numerous, mentally and morally fit progeny can only be achieved through the work of intellectually and morally mature, physically healthy mothers conscious of their responsibility.\\" She thought that creating such women was \\"the foremost goal of the women's movement.\\" At the time, contraception was thought by most Christians to be deeply immoral. The abolitionists were ambivalent. In 1906 Pappritz supported \\"regulation\\" of births so a mother could space them out by at least two years, but in 1911 an article in the Abolitionist criticized contraception as egotistical, weakening the nation demographically and therefore militarily. Pappritz wanted a ban on \\"all places of entertainment that are nothing more than veiled brothels.\\" This included indecent displays and performances with no artistic value. In 1908 the Abolitionist ran a denunciation by a Protestant pastor of \\"immoral literature\\". However, Pappritz strongly opposed efforts by morality campaigners to tighten up censorship legislation, saying they wanted to censor everything that was politically or religiously liberal. She thought the drive for censorship revealed \\"inner unchasteness\\" that made them \\"suspect every form of nudity and naturalness of being indecent.\\" Pappritz, Helene Lange (1848‚Äì1930) and Gertrud B√§umer (1873‚Äì1954) vigorously opposed St√∂cker and the \\"New Ethic\\" of sexual morality and sexual freedom for women outside of marriage. She worked hard to exclude St√∂cker's League for the Protection of Mothers from the feminist mainstream, saying it added nothing new either in theory of practice. Pappritz considered homosexuality \\"reprehensible, repulsive and disgusting\\", but also believed that \\"private relationships between adults are not subject to the criminal law.\\" The BDF passed a resolution saying \\"sexual aberrations without injury to legal rights of third persons must remain unpunished.\\" Pappritz opposed the extension of laws on homosexuality, which was illegal between men, to also include women. Although she denounced the depravity of lust, she pointed out that penetration was not possible between women. This was in line with conventional ideas of the time about the sexual innocence of women. She was more concerned with the greater ills of child abuse, pimping, seduction and the egotistic demands of husbands. However, she made it clear that \\"the sin, when practiced by women, is just as reprehensible, unpleasant, and revolting as when it is committed by men.\\" Publications Pappritz wrote a number of short stories or novels in the 1890s. *Aus d.

He studied Social and Economic Communication at the Berlin University of the Arts and Design Thinking at the HPI School of Design Thinking. He was awarded the Order of Merit of Germany and is an Ashoka Fellow.  Early Life  Krauthausen grew up in Berlin and attended one of the first inclusive schools as a child. He claims that going to this school is what laid the foundation stone for his career. After he finished school, Krauthausen decided to study social and business communication, which he says gave him a new perspective on life as a person with a disability. Krauthausen has said that throughout his life, he never wanted to think much about his disability. His parents always tried to make him play with other kids who were disabled, but he thought this was weird. However, when he entered college and was the only person with a disability, he changed his view. He missed the contact he had with his peer group. This is when he decided to start his nonprofit.  Career  Together with his cousin, Jan, he founded the nonprofit organisation Sozialhelden, which translates to social heroes, in 2004. He works alongside his colleague, Svenja Heinecke, on projects to make Germany and the rest of the world accessible. The organisation develops projects which address social issues and offer practical solutions in a spirit of diversity and inclusion. Their fundraising project Pfandtastisch helfen, which raises funds for other nonprofit organisations through donated bottle recycling receipts, received the Startsocial prize from Chancellor Angela Merkel in 2008. In 2010, Wheelmap.org, a crowdsourced online map for finding and marking wheelchair accessible places was launched by Sozialhelden. The map, which is available in 22 languages, is based on OpenStreetMap and operates under a Creative-Commons license. Wheelmap has worked with German phonebook provider, \\"Gelbe Seiten\\" to offer accessibility information about places that were already in the book. Krauthausen and his colleagues also invented Accessibility Cloud, a cloud that allows data on accessibility to be easily transferred to international organizations with the same goal. The overall goal of Krauthausen's nonprofit is \\"Disability Mainstreaming\\". In addition to his work for Sozialhelden Ra√∫l Krauthausen co-founded Selfpedia.de in 2013, an online self-help community for questions and advice pertaining to life with a disability. Ra√∫l Krauthausen is a frequent guest on talk shows and a popular interview partner for journalists regarding topics related to disability rights, accessibility and inclusion. In October 2016 Krauthausen went undercover in a German home for people with disabilities. He shaved his beard, cut his hair and even got rid of his signature hat. For five days he lived in the home and uncovered some harsh truths about the complete loss of independence that comes with being a disabled person in a care home. Krauthausen's undercover investigation was discussed by German politicians and decision-makers but unfortunately didn't lead to a change in legislation. One of the newest Sozialhelden projects is Leidmedien.de, an online platform for journalists and others whose work involves the portrayal of people with disabilities. Through advocacy, articles, workshops and informational materials Leidmedien.de offers perspectives on life with a disability which steer away from stereotypes and clich√©s. In 2014 Ra√∫l Krauthausen developed a printable 3D mini-ramp which can be used to overcome sidewalk curbs in a wheelchair. Ra√∫l Krauthausen has osteogenesis imperfecta, also known as brittle bone disease, and uses a wheelchair. Krauthausen sees the Americans with Disability Act as a role model that he thinks Germany should follow. He believes that Germany doesn't score high in terms of accessibility in relation to other European countries.  Personal Life  Krauthausen's partner is also disabled. Krauthausen says that he is fine with children being curious and asking him questions about his disability, but he is much more strict when it comes to adults and parents.

It is famous for being impregnable and playing a key role in defending the castle in the winter of 1615. Later, it was forcefully destroyed despite being exempt from the reconciliation condition. Background Osaka castle was built on the Uemachi plateau enclosed by the Yodo River and the Yamato River. It was well fortified to the north but weakly guarded to the southern Tenn≈çji plateau. Sanada Yukimura build the fortification in front of the outer moat, at the Kuruwa port, at the southeastern Hirano-guchi (Âπ≥ÈáéÂè£) gate and beside the Kuromon-guchi (ÈªíÈñÄÂè£) gate. Due to its position, Sanada Maru became an obstacle to the main Tokugawa force during the Siege of Osaka. By 1615, after its destruction, the tower keep era had reached its peak and construction declined with the establishment of the Pax Tokugawa, which lasted until the Meiji period in the late 19th century. History In 1614, Osaka castle, the stronghold of the Toyotomi clan, represented the last obstacle to Japan's unification under the Tokugawa hegemony. Toyotomi Hideyori appointed Sanada Yukimura as the garrison commander due to his experience opposing Ieyasu's army in his castle at Ueda during the Sekigahara campaign. At that time the castle had two moats, which still exist, and Hideyori's engineers created an outer moat by cutting a channel between the canal that existed to the west and the Nekoma stream which flowed from south to north on the eastern side. The following campaign and battle is often referred to as the last stand of the samurai before the Tokugawa shogunate reformed the ways of the samurai including prohibiting practices like headhunting. Samurai: Japan's Way of the Warrior Tom O'Neill, National Geographic Magazine, December, 2003 The attack on Sanada Maru began on December 4. Yukimura and about 6-7,000 men defended Sanada Maru against Tokugawa forces of approximately 10-30,000 men. The Tokugawa forces were repeatedly repelled, and Sanada's troops launched a number of counterattacks, even breaking through the siege lines. By December 18, all the outlying forts and waterways had fallen but the Sanada Maru proved impregnable. As a stockade had been built, Ieyasu began to starve out the huge castle. However, supplies were sufficient to feed everyone for several years. Ieyasu then resorted to artillery bombardment. Sakers fired from the north, no less than 300 culverins blasted from the south, and more culverins firing from the north and the east were able to do considerable damage. While long-range culverins kept up a bombardment, miners began digging in an attempt to weaken the walls. As there were still uncommitted clans who might be tempted to attack the Tokugawa from the rear, time was on the side of Hideyori. Ieyasu used the steadily improving bombardment to pressure for peace negotiation. Hideyori accepted a peace formula whereby the Tokugawa army would withdraw and Osaka castle would remain in Hideyori's hand under the provision of no further \\"rebellion\\" against the Tokugawa Sh≈çgun. Many Tokugawa troops did not leave but instead worked to fill in the outer moat. Hideyori protested but by the time, a week later, Ieyasu agreed that these had indeed not been included in the peace agreement the outer moat had ceased to exist, and his men were turning to the second moat. Location The place where Sanada Maru was located is north of the Sanadayama Park. It was originally a little hill which was recessed in the center. Today it is a small underdeveloped plot of land in an urbanized area. A partial moat and bridge are present. Just south of it is Sanada High School. Structure Sanada Maru was an earthwork barbican with a simple two-storey wooden wall on top with firing platforms augmented with other simple means of defense like palisades. A dry moat offered additional defence. Cannons were placed along the walls, together with firebomb-projecting mangonels. Defended by the Sanada samurai clan it may be classified as a yagura, although only in the spirit rather than technical accuracy. As essentially a temporary structure it was not copied elsewhere. Film, television, and theatrical adaptations Sanada Maru has appeared in part or in full for different media including stage, screen and radio.

He is also a philanthropist and is active in the revitalization of Historic Route 66. In 2005, Okura purchased the town of Amboy, California, which is located along Route 66. The corporate headquarters for the Juan Pollo chain now sits on the original location of the first McDonald's restaurant where Okura created and hosts a museum, preserving artifacts and memorabilia about the landmark. Early life Okura is a third- generation (or sansei) Japanese American, born in Wilmington, California in 1951. His first full-time job was with Burger King in 1970, which led to managerial positions in the chain as well as Del Taco, and ultimately founding his own Mexican-influenced chicken rotisserie chain. In 1981, while working for Del Taco in Carson, an El Pollo Loco opened near him. At the time El Pollo Loco was a new char-broiled Mexican chicken chain. Okura tried the restaurant and was impressed with the food and the simplicity of its operations and began to investigate opening his own restaurant. Juan Pollo Okura's uncle initially invested in his idea to open a restaurant and made Okura aware of a restaurant location in a shopping mall he owned in Ontario, California. This location would become the first location for his restaurant. With Armando Parra, the creator of the recipe of Juan polle who grew up in an area of Chihuahua, Mexico where rotisserie chicken restaurants are popular, Okura looked into opening the restaurant. However, Parra told Okura the restaurant was not big enough for the grills and suggested rotisserie cooking instead. The first location opened in January 1984. Sales were initially modest, but it wasn't until the opening of the chain's second location in 1986 that became popular, due to a large part because of a food review written by Norman Baffry, a food critic for The San Bernardino Sun. There are now a total of 26 Juan Pollo locations in Southern California, most of them in the Inland Empire. Okura has said he plans on turning Juan Pollo into a national and ultimately, an international chain. Juan Pollo hosts an annual Veteran's Day Parade and Car Show in front of corporate headquarters in San Bernardino and the company has been one of the main toy contributors for the annual Christmas toy give away in the city. In April 2014, Okura's book about his experiences in fast food, founding Juan Pollo and scaling his chain to its current size was released, Albert Okura: The Chicken Man with a 50 Year Plan. Route 66 restoration Okura purchased the location of the original McDonald's restaurant opened by Dick and Mac McDonald in 1948 for $135,000, which was being foreclosed on in 1998. The restaurant, located in San Bernardino, California, had been demolished, but Okura recognized the property and moved his corporate headquarters to the site, which he described as \\"destiny.\\" He also opened an unofficial McDonald's museum next to his headquarters. In addition, in 2005 he bought the town of Amboy, California, located on Route 66, for $425,000. Okura's plans include improvements for tourists interested in and traveling along the highway and building a museum. He reopened the gas station in 2008, after $100,000 worth of renovations to the building housing the gas station, diner, and caf√©. Counting on the traffic from a renewed interest in traveling Route 66, the gas station is stocked with candy and souvenirs.

Route The route begins in Muldersdrift (north of Krugersdorp), in the Mogale City Local Municipality, at a junction with the N14 National Route. It parallels the N14 in a northeasterly direction (while being on the southern side of the N14) and meets the M5 Road of Johannesburg (Beyers Naude Drive), which connects to Randburg. It is co-signed with the M5 south-east up to the next junction, where it becomes its own road northeast. It proceeds to form a junction with the R512 Road (Malibongwe Drive) south of Lanseria International Airport. The R512 also connects to Randburg in the south-east. Soon after meeting the R512, it meets the R552 Road (Cedar Road), which connects to Fourways and Sandton. The R114 proceeds to enter the township of Diepsloot in the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality.

Produced in partnership between Pemberley Digital and PBS Digital Studios, the show is a modern adaptation of Frankenstein by Mary Shelley, replacing the eponymous character with Victoria Frankenstein, a medical student near graduation. The show, which represents PBS Digital's first foray into scripted content, was created by Bernie Su, Brett Register, and Lon Harris. It ran on YouTube from August 19 through October 31, 2014, and was generally well-received by critics. Synopsis Frankenstein, MD is presented as an educational webseries presented by medical students (and later doctors) Victoria Frankenstein and Iggy DeLacey from the fictional Engle State University. Each episode generally consists of Frankenstein experimenting with cutting-edge medical technologies or theories, often using DeLacey or her childhood friends Eli Lavenza and Rory Clerval as subjects. Dr. Abraham Waldman serves as an adviser to Frankenstein, usually acting as a foil and reminding her of the impracticality or perceived impossibility of her experiments and theories. Partway through the series, the show's unseen camera operator and editor, Robert Walton, dies from a fall while adventuring in Alaska, where his body is left partially preserved in the snow. Frankenstein becomes distraught and attempts to revive Walton's corpse with DeLacey's help in secret using the medical technologies she had expounded upon earlier in the show. The attempt is successful, but the revived creature is startled by light and escapes the lab, running into the woods. Later, as Frankenstein and Lavenza are trying to locate the creature from her father's basement, Clerval is killed mysteriously while camping. The creature confronts Frankenstein and asks her to make him a friend. She grows morally opposed to the idea of recreating her experiment and agrees to run off to Costa Rica with Lavenza after he confesses his love to her. The creature returns to her makeshift lab and kills Lavenza in anger after he tries to stop it from hurting Frankenstein. Production Frankenstein, MD was announced in May 2014, in a partnership between PBS Digital Studios, the online arm of the American Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), and Pemberley Digital whose previous webseries included The Lizzie Bennet Diaries (an adaptation of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice) and Emma Approved (based on Austen's Emma). The show is a transmedia adaptation of Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus by Mary Shelley that reimagines the story's male protagonist Victor Frankenstein as a female student of medicine named Victoria Frankenstein. The show is PBS Digital's first scripted program, though it also includes educational elements. According to its writers, Frankenstein, MDs narrative fills a two- year gap left by Shelley's source text between Victor Frankenstein's time at medical school and his reappearance as a mad scientist. The original Frankenstein is driven to insanity by his ostracization and Frankenstein, MD attempted to recontextualize this concept by gender-swapping its lead. Victoria Frankenstein is a medical student and later doctor grappling with institutional sexism in what the creators called the \\"sort of a male-dominated profession\\" of medicine. The show is produced by Bernie Su who was previously responsible for Pemberley Digital's other webseries. Filmed at YouTube's Space LA production studio, it premiered on the site on August 19, 2014. Prior to the show's premiere, accounts on social media for various characters in the show were created, allowing viewers to interact with Frankensteins protagonists. Joe Hanson, host of PBS Digital's It's Okay To Be Smart, acts as the show's science consultant. In early episodes of the show, Frankenstein neglected to wear gloves during her experiments which Su claimed was because, \\"real science and real-life procedures aren't sexy for entertainment\\". During its run, fans noticed this and called the show out for the error; in later episodes she is depicted with gloves on for all of her scientific work. The first season of the show concluded after 24 five- to eight-minute episodes on October 31, 2014. Episodes of Frankenstein, MD are directed by Brett Register, executive produced by Su, and produced by Tracy Bitterolf with consulting producer by Frederick Kim. Register and Lon Harris serve as showrunners with the latter also working as head writer. Other writers include Kim, Danielle Evenson, and Taylor Brogan. The series's cinematographer is Matt Ryan. Cast and characters * Victoria Frankenstein (Anna Lore) ‚Äì Analogous to Victor Frankenstein, she is a medical student described by The New York Observer as \\"smart, strong willed and filled with both an insatiable desire to learn about science and an unwavering belief in the field itself.\\" According to Register, Frankenstein's character was not fully understood by the creators of the show until after Lore was cast on July 23, 2014. She helped them view the role as \\"this very confident but almost introverted character\\". * Ludwig \\"Iggy\\" DeLacey (Steve Zaragoza) ‚Äì Analogous to Igor, he is Frankenstein's fellow student and co-host of her show. Zaragoza mailed an audition tape to the show's producers before in-person auditions began which \\"set the bar for the character of Iggy\\" according to Register. * Dr. Abraham Waldman (Kevin Rock) ‚Äì Analogous to M. Waldman, he serves as a mentor to Frankenstein. * Eli Lavenza (Brendan Bradley) ‚Äì Analogous to Elizabeth Lavenza, he is one of Frankenstein's close friends. * Rory Clerval (Sara Fletcher) ‚Äì Analogous to Henry Clerval, she is another of Frankenstein's close friends. * Robert Walton / The Creature (Evan Strand) ‚Äì A combination of both Robert Walton and Frankenstein's monster from the novel, Walton is the camera operator for Frankenstein's vlog. He dies and is reanimated by her experiments. Lon Harris, a producer and writer of the series, chose Strand to perform The Creature because Strand's performance was very different from Boris Karloff's, and Tracy Bitterolf, a producer, praised Strand's control of his body. Strand described his performance as being inspired by a five-year-old child, a silverback gorilla, and a rhinoceros.

Nicole Vranjican wrote in The New York Observer that the show \\"has a definite juvenile feel and is likely best suited for scientifically curious Jr. High students\\" and that its message \\"that being smart is cool...sets a standard for television that more TV shows should get behind\\". After viewing the first six episodes, Atiya Abbas noted in Vox Magazine that \\"[t]he series is light- hearted compared to the dark subject of the novel\\". On Hypable, Marama Whyte called the show \\"highly comedic\\" and noted its high production value and Anna Lore's \\"standout performance\\" as positive aspects.

An active Unionist, in 1867 Madison was president of the Austin chapter of the Union League. He was an active participant in Reconstruction, and served as an assistant at the Texas Constitutional Convention of 1868‚Äì69.

It accepts male and female members and has chapters in Ghent, Leuven, Antwerp, Brussels, Aalst and Sint-Katelijne-Waver. Previously KVHV had chapters in Kortrijk, Ostend, and Mechelen. History In Belgium in the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, the dominant language for education, literature and politics was French as this was the language of the elites at the time. The majority of the people in Flanders, the northern part of the country, spoke Dutch. The northern part was financially helped by the southern to develop. In the second half of the 19th century a movement started that sought to elevate the status of Dutch in society and emancipate the Flemish people. At the two universities in Flanders (the Catholic University of Leuven and the State University of Ghent) Flemish students started to organize themselves in societies. The name KVHV was first used by Flemish students in 1911, when the Vlaams Verbond (Flemish Union) was banned by the Catholic University of Leuven. The name was permanently adopted in 1923. At the same time the dominant Flemish society in Ghent, Rodenbach's Vrienden, also changed its name to KVHV. Organisation The KVHV has four general principles, must be accepted by all members: * Catholic: The KVHV is a Roman Catholic organisation. Members have a conservative ideology. * Flemish: the KVHV is the dominant Flemish nationalist student society together with the NSV. * Student society: The KVHV is the publisher of the Studentencodex, a book containing songs and the rules and traditions of Flemish student societies. The KVHV itself is organised according to these rules. The most visible expression of this is the ribbon and cap worn by all members in the colors of the society. * 'Levensbond' or bond for life: The membership of the KVHV not only consists of students, but also all alumni. All members have to strictly follow these rules and principles.

He was a Democratic-Republican, who opposed allowing slavery in the new state. Biography James Grubb was born in 1771 at Little Britain in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. His great grandfather had emigrated from England about a century before, and his father was a veteran of the French and Indian War. Grubb settled in Ross County in the Northwest Territory, and was named a Justice of the Peace in 1799 by Governor Arthur St. Clair. He was prominent among those Democratic-Republicans who pushed for statehood and for the removal of St. Clair. In 1802, elections were held in each county of the territory that would become Ohio for delegates to a constitutional convention to write a constitution for the new state, which would be submitted to the US Congress. Grubb ran for a seat on this commission, and submitted a letter to the Chillicothe newspaper on September 6, 1802, which stated: \\"As to the introduction of slavery, I must confess that I am not so great a Federalist or Aristocrat as to wish its admission. Such a pernicious scheme ought to be guarded against in a particular manner, as I conceive it bad policy and the principle cannot be advocated by any person of humane or republican sentiments.\\" Grubb won election to the convention, which met from November 1 to 29, 1802. At the convention he voted against allowing slavery, but opposed equal civil rights for black men. Grubb ran for the Ohio House of Representatives in January and October 1803, but lost both times. At the time he died, he lived in the village of Westfall, which was then in Ross County, but is now in Wayne Township, Pickaway County, Ohio. Grubb died at Chillicothe on January 30, 1806, after a short illness. He never married.

It covers an area of . The site became a quasi-national geopark on April 23, 2012 (provisional name: Zhangye Danxia Geopark). It was formally designated as \\"Zhangye National Geopark\\" by the Ministry of Land and Resources on June 16, 2016 after it has passed the on-site acceptance test. Known for its colorful rock formations, it has been voted by Chinese media outlets as one of the most beautiful landforms in China. Location Layers in the geopark The park is located in the northern foothills of the Qilian Mountains, in the counties of Linze and Sunan, which are under the administration of the prefecture-level city of Zhangye, Gansu province. The main areas of Danxia landform are in Kangle and Baiyin townships. The core area of the park, Linze Danxia Scenic Area, is located west of downtown Zhangye and south of the seat of Linze County. It is the most developed and most visited part of the park. A second scenic area, Binggou (), located on the north bank of Liyuan River (), was officially inaugurated on 3 August 2014. Binggou covers an area of , and its elevation ranges from 1,500 to 2,500 meters above sea level. A third area, Sunan Danxia Scenic Area, is located in Ganjun, south of Linze. Landscape Landscape of Zhangye National Geopark Zhangye Danxia is known for the unusual colours of the rocks, which are smooth, sharp and several hundred meters tall. They are the result of deposits of sandstone and other minerals that occurred over 24 million years. The result (similar to a layer cake), was tilted by the action of the same tectonic plates responsible for creating parts of the Himalayan mountains. Wind, rain, and time then sculpted extraordinary shapes, including towers, pillars, and ravines, with varying colours, patterns, and sizes. Media and tourism In 2005, Zhangye Danxia was voted by a panel of reporters from 34 major media outlets as one of the most beautiful Danxia landform areas in China. In 2009, Chinese National Geography magazine chose Zhangye Danxia as one of the \\"six most beautiful landforms\\" in China. The area has become a top tourist attraction for Zhangye. A series of boardwalks and access roads have been built to help visitors to explore the rock formations. In 2014, 100 million yuan was invested to improve the facilities in the Binggou area. Zhangye Danxia is featured as a natural wonder in the video game Sid Meier‚Äôs Civilization VI. It was added in the Rise and Fall expansion.

It is the second novel in Leckie's \\"Imperial Radch\\" space opera trilogy, which began with Ancillary Justice (2013) and ended with Ancillary Mercy (2015). The novel was generally well received by critics, received the BSFA Award for Best Novel and the Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel, and was nominated for the Nebula and Hugo awards. Synopsis Anaander Mianaai, the Lord of the Radch ‚Äì or the part of her personality that opposes further militant expansion of the empire ‚Äì adopts Breq into her house, appoints her Fleet Captain, puts her in command of the warship Mercy of Kalr, and charges her to protect the remote Athoek system. Breq's crew includes her old comrade Seivarden and the young Lieutenant Tisarwat, who is revealed to be an ancillary copy of Anaander herself. After Breq recognizes Tisarwat as an ancillary of Anaander, she has her ancillary implants removed, allowing Tisarwat to develop an independent personality. At Athoek Station, Breq seeks out Basnaaid, the sister of Awn, an officer Breq, as the ship Justice of Toren, once loved and, on Anaander's orders, killed. She meets Dlique, translator for the alien Presger, who is killed in a scuffle with ancillaries of Sword of Atagaris ‚Äì the other warship on station, commanded by Captain Hetnys, Breq's nominal subordinate. To hopefully placate the powerful aliens, Breq and Hetnys enter formal mourning on the estate of Fosyf, a prominent tea planter who holds her workers, transportees from other Radch-conquered worlds, in conditions akin to serfdom. After Breq survives an attempt on her life by Raughd, Fosyf's abusive heir, she suspects that somebody abducts suspended transportees, possibly an ancient warship seeking to replenish its ancillary crew. Hetnys and her ship move against Breq, apparently serving the other half of Anaander Mianaai, but they are subdued after Breq holds Hetnys hostage. Reception =Critical reception= Liz Bourke of Tor.com characterized Ancillary Sword as surpassing Leckie's debut novel, being more of a character- focused \\"extended meditation on power, and identity, and morality\\" than its thriller / space opera predecessor, and exhibiting Leckie's broad and deep worldbuilding. But she considered that it fell \\"prey to a certain amount of Middle Book Problem\\", with a narrative that felt slower because it lacked the parallel past and present plotlines of the prequel. In io9, Annalee Newitz appreciated the novel as \\"a gripping read, with top-notch worldbuilding and a set of rich subtexts about human rights, colonialism ‚Äì and (yes) hive mind sex\\", but noted the lack of a strong narrative thread, as well as Breq's \\"holier-than-thou facade\\" reducing the impression of ambivalence that characterizes a realistic character. Kirkus Reviews called the novel \\"something of a retread but still interesting\\". The reviewer appreciated the characterization of Breq as a former AI who feels \\"lonely and limited\\" in her human body rather than wanting to become human (a more common trope in science fiction), but noted the \\"groaningly obvious moral\\" in Leckie's portrayal of a highly stratified society. In The New York Times, N. K. Jemisin similarly focused on the \\"quintessentially inhuman\\" Breq's difficulty to understand other people as the novel's most powerful element, and as a challenge to sci- fi's tropes of \\"disabled people being made whole by technology, and (...) nonhumans inexplicably yearning for humanity\\". NPR notes that \\"Ancillary Sword is, quite contentedly, a different beast\\" in comparison to its predecessor and says \\"Sword is more directly political than Justice\\". A reviewer for Canada's National Post called the all-female pronoun usage an \\"almost alienating trick\\" referring to the first book but yields to the usage by saying it \\"has become imperceptible by the end of Ancillary Sword\\". The Portsmouth Review appreciated the fusion of emotion with AI and said the series \\"dominates in the genre of artificial intelligence by fusing it with the perfect amount of human emotion\\". =Awards= Ancillary Sword received the 2014 BSFA Award for Best Novel and the 2015 Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel. It was also nominated for the 2014 Nebula Award for Best Novel and the 2015 Hugo Award for Best Novel.

The company currently sells the majority of their clothing online and currently has brick and mortar retail locations in Washington D.C., San Francisco, New York, Santa Monica, Boston, and Chicago. History Ministry of Supply was started with the intention of creating technologically advanced office apparel. As an anecdote, Gihan arrived to the team's first meeting with a hand sewn dress shirt - composed entirely of off-the-rack athletic fabrics. Similarly, Advani arrived with a sock of the same ilk - a dress sock, where he had replaced the sole with that of a running sock. Both represent the earliest known samples of \\"Performance Professional\\" clothing, an emerging category of apparel. The team met as students at MIT, where they quickly realized they shared a vision for everyday clothing that could be as capable as their athletic gear. The group joined forces in 2012 and introduced their first performance dress shirt. The Apollo Kickstarter campaign set the record for most-funded fashion project at the time, and gave way to the full line of garments that continues to evolve for optimal comfort and capability. After a year of product development and small- scale sales in the spring of 2012, the company decided to conduct a Kickstarter campaign to fund the creation of a synthetic knit-blend dress shirt with heat and moisture management, odor control, and offered a full range of motion. The campaign raised over $400,000 and became the largest amount raised for a fashion product at the time on a Kickstarter project. In June 2013, the company again went to Kickstarter for a campaign to raise funds to produce a high performance dress sock. This campaign raised more than $200,000 for the start up company.

In late September 2013, the company raised $1.1 million in seed round financing from VegasTechFund, SK Ventures, and Red Sox pitcher Craig Breslow. The $50,000 investment from Breslow came after his fianc√©e bought one of the shirts as a birthday present and he wore the shirt while traveling on the road with the team. Since launch, the company has built an impressive offering of men's and women's performance clothing, utilizing modern, sharp silhouettes with deep engineering down to the fiber level - ultimately creating soft, stretchy, machine washable clothing suitable for any occasion. The team has won numerous design and engineering awards, including two Guinness World Records (Fastest Half Marathon in a Suit, Men + Women) and NASA's Innovation Award. Design The Ministry of Supply's goal is to use new materials, aerospace, robotic engineering, and thermal analysis to create a new category in the design of better-fitting men's business attire. The company seeks limited beta testing through customer input and feedback with when designing their clothing.

Sellers (born David Edward Sellers, September 7, 1938) is an American architect based in Vermont known for using an improvisational approach to modern architecture which eventually led to what is known as design/build.Architectural Improvisation: A History of Vermont's Design/Build Movement 1964-1977, University Press of New England, 2008. His work focuses on designing and building with nature, with special emphasis on custom craftsmanship and a preference for sustainability. His work in town and community planning has received national recognition for pedestrian and human- scaled settlement patterns. Education Sellers received his Bachelor of Arts from Yale University in 1960. He received his Masters in Architecture at the Yale School of Architecture in 1965, studying under dean Paul Rudolph, and noted architects James Stirling, Shadrach Woods and Henning Larsen, and Robert Engman (at the Yale School of Art who was a student of Josef Albers). Also an influence was Louis Kahn who served as a design critic and professor of architecture at Yale School of Architecture from 1947 to 1957. The Yale Building Project was initiated during his graduate studies. \\"The design-build culture was largely initiated by two members of the class of 1965, David E. Sellers and Peter Gluck.Hayes, Richard W. (2007). The Yale Building Project: The First 40 Years. Yale University Press. . The two friends helped one another on building projects, one for Sellers' brother, and one for Gluck's parents. In 1963, Sellers and Gluck built a vacation house for Gluck's parents in Westhampton, New York. A cedar-clad house which was supported on telephone poles took two summers to build and was featured in a 1967 article in Progressive Architecture which described the young Sellers as \\"plunging headlong into architecture‚Äîdesigning, building and developing.\\"[No Author], \\"Light and Air Houses\\" in Progressive Architecture, July 1967, Vol. XLVIII, No. 7, pp. 106-115. Career =Early work= Shortly after Yale, Sellers and his friend, William Reineke purchased a piece of land near Warren, Vermont, known by the name Prickly Mountain, while Peter Gluck embarked on projects elsewhere. From these beginnings a new way of making architecture developed, resulting in structures unmoored from architectural tradition.Architectural Improvisation: A History of Vermont's Design/Build Movement 1964-1977, University Press of New England, 2008. The three young architects were motivated by the idea that they could control the economics and construction of their buildings, as well as the design. At the time, Sellers was quoted as saying: \\"The architect is irresponsible today in thinking he has to sit in his office and wait for some client to come up and say, all right build me that. But I think the architect has got to change his whole scope if he's going to survive as an integral part of our future society. I think he's got to play the role of the entrepreneur as well.\\"C. Ray Smith, \\"Architecture Swings Like a Pendulum Do\\" Progressive Architecture, May 1966, 150 Three primary forces launched the design-build experiments at Prickly Mountain: 1) an entrepreneurial urge to create and control one's life economically; 2) a desire to build, to engage in the materiality and empirical nature of architecture with one's own body; and 3) a desire for the creative freedoms and personal expressions of the artist's life.Architectural Improvisation: A History of Vermont's Design/Build Movement 1964-1977, 11, University Press of New England, 2008. Burlington, Vermont: Waterfront Drawing The Tack House, The Sibley/Pyramid House, and the Bridge House were a direct result of a design-build process that resembled the making of art more than the standard methods of making buildings. The Tack House 1966Sibley House 1967 In architecture firms, projects are completely designed with all details in place before construction begins; final buildings are executed by a builder reading a set of instructions and therefore having no input on the design. By contrast, the houses build on Prickly Mountain were built by their designers, and they were undertaken without the preparation of finished architectural drawings. A broad, formal or structural concept executed as a simple sketch or scale model would often be the only aspect of design completed prior to construction. The process that followed was one of continual design and problem solving. It was improvisational and full of surprises; often solutions had to be figured out when the creative process got ahead of practicality.Danny Sagen, interview with David Sellers, 1998, previously published in Influence across Fields, The Chicago Architectural Club Journal, 2001, Volume 10Karrie Jacobs, \\"The Revolution That Never Quite Was,\\" Metropolis Magazine, October 2006. =Sustainable design= Starting in the mid-1970s, Sellers experimented in the integration of sustainable energy and waste systems into homes by featuring various green technologies. Between 1974 and 1980 during the oil embargo, Sellers designed five residences (in Colorado, Kansas, Maine, Vermont and New Jersey) featuring passive and active solar, wood backup, super-insulation, water storage for recirculating heat, composting toilets, windmills. Two of these experiments led to inventions that were used to start successful businesses. In 1974, he co-founded with Don Mayer, Northwind Power (now Northern Power Systems).\\"Wind Power Holdings raises $45M\\". Mass High Tech. 23 October 2009. Retrieved 14 June 2010. The company is now a successful developer of wind turbines. In 1976 he co-founded the Vermont Iron Stove Works which created new designs in iron stoves for the domestic market.http://www.vermontironstove.com/about.html In 1978, he co- founded 4 Elements Corporation with architect John Todd, to develop solar aquatic waste treatment systems. =Architectural style= The Pitchern Inn; Trout Room Sellers architectural style reflects a commitment to bringing outside materials indoors and remaining true to the natural beauty of the surroundings. For an elegant design solution, Sellers says, \\"Don't use rocks if you don't have rocks on your site. Use what meets the main criteria for value, which is based on perceived appropriateness for the site.\\" By doing so, you support the local craftspeople who are familiar and adept at working with the native materials. Fork View Lodge In one of his designs, the Tree House, about one-third of the vertical supports are trees that were originally located on the property. The strength is preserved because they are in full shape without any cuts, usually without stain or bark removal.Maren Thompson Bzdek, \\"The Green Tree House,\\" Natural Home, February/March 2004 The Fork View Lodge Gesundheit Institute Library thumb =Industrial design = Sellers' interest in everyday design lead him to found a museum in 2011, the Madsonian Museum of Industrial Design, ‚Äúto celebrate the great designs and encourage a civil society to understand that the future of a material world depends on permanence, and that depends on artistic infusement into everything we do‚Äù. While living through long Vermont winters covered in snow, Sellers realized a need for a sled that could maneuver through trees safely, as opposed to the existing sleds available at the time which did not have steering capabilities. He and friends developed a sled which would not sink in deep powder and was able to easily be carried up the mountains without trouble. In 1987, he created the Mad River Rocket CompanyMad River Rocket Company and began selling sleds. The company is still in operation and is run by his son, Parker Sellers.Lisa Rathke, \\"Free Sledding; Vermont's Mad River Rocket opens up a world of 'reckless fun' in winter,\\" Bangor Daily News, December 26, 2007.Parker Sellers =Community design= * Representing US at International Design conference in East Berlin, team leader for design strategies of new development in the medieval section of Berlin. * Prickly Mountain Project (with Bill Reinecke).

Its operation is based on assemblearism, with a decentralized structure divided in local and regional assemblies. The highest political body is the National Assembly that is held every two years, and where all the membership has the right to attend. Although originally it was an independent organisation, it quickly began to work as the youth organisation of the Galician Nationalist Bloc, until the II Assembly (Compostela, 1990), absorbed ERGA and the Union of the Galician Youth, approved the admission into the BNG. They define their political objectives as the: \\"national liberation and the transformation of society (without national, class or gender oppression/exploitation and totally demilitarized),\\" claim a fully sovereign Galiza as the final culmination of the process of national self-determination. Galiza Nova also defends that the relationship between the different nations of the world should be based on equality and internationalist solidarity. Galiza Nova is also against the NATO and defends a Europe of the peoples as opposed to the current European Union of the states. Until its abolition in 2002, the organisation was a strong opponent of conscription and supported insubordination against it.

Early life and education  Ruth Sacks was born in New York City on September 5, 1920. Her parents, who were Jewish immigrants originally from Eastern Europe, were both lawyers. Sacks received her bachelor's degree in art education in 1941 from Skidmore College. In 1977, she completed her master's degree in counseling and therapy from American University.  Marriage and family  In 1942, she married Mortimer Caplin, an attorney, whom she had met when both were teenagers. The couple had five children, Lee, Michael, Jeremy, Cate and Mary Ellen Caplin. She now has nine grandchildren; Ella, Bennett, Sophie, Phoebe, Aubrey, Harriet, Daniel, Victoria ad Carter Caplin. Mortimer Caplin served as the Commissioner of Internal Revenue from 1961-63. Ruth worked as a fashion designer in New York City early in the marriage.  Early career-Virginia  The family moved to Charlottesville, Virginia in 1951 when Mortimer Caplin became a law professor at the University of Virginia School of Law. She began working on children's plays in local schools as a costume designer and director. However, many local public schools temporarily closed in the late 1950s as part of Virginia's resistance to desegregation at the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement. Caplin and other parents organized makeshift home schools for students in defiance of the closures. She taught her children dance, music and studio arts in the family basement. She also co-designed her husband's law firm office.  Children's theater/counseling-Washington, DC  The Caplins again relocated in 1961, this time to Washington D.C. when Mortimer Caplin was appointed Commissioner of Internal Revenue by the Kennedy administration. Ruth Sacks Caplin continued her work with children's theater in the Washington area. She offered therapy and counseling services from her home in Chevy Chase, Maryland. Caplin did not retire from counseling until she was in her late 80s.  Screenwriter  Ruth Caplin Sacks chanced upon a novel called \\"Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont\\" by Elizabeth Taylor while traveling with her husband in London during the late 1970s. The Caplins had recently lost their daughter, 29-year-old Mary Ellen, to cancer. Ruth Caplin found the plot of the novel, which centers on Laura Palfrey, an older woman who moves to a residential hotel for the elderly, comforting. Palfrey, who is working through her own period of grief, befriends an aspiring young writer, Ludo. During the course of the book, Ludo helps Laura to overcome her loneliness and becomes as close as a grandson to her. Caplin, who identified closely with the story, soon set out to write a screenplay based on the novel. While she had been a writer throughout her life, she had never been published, nor had she previously attempted to pen a screenplay. Caplin purchased a how-to guide on screenwriting and began her work. Her writing for the film allowed her to retreat into an \\"imaginary, quiet\\" and move forward through her grief, according to the Washington Post. Caplin, who disliked unhappy endings, lightened the mood of some of the book's sadder scenes. Despite her efforts, Ruth Sacks Caplin's screenplay was ignored for decades until her son, film producer Lee Caplin, purchased the film rights for her screenplay and the movie in 1999. In the early 2000s, Lee and Mortimer Caplin flew Ruth to London, where she was surprised to find Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont in production. Directed by Dan Ireland, Academy Award-nominated actress Joan Plowright was cast as Laura Palfrey, opposite actor Rupert Friend as Ludo, in the title roles. Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont was released in 2005 when Ruth Sacks Caplin, making her screenwriting debut, was 85-years old. She acknowledged at the time that seeing her work in theaters was, \\"...a nice surprise, in the senior quarter of my life to have this bloom.\\" Film critics gave the movie positive reviews. Stephen Hunter of the Washington Post praised Joan Plowright's performance saying it was \\"possibly her best role in the flickers\\", while Roger Ebert called the film \\"a delight ... in ways both expected and rare.\\"  Philanthropy  Ruth and Mortimer Caplin donated four million dollars for the construction of a new theater at the University of Virginia. The Ruth Caplin Theatre, a 300-seat theater located in the Department of Drama, was named in her honor and her advocacy for the arts. The theater was opened and dedicated in 2013. Additionally, Ruth Sacks Kaplan helped to establish the university's President's Council for the Arts.  Death  A resident of Chevy Chase, Maryland, Ruth Sacks Caplin, who suffered from a heart condition, died at a hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, on August 5, 2014, one month short of 94. She was survived by her husband of 71 years and their four surviving children.

Life He came from a well-known Anglo-Indian family, and was the son of Richard Comyns Birch, of the Bengal Civil Service, and afterwards of Writtle, Essex, who was a grandson of John Zephaniah Holwell, author of the famous account of his sufferings in the Black Hole of Calcutta. Birch was born in 1803 and received a commission as an ensign in the infantry of the Bengal Army in 1821. His numerous circle of relations in India ensured his rapid promotion and almost continuous service on the staff, and after acting as deputy-judge advocate-general at Meerut, and as assistant secretary in the military department at Calcutta, he was appointed judge-advocate-general to the forces in Bengal in 1841. In the same capacity he accompanied the army in the First Sikh War of 1845 to 1846, was mentioned in despatches, and was promoted to lieutenant-colonel for his services. In the Second Sikh War, in 1849, Birch was appointed to the temporary command of a brigade after the Battle of Chillianwallah. He distinguished himself at the Battle of Gujrat, and was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1849, and continued to serve as brigadier-general in Sir Colin Campbell's campaign in the Kohat Pass in 1850. He then reverted to his appointment at headquarters, and in 1852 received the still more important post of secretary to the Company government in the military department. While in this office, he was promoted to colonel in 1854, major-general in 1858, and still held the secretaryship when the Indian Mutiny broke out in 1857. At the time of the mutiny and ensuing rebellions, his services were most valuable to the British forces, even though he never left Calcutta. His thorough knowledge of the routine duties of his office and his long official experience enabled him to give valuable advice to Lord Canning, the governor-general, and to Sir Colin Campbell when he arrived to take up the post of commander in chief. These services were recognised by his being made a Knight Commander of the Bath in 1860. In 1861 he left India, and in the following year he was promoted lieutenant-general and retired on full pay. He was later promoted to the rank of full general on the retired list. On 25 February 1875 he died at Venice, aged 72.

College football Heckman was raised in Allentown, Pennsylvania. He enrolled at the University of Florida in 1954, but dropped out of the university in 1955. He returned in 1956 and played at the tackle position for head coach Bob Woodruff's Florida Gators football teams from 1956 to 1958. After the 1956 season, he was ranked as one of the best sophomores in the Southeastern Conference (SEC). He became a star as a senior in 1958. Bill Kastelz, the sports editor of the Jacksonville Times-Union, wrote that Heckman's play reached All-American levels against No. 3-ranked LSU on October 25, 1958. The following week, an injury to one of Florida's tackles led coach Woodruff to use an unorthodox strategy of shifting Heckman between the right and left tackle positions during the Auburn-Florida rivalry game. After the game, Woodruff said, \\"Heckman probably will be selected All America for his play.\\" Bill Kastelz wrote: \\"Big, fast and tough, he outshone all of Auburn's great linemen.\\" Auburn coach Shug Jordan said of the strategy: \\"There should be a law to prevent things like that. We were supposed to run plays where Heckman wasn't, and he's there now.\\" After the 1958 season, Heckman was selected as a first-team All-American tackle by the Football Writers Association of America, Notre Dame Scholastic, and Football Digest. He also received first-team All-SEC honors from the Associated Press and United Press International, as well as the Daytona Beach Quarterback Club's award as the outstanding senior college football player in the State of Florida.

His third son Robert Morgan (1608‚Äì1673) in 1660 became Archdeacon of Merioneth in 1660 and was consecrated Bishop of Bangor in 1666. In the 18th century Fronfraith had passed to the Jones family. A notable member of the family was Rear Admiral Sir Charles Thomas Jones (1778‚Äì1853). Jones saw distinguished service in the Royal Navy and was knighted in 1809. He was High Sheriff of Montgomeryshire 1832.Richard Williams ‚ÄúMontgomeryshire Worthies\\", Newtown, 1884. 59 A fine memorial to Admiral is in Montgomery Church, where he is buried.

The show originally began in 2005 as a comic book convention, before moving on in 2009 to include actors from television shows and movies. Starting in 2005, the convention has quickly become the second largest convention in Canada. The convention originally began in the BMO Centre before expanding in 2013 across the whole Stampede Park, and in 2014 additionally creating an extra tent for panels. The convention became famous for having reunited the cast of Star Trek: The Next Generation for the shows 25th anniversary in 2012, and two years later, reuniting nearly the entire cast of Aliens. In addition, a cosplay parade, which begins at Eau Claire, and finishes at Olympic Plaza, which began in 2013 with over 400 participants, and continued in 2014 with 690.

Programming Doctor Who cosplayers pose with Calgary mayor Naheed Nenshi during the 2014 Calgary Expo opening ceremony on Friday April 25. The convention offers an extensive range of panels that take place in locations throughout the park. In addition to the exhibitors' hall taking place in BMO halls A-C, and celebrity autograph sessions taking place in D and E, multiple conference rooms throughout the BMO such as the Palomino room host smaller panels. Bigger names will often also have their panels in the Stampede Corral, and some also taking place in the Boyce Theatre. In addition to the regular panels which last 45 minutes, 2012 and 2014 included special, extended panels often labeled as \\"EXPOsed\\", which typically last from an hour to two hours long. These have ranged from concert- type panels to discussion panels. Controversy =2012 overselling incident= In 2012, the convention had gotten even bigger, with the cast of Star Trek: The Next Generation having been announced, and ticket sales increased. On Saturday of 2012, the venue had reached past the maximum capacity, with an estimated attendance having been projected as 45,000. The venue had exceeded capacity, and at 13:00 the Fire Marshall was called; it was deemed safe for 100 people to be admitted every 15 minutes. Many people were turned away and not let into the venue. Despite this, Expo staff had issued a statement claiming the convention was not oversold, and they hadn't been charged because no violations took place. A week later, the organizers issued a refund plan for people who were not admitted. = Accessibility = In 2018, following the acquisition of Calgary Expo by Fan Expo/Informa, the convention was criticized by disability-rights advocates for removing a long-standing policy that allowed wheelchair users free access to VIP lanes to receive priority access to celebrity autograph and photo opportunities. The organizers stated that the revised policies were intended to provide balanced access for all attendees, were part of a goal to provide an \\"equal and accessible\\" experience for all attendees (as the result of the change was to make all attendees require a VIP pass for such access, regardless of disability), and that they were in compliance with relevant legislation.  Related events  In 2012, an Edmonton-based spin-off was first held, the Edmonton Comic and Entertainment Expo, at the Edmonton Expo Centre in Northlands. The inaugural edition hosted 15,000; by 2016, attendance had grown to 40,000. The 2017 edition featured an appearance by William Shatner and a concert by Gene Simmons of Kiss. In 2014, the convention began an affiliation with the Saskatchewan Entertainment Expo in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, first held in 2013, which was re-branded as the Saskatoon Comic and Entertainment Expo. The affiliation ended in 2018 following the sale to Fan Expo. In 2016, the convention began to hold the Calgary Expo Holiday Market at BMO Centre, with a focus on vendors and gift shopping.

Orphaned shortly after his family emigrated to the United States, Bayliss worked his way into Hillsdale College in Michigan. After a two-year break to fight in the Civil War, Bayliss graduated in 1870 and first oversaw schools in Indiana. He then came to Streator, Illinois to lead a school district, becoming superintendent of a high school in 1896. In 1898, Bayliss was elected Illinois Superintendent of Public Instruction. He later served as the second president of the Western Illinois State Normal School before falling to his death from a horse.  Biography  Alfred Bayliss was born in Bledington, England on March 22, 1847. He emigrated to the United States with his family when he was a child, settling in Hillsdale, Michigan. Bayliss was orphaned when he was twelve. When he was fifteen or sixteen, he matriculated at Hillsdale College. However, he withdrew in 1863 to enlist in the 11th Michigan Volunteer Cavalry Regiment for the Civil War. He returned to college after the war, graduating in 1870. Bayliss' first position out of college was superintendent of schools in LaGrange County, Indiana. In 1874, he took a position as superintendent of school district #3 in Sterling, Illinois. Bayliss spent the next twenty years in the district. He then ran for Illinois Superintendent of Public Instruction as a Republican, but was defeated in the primary by Samuel Inglis. Bayliss assumed the editorship of the Streator Standard, then served in the role of first assistant clerk of the 39th Illinois General Assembly. Bayliss also edited The Child-Study Monthly periodical. In 1896, he was named Superintendent of Streator Township High School. He ran for the state superintendent again in 1898 and was elected. He served two consecutive four- year terms. Bayliss advocated for free high school education, although the state legislature did not adopt the idea. In 1906, Bayliss became the second President of the Western Illinois State Normal School, a role he held until his death. Bayliss served as the president of the Northern Illinois Teachers' Association and vice president of the Illinois State Teachers Association. He was also a member of the State Committee on Educational Progress. In Streator, he served on the city council, commanded the Grand Army of the Republic chapter, and was once the chairman of the LaSalle County Republican Party. He married Clara Marie Kern, who became a social activist and author, in 1871; they had two daughters. On August 26, 1911, Bayliss died from injuries he sustained eleven days earlier after falling from a horse in Woodbine, Iowa. He was buried in Oakwood Cemetery in Macomb, Illinois.

She currently is Chief operating officer and president of North America for Focus Brands.\\"www.focusbrands.com/management\\" She is a former president of Focus Brands' subsidiary Cinnabon, an American chain of retail bakeries specializing in cinnamon buns. Prior to that, she was an executive vice president of Hooters.  Early life  Cole was born the eldest of three sisters in Jacksonville, Florida, and raised in Orange Park, Florida. Her mother divorced her father (a Vietnam War veteran) when Cole was nine years old, and raised the three girls as a single mother.  Education  Cole received her MBA in 2010 from Georgia State University. She had dropped out of her undergraduate engineering program at the University of North Florida to focus on her global career at Hooters, so she had to take the GMAT and extra interviews in order to apply. She was only allowed to attend the Georgia State MBA program, since they are one of the few schools that allow experienced students who did not receive a bachelor's degree to apply. She also asked ten CEOs, including Ted Turner, for letters of recommendation to the business school program.  Early career  Following her mother's divorce, Cole began working to help pay some of the family expenses. Cole worked at The Body Shop before starting her career at Hooters as a hostess. During her first year waitressing at Hooters, Cole covered varied positions from manager to cook, nearly every position at the restaurant. Upon her manager's recommendation as the Jacksonville franchise's best employee, Cole was sent to Sydney to train and motivate the new owners and employees at the opening of the first Hooters in Australia. She continued to travel overseas in order to train employees in Hooters Restaurants abroad. She became a vice president at age 26. As the vice president of training and development, Cole oversaw the growth of Hooters, from approximately 100 locations and $300 million in revenue to 500 locations in 33 countries and $1 billion in revenue.  Tenure at Cinnabon  In November 2010, Cole was hired by Cinnabon Inc., and was named president in January 2011. During the first three years of her tenure, Cinnabon added 200 bakeries, created partnerships with grocery stores and restaurants like Taco Bell and Burger King, and became a global brand in 56 countries. Cinnabon's 2013 sales was estimated at a billion dollars. Cole worked anonymously in several of Cinnabon's retail and production roles during her appearance on the American television show Undercover Boss. At the time the show aired in 2012, she was 34 years old and the youngest CEO to appear on Undercover Boss. Among a number of other awards and accolades, Cole was also recognized by Fortune Magazine in 2013 for its 40 under 40 list. In the winter of 2015, Cole moved to become group president of Focus Brands, the company that owns Cinnabon as well as Moe's and Auntie Anne's.\\"Kat Cole Reflects on Sweet Success at Cinnabon https://www.cnbc.com/2015/02/28/kat-cole-reflects-on-sweet-success- at-cinnabon-and-beyond.html\\"  Non-profit and humanitarian work  Cole in Ethiopia Cole has worked in Africa for sustainable development of women and children in need.

The convictions were overturned after DNA evidence implicated then- convicted sex offender Roscoe Artis, who was found guilty of a similar murder he perpetrated in the same neighborhood less than a month after the Buie killing. Both brothers were originally sentenced to death but were released after 30 years in prison. Even in the light of the scientific evidence, Britt refused to acknowledge the men's innocence.Pilkington, Ed, \\"DNA evidence could exonerate two in North Carolina death row case\\", The Guardian, September 2, 2014. Retrieved 4 September 2014. Britt's multiple oversights in the case raised the question of whether he was negligent in his prosecutions of Brown and McCollum, or even whether he intentionally overlooked evidence that could have exonerated them (especially since Britt had requested that a fingerprint comparison test between Artis and prints found at the crime scene be cancelled after the trial had concluded). A September 2014 story by The Charlotte Observer revealed that Britt's enthusiastic prosecution of Brown and McCollum overlooked glaring evidence that implicated Artis. First, Britt himself had convicted Artis for a similar crime just one month before McCollum and Brown went to trial. Second, Artis lived next to the field where Buie's body was found. Third, Artis also faced a warrant for the 1980 rape and murder of a woman in Gastonia, North Carolina. In 2015, with the two convicts released by the court due to the DNA analysis, Britt still opposed a pardon and compensation for wrongful imprisonment of the two. Governor Pat McCrory had also not acted on the pardon and compensation six months after the release.Blinder, Alan, \\"Pardons Elude North Carolina Men Exonerated After Decades in Prison\\", New York Times, March 16, 2015. Retrieved 2015-03-16. On June 4, 2015, nine months after their release, McCrory issued a formal pardon to Brown and McCollum. McCrory said \\"it's the right thing to do\\". The brothers were therefore able to seek compensation for false imprisonment. Judicial election and opponent's murder In 1988, the North Carolina General Assembly created a new Superior Court Judgeship in Robeson County. Britt was the first to announce his candidacy. Seeing an opportunity to be the first Native American superior court judge in North Carolina, Lumbee civil rights activist Julian Pierce resigned from his position as director of Lumbee River Legal Services and entered the race as Britt's opponent. On March 26, 1988, just a few weeks before the election, Pierce's body was found in his home with shotgun wounds to his head, chest, and stomach. Though local law enforcement claimed they had located the murderer, who committed suicide prior to an arrest or trial taking place, the reasons for the murder continue to be debated., 2014/03/20. In the aftermath, Britt was automatically declared the winner of the primary election. However, some reporters and campaign workers counted the votes and determined that Pierce actually won the vote posthumously, 10,787 to 8,231.

Journey from Phrygia to Troas (16:6‚Äì8) This section records the journey out of Paul's previous mission area ('region of Phrygia and Galatia' in verse 6) in the center and southern part of Anatolia, approaching the north-west corner of Asia Minor following ancient routes (the Roman roads north of Antioch in Pisidia were built in later period), one of which reached north of Antioch, leading 'westwards down the Lycus Valley towards Ephesus'. The direction of the travel was determined by Holy Spirit (verse 6; interchangeable with \\"the Spirit of Jesus\\" in verse 7) at least in two junctions: not to take the one that could lead westward to Smyrna, nor the other that could lead northward to Bithynia and Pontus, but following the road towards Troas. The lack of preaching account along this part of the journey indicates that they were continually waiting for guidance, which finally came to Paul when they arrived in the port city of Troas, in a vision of a call for help from the man of Macedonia. The man of Macedonia (16:9‚Äì10) Seal of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, (1629‚Äì1686, 1689-1691) Verse 9 records a vision in which the Paul is said to have seen a 'man of Macedonia' pleading with him to \\"come over to Macedonia and help\\" them.

KJV The independent status of Lydia as a trader and householder (verse 15) was not unusual for women among the 'traveling merchants and artisans' in most Greek cities of the ancient world and such women often became 'patron and benefactor to Jewish and other immigrant communities'.

This girl followed Paul and us, and cried out, saying, \\"These men are the servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to us the way of salvation.\\" And this she did for many days. But Paul, greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, \\"I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.\\" And he came out that very hour. NKJV The passage refers of woman who was possessed by a \\"spirit of divination\\", whose nature remains unclear. Paul ordered to the spirit to come out of her and this happened in the Name of Jesus Christ, like apostles were called to do against demons (). Nevertheless, the spirit of divination () affirmed for some days that Paul and Silas were servants of the Most High God. The saving of the jailer in Philippi (16:15‚Äî34) The dramatic scenes of Pauls's imprisonment and escape in Philippi mirrors Peter's experience in Jerusalem (Acts 12:6‚Äî17). The singing hymn in prison is similar to the act of the philosopher Socrates (Epict. Diss. 2.6.26‚Äî7) and the rescue by divine intervention because of faithfulness to God is like that of the prophet Daniel and his friends (cf. Daniel 3, Daniel 6). Instead of escaping during earthquake, Paul honorably stayed inside (by implication also keeping the other prisoners in place) so he could prevent the jailer to commit a shame-induced suicide (verse 28) and brought change in this person's life: treating his prisoners with honor (verse 30; disregarding his original orders in verse 23), washing their wounds (verse 33) and inquiring them about salvation (verse 30). Paul's 'shameful experience of prison' was turned into a successful mission (verse 32), even in the middle of the night (verses 25, 33), that the jailer 'with his entire household' became a 'paradigmatic convert' (stressed three times in verses 32, 33, 34), baptized, 'sharing table-fellowship', and 'rejoicing' (verses 33, 34). =Verse 31= : So they said, ‚ÄúBelieve on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household.‚Äù NKJV The shaming of the magistrates (16:35-40) When the 'police' (Greek: rhabdouchoi, \\"lictors\\", verse 35) came to order the jailer to release him, Paul chose this time to reveal his Roman citizenship (cf. ; ), which higher standards of legal treatment than other people in the empire should prevent him and his companion to be publicly humiliated, and the violation of this could result in severe punishment for the magistrates (verse 37).Quote: \\"In the 1st century BCE, the senator Verres had been prosecuted in Rome for a series of crimes against provincials which included the mistreatment of Roman citizens\\" from: Cicero, Against Verres:', 2.5.169-70; apud Alexander 2007, p. 1049. A complete the role-reversal then happened with the magistrates came to 'apologize' to Paul (better translation: \\"implore\\", from Greek: parekalesan, verse 39) vindicating Paul's faithfulness to God who can turn around potentially humiliating situations into honor.

The property is distinctive for its well-preserved Federal style house, including one room that contains an unusual form of stencil painting on its walls. It also has historic association with Don Carlos Seitz, the editor of the New York World, who operated a gentleman's farm on the property.NRHP nomination for Nathaniel and Elizabeth Bennett House; available by request from the National Park Service It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. Description The current farm property consists of , a remnant of the purchased by Nathaniel Bennett in 1790. The house is a fairly typical south- facing five-bay Federal style wood frame structure, with a pair of interior brick chimneys. The central doorway is framed by sidelight windows and fluted pilasters, and topped by a wide frieze and cornice. An ell extends from the rear of the house, connecting it to an English barn. The ell is a 1980s replacement for an earlier structure which was likely narrower; the barn is of unknown construction date, but may be contemporaneous with the main block. The interior of the main block consists of four rooms, two on either side of a central hallway, on each floor. The front rooms on both floors have raised paneling on the fireplace wall, and wainscoting capped by a chair rail. The rear rooms are only modestly finished. The left front parlor has unusual stenciled artwork drawn on its walls. It is distinctively different from typical stencilwork of the period, which was often derived from the work of the itinerant artist Moses Eaton. A sky blue background is painted over with a row of flowers, with two buds on each stem, and a group of leaves separated by a small yellow flower. History The front half of the house is by tradition dated to 1792, not long after Nathaniel Bennett's purchase of the land. The back half was added in 1812, and the exterior doors were given their Greek Revival treatment sometime later. The Bennetts died childless, and the house eventually was sold to Don Carlos Seitz, publisher of the New York World. Seitz operated the property as a gentleman's farm, and built a large barn (no longer extant, although its foundation survives) on the property north of the surviving barn; he was also responsible for naming the property \\"Cedarbrook Farm\\". His estate sold the property to one of his hired hands in 1927, and the property was operated for a time as tourist accommodations.

The phenomenon is sometimes known as \\"Jihad Cool\\" and includes music, clothing, magazine, videos and other media. Notable examples German rapper Deso Dogg later took the names Abu Talha al-Almani and Abou Maleeq, and joined ISIL in 2014. British-born Abdel- Majed Abdel Bary rapped under the name L Jinny, is the son of Egyptian militant Adel Abdel Bari. Jinny once tweeted a photo of himself holding a man's severed head, with the words \\"Chillin' with my homie or what's left of him.\\" One American rapper, Omar Hamaami, who later joined al-Shabaab, released a song with the lyrics \\"Bomb by bomb, blast by blast, only going to bring back the glorious past.\\" In 2006, Aki Nawaz of the group Fun-Da-Mental released an album with lyrics comparing Osama bin Laden to Che Guevara and depicting the Statue of Liberty as an Abu Ghraib prisoner. Analysis The phenomenon of jihadi rap has been around since at least 2004, when the song \\"Dirty Kuffar\\" was released. Anthropologist Scott Atran argues that the phenomenon results from a search for \\"sacred values\\" and what Edmund Burke called \\"the sublime\\"; a \\"quest for greatness, glory, eternal meaning in an inherently chaotic world\\". Political historian Mohamed Mahmoud Ould Mohamedou argues in his book A Theory of ISIS - Political Violence and the Transformation of the Global Order that the choreography and the soundscape (notably the nasheeds) of the transnational re-imagined and 'remixed' violence of the Islamic State partly borrows from the urban culture of hip- hop.https://www.plutobooks.com/9780745399119/a-theory-of-isis/ Amil Khan has cited Douglas McCain as yet another example of this phenomenon, and said that both Islamism and gangsta rap foster a \\"sense of grievance towards wider society\\" and \\"focus on vengeance and fetishize violence as a way of redressing the balance\\". Khan says that while researching young Islamists in London, he found that they looked to the works of 50 Cent and Tupac Shakur for inspiration. Khan argues that what sets ISIL apart from other jihadist groups, and makes it far more dangerous as a result, is its ability to harness hip-hop to \\"bestow on its struggle a counter-culture sense of subversive 'cool' that mainstream political parties and even commercial brands might envy.\\" ISIL's marketing methods and overall strategies are also reminiscent of those used by street gangs. Hisham Aidi has written a book, Rebel Music: Race, Empire, and the New Muslim Youth Culture describing the phenomenon of Islamist hip-hop. Aidi also mentions that the United States and other Western governments have attempted to use hip-hop and Sufi music to fight terrorism by deradicalizing young Muslims.

Life  His father was a grocer whose business had been nearly ruined by the French Occupation. After a financially difficult youth, his desire to improve himself led to art lessons with and and a lasting association with the artistic family of . Later he, and Erwin Speckter toured Northern Germany with the support of art historian Carl Friedrich von Rumohr. They were all most impressed with the old Hanseatic city of L√ºbeck. On Rumohr's advice, Milde went to study at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts in 1824. Later, he studied briefly at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich, followed by a visit to Italy. Pastor Rautenberg and His Family (1833) From 1830 to 1832, he returned to Italy, visiting every major city, but staying longest in Rome, where he came under the influence of Friedrich Overbeck and the Nazarene movement. Although he continued to travel, Hamburg remained his home for most of the 1830s, making a name for himself with portraits and church paintings. In 1835, he completed a series of frescoes at the Mayor's official residence, which had been started by his friend Erwin Speckter but left incomplete at the latter's early death. As an amateur scientist and naturalist, he also illustrated several medical/anatomical texts. =Career in L√ºbeck= In 1838, shortly after getting married, he moved to L√ºbeck where he took a position as a drawing instructor at the Katharineum and became a Professor in 1841. He also pursued his scientific hobbies, documenting and cataloguing items for the L√ºbecker naturhistorische Museum, where he served as a curator for thirty years. Among his more interesting projects was helping to assemble the museum's first gorilla skeleton. Cologne Cathedral dome: the west window Increasingly though, his focus turned to documenting and saving the city's artistic and architectural heritage. He concentrated on the rescue and restoration of Medieval interior pieces and stained glass, laying a foundation for the collection of altarpieces at St. Anne's Museum. In 1865, while working at the Hofkirche in Semlow, he attracted the attention of Crown Prince Frederick and was commissioned to work on the windows between the towers at Cologne cathedral. Despite increasing senility during his last six years of life, he continued to work and serve in all of his official capacities. His many collections are still preserved at their respective institutions in L√ºbeck. A street in Hamburg's Barmbek-Nord district is named after him.

He was a radical and Liberal civil servant at the Head of the Treasury. His influence was felt at a time of expansion in governmental activities.  Personal life  Mowatt was born in Sydney, Australia on 28 April 1837. His father Francis Mowatt (1803‚Äì1891) was an MP from Falmouth. His wife Sarah Sophia was the daughter of Captain George Barnes of Romford. Barnes was part of the marine services of the British East India Company. Mowatt's sister was married to Vernon Lushington, a permanent secretary to the Admiralty.  Early career  Mowat was educated at Harrow (1851‚Äì53) and Winchester, before going on to St John's College, Oxford (1855‚Äì56). He was a Treasury Clerkship scholar. In one of the first civil service exams taken, he scored 880 marks out of 1545. As a third class clerk he was paid ¬£100 with an appraisal of ¬£250. On 9 June 1864, aged 27, Mowatt, on a salary of ¬£430, married Lucy Sophia, daughter of John Andrew Freriche of Thirlestaine Hall, Cheltenham, and a widow of Count Stenbock, of Kolk, Estonia.  Civil Service  At his previous work, he controlled expenditure at the Treasury. He was promoted as a Second clerk (1860), and First class (1870) in Assistant Secretary division with a ¬£700 to ¬£900 salary. He was made Principal clerk of the Law division in 1881, and awarded a Companion of the Bath (1884). He rose to deputy head of department in July 1889 and Assistant Secretary and Auditor of the civil list, on a yearly salary of ¬£1500. He was made a Knight Commander of the Bath (KCB) in 1893. Mowatt became Permanent Secretary to the Treasury in 1895. Haldane required Mowatt and John Morley to join him on his trip to Ireland in 1898 to sort out the Catholic universities. Haldane later praised the \\"far-sighted Permanent head of Treasury in founding the Imperial College of Science and Technology...\\"D. Sommer, \\"Richard Haldane, first Viscount Haldane of Cloan,\\" 100. Mowatt was appointed the first Chairman of Imperial before it was reconstructed, but retired due to ill-health. Sir Francis was created a GCB in 1901. He stayed on in the civil service until 1903, sharing with Sir Edward Hamilton, as Joint Permanent Administrative Secretary; while Hamilton was joint secretary in charge of finance. A crisis hit the Conservatives in 1902-3 when Joseph Chamberlain decided to split the cabinet by proposing the Tariff Reform League, giving preferential trading terms to the colonies, particularly in Canadian North America. As Permanent Secretary, Mowatt was supposed to remain neutral and impartial, but Mowatt was an even more passionate Gladstonian free trade liberal than his predecessor, Sir F. Welby. In August 1903, Mowatt wrote to Haldane that the Duke of Devonshire was prepared to set up a new ministry of Unionists with Haldane in the Foreign Office to defend Free Trade.Haldane, An Autobiography, p.92. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Charles Thomson Ritchie wanted to repeal the Corn Duty that had been imposed for the first time since 1846 by his predecessor Michael Hicks Beach. Mowatt interfered on Ritchie's behalf, compromising his position. Mowatt was photographed on the streets in London remonstrating toe to toe with Chamberlain. He trained Winston Churchill at the Board of Trade to be a free trader stimulating a defection to the Liberal party in 1904. Arthur Balfour was unimpressed with Mowatt's policy-making and bias. On retirement Mowatt became an Alderman of the London County Council. He served on Royal Commissions and Official Committees. As a pastime he followed the South Downs Hunt at Parham. He was living at 41 Sloane Gardens, Chelsea, SW when he died on 20 November 1919.

As they became overgrown with banyan trees the landscape came to be called ƒê·ªëng ƒêa, literally Heap of Banyan trees. In 1851, during construction and clearance work for new roads and the Nam ƒê·ªìng markets, more remains were found and gathered into a big burial next to ·ªêc hill. This mound gradually expanded and merged with ·ªêc hill. As it became overgrown it eventually came to be named ƒê·ªëng ƒêa Mound. During the French occupation, the French army dug out the twelve hills leaving only ·ªêc mound untouched. Therefore, the current ƒê·ªëng ƒêa Mound became the remaining 13th mound.Dong Da Hill iGrandtour Corporation, April 6, 2012 In 1989, to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the victory the ƒê·ªëng ƒêa Park was established.Dong Da Mound Dong A, Binh Dinh Newspaper, January 11, 2007 Location ƒê·ªëng ƒêa Mound is located within the ƒê·ªëng ƒêa Park.

From then on, the ƒê·ªìng Quang Pagoda organized an annual religious ceremony to commemorate the ƒê·ªëng ƒêa Battle on the 5th day of the Lunar New Year.

Netgn is the organiser of NECLive (Nigerian Entertainment Conference) and the NET Honours. History Nigerian Entertainment Today (NET) was established on November 23, 2009 by Ayeni Adekunle. NET also ran as a print media and its printed copies circulated in about 37 major Nigerian cities and sold 10,000 copies weekly. In 2016, NET gradually phased out its print version as many of its readers moved online in search of entertainment news. In April 2013, a website ranking organisation, Alexa ranked Netng 33rd most visited website in Nigeria. Days after the ranking was announced, NET website (www.thenetng.com) came under a sustained hackers attack believed to be from certain Rocco Mancini who took total control of the site and made it inaccessible to visitors. The hackers initially demanded a ransom of $1,200. Later this amount was reduced but the publisher refused to pay any ransom to the hackers preferring to launch a new domain (www.thenet.ng). By 2014, the new website was ranked among 100 top websites in Nigeria by Alexa. The NET Newspaper Limited (NNL) and all its subsidiaries including Netng was acquired in 2019 by ID Africa. The acquisition ceded total ownership rights to ID Africa. Reportage  Netng is known for breaking and reporting exclusive entertainment news. For instance, Netng was first to break the news of the birth of Wizkid and Ice Prince's kids. In 2012, Netng reported an exclusive interview granted it by D'Banj in London providing a comprehensive insight into what led to the break up of Don Jazzy and D'banj (co-founders of Mo' Hits Records). This exclusive report laid to rest speculations about the cause of their breakup.

It is based in New York City. The label was founded in 2011 and has released albums from Speedy Ortiz, Pile, LVL UP, and Porches.  History  = Beginning in Boston = Dan Goldin had been working at Island Def Jam Music Group but was dissatisfied working with music he didn't quite enjoy as much as the bands he and Spak had been seeing at local shows around the area. While working at Def Jam, Goldin decided to start operating a music blog which was the first appearance of the Exploding in Sound name. According to an interview with Consequence of Sound, Goldin stated: \\"If I can do this blog long enough to where it develops an audience, I can eventually start a label which in theory, has a built-in audience with that same taste.\\" Together, Goldin and Spak decided it would be a good idea to start a record label to showcase some of the homegrown acts. = Move and first releases = In 2011, Goldin moved to New York City, which led to the signing of Boston band Pile on October 16 while they were playing a CMJ showcase. At the time, Spak had relocated to Scranton, Pennsylvania. Exploding in Sound's first release was Grass is Green's \\"Ronson,\\" released on CD followed by Speedy Ortiz's \\"Sports EP,\\" the label's first record pressing. Before the end of 2012, the label had two more releases including the \\"Split Dicks\\" seven-inch split featuring Grass is Green and Two Inch Astronaut, and Pile's \\"Dripping.\\" = Expansion = The following summer, Speedy Ortiz released their debut album, Major Arcana on Carpark Records while continuing to be a part of the Exploding In Sound family, with Sadie Dupis providing vocals on Ovlov's \\"am\\" released July, 2013. The label would go on to put out a total of 19 additional releases including Massachusetts bands Fat History Month, Krill, Kal Marks and Ponybones (featuring Speedy Ortiz original guitarist Matt Robidoux.) In October 2013, Goldin and Spak put on an unofficial CMJ showcase at the Silent Barn in Brooklyn, New York which also acted as the label's second birthday celebration. According to Stereogum, \\"It was a feeling that built over the 11-band lineup. It was more than just ‚Äúa showcase,‚Äù it was bigger than CMJ, and it cements EIS as the most exciting rock label in years. This one show had more energy and excitement (both from audience and performers) than entire festivals.\\" Goldin would call the show one of his favorites in a Summer, 2014 interview with Interviewtion. In a 2015 interview with Allston Pudding, Goldin described the showcase as a turning point, one of the \\"little affirmations here and there that keep it going.\\" In 2015, Exploding in Sound hosted \\"a five-day, six-show celebration\\" in Boston and New York.

He was the cellmate of American war photographer Matt Schrier, who escaped after seven months of captivity. Early life and career Peter Theophilus Eaton Padnos was born in Atlanta, Georgia, to Michael Padnos, a writer now living in Paris (then he worked as a lawyer), and Nancy Curtis. He received his bachelor's degree from Middlebury College in Vermont and his doctorate in comparative literature from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. He is fluent in French, Arabic, German, and Russian. He moved to Vermont and taught poetry to prisoners of a local jail. His first book, My Life Had Stood a Loaded Gun, was written about this experience. In this book he firstly shows his interest in writing about disaffected youth. He then relocated to Yemen, where he changed his legal name to Peter Theo Curtis, under which he continued writing. Padnos began his study of Islam in Yemen at Dar al-Hadith, before moving to Damascus, Syria, to enroll in an Islamic religious school. His second book, Undercover Muslim, where he highlights the topic of Islamic extremism, was published in the UK. After its publication, the changing of his name (to Peter Theo Curtis) made travel in the Middle East easier. Since he had declared allegiance to Islam in public, the book could be interpreted as apostasy. In 2012, he became a freelance journalist. He created articles about the Middle East for magazines such as the New Republic, The Huffington Post and the London Review of Books. He then moved to Antakya, Turkey, near the Syrian border. Although Curtis originally claimed in his NY Times article that he went to Syria to \\"stop into villages and interview people, telling the story of a nation with many identities, dissatisfied with them all, in trouble, wanting help,\\" he later completely changed his story in his documentary, claiming he was there to \\"follow some refugees back into Syria and write about the adverse conditions in the camps.\\" However, in his former cellmate's book, \\"The Dawn Prayer,\\" Matthew Schrier claims Curtis told him he was in Syria to write a story about abducted American journalist Austin Tice, and provided documentation proving so in the form of an email Curtis wrote to Tice's editor shortly before he was kidnapped asking him to \\"commission\\" the article. Abduction and imprisonment Curtis was held in a series of prisons run by Syrian rebel groups with ties to Al Qaeda. His family was asked to pay a ransom of an amount of money between $3 million and $25 million. According to his account of his captivity published in The New York Times Magazine on November 2, 2014, he was held by al-Nusra Front and later by Abu Mariya al-Qahtani, who also released him. Curtis considers himself \\"most responsible\\" for his kidnapping, believing he was reckless in crossing into Syria with smugglers he did not know and who held him captive. Commenting on the torture and mistreatment he endured at first, he says, > It seemed to me that I had been walking calmly through an olive grove with > Syrian friends, that a rent in the earth had opened, that I had fallen into > the darkness and woken in a netherworld, the kind found in myths or > nightmares. Curtis was imprisoned with another American, the New York photographer Matthew Schrier. Both were tortured by Al Qaeda and Schrier, of Russian Jewish heritage, converted to Islam https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/10/life-as-a-hostage- in-syria/382068/ https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/magazine/theo-padnos- american-journalist-on-being-kidnapped-tortured-and-released-in-syria.html but Curtis remained a Christian. Toward the end of July 2013, Curtis and Schrier devised a way to crawl out of a small window in the cell. They agreed Schrier go first, but however upon escape, in a contested account, Schrier fled and left Curtis behind wedged through the window https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/theo-who-lived/. Curtis said that he escaped twice, each time seeking refuge with the Free Syrian Army, and that both times they delivered him back to the Al Nusra Front. Release Relatives were not told the terms of Curtis's release, which came one week after James Foley's beheading by the Islamic State. A team led by editor David G. Bradley and the Padnos family contacted Ghanem Khalifa al-Kubaisi, head of Qatar State Security, who mediated for Curtis's release and according to what it told the Padnos family it was \\"on a humanitarian basis without the payment of money\\". The kidnappers had demanded ransom reaching 22 million euros. Curtis states that he was released to the UN mission in the Golan Heights. A documentary about Curtis' time in captivity was released in 2016 titled Theo Who Lived.

This is a form of indirect holding system where an intermediary, such as a broker or central securities depository, or the issuer itself (e.g., French system) holds a record of the ownership of shares usually in electronic format. The dematerialization of securities such as stocks has been a major trend since the late 1960s, with the result that by 2010 the majority of global securities were held in dematerialized form. History Although the phenomenon is ancient, since book-entry systems for recording securities have been noted from civilisations as early as Assyria in 2000 BC, it gained new prominence with the advent of computer technology in the late 20th century. Even during the period when paper certificates were popular, book-entry systems continued since many small firms could not afford printing secured paper-form securities. These book- entry securities were often held under the control of an attorney who acts as a notary to certify the existence of the securities, as well as their authenticity. Since the 1960s, dematerialization has effected more and more listed companies in the United States and more recently in the European Union, where dematerialized securities represent often more than 99% of the securities listed on regulated markets.\\"Summary of responses received in respect of the EU consultation on legal certainty of securities holding and transactions\\", European Commission However, the phenomena of dematerialization of securities issued by large firms is mostly undertaken via Central Securities Depository, a national or regional institution holding the notary function, such as the Depository Trust Company (DTC) in the United States or Euroclear Group in part of the EU, which itself entrusts banks and investment firms to act as intermediaries between issuers and investors for the custody of these securities. Therefore, dematerialized securities are often referred as intermediated securities, in particular by the Unidroit convention on substantive rules for intermediated securities.

In common terms, dematerialization means doing more with less. This concept is similar to ephemeralization as proposed by Buckminster Fuller. In 1972, the Club of Rome in its report The Limits to Growth predicted a steadily increasing demand for material as both economies and populations grew. The report predicted that continually increasing resource demand would eventually lead to an abrupt economic collapse. Studies on material use and economic growth show instead that society is gaining the same economic growth with much less physical material required. Between 1977 and 2001, the amount of material required to meet all needs of Americans fell from 1.18 trillion pounds to 1.08 trillion pounds, even though the country's population increased by 55 million people. Al Gore similarly noted in 1999 that since 1949, while the economy tripled, the weight of goods produced did not change. By most measures, quality of life improved from 1977 to 2001. While consumer demand is constantly increasing, consumers demand services such as communication, heating and housing, and not the raw materials needed to provide these. As a result, there is incentives to provide these with less materials. Copper wire has been replaced with fiber-optics, vinyl records with MP3 players while cars, refrigerators and numerous other items have gotten lighter.

After 1640, he entered into negotiations with the Catholic Church, hoping to achieve political and military support through Church Union. He succeeded Metropolitan Rufim Njegu≈°, and was succeeded by Rufim Boljeviƒá. Life Born in Korneta, in the Lje≈° nahija (Ottoman sub-district), his surname was Uskokoviƒá.http://www.vijesti.me/vijesti/tragom-mardarijevog-manastira-u- kornetu-130308 He was the hegumen of the Cetinje Monastery since 1625. He is mentioned in a book written in 1631 in the Hilandar monastery. He is mentioned as a Metropolitan for the first time in July 1637. The previous Metropolitan bishop was Rufim Njegu≈°. In 1637, he also had jurisdiction over the Bay of Kotor and Pa≈°troviƒái. The same year peasants from around Cetinje \\"pressured Church land\\" and were, quoting Mardarije \\"stealing from the monastery and doing much evil\\". Mardarije and the monastic brotherhood brought the suit to the Sultan's kadi (judge), as Montenegro at the time was \\"ruled by the Ottomans\\" (as said by himself). The monastic brotherhood brought the chrysobulls of Ivan Crnojeviƒá and other documents, and the Ottoman judge then confirmed the monastery's property. The first report of a Montenegrin bishop secretly getting in contact with the papacy about the possibility of a church union was recorded in 1638, when Mardarije met with Francesco Leonardi; this was viewed of by the Papacy as the beginning of the plan of conversion of all Serbian lands. He was imprisoned by the Ottomans due to his closeness with the Papacy and then released from prison in 1639 or 1640, after which he met up with Francesco Leonardi in the Bay of Kotor. The Vatican Congregation for Propaganda sought to gain Mardarije and Pajsije I, the Serbian Patriarch of Peƒá, to the church union (1640). In 1640 Mardarije accepted church union with the papacy. According to traditional folklore, he was stoned by Montenegrins for this action, although there are no factual proofs of this.http://www.rastko.rs/rastko-bl/istorija/corovic/istorija/6_6_l.html He was also in favour of placing Montenegro under Venetian suzerainty. His title is unknown, though in 1640 he called himself \\"bishop [...] from the Macedonian region of the land of Montenegro, of the Cetinje monastery\\" (episkup ... od predel makedonskih, zemle Crne Gore, od manastira Cetinja) or simply \\"of Montenegro\\" (ot zemle Crne Gore), and also as . Although the church union did not last, the Montenegrins continued cooperation with the Republic of Venice. He is believed to have been last mentioned in 1659. The same year, he was succeeded by Visarion II Kolinoviƒá from Ljubotinj as the acting metropolitan. Visarion was ordinated as co-adjutor earlier by Mardarije and thus often acted as an official negotiator with Venetians. His tenure was short, ending in 1662.http://www.montenegro.org.au/kalendar.html The next metropolitan was Rufim Boljeviƒá ( 1673‚Äìd. 1685).

Later release included on U.S. VHS as Deadly Neighbor and in West Germany as Angst der Verlorenen. Reception Having years previously read an article in Amazing Cinema about the making of Fiend, author Scott Phillips had wanted to see the film but had not been able to locate a copy. When later as a staff writer at Monsters at Play, he found a copy and wrote \\"So was it worth the 20+ -year wait? Two words: Holy Freakin' Hell, Yes. Any movie that delivers this kind of cheese-slathered drive-in goodness is gonna get the big thumbs-up from this li'l reviewer, you can count on that - and Fiend serves it up big\\", and went on to praise, plot, effects, lighting, and acting. He noted the film benefited from writer/director Don Dohler avoiding gore in favor of atmosphere, doing \\"a great job of delivering some creepy moments, one of which - involving a little girl behind Longfellow's house - will have you squirming in your seat. It gets goofy in places, but that's part of what makes it so enjoyable.\\" The film is recommended for anyone loving old-school, late-nite horror films. The DVD transfer of the original 16mm film was good considering the age of the original film stock, and includes a blooper reel, a still gallery, and the \\"gratuitous George Stover gallery\\" (there's also a great photo of the lovely \\"Miss Kim\\" (Fred Olen Ray's wife) on the Retromedia website link).\\" Contrarily, when re-released and co-featured with The Alien Factor on DVD in 2005, DVD Talk compared the two films, and in finding T.A.F. almost likable, felt that Fiend was \\"an almost complete failure, primarily because it is much more dependent on Dohler's storytelling and direction, and his skills aren't up to the task in either department,\\" concluding it was \\"little more than a backyard movie not worth anyone's time.\\" References External links * Fiend at the Internet Movie Database Category:1980 horror films Category:American supernatural horror films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Films set in Maryland ","title":"Fiend (film)"},{"id":"43727355","text":"Chen Tiexin (born April 1955) is a former Chinese politician.

He was expelled from the party in February 2015. Career Wu was born in January 1954 into a farming family in rural Tianjin, his father worked on a farming cooperative, while his mother was a homemaker. He was the second of five children. He spent his childhood at the Wu family courtyard where he lived with his extended family. As a child, Wu enjoyed playing football. Wu attended No. 28 Middle School in Tianjin, where he completed middle school in 1970. Shortly thereafter, he joined the Tianjin police force as a trainee at the age 16. He joined the Communist Party of China in September 1973. Wu worked his way up the ranks of the Tianjin Public Security Bureau, beginning as a junior officer, he was promoted to team leader, division chief, and deputy director general. In September 1998 he was appointed as the Deputy Party Secretary of Tianjin Public Security Bureau. In February 2003, 32 years after he joined the force, he became the chief police commissioner of Tianjin. He would serve in the role of the city's top cop for over ten years. In June 2003, he also took up the post of political commissar of the People's Armed Police Tianjin division. In November 2005, he took up the office of Deputy Secretary of Tianjin Political and Legal Affairs Committee (Zhengfawei). In October 2011, as he neared retirement age, Wu was appointed to become the Vice Chairman of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (a position at the Sub-Provincial level). He was re-confirmed in 2013. He left his post as chief of police on July 20, 2014. =Patents= Traffic lights found in Tianjin, patented by Wu Changshun During his time as police chief, Wu had applied for 35 patents, mostly for inventions in the public transport sector. Of the 35 patents, four of which were solely accredited to Wu himself, while Wu had collaborated with others on the remaining 31.

Regarding Wu Changshun, President and Party General secretary Xi Jinping was reported to have said to a discipline inspection conference, \\"in Tianjin there is a guy that people call Wu Ye (roughly, \\"Lord Wu\\"). Pretty much all the parking lots in that city belonged to his family... it was absolute madness; totally despicable.\\" On May 27, 2017, Wu was sentenced by the Zhengzhou Intermediate People's Court to death sentence with reprieve without commutation or parole when the sentence was automatically reduced to life imprisonment; he was convicted of plundering the public fund worth 342 million yuan (~$50 million), taking bribes worth 84.4 million yuan (~$12.32 million), redirecting public fund worth 101 million yuan (~$14.74 million) for illicit use, giving bribes worth 10.57 million yuan (~$1.54 million), abuse of power and ordering his subordinates to shield suspects who avoided being investigated. Public image Wu was known to traverse the city's streets on a bicycle, tending to the concerns of ordinary people, and devoting much of his working time to on-the-scene guidance. Wu became famous in Tianjin for resolving seemingly intractable disputes and for showing up personally to handle everything from legal procedural complaints to a broken traffic light. During his time in office he cultivated an image of an approachable populist and a \\"man of the people\\". Wu appeared frequently on the Traffic Light program of the Tianjin traffic radio station to address concerns such as traffic congestion. Speaking of his own career, Wu Changshun said that he started climbing from the lowest rung of the ladder, going step-by-step from a junior police officer to team leader to division head to police chief. Wu said, \\"when it comes to climbing the career ladder, I was playing a methodical game of chess, never once did I play a game of checkers [i.e., 'jump' multiple levels in a promotion].\\" Wu was reported to have been involved in soliciting prostitutes in 1992.ËÆ∫1992Âπ¥ÁöÑ‰∏ÄËµ∑ÂÆòÂëòÂ´ñÂ®º‰∫ã‰ª∂ While rumours about this alleged incident circulated among Tianjin residents, many do not regard it as damaging to Wu's public image; Wu's former neighbour said that \\"such activities are fairly common place among high officials.\\" Personal life Wu is married to a woman surnamed \\"Zhang\\" who worked for the Tianjin police department.

Idrimi a member of the dynasty was able to conquer Alalakh leaving his descendants to rule until the last of them was dethroned by the Hittite king Suppiluliuma I in c. 1344 BC. History In all likelihoods Yamhad was a tribal name. The dynasty entered the historic records when the founder Sumu- Epuh was mentioned as an enemy in the inscriptions of Yahdun-Lim of Mari. Sumu-Epuh faced dangerous enemies most important of them was Shamshi-Adad I of Assyria and was killed in one of the battles. His successor Yarim-Lim I was able to defeat all his enemies becoming a Great King, his reign saw an alliance with Hammurabi of Babylon, and the dynasty became the most influential family in the Levant with the armies of Yamhad campaigning as far away as Diniktum in southern Mesopotamia next to Elam borders. Dynastic marriages played a part in the dynasty policy and included royal members of many kingdoms such as Ebla and Mari, whose King Zimri-Lim was married to Shibtu the daughter of Yarim-Lim I. Hammurabi I (re. c. 1764 BC) son of Yarim- Lim I ruled a prosperous Kingdom, The dynasty hegemony remained unchallenged and he was able to add Carchemish to his vassals, his successor Abba-El I installed his younger brother Yarim-Lim on the throne of Alalakh in c. 1735 BC, thus creating a cadet branch of the dynasty under the hegemony of the great king in Aleppo. =In Aleppo= Legal case from Niqmi-Epuh to the king of Alalakh The line of great kings in aleppo continued to hold hegemony over other Syrian kingdoms, Abba-El I was succeeded by his son Yarim-Lim II whose reign isn't well attested, his successors Niqmi-Epuh and Irkabtum fought with the Hurrian principalities and guaranteed the kingdom dominance in the north. The short reign of Hammurabi II was followed by Yarim-Lim III who defeated the dynasty old rival Qatna, but the danger came from the north as the Hittite king Hattusili I launched a series of destructive campaigns against the allies of the kingdom starting with Alalakh which fell in c. 1650 BC. The war continued for many years and ended with the sacking of Aleppo and the capture of Hammurabi III in c. 1600 BC by Mursili I the successor of Hattusili. After the assassination of Mursili, Sarra-El a prince and a possible son of Yarim- Lim III regained aleppo and ruled a much smaller kingdom that again included Alalakh. He was succeeded by his son Abba-El II, then his grandson Ilim-Ilimma I who was the last member of the dynasty to rule Aleppo as its king, he was killed in c. 1524 BC which put an end to the kingdom of Yamhad. =In Alalakh= Yarim-Lim of Alalakh Two cadet branches ruled Alalakh, the first was founded by Yarim-Lim son of Hammurabi I in c. 1735, he had an exceptional long reign so did his successor Ammitakum who started to reign at the beginning of Niqmi-Epuh term and died shortly before the sack of Alalakh. Ammitakum asserted his autonomy from Yamhad without declaring an independent kingdom, he declared his son prince Hammurabi as his heir in the presence of Yarim-Lim III who had no part in making that decision, those acts probably played a part in Aleppo decision not to send reinforcements to protect Alalakh from the Hittites who sacked it ending the first branch rule in c. 1650 BC. The second branch was established by Idrimi the son of Ilim-Ilimma I who managed to conquer Alalakh seven years after his escape from aleppo which fell to the hands of the Mitannian king Parshatatar. Idrimi ruled Alalakh and its area which was called the Kingdom of Mukish as a vassal to Mitanni and was attested campaigning against the Hittites, he was succeeded by his son Addu- nirari, then his second son Niqmepa who controlled aleppo as a vassal to Mitanni, he was succeeded by Ilim-Ilimma II, who left his son Itur-Addu as the last king of the dynasty, Itur-Addu allied with Nuha≈°≈°e and Niya to face the armies of the Hittite king Suppiluliuma I, who defeated Itur-Addu and annexed both Aleppo and Alalakh in c. 1344 BC.

Biography Weston was born Margaret Woodward in England and raised in South Africa. In 1956 she came to New York City to pursue a career in singing, and soon thereafter she moved to Los Angeles because of the growing theatrical scene in that city. By chance she took a trip to Big Sur and fell in love with the area. She moved there and became involved in the amateur theater productions at the State Theater in Monterey. It was there that she met her future husband Cole Weston, who directed her in a play. Cole was the son of famed photographer Edward Weston and was responsible for making authorized prints of Edward's photographs after his death. Maggi is quoted as saying \\"Edward's prints drove me to tears, and I knew photography was my calling.\\" The two married in 1963. At the time photography had a limited value in the art market, but over the next decade Weston watched the market slowly grow while learning the intricacies of what makes a quality photograph. Through her husband she met and became friends with a wide circle of important photographers that included Ansel Adams, Wynn Bullock and Imogen Cunningham. Her marriage ended in 1975, and although she had benefited from the knowledge and experience she gained as part of the Weston household she received only a few Weston prints as part of the divorce. Needing a job to support herself, she made the then risky decision to open a gallery that would sell only photography. She asked Adams to provide her with some of his prints to launch her collection, and he both honored her request and helped her find a gallery space in the nearby small town of Carmel-by-the- Sea, California. His prints became her opening exhibit, which was described as \\"a sell-out, with lines stretching for blocks.\\" That same year Adams decided to stop making new prints from his old negatives, and Weston took out a bank loan to secure one last batch of prints for her gallery. Her timing was opportune, for soon after the market for fine art photography began to rise. In 1980 Weston and Adams together came up with the idea for a \\"Museum Set\\" of Adams' photographs. She mortgaged her house to come up with money to help finance the project, but as a result she added a large number of Adams' prints to her collection. Their individual and collective value rose significantly during the next 20 years, and she sold many at substantial profits. Over the years Weston became a shrewd and obsessive collector, buying both then little- known prints from 19th century photographers and important images from 20th century masters of the art. She was an early collector of Jerry Uelsmann, Ralph Gibson, Michael Kenna, Joel-Peter Witkin and Adam Fuss, and she helped build their reputations by placing their work in important corporate collections like the Gilman Paper Company, Pacific Bell, Mitsubishi, and the Southland Corporation. She also advised the curators at the Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Victoria and Albert Museum. In 2007 Weston sold the bulk of her private collection at Sotheby's in New York. Included in the sale was one of only two known prints of Edward Weston's The Ascent of Attic Angles (1923), which sold for $824,000. Maggi Weston originally bought the print at Sotheby's in 1979 for $2,500. Other important prints that sold that evening included Carleton Watkins' The Garrison, Columbia River (1867) - $492,000, Man Ray's Noire et Blanche (1926, printed c1935) - $396,000, Imogen Cunningham's Amphitheatre No. 2 (1920s) - $348,000, Edward Weston's The White Iris (1921 ) - $340,000, and Paul Strand's Boat Houses, Wolf River, Gaspe Quebec (1936) - $336,000.

It was first \\"exposed to public view\\" on 12 August 1816 and has been classified as a Grade II listed building since 1 December 1987. The monument was a feature of many satirical verses and cartoons in the early 19th century, mainly because the word \\"bomb\\" ‚Äì pronounced \\"bum\\" ‚Äì gave it an immediate association with the notoriously profligate Prince Regent's sizeable backside. Description The mortar is mounted on the back of a large brass sculpture of Dante's reimagining of the monster Geryon (wrongly described as a \\"Chinese dragon\\" in some sources), associated with the Isle of Gades on which C√°diz stands, with twin tails twisting round to the vent of the mortar which it supports on its back.

The Prince of Wales's feathers appear in high relief at the front of the bed, while at the rear is the inscription, \\"Constructed in the Royal Carriage Department. Earl of Mulgrave, Master General - A.D. 1814\\". History =Origins= The memorial in its original location in 1860, with chevaux de frise surrounding it The mortar was one of a number of giant siege weapons used by the French army under Marshal Soult during the two-year siege of C√°diz in Spain. Made in Seville in March 1811, it was spiked and abandoned when the French retreated after the Duke of Wellington's victory at the Battle of Salamanca in 1812. It was designed to be capable of throwing shells over what contemporaries described as \\"the immense distance\\" of and could actually reach a range of . Although the mortar and its siblings were intended to serve essentially as terror weapons to compel the inhabitants of C√°diz to surrender, they were, however, ineffective and inaccurate weapons. The shells were said to be aimed \\"much at random, some of them falling short of the town, others flying completely over into the bay near the lighthouse on the other side, and some few ... falling in the city, but from which very few casualties occurred.\\" According to one Royal Engineer who saw the mortar in action, he watched it fire a shot into the middle of the crowded Plaza de San Antonio in the centre of C√°diz \\"without injuring a single individual\\". After the siege was lifted, the Spanish Regency presented one of the captured French mortars to Rear Admiral Arthur Kaye Legge. They requested that it might be placed in one of London's Royal Parks to commemorate the victory at Salamanca, the liberation of southern Spain and the exploits of the Duke of Wellington. The Prince Regent agreed and instructed the Earl of Mulgrave to procure a suitable carriage for the mortar and set it up in Horse Guards Parade. The royal carriage department at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, carried out the work, creating an elaborate allegorically sculpted bronze base for the weapon. It was unveiled on the Prince Regent's 54th birthday, situated on the south side of the parade ground behind a square of chevaux de frise. It was subsequently moved to its present position adjacent to the Horse Guards building. =The Regent's Tremendous Thing= Saluting the Regent's Bomb Unveiled on his Birth- Day, August 12th, 1816, by George Cruikshank A Representation of the Regent's Tremendous Thing erected in the Park, by C. Williams At the time, the slang term for a cannon or mortar was a \\"bomb\\", pronounced \\"bum\\". The C√°diz mortar was thus immediately nicknamed the \\"Regent's Bomb\\", prompting a flood of scatological puns associating it with the corpulent posterior of the Prince Regent. C.F. Lawler wrote of its report, its wind and \\"width, breadth and monstrous size\\" and predicted that the Poet Laureate would \\"sing the charming odour of the thing\\". The satirist William Hone celebrated its unveiling with a verse attacking the Prince Regent and his ministers, their names scarcely disguised: > Oh, what a Bomb! Oh, Heaven defend us! The thought of Bombs is quite > tremendous! What crowds will come from every shore To gaze on its amazing > bore! What swarms of Statesmen, warm and loyal, To worship Bomb so truly > royal! And first approach three 'secret hags,' Then him the R‚Äî‚Äît [Regent] > calls 'Old Bags;' [the Lord Chancellor, John Scott, 1st Earl of Eldon] > Methinks I see V‚Äî‚Äî‚Äît [Vansittart] come, And humbly kiss the royal Bomb! > While T‚Äî‚Äîy W‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîy [Tylney Wellesley], (loyal soul) Will take its measure with > a Pole; And C‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîh [Castlereagh] will low beseech To kiss a corner of the > breech; And next will come of G‚Äî‚Äîy R‚Äîe, [George Rose] And in the touch-hole > shove his nose!See \\"Hone's View of the Regent's Bomb\\" for the full text of > the verse. The poem was accompanied by a cartoon drawn by George Cruikshank, which showed the Prince Regent as the personification of the mortar with a queue of ministers lining up to kiss his backside. Similarly, S.W. Fores published C. Williams' A Representation of the Regent's Tremendous Thing erected in the Park ‚Äì \\"thing\\" being a slang term for \\"penis\\" ‚Äì with predictable double entendres such as a parson saying \\"What an erection to be sure,\\" to which his wife replies, \\"I could look at it for ever\\". Many other cartoonists followed suit, often depicting the mortar in conjunction with the Prince Regent's then mistress Lady Hertford.

However, pooled analysis of the effect of apabetalone in three phase II clinical trials ASSERT, ASSURE, and SUSTAIN demonstrated increases in HDL-cholesterol (HDL-c) and apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) levels, as well as decreases in the incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE).J.

Reduction of MACE was more profound in patients with diabetes mellitus. In a short term study in prediabetics, favorable changes in glucose metabolism were observed in patients receiving apabetalone. An international, multicenter phase III trial, ‚ÄúEffect of RVX000222 on Time to Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events in High-Risk Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Subjects with Coronary Artery Disease‚Äù (BETonMACE) commenced in October 2015. The trial is designed to determine whether apabetalone in combination with statins can decrease cardiac events compared to treatment with statins alone. Mechanism of action The molecular targets of apabetalone are bromodomain and extra terminal domain (BET) proteins, and in particular the BET family member BRD4. BET proteins, which contain two bromodomains, interact with acetylated lysines on histones bound to DNA to regulate gene transcription via an epigenetic mechanism. Apabetalone selectively binds to the second bromodomain (BD2). When apabetalone binds to BRD4, it impacts key biological processes that contribute to CVD such as cholesterol levels and inflammation. Apabetalone stimulates ApoA-I gene expression and production of the protein. ApoA-I is the main protein component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), which can transfer cholesterol from atherosclerotic plaque in arteries to liver for excretion via the reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) pathway. This process is thought to stabilize the plaque to avoid coronary events. Clinical trials have shown apabetalone increases ApoA-I and HDL. Further, serum from individuals taking apabetalone had increased cholesterol efflux capacity, indicating the HDL generated in response to apabetalone functions in RCT. Inflammation is also a major contributor to atherosclerosis and CVD. Both ApoA-I induction and anti-inflammatory effects are common properties of BET inhibitors. In clinical trials, more favorable effects of apabetalone on coronary disease progression have been observed in patients with elevated levels of inflammatory markers.R. Puri, Y. Kataoka, K. Wolski, A. Gordon, J. Johansson, N.C. Wong, S. Nissen, S. Nicholls, Effects of an apolipoprotein A-1 inducer on progression of coronary atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events in patients with elevated inflammatory markers, Journal of the American College of Cardiology, 63 (2014) S0735-1097 Apabetalone was also reported to reduce inflammation in pre- clinical models. Subsequent research showed apabetalone targets multiple processes that underlie CVD. The impact on any of these pathways, independently or cumulatively, may contribute to the lower incidence of MACE observed in clinical trials.

It is based on the 2013 feature film Frozen, and tells the story of Anna's birthday party given by Elsa with the help of Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf. Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee again served as the directors with Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, Jonathan Groff, and Josh Gad reprising their roles from the first film. Production on Frozen Fever began in June 2014 and took six months to complete. The film debuted in theaters alongside Walt Disney Pictures' Cinderella on March 13, 2015. It received positive reviews from critics, along with praise for its new song \\"Making Today a Perfect Day\\" by Kristen Anderson- Lopez and Robert Lopez. Plot Elsa plans to give Anna a surprise birthday party with the help of Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf; but while Anna is led on a party treasure hunt by a string that winds through the kingdom, Elsa has caught a cold, and unknowingly produces a group of \\"Snowgies\\" with each sneeze, who begin to dismantle the birthday party's decorations while Kristoff tries to stop them. While Elsa takes Anna on the hunt, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf try to control the snowmen and fix the decorations in time for Anna and Elsa's return. Meanwhile, Elsa's condition rapidly worsens and she becomes delirious with fever. After Elsa nearly falls off a clock tower, Anna convinces her to rest. They walk back to the castle where Elsa apologizes to Anna for \\"ruining\\" another birthday, but Anna reassures her that she didn't ruin anything. As Anna goes to lead Elsa to bed, the doors to the castle open to reveal Kristoff, Olaf, Sven, and a mountain of tiny snowmen, who surprise Anna. Elsa sneezes again and finally sees more tiny snowmen that she produced. Despite Anna's protests, Elsa concludes the party by blowing into an alphorn. However, she sneezes into the horn, forming a giant snowball that inadvertently hits Hans overseas (and into a cart of manure, as he was cleaning out the stables as punishment for his attempt on Elsa's life). Elsa rests in bed under Anna's care while she points out that taking care of her beloved big sister is the best birthday present ever. Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven escort the small snowmen to Elsa's ice palace, where they stay with her snow- giant doorkeeper Marshmallow. Cast * Kristen Bell as Anna * Idina Menzel as Elsa * Jonathan Groff as Kristoff * Josh Gad as Olaf * Chris Williams as Oaken * Santino Fontana as Hans * Paul Briggs as Marshmallow Production On September 2, 2014, during the ABC airing of The Story of Frozen: Making a Disney Animated Classic, Walt Disney Animation Studios' chief creative officer John Lasseter announced that a Frozen short film with a new song would be released in the future. On the same day, Variety announced that the short would be released in early 2015 under the title Frozen Fever, with Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee returning as co-directors, Peter Del Vecho returning as producer and a new song by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez. Olaf the snowman would also make an appearance in the short. On December 3, 2014, it was announced that Aimee Scribner would be a co-producer and that Frozen Fever would debut in theaters alongside Walt Disney Pictures' Cinderella on March 13, 2015. In late December, the co-directors told the Associated Press \\"There is something magic about these characters and this cast and this music. Hopefully, the audiences will enjoy the short we're doing, but we felt it again. It was really fun.\\" Around the same time, Dave Metzger, who worked on the orchestration for Frozen, disclosed he was already at work on Frozen Fever. The short features the song \\"Making Today a Perfect Day\\", by Anderson- Lopez and Lopez. At the premiere of Cinderella and Frozen Fever at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, California, on March 1, 2015, Josh Gad told USA Today, \\"I want to apologize to parents everywhere for the fact that children are going to be singing a whole new Frozen song[.]\\" The creators started brainstorming possibilities for the short film in June 2014. After early discussions about Olaf, head story artist Marc Smith pitched the idea of what might happen if Elsa had a cold, which became the basis for the short's plot. The directors began working on the short in June and by August were back in the recording studio with the cast to lay down vocal tracks. The production of Frozen Fever took six months. All of the animators from Frozen wanted to come back to animate at least one shot on Frozen Fever, resulting in a large number of animator credits for a short film. They struggled to squeeze the animation phase of the short's production into a tight time slot in fall 2014 after animation wrapped on Big Hero 6 and before the studio's animators had to start working on subsequent features. It was during this time period that the directors began to realize how much they missed the Frozen characters; they began to discuss the ideas that evolved into a full-length sequel, Frozen II (2019). Release and reception Frozen Fever premiered in theaters alongside Walt Disney Pictures' Cinderella on March 13, 2015. It was released on Digital HD and Disney Movies Anywhere on August 11, 2015, and was released on the Walt Disney Animation Studios Short Films Collection DVD/Blu-ray Combo Pack on August 18, 2015. It was also included on the Blu-ray, DVD, and digital HD releases of Cinderella on September 15, 2015. On November 9, 2015, it was released on an exclusive DVD copy of its own, courtesy of Tesco stores across the UK. USA Todays Claudia Puig rated the short three stars out of four, and described the new song (\\"Making Today a Perfect Day\\") as \\"pleasant\\". She concluded that although the short \\"is not as exhilarating and inventive as the original, it's still a treat to see an abridged tale of these two sisters in a warmhearted spinoff.\\" Writing for BBC, Natalie Jamieson called the new song \\"catchy and fun\\". Dan Kois of the Slate called the film \\"a real bummer, the first recent misfire from Disney's shorts program, and thus the first serious misfire from the Lasseter-led Disney.\\" The Daily Telegraphs Robbie Collin praised the song \\"Making Today a Perfect Day\\", stating that \\"it's a lip- smacking confection, dusted with pure icing sugar, and suggests that songwriters Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez are capable of coming up with something special for the forthcoming feature-length Frozen sequel.\\" CraveOnline's Witney Seibold wrote that the film \\"is a celebration of the very kind of conspicuous consumerism that Disney is always smearing the landscape with.\\" Mike Scott of The Times-Picayune wrote that \\"with its blend of sweetness, silliness and tunefullness, this animated Disney short is satisfyingly consistent in vision and in spirit with the original Frozen.\\" References External links  Category:2015 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:2010s American animated films Category:2015 computer-animated films Category:American animated short films Category:Animated comedy films Category:American animated fantasy films Category:American fantasy-comedy films Category:American musical comedy films Category:Animated musical films Category:American musical fantasy films Category:American sequel films Category:Disney animated short films, 2010s Category:Films scored by Christophe Beck Category:Films about birthdays Category:Films about sisters Category:Films directed by Chris Buck Category:Films directed by Jennifer Lee (filmmaker) Category:Films produced by Peter Del Vecho Category:Frozen (franchise) Category:Films with screenplays by Jennifer Lee (filmmaker) Category:Films set in Scandinavia ","title":"Frozen Fever"},{"id":"43728125","text":"Fang Xiping (; born October 1958) is a former Chinese politician who spent most of his career in Anhui province.

It is one of three species of Lomatia endemic to Tasmania, the others being L. polymorpha and L. tasmanica. Lomatia tinctoria is closely related to L. polymorpha, with which it sometimes hybridises. Its leaves are divided, while those of L. polymorpha are simple. Description Lomatia tinctoria grows as a woody shrub reaching 1.5 m (5 ft) high, or rarely up to 2 m (7 ft) high. The leaves are strongly lobed (pinnate or bipinnate) and are around 8 cm long. The white or cream flower heads, known as inflorescences, appear in summer. The common name of guitar plant may refer to the shape of the fruit. Distribution and habitat Lomatia tinctoria is found in north eastern Tasmania, \\"mostly north and east of the Pieman and Derwent rivers and on Cape Barren and on and Flinders Islands\\". Lomatia polymorpha occurs \\"approximately south of the Pieman River and west of the Derwent River\\" but where the ranges overlap, as for example near Lake St Clair, apparent hybrids occur, even though the leaves of the two species are \\"strikingly different\\". L. tinctoria immature fruit. ANBG L. tinctoria x polymorpha hybrid near Lake St Clair. Taxonomy and naming French naturalist Jacques Labillardi√®re first described this species as Embothrium tinctorium in 1805, with the species name, Latin tinctoria \\"used in dyeing\\", relating to a product in the fruit that can be used for dyeing. At the time, Embothrium was a wastebasket taxon to which many proteaceae were assigned. It was given its current binomial name by Robert Brown in his 1810 On the natural order of plants called Proteaceae. An alternative name, Tricondylus silaifolius, published by Joseph Knight in his 1809 On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae, was rejected, after Brown's 1810 description of the genus Lomatia was officially conserved against Salisbury's 1809 Tricondylus. Cultivation Lomatia tinctoria can be grown in gardens, doing best on acidic well-drained soils, and tolerating sunny or shady locations. It is readily propagated from seed or cuttings.

Description Lomatia polymorpha is a shrub or small tree which grows to a height of between . It has simple leaves which are linear to narrow egg-shaped, long, wide, have a stalk about long and sometimes have a few lobes or teeth on the margins.

The film stars Shepard as Officer Jon Baker and Michael Pe√±a as Frank \\"Ponch\\" Poncherello, with Rosa Salazar, Adam Brody and Vincent D'Onofrio in supporting roles. Principal photography began on 21 October 2015, in Los Angeles. The film was released on 24 March 2017, by Warner Bros. Pictures and grossed $26 million worldwide. It has a 18% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, which called it \\"only mildly arresting at best\\". Unlike the original series, the movie was produced without the cooperation of the California Highway Patrol (CHP) and without a license to use CHP logos. Plot A getaway driver known as Chacho (Michael Pe√±a) assists a crew of bank robbers in evading the Miami Police. After exchanging vehicles, Chacho reveals himself to be Agent Castillo of the FBI, who then converges with other agents on a dock and arrests the bank robbers. At the same time, Jon Baker (Dax Shepard) enrolls in the California Highway Patrol Academy. Despite his low aptitude score across every field, Sgt. Gail Hernandez (Maya Rudolph) sympathizes with Jon, noting that he can ride a motorcycle better than the majority of cadets she has trained and grants him a probationary graduation. On a California highway, an armored van is attacked by a crew of bike riders. One member identified by the guard as \\"LT\\" accuses the guard and TJ, his CHP closet boyfriend of stealing from him from a previous hit. TJ, who happens to be responding to the hit at the time, arrives overhead in a Police helicopter. LT informs TJ over the police frequency that he must choose who lives (TJ or his boyfriend) as punishment. TJ ultimately jumps from the helicopter and falls to his death. In Miami, Castillo is informed by his boss Peterson (Isiah Whitlock Jr.) that the CHP have requested the FBI's help in the armored van heist, believing that a corrupt police ring is involved. Castillo is ordered to go undercover within the CHP and is given the alias Francis Llewellyn \\"Ponch\\" Poncherello. Ponch is partnered up with Baker and the two head to ostensibly pay respects to TJ's widow at home. Baker points out that there isn't a single commendation, picture or other effects a helicopter pilot would have in the house, and later precisely identifies the bikes used in the heist as the Ducati Hypermotard 939. The bike gang makes another attempt on an armored van. The crew evade Ponch and Baker on the faster Ducati's after a lengthy chase through Elysian Park. LT, already wary of Ponch's extensive investigations into the heists finds out from his FBI contacts that he is undercover, whereas Ponch also obtains a potential lead on an apartment TJ tenanted at. Ponch concludes that TJ had to have been corrupt, as it would not have been affordable on his salary. Sensing that something is still amiss, Ponch and Baker re-visit TJ's widow. Officer Parish - who had previously warned Ponch not to return - fights him until he is subdued by Baker. Ponch recognizes that Parish is not in on the corrupt circle, after he suggests that \\"LT\\" in reality could stand for Lieutenant. Ponch and Baker arrive on the profile of Lieutenant Raymond Kurtz (Vincent D'Onofrio) and immediately suspect him, but have nothing to pin him to the heists. The FBI pick up on a promising lead to a drug house in Venice, prompting Ponch and Baker to respond and give chase to one of the bike crew members. During the lengthy pursuit, Officer Brian Grieves (Ryan Hansen) secretly informs LT that the suspect involved is his son. While crossing a bridge, the suspect is decapitated by a recovery vehicle's extended industrial wire. LT arrives and crashes into Baker who was in pursuit. Parish arrives in his police helicopter and airlifts an unconscious Baker to hospital. Corrupt Officer and Ponch's love interest Lindsey Taylor (Jessica McNamee) attempts to console LT over his loss, but is instructed to wait for Grieves until he is discharged from hospital. Petersen fires Ponch for disobeying his orders to stay well away from Allen's lead, and Baker also discovers that his ex-wife Karen (Kristen Bell) who Baker had been living with, has sold her house while he was in hospital without telling him. At Ponch's house, Baker identifies the decapitated biker as Raymond Reed Kurtz Jr., CHP Lieutenant Ray Kurtz's son, confirming their earlier suspicions. Ponch returns to the CHP Central Station and is sworn in as a CHP Officer while Ray kidnaps Karen and holds her hostage at his safe house. Ray gives Ponch and Baker her location, but the two are ambushed by Ray en route. Both Ponch and Baker rescue Karen as Officer Ava Perez (Rosa Salazar) arrives with back up, but are attacked by Ray's associates. Ray shoots off three of Ponch's fingers, leaving him unable to return fire and instead rely on Baker's poor aim to retaliate. Baker alters his aim to compensate for this, but accidentally triggers an explosive device that incapacitates Ray and his remaining guards, who Perez and the other Officers arrest. Ray comes to, but is reinforced by Taylor and then holds Baker at gunpoint. Ponch intervenes moments before Ray fires a shot into Baker's arm which ricochets off of a titanium implant and strikes Ray in the head, killing him instantly. Baker is loaded onto an ambulance to be treated for his injuries. Karen offers to join him in hospital, however Baker finally realizes how little she cares for him and declines her offer. Ponch is given morphine by a Paramedic (who is played by Erik Estrada in a cameo appearance). A final cut scene shows Castillo receiving a call from Peterson, who offers him his job back at the FBI. Castillo however refuses, preferring to stay in the CHP.

In August 2015, the film was selected by the California Film Commission to receive $5.1 million in tax credits. =Filming= Principal photography on the film began on October 21, 2015, in Los Angeles, California, utilizing many of the same sections of Southern California freeways used for the original television series, notably Interstate 210 in La Crescenta, California. =Casting= In September 2014, Warner Bros. announced that Shepard would write, direct, and star in the film as Officer Jon Baker, and that Michael Pe√±a would portray Frank \\"Ponch\\" Poncherello. In May 2015, Vincent D'Onofrio was announced to be playing a former cop turned car thief and gang-leader. In September, Adam Brody joined the film to play an officer, while Rosa Salazar and Shepard's wife Kristen Bell also signed on to star. A few weeks later, Jessica McNamee signed on to play Lindsey Taylor, a tough young California Highway Patrol officer. In November, Jane Kaczmarek joined the film to play the police captain. In March 2016, it was announced that Ryan Hansen would join the film.  Release  CHiPs was originally scheduled to be released on August 11, 2017, but it was pushed up to March 24, 2017, by Warner Bros. Pictures. CHiPs was released digitally on June 13, 2017. Two weeks later on June 27, 2017, Warner Home Video released the film on Blu-Ray and DVD. Reception =Box office= CHiPs grossed $18.6 million in the United States and Canada and $8.2 million in other territories for a worldwide gross of $26.8 million, against a production budget of $25 million. In the United States and Canada, CHiPs opened alongside Life, Power Rangers and Wilson, and was projected to gross around $10 million from 2,464 theaters in its opening weekend. The film made $500,000 from Thursday night previews at 2,400 theaters. It went on to debut to $7.6 million, finishing 7th at the box office. In its second weekend the film grossed $4 million (a drop of 48.7%), finishing 9th at the box office. =Critical response= On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 18% based on 110 reviews and an average rating of 3.36/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"CHiPs abandons the endearing innocence of its source material, using the titular cop show's premise as a setup for aggressively lowbrow gags that prove only mildly arresting at best.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 28 out of 100 based on 26 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B‚Äì\\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave a 74% overall positive score and just 50% gave it a \\"definite recommend\\". Varietys Owen Gleiberman called the film lazy and clich√©d, saying: \\"The film's model is‚Äîor should have been‚Äîthe movie version of 21 Jump Street and its sequel, but the co-directors of those bumptious nihilistic undercover burlesques, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, knew how to turn comedy into suspense and thrills into media-mad absurdity. Shepard just sprinkles overstated banter onto a generic plot and bits of pedal-to-the-metal action, as if he was serving the action-comedy gods by sticking the usual ingredients in a blender and pushing 'pur√©e.'\\" The original show's star, Larry Wilcox, posted on Twitter saying, \\"Way to go Warner Bros - just ruined the Brand of CHIPS and of the Calif Highway Patrol. Great choice!\\" =\\"Accolade\\"= The film was awarded the Barry L. Bumstead Award at the 38th Golden Raspberry Awards, meaning the film would have likely been nominated in their \\"Worst Film\\" category had the recipient's theatrical run met their eligibility criteria.

Production and International airings On December 11, 2014, Hot Bench was renewed for a second season. The show airs in the UK on TruTV (UK and Ireland), and in Canada on Yes TV and in syndication. The show has produced 1,035 episodes as of March 27, 2019 Format The series features a panel of three judges, Michael Corriero, Tanya Acker, and Patricia DiMango, who preside over small-claims cases, and then argue the merits of the case amongst themselves in the chamber room before rendering a verdict (under the format, only a majority - two of the three panel members - need to agree on the verdict). DiMango was on the Brooklyn, New York Supreme Court prior to accepting this job, and Corriero was employed by the New York State court system at the time of his hiring, while Acker was an attorney before being selected to join the program. The panel acts as an arbitral tribunal, and as with most televised court shows, the cases are a form of binding arbitration in which the litigants forgo their actual lawsuit in favor of appearing on the program. Attorney Larry Bakman was originally on the panel with DiMango and Acker for its first two seasons on air. In October 2016, Bakman announced that he was leaving Hot Bench to focus on his law practice. Bakman's final episodes aired October 28, 2016, and Corriero's first episode was scheduled to air November 1, 2016, with series creator Judge Judy Sheindlin and her husband, former The People's Court judge Jerry Sheindlin, serving as guest judges on the October 31, 2016, broadcasts.\\"Hot Bench\\" adds a third judge, New York Post, 26 October 2016 Conception The concept was inspired by Judy's vacation to Ireland, a country which occasionally uses panels of three judges to handle one case: \\"When my husband Jerry and I were in Ireland recently, we visited the courts and watched a three-judge bench, which I found both fascinating and compelling.\\" She added, \\"I immediately thought what a terrific and unique idea for a television program that brings the court genre to the next level. We have assembled three individuals with extremely varied backgrounds to serve as the judges. They are smart and talented, with terrific instincts and great chemistry, and are sure to create a 'hot bench'.\\" The bailiff is Sonia Montejano, who was also the bailiff for Judge Joe Brown from 2006 to its end in 2013.

He was a pioneer in the field of theatrical posters. He created many portraits and caricatures of luminaries of the day. During World War I he was commissioned by the United States Army to develop camouflage painting. Haskell's etchings and intaglio prints are considered by critics and scholars to be his most important contribution.  Biography  Ernest Haskell was born on June 30, 1876 in Woodstock, Connecticut. His mother was Caledonia deRennes Haskell and his father was Besture Haskell. Ernest spent his childhood on the Haskell farm and attended Woodstock Academy. While convalescing from an attack of typhoid fever, he passed the time sketching and drawing. Ernest was a teenager and had expected to attend Yale University on a football scholarship he had secured. However, his artwork attracted attention which led to an offer of employment in the field of magazine illustration. Soon he was working in New York City as a professional artist in the art department of the New York American. His techniques were mainly self-taught at this point. Over the next decade Haskell made three extended trips to Paris, France for the purpose of conducting independent art studies. Haskell was encouraged and assisted in this endeavor by his older sister Mabel Percy Haskell, herself an artist and writer and newspaper correspondent. On the first trip he enrolled in a prestigious art school, the Academie Julian, but did not stay, instead devising his own system of studying and practicing. For a time Ernest was a protege and friend of James McNeill Whistler, who taught him to make etchings. He made several caricatures of Whistler.In Pursuit of the Butterfly, Portraits of James McNeill Whistler by Eric Denker. Published by the National Portrait Gallery, Washington D.C. copyright 1995 Smithsonian Institution Upon returning to New York from Paris in the late 1890s Haskell brought with him techniques he had learned in the field of advertising and theatrical posters. His work in this area became very popular. He made posters promoting magazines such as Scribner's, Collier's, Truth, and Pearson's.American Art Posters of the 1890s in the Metropolitan Museum of Art including the Leonard A. Lauder Collection, compiled by David W. Kiehl Copyright 1987 Metropolitan Museum of Art, distributed by Harry N. Abrams, Inc. His portrait subjects included stage actresses Helen Hayes, Ethel Barrymore, Minnie Maddern Fiske and Maude Adams. He was a member of the Player's Club on Gramercy Park in Manhattan during this period. Haskell himself was the subject of a portrait by Zaida Ben-Yusuf (published in The Critic magazine September 1899), who was known for her artistically rendered photographic portraits of eminent artists and political figures of her time.Zaida Ben-Yusuf, New York Portrait Photographer, Frank H. Goodyear III, National Portrait Gallery Smithsonian Institution Copyright 2008 Merrell Publishers Limited Ernest Haskell by Zaida Ben-Yusuf New York City 1899 In 1903 he married Elizabeth Louise Foley, a writer and member of New York society, and in 1906 they bought some land and a farmhouse on the coast of Maine in the town of Phippsburg. They lived there in the summer seasons, returning to New York City during the winter months. Haskell worked on etching and painting in the summers, and on trips to California, while maintaining portrait commissions and commercial work in the winters. In 1915 he was engaged by the newly formed Metro Pictures Corporation (later to become MGM films) as a poster artist.Motion Picture News Vol.12 no.3 p.60 July 24, 1915 Ernest and Elizabeth had two children, Hildegarde and Eben. During this period Haskell was doing much work in the line of creating etchings, in Maine as well as in California and Florida. When exhibited, these met with critical acclaim, so Haskell became known as a \\"fine\\" artist as well as a portraitist and poster lithographer. He belonged to the group of artists who were exhibited at Alfred Steiglitz' famed 291 Gallery in New York City. He also had one man shows at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, the Berlin Photographic Company and the Art Institute of Chicago among other venues. Haskell exhibited with the Brooklyn Society of Etchers from 1916 to 1922. Ernest Haskell served in World War I in the Camouflage Unit.The Most of John Held Jr. illustrations by John Held Jr. introduction by Marc Connelly copyright 1972 Stephen Greene Press He was one of the artists who developed camouflage painting for the United States Army to disguise battleships and to use on soldiers' uniforms.

Ernest Haskell by Dorothea Lange In 1920, at the studio of photographer Dorothea Lange, he met Emma Loveland Laumeister. They were married in San Francisco and returned to New York City, where twins Ernest Jr. and Josephine were born. The pattern of dividing time between New York and Maine continued for about four years. At that time, Haskell had been working in watercolors which were admired for their modern style. On November 1, 1925 he was returning to his family in Maine after organizing an exhibition of the new paintings in New York when he was involved in a fatal automobile accident near West Point in Phippsburg, Maine.The New York Times, Tuesday, November 3, 1925 \\"Ernest Haskell Dies in Auto Crash\\" The exhibition became a memorial show at the Macbeth Gallery in New York City.

The stupa is located in the Wat Phra Prathon Chedi Wora Viharn (), a temple in Nakhon Pathom, Thailand, 3 km east of Phra Pathommachedi. The name Phra Prathon Chedi means the holy stupa of Thona or Thanan (), name of an ancient measurement. According to legend after the cremation of Gautama Buddha, his relics were equally divided amongst 8 royal families and his disciples by using a golden Thona. This golden Thona eventually sent to ancient Nakhon Chai Si in Suvarnabhumi and kept inside a stone stupa in 590. King of Sri Lanka wanted the golden Thona, so he sent a prominent monk to ask the golden Thona from the King of Nakhon Chai Si. The king agreed in exchange of one Thona of holy relics of Buddha and built a new stupa to keep the holy relics, which is Phra Pathommachedi. In 656 King of Lavo ruled Nakhon Chai Si and rebuilt the stupa and named Phra Prathon Chedi. History =Dvaravati Period= The original of Phra Prathon Chedi has no historical record, but according to archaeological survey findings date back to the 4th century. Modern Historians believe that the stupa was the principal stupas of ancient Nakhon Pathom, the largest settlement of Dvaravati culture together with the nearby Phra Pathommachedi (Thai: ‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏õ‡∏ê‡∏°‡πÄ‡∏à‡∏î‡∏µ‡∏¢‡πå) during the 6th to the 8th centuries. Before excavation, archaeologists believed that the original structure of Phra Prathon Chedi was similar with the Great Stupa in Sanchi, India, with a simple hemispherical brick structure built over the relics of the Buddha with chatra, a parasol-like structure symbolising high rank, on the top of stupa. After excavation, the stupa was built in Dvaravati style with multi-tiers brick square shape stupa, similar with Borobudur in Indonesia, but in much smaller scale. =Legend of Phaya Gong and Phaya Phan= Since the origin of Phra Prathon Chedi is unknown, there are many legends about the stupa construction. The most famous legend is the legend of Phraya Gong and Phraya Phan[6] (Thai: ‡∏ï‡∏≥‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏Å‡∏á‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏û‡∏≤‡∏ô). The story is about a king of Nakhon Chai Si, Phraya Gong, had a baby boy, Phan, but the court astrologer predicted that Phan will commit fratricide in the future. Phraya Gong then abandoned Phan. The orphan baby had been unknowingly adopted by chidless Granny Hom. Granny Hom raised Phan in Ratchaburi, a vassal city state of Nakhon Chai Si. One day an elephant of the local lord was in rut and attacked people. Phan went to see the elephant and was able to subdue it. After Ratchaburi lord heard about heroic act of Phan, the lord adopted Phan as his son. Phan wanted to conquer Nakhon Chai Si of Phraya Gong, so he sent a letter to Phraya Gong for war elephant duel battle. Phan killed Phraya Gong, and demand Phraya Gong's wife to become his queen according to ancient custom. When the queen met Phan, she recognized him to be her son, and told him the truth. Shocked Phan, now became king and named Phraya Phan, executed old Granny Hom for not reveal the truth before he killed his father. After realised that he did a great sin by killing both father and a person who raised him, Granny Hom, in the year 26 BCE Phraya Phan consulted with a group of arhats how to atone for his sin. The arhats recommended Phraya Phan to build a great stupa at great height that even the birds can not fly over. Phraya Phan then built Phra Pathommachedi for his father and Phra Prathon Chedi for Granny Hom. =Khmer Empire and Pagan Invasion= After Khmer Empire annexed Dvaravati settlements including ancient Nakhon Pathom, in the 11th century, the stupa had been modified with a Khmer style temple on the top of stupa. Anawrahta of Pagan Kingdom invaded and plundered ancient Nakhon Pathom. Then the city and the stupa had been abandoned and later overgrown by the jungle. =Later Development= King Mongkut ordered the restoration of Phra Prathon Chedi. He also built Khmer style prang on the top of the stupa, as he believed the design of Phra Prathon Chedi was the same with Phra Pathommachedi. Also under his reign the Phra Prathon Chedi Temple also had a major renovation. Vajiravudh started excavation on Phra Prathon Chedi Temple ground, and found many historic artefects. Phra Prathon Chedi has been registered as a national heritage site in 1931. How ever in 1962 after long neglect Phra Prathon Chedi partially collapsed, due to the lack of budget or any help from the central Thai government, the abbot of Phra Prathon Chedi Temple restored the stupa to prevent any further collapse. In 1999 Phra Prathon Chedi has been restored to its Dvaravati form for the first time by the Department of Fine Arts.

The entire film was thought lost until 2002, when 22 minutes were rediscovered in the archive. Additional fragments have been compiled, the equivalent of about two and a half reels of film.

She was honoured by the Government of India, in 2014, by bestowing on her the Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian award, for her services to the field of mountaineering sport. Biography Everest North Face toward Base Camp Tibet Luca Galuzzi 2006 Mamta Sodha was born on 1 November 1979, at Kaithal, in the state of Haryana, in India, in a family with poor financial resources, as the eldest of three Girls and two boys. She lost her father, Laxman Dass Sodha, who worked as an inspector with the Haryana Food and Supplies Department, in 2004, and her mother, Mewa Devi, had to support the family with the help of her brothers. Mamta did her schooling at a local school in Kaithal and college studies at the RKSD College, Kaithal from where she secured her graduate degree, getting high grades. Subsequently, she passed her master's degree in Physical Education (MPhEd) from Kurukshetra University, in 2005 and joined the same university at the Shaheed Baba Deep Singh College of Physical Education, Haryana, as a lecturer. After the successful Everest climb, Government of Haryana absorbed her into Haryana Police Force. Mamata Sodha is now a Deputy Superintendent of Police with Haryana Police since 11 August 2010. Sporting achievements Mamta had a passion for rock climbing early on, a trait encouraged by her father. Soon, she made up her mind to climb Mount Everest one day for which she joined Nehru Institute of Mountaineering, in the state of Uttarakhand. Prior to embarking on the project, she scaled a few other peaks. She was a member of the IMF Golden Jubilee expedition team that scaled Phawararang peak in July 2008. Two months later, in October, she climbed the Mun Peak with another team, while on an expedition at McLeod Ganj. In August 2009, she summited Shri Kanth Peak with an all-women team. She has also scaled other peaks of varying heights such as Morni Peak, Kh√ºiten Peak, Inderhara Pass and Island Peak on various occasions. This was followed by an attempt on Idland (Imja-tse) Peak which she successfully accomplished in April 2010, just prior to the Mount Everest expedition. The total financial outlay for the Everest project was around 1.8 million. Mamta collected the money by way of contributions from several agencies and individuals such as Haryana state government (300,000), PWD Minister, Randeep Singh Surjewala (51,000), Kurukshetra member of parliament, Navin Jindal (500,000}, District Police Commissioner Amneet P Kumar (250,000) and various others and the project started in April 2010, with the encouragement of previous Everest climbers Bachendri Pal and Santosh Yadav. The expedition team consisted of 13 members, of which nine mountaineers were from United States, Denmark, Switzerland and Australia and the remaining four from India, including 16-year-old Arjun Vajpai. The team was led by the legendary Apa Sherpa, who held the world record of 19 successful climbs of Mount Everest. The team spent 40 days at Khumbu Glacier, where the team had set up their base camp, for acclimatisation. The route was the traditional South Col route in Nepal. The team, after periodic stop overs at three or four camps en route, finally reached the top around 20 May 2010. At 10.24 am, on 22 May, 2010, Mamta Sodha summited Mount Everest. After the Everest triumph, Mamta scaled the highest peak in Europe, Mount Elbrus, in 2012. Apart from being a mountaineer, Mamta Sodha excelled in handball, too. She was a member of the Haryana state girls team which secured runner up position at the 21st Junior Girls' National Handball Championship, held at Agra in November 1998. As a member of the Kurukshetra University team, she was a winner at the All India Inter-University Handball tournament in December 1998. In 2003, she was selected as a B1 grade sportsperson in Handball by the Sports and Youth Welfare department of Haryana Government. Mamta Sodha is also a member of National Adventure Club.

Biography Born in Fredericia, Krause was the daughter of a railway official. She studied at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts under Kr√¶sten Iversen and Ejnar Nielsen, graduating in 1933, the year when she first exhibited at the Kunstnernes Efter√•rsudstilling (Artists' autumn exhibition). In 1937, she married Viggo R√∏rup and settled with him in Odsherred for the rest of her life. Paintings Krause is remembered for her touching portraits of children but she also painted still-lifes of flowers and fruit as well as landscapes. The garden in Odsherred, the surrounding fields and scenes of everyday life at home with her husband and child were common motifs. After her husband's death in 1970, she travelled frequently, especially to France, where she painted the places and people she encountered. In addition, she painted scenes in restaurants and bars, and also in railway stations, including the Central Station in Copenhagen where people are rushing about or waiting for trains. He earlier paintings exhibit dull, rather earthy tones but she went on to employ stronger colouring, especially blues and greens, ultimately adopting a much lighter approach with delicate shades of red and purple. From broad brush-strokes, she moved to much looser, more sketchy techniques. Exhibitions Krause's works were widely exhibited in Denmark during her lifetime. In 1966, she joined Corner, founded by her husband and his friends in the 1930s, frequently exhibiting there. In 2013, Odsherreds Kunstmuseum arranged a major exhibition of her works.

Career Martell qualified for a few Pro Tours in the early 2000s, but without putting up any major finishes; he disappeared from the professional scene, and quit playing Magic for some time. However, after finishing college and moving to New York, Martell was invited to play at Jon Finkel's apartment, where many of the best players in the area came to play. Martell's first Pro Tour after returning to the game was Pro Tour San Juan 2010, which he qualified for via the Last Chance Qualifier. Martell finished 32nd in the event, qualifying himself for the next Pro Tour.

There is a nationwide numbering scheme consisting of national, provincial and regional routes, and within various urban areas there are schemes of metropolitan route numbering. Numbering In the nationwide numbering scheme, routes are divided into a hierarchy of three categories: national routes, which are the most important routes connecting major cities; provincial routes, which connecting smaller cities and towns to the national route network; and regional routes, which connect smaller towns to the route network. Route numbers are allocated to these classes as follows: * National routes: N1 to N20. * Provincial routes: R21 to R99. * Regional parallel routes: R101 to R120. (A regional route R1xy will consist of road segments formerly part of the national route Nxy that have been replaced by upgraded roads.) * Regional routes in the former Cape Province: R300 to R499. * Regional routes in the former Transvaal Province: R500 to R599. * Regional routes in KwaZulu-Natal: R600 to R699. * Regional routes in the Free State: R700 to R799. These numbers are allocated by the Route Numbering and Road Traffic Signs Sub Committee within the Roads Co- ordinating Body, an organisation which contains representatives from road authorities in national, provincial and local government. In metropolitan numbering schemes the local authority can designate routes consisting of M followed by any number, but it should not use numbers the same as those used by national, provincial or regional routes in the same area. This rule is not universally followed, for example in Johannesburg where there is both an N1 and an M1. The Pietermaritzburg-Hilton area and Krugersdorp are the only urban areas that does not form of a metropolitan municipality but still have metropolitan routes. The following metropolitan municipalities and their cities have metropolitan numbering schemes. * Buffalo City (East London) * City of Cape Town (Cape Town) * City of Johannesburg & Ekhuruleni (Johannesburg) including Krugersdorp which is in the West Rand * City of Tshwane (Pretoria) * Ethekwini (Durban) * Mangaung (Bloemfontein) * Nelson Mandela Bay (Port Elizabeth) * Pietermaritzburg-Hilton area (Pietermaritzburg) Lists of routes *List of national routes in South Africa *List of provincial routes in South Africa *List of regional routes in South Africa References Category:Roads in South Africa ","title":"Numbered routes in South Africa"},{"id":"43729752","title":"Gymnastics at the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics ‚Äì Girls' trampoline"},{"id":"43729762","text":"Ysaias Zamudio (born May 10, 1969) is a former professional boxer from Mexicali, Mexico who resides in Blythe, California.BoxRec for Ysaias Zamudio His ring nickname is \\"Kid Showtime\\". Professional boxing career Zamudio made his professional boxing debut on August 13, 1987, defeating Jerome Wilson, 1-2 coming in, at the Great Western Forum in Inglewood, California, by a four round unanimous decision as part of the Paul Banke-Jesus Poll fight's undercard. Less than a week later, he returned to the ring in San Diego, defeating Jose Hernandez at the Cortez Hotel on August 19 by first round knockout. This fight was significant because it was Zamudio's first knockout win as a professional. After three more wins, Zamudio faced Jose Robles in Mexicali on March 4, 1988, beating Robles by a second round knockout. This fight marked the first of six in a row held in Mexico for Zamudio, which included his first defeat as a professional, a ninth round disqualification defeat to the far more experienced, future world champion German Torres (56-10-3 coming in) on August 4 at the Plaza de Toros Calafia as part of the first Jorge Paez-Calvin Grove world title fight's undercard. First professional title challenge After his first loss, Zamudio returned to the United States, where on August 26, he outpointed 1-4 Ramon Solis over ten rounds at the Aviation Gym in Redondo Beach, California.

Second professional title challenge Zamudio then outpointed Rafael Morales on November 11, 1988 at Mexicali, before fighting Jose Manuel Diaz on April 4, 1989 at the Great Western Forum, once again, in Los Angeles, California. Despite having a record of only 3 wins and 17 losses, Diaz was allowed to compete for the vacant WBA's Americas' Flyweight title. This was a rematch of Zamudio's win over Diaz only two months before, when Zamudio beat him by a ten round decision win. The second time around, Zamudio left no chances, as he stopped Diaz in only three rounds to win the WBA's crown. Zamudio and Diaz were both floored simultaneously in round three, but Zamudio got up first. After one more fight (a ten round decision win over Jorge Ortega), Zamudio defended his regional title for the first time, meeting Martin Cardenas on June 28, 1989 at San Diego. Zamudio defeated Cardenas by a 12 round unanimous decision.

Two months after winning the NABF belt, Zamudio faced Willy Salazar in a rematch; on June 15, 1990 at Mexicali, Mexico, Salazar repeated his previous victory over Zamudio, reproducing their first fight's result with a ninth round technical knockout win over Zamudio. Zamudio returned to the win column on his next two bouts, a ten rounds decision win over Jose Angel Herrera and a 12 round decision over Tony DeLuca in defense of his NABF Flyweight title, before facing future world champion Jesus Chong of Mexico, also in defense of his NABF belt. On Monday, January 14, 1991, Zamudio beat Chong by a 12 round unanimous decision at the Great Western Forum in Inglewood, to retain the title. A points victory over Sergio Aguila followed.

A rematch was fought on July 22, 1991, one month and five days after their first bout. The second bout between Zamudio and Montiel was for Zamudio's NABF title, and Zamudio retained the belt by a twelve round unanimous decision in an undercard headlined by former world Heavyweight champion James Bonecrusher Smith. Three ten round decision wins followed the victory over Montiel and then Zamudio defended his title again, against Jamaican Richard Clarke. On April 20, 1992, Zamudio defeated Clark by an eight round technical decision. First world title challenge The win over Clarke gave Zamudio a world ranking on the WBC, one of the four major boxing governing organizations, and after five further victories (one first round knockout, one second round knockout and three ten round decision wins-three of which took place at the Great Western Forum in Inglewood, one at El Paso, Texas and one at Mexicali) Zamudio was able to fight Yuri Arbachakov for the latter's WBC world Flyweight title at the World Memorial Hall in Kobe, Japan. Zamudio lost a close but unanimous twelve round decision to the 15-0, 13 knockouts coming in-champion. Zamudio lost by only two points on one card and three on another (four on the third judge's card).

He lost a ten round split decision to Miguel Martinez, a boxer with a 27 wins, 7 losses and one draw (tie) record, in the Mexico fight, on June 27, 1994, being deemed loser of the bout by only one aggregate point (the two judges who scored against him both giving Martinez the win by a single point and the one who voted for him also seeing a one-point difference). On June 29, 1996, Zamudio scored a third round knockout of former WBO world champion Jose Quirino at Fantasy Springs Casino in Indio, California, which made the WBC rank him among the top challengers on the flyweight division once again. After two more wins, Zamudio travelled to Bangkok, Thailand, where he challenged the WBC's interim world flyweight champion Chatchai Sasakul, 28-1 coming into their bout, and lost by a twelve round unanimous decision at the Prince Palace Hotel, May 9, 1997. Final bouts and world title challenge Ysaias Zamudio then fought Alejandro Montiel for the WBC's Continental Americas' flyweight title on March 14, 1998 at Arizona Charlie's, in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Early life Mottershead was born in Sale Moor, Manchester. His father Albert Mottershead was a botanist and nurseryman. He had two brothers Stanley Saul and Charles Saul, a sister Norah and a half-brother Albert. Mottershead was taken to Belle Vue Zoological Gardens in Manchester in 1903 as a childhood treat after the end of the Second Boer War. He disliked seeing the animals confined in cages, and was determined to create a zoo without bars. As a youth, he experimented with aviaries, and tanks and runs for pet lizards and snakes. He left home aged 16 to become a fitness instructor. First World War After the outbreak of the First World War, George Mottershead joined the South Lancashire Regiment. At least two of his brothers joined the Manchester Regiment, and they all served on the Western Front in France. While on leave, Mottershead married Elizabeth Atkinson at St Mary Magdalen Church, Ashton-on- Mersey, in 1916. They had two daughters, Muriel (born 1917) and June (born 1926). In October 1916, at the Battle of the Somme, Mottershead suffered a bullet wound to his neck, injuring his spine. He was initially paralysed, and recuperated at Highfield Military Hospital in Knotty Ash. Contrary to the expected medical prognosis he eventually recovered the ability to walk (with a limp) after three years in a wheelchair. His brothers, Albert and Stanley Mottershead, were killed in the war. Lance Corporal Albert Mottershead was killed in October 1916 and is commemorated on the Tyne Cot Memorial; Private Stanley Mottershead died in December 1916 and is buried at Douchy-l√®s-Ayette war cemetery. Both are also commemorated on the war memorial at St Anne's Church, Sale Moor and the Sale war memorial. * Roll of Honour, St Anne's Church, Sale, Cheshire * Albert Mottershead, Commonwealth War Graves Commission * S.S. Mottershead, Commonwealth War Graves Commission * Albert (Bert) Mottershead, Trafford War Dead * Stanley Saul Mottershead, Trafford War Dead His brother Charles served with the Royal Flying Corps's School of Technical Training. Chester Zoo With his parents and young family, Mottershead moved to Shavington in the 1920s, and operated a successful market garden and florist, later selling pet birds. He started to show his stock of birds and his private collection of animals to the paying public. The Mottershead family moved to the Oakfield Estate in Upton by Chester in December 1930, paying ¬£3,500 for a site including Oakfield Manor, built around 1885 for Benjamin Chafers Roberts and now a Grade II listed building. They acquired two Himalayan black bears from a wildlife park in Matlock, and added monkeys, chimpanzees, birds, and reptiles. The local residents were concerned about the potential dangers of escaped animals, but, after a public inquiry, the Ministry of Health granted permission to open the zoo in April 1931, and Chester Zoo opened to the public on 10 June 1931. Mottershead founded the \\"North of England Zoological Society\\" in 1934. The zoo continued through the Second World War, accepting its first pair of elephants from a circus in 1941. Recognition Mottershead was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1973 New Year's Honours List. He was also awarded an honorary degree of Master of Science, and served as president of the International Union of Directors of Zoological Gardens (now the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums). After his death, his ashes were scattered on the zoo memorial garden dedicated to his wife Elizabeth who died in 1969. The garden is now the Chinese garden at the zoo. The story of George Mottershead's founding of Chester Zoo is the subject of a 2014 BBC television drama serial, Our Zoo. Mottershead is portrayed by Lee Ingleby.
