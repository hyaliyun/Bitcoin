To cover up the mass-killings, the Japanese soldiers burned the church down. However, Canadian missionary Dr. Frank W. Schofield witnessed the aftermath of the slaughter and published a report on the event. Background In 1919, two million Koreans organized peaceful protests against Japanese occupation in the March 1st Movement. In retaliation, Japanese authorities sent troops to violently suppress the demonstrations. Massacre On April 15, in the village of Jeamri, Japanese soldiers herded 29 residents, including children, into a Methodist church before firing at the building. Afterwards, the soldiers committed arson by lighting the church on fire and killing any surviving victims. Canadian doctor Frank Schofield heard news of the event and immediately visited the scene. Schofield then wrote a report titled \\"The Massacre of Chai-Amm-Ni\\" and published it in The Shanghai Gazette on May 27, 1919. Japanese cover-up In his diary, Japanese commander Taro Utsunomiya wrote that the incident would hurt the reputation of the Japanese Empire and acknowledged that the Japanese soldiers committed murder and arson. Utsunomiya's diary revealed that Japanese colonial authorities met and decided to cover up the incident.

History The estate is first mentioned in the Danish Census Book under the name Stighsburg and was then crown land. In the 14th century, Bjergbygaard came in the hands of Peder Karlsen and later his daughter, Christine, who was married to Mogens Johansen. He pledged the estate in 1371 and after that the ownership seems to have been divided between multiple owners. Jep Bille was later the sole owner of the estate but the ownership was then once again spread out on multiple owners. In the 16th century, all the stakes came in the hands of the Dresselbjerg family and Niels Andersen Dresselbjerg was at the time of his death in 1594 the sole owner of the estate. Bjergbygaard was then passed to his sons Anders and Hans Dresselbjerg. Their brother Vilhelm Nielsen Dresselberg,'s son-in-law, Frederik Parsberg, owned Bjergbygaard from 1616. His wife, Mette Dresselbjerg, died in 1635. He was then married a second time to Sophie Kaas. She bought the estate from her late husband's sons by his first wife. She ceded the estate to her son-in-law, Claus Maltesen Sehested, who sold it in 1691. The new owner was Johan Adolf de Clerque. In 1730, he sold it to Albrecht Philip von Eynden. Bjergbygaard changed hands a number of times over the next decades before it was acquired by Peter Johansen Neergaard in 1766. He expanded the main building and increased the size of the estate through the acquisition of more land. Bjergbygaard by Ferdinand Richardt in 1861 In 1803, Bjergbygaard was acquired by Cosmus Bornemann. He constructed a new main building. After his death, Bjergbygaard passed first to his widow and then to his son Philip Julius Bornemann. After Philip Julius Bornemann's death, Bjergbygaard passed to his grandson, Alphonsem Baron Walleen. In 1888, Bjergbygaard was acquired by count A. Brockenhuus-Schack. As a result of the lensafl√∏sningslov of 1919, he sold the estate in 1026 after first selling off land for 21 independent smallholdings. Lois Frances Booth, the wife of Prince Erik, Count of Rosenborg, purchased Bjergbygaard in 1931. The couple was divorced in 1937 and the following year Lois Frances Booth was married to brewer Thorkild Juelsberg. She lived on the estate until her death in 1941.

In April 2017, the Associated Press quoted a U.S. official as saying that although Cohen-Watnick had access to those kinds of intelligence materials, he did not play a role in helping Nunes gain access to the documents. According to a U.S. official, Cohen-Watnick was not involved in showing the material to Nunes, did not clear Nunes onto the White House grounds, did not review the material with Nunes, and was not even aware that the material was going to be shared with Nunes. Trump‚ÄìUkraine scandal Eisenberg ordered a transcript of a Trump call with Ukraine's president be moved to a highly classified server and played a role in the Justice Department's early handling of the Trump‚ÄìUkraine scandal. The whistleblower initially submitted concerns anonymously to Courtney Elwood, general counsel of the CIA. Elwood then contacted Justice Department officials and Eisenberg. Eisenberg was notified by both Fiona Hill and Alexander Vindman that they were concerned about inappropriate comments to Ukrainian officials by European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland and President Donald Trump. Per Vindman's testimony, Eisenberg instructed Vindman not to tell anyone about the Trump call to President Volodymyr Zelensky. In early November 2019, Eisenberg was subpoenaed to testify by the House Intelligence Committee but refused.

Biography Hugh Southern was born March 20, 1932 to Norman and Phyllis Margaret (Hiller) in Newcastle-on-Tyne, England. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in English language and Literature in 1956 from King's College Cambridge, England. After moving to New York from London in 1955, he became active in the theater community working as Treasurer for the Westport Country Playhouse in Connecticut. From 1959-1962 he was Administrative Manager of the Theatre Guild-American Theatre Society. From 1962-1965, he served as Assistant Director of the Repertory Theatre, Lincoln Center, and from 1965-1967 as its General Manager. During this period, Southern also advised the Producers of Expo 67 in Montreal. On the national front, Southern became Managing Associate for the San Francisco Opera leading its Western Opera Theater touring company. He was Acting Director of the New York State Council on the Arts and a Director of both the New Dramatists, and the Film Forum. From 1978-1985 he was a trustee for the American Actor's Fund. Memberships include Trustee for Manhattan Country School, New York City, where he was its Chairman, 1971-1974. From 1968 to 1982, Southern was the executive director of Theatre Development Fund, the nonprofit organization for the performing arts that works to make theatre affordable and accessible. During that time, Southern was responsible for creating the first TKTS booth to sell discount tickets for Broadway productions. The inaugural booth, a trailer donated by New York City's Parks Department, opened in June 1973 in Duffy Square. During Southern's tenure, Theatre Development Fund grew to be one of the largest service organizations for the performing arts in the country. Theater Development Fund now operates four TKTS booths in NYC. TKTS Booth @ Times Square (3619286756) Following his time with the Theatre Development Fund, Mr. Southern worked for the National Endowment for the Arts, the independent federal agency that funds, promotes, and strengthens the creative capacity communities across the country. He spent several years as deputy chairman before being named acting chairman in 1989. That year, one of the photos in an exhibition of the work of Andres Serrano, which was supported by a $15,000 NEA grant, drew the ire of the religious right. Southern's leadership during the controversy helped him land a position as General Manager of The Metropolitan Opera in 1989 after a ten-month search by the Met. Southern's tenure was brief and he resigned from the Met after nine months, stating that he had not found fulfillment in the position. Following this, Southern became a director for the Virginia Festival of American Film in Charlottesville, VA until he retired. Personal life In 1954, Southern married Jane Rosemary Llewellyn with whom he had two children, Hilary and William with the marriage ending in divorce. In 1988, he married Kathy Ayers Dwyer and they had one child, Jaime, and he remained married until his death. Southern died on July 15 in a hospital in Leesburg, Va. He was 87. His wife, Kathy Dwyer Southern, said the cause was pneumonia and congestive heart failure.

The United Kingdom - 42184/05 [2010] ECHR 338was heard by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), (Grand Chamber) in Strasbourg on 16th March 2010 on appeal from the European Court of Rights (ECHR), Fourth Section before Jean-Paul Costa (President), Christos Rozakis, Nicolas Bratza, Peer Lorenzen, Fran√ßoise Tulkens, Josep Casadevall, Karel Jungwiert, Nina Vajiƒá, Dean Spielmann, Renate Jaeger, Danutƒó Joƒçienƒó, Ineta Ziemele, Isabelle Berro-Lef√®vre, P√§ivi Hirvel√§, Luis L√≥pez Guerra, Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska, Zdravka Kalaydjieva. Prior to the judgment being handed down, the judges had met privately on 2 September 2009 and 27 January 2010.  Background  This is a Human Rights Act 1998 case under Article 34 of the Convention: :\\"The Court may receive applications from any person, non-governmental organization or group of individuals claiming to be the victim of a violation....of rights enshrined in the Convention or one of the protocols to it.\\" National Insurance Contributions are paid in the United Kingdom by employees and those that are self-employed, by those who earn an income over a set limit, and by employers of those employees. It is also possible for UK nationals living abroad to make National Insurance Contributions in order that they can maintain their social security record which may lead to a larger UK state pension on retirement. Examples of the social security benefits that are paid from National Insurance Contributions include Jobseeker's Allowance; Employment and Support Allowance (formerly known as incapacity benefit; Maternity Allowance; Widow‚Äôs Pension; Bereavement benefit; State pension; Child's Special Allowance; and Guardian's allowance. All of these benefits are financed by the UK government on a \\"pay as you go\\" system from the National Insurance Fund. If there is insufficient funds then the UK government finances them out of general taxation. The National Insurance Fund was also used to partly fund the National Health Service. paras 37,38 To qualify for a UK state pension, a person needs to reach a certain age. For men, this was 65 and for women, 60. In order to qualify for a \\"full\\" UK state pension, men needed 44 National Insurance qualifying years, and women needed 39. In the 2007 Pensions Act, this was changed to 30 qualifying years for men and women. In the 2014 Pensions Act, implemented in April 2016, this was changed to 35 qualifying years for men and women. For those individuals living in the UK who do not qualify for a UK state pension - there are other social welfare benefits that they can apply for. paras 39,40 The UK government is compelled by law to increase the UK state pension annually to maintain its value as prices rise. The UK state pension increases are only available to residents of the UK - UK pensioners living abroad are not entitled to the increases. There are exceptions to this for those UK pensioners who live in countries that have negotiated bilateral social security agreements with the UK. Bilateral social security agreements cover other aspects of social welfare besides the increases to the UK state pension such as health benefits. The UK has reciprocal social security agreements with the European Economic Area countries and with a number of other disparate countries (such as the United STates) Social security bilateral agreements were negotiated between 1948 and 1992. There were agreements with Australia (1953), New Zealand (1956) and Canada (1959) but these did not require payment of an up-rated UK state pension. The agreement with Australia was terminated by Australia in March 2001 because of the refusal of the UK government to uprate the state pension to UK pensioners living in Australia. In 1995, amendments to the Pensions Bill were tabled giving the increase to all UK pensioners regardless of where they lived. The cost to uprate these pensions, and also to pay for them to be backdated, was estimated to cost ¬£4 billion which represented 0.79% of the 2008-09 Pension Budget. These amendments were defeated in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. The 1952 International Labour Organization's Social Security Convention provides that the old age security benefit can be suspended by UK domestic law if the recipient of the old age security lives abroad. This is also supported by Article 68 of the 1964 European Code of Social Security and Article 74 of the 1990 European Code of Social Security The 1982 International Law Organization allowed that social security rights could be extended to UK pensioners living abroad subject to bilateral agreements being negotiated. A Council of Europe initiative in 2008, tried to negotiate a new framework for coordinating social security schemes but each of the countries within the European Union decided to keep the bilateral agreements that were already in place. paras 42-51  Judgment  Annette Carson and other applicants and their legal team prior to first hearing before the ECHR Grand Chamber - 2 September 2009 The same 13 applicants were appealing against the decision of the European Court of Human Rights - Fourth Section case. The Court summarized the circumstances of each of the Applicants. paras. 10-24 The Court then reviewed the domestic proceedings that Carson had brought against the UK government, including Lord Carswell's dissenting opinion in the House of Lords Appeal. The Applicants contended that their human rights had been violated under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 \\\\- \\"Right to property\\" on its own and in conjunction with Article 14 of the Convention and Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights in conjunction with Article 14 (six applicants). The applicants also argued that they were being discriminated against because they were not receiving the annual increase to their UK state pension whilst others in a similar position to them were. paras. 25-36; para 52 The ECHR Fourth Section had previously decided that the complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 taken alone was inadmissible. It also decided that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 taken in conjunction with Article 14 was admissible, and that Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8 did not need to be examined. para 53 Under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the adding of \\"country of residence\\" in determining whether a UK pensioner should receive the annual increase to the UK state pension involved a \\"deprivation or interference\\" with the right to receiving the annual increase. In addition, the \\"possession\\" that UK pensioners have (in the UK state pension that they receive) was being eroded every year for which they did not receive the annual increase. The applicants argued that the ECHR Fourth section had only dealt with the first of the two complaints above. With respect to Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8 had not been heard in UK court proceedings brought by Carson (alone), and therefore should not have been dismissed so lightly in the ECHR Fourth Section. paras 54,55 The UK government argued that Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8 for all the applicants (other than Carson) should be declared inadmissible since they had not brought proceedings before the UK courts. Since Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8 had not been tested in the UK courts, it should be declared inadmissible to this Court. para 56 The Court maintained that, under UK domestic law, under Article 1 Protocol No. 1, the applicants do not have a right to receive the annual uprating. This had been dismissed by the ECHR Fourth Section and cannot be appealed. The Court did not accept the UK government's objections to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 for the 12 applicants that had not filed domestic proceedings in the UK, and given that Carson had failed in that regard, there was no point in them litigating in the UK. The Court declared that Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8 should be inadmissible, because this had not been tested in the UK domestic courts. paras 57-60 The Court accepted that the UK government was better placed to understand \\"..what is in the public interest on social or economic grounds\\". The Court discounted the hardship that \\"freezing\\" the UK state pension had on the applicants, and thousands like them, since \\"any welfare system, to be workable, may have to use broad categorizations to distinguish between different groups in need\\". The question before the court was whether different groups of UK pensioners were in similar situations such that one group was discriminated against over the other. Article 14 by itself has no meaning in law, since it is an anti-discrimination law, without identifying who or what is being discriminated against, so, in order to be used the applicants case must be \\"within scope\\" of one or more of the underlying Article(s). The ECHR Fourth Section had found that the applicants case was within the scope of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. The Court agrees with this assessment, and there was no argument relating to this from the UK government. The ECHR Fourth Section had agreed that \\"country of residence\\" fell within scope of Article 14. paras 61-66 The Applicants maintained that the treating of \\"residence\\" was an aspect of \\"personal status\\" and was consistent with previous decisions. In addition, their position is that whilst moving abroad is a question of \\"free choice\\" it is not so if it is driven by the need or desire to be close to family members. The UK government had conceded in the UK domestic courts that Carson's \\"foreign residence\\" was protected under Article 14, but argued that moving abroad was a matter of choice. The third party, Age Concern, and Help the Aged emphasized the importance of family support in old age. The Court supported the decision by the ECHR Fourth Section in concluding that \\"place of residence\\" is an aspect of \\"personal status\\". paras 67-71 The Court understood that there were three cohort of UK pensioners - those that live in the UK; those that live abroad but in a country that has a reciprocal social security agreement with the UK; and those that live abroad but in countries that do not have reciprocal social security agreements with the UK. In addition, the UK's social welfare and pension system was primarily for UK pensioners living in the UK. The Court did not believe that the pensioners in the second and third categories could be compared against each other. para 72 = The Applicants submission = The Applicants argued that there was no difference between the UK pensioners who live abroad and therefore they should be treated the same regarding the annual UK state pension increase. They agreed with the dissenting opinions expressed by Lord Carswell (House of Lords Appeal), and by Judge Garlicki, President, ECHR Fourth Section that UK Pensioners will have spent major parts of their life working in the UK, and all would have made the same National Insurance Contributions, regardless of where they had chosen to live, and therefore they are all entitled to the same UK state pension. The UK state pension was a contributory system and the UK government themselves had made it available to some UK pensioners living abroad. Regardless of \\"country of residence\\" all UK pensioners would want to maintain the same standard of living. There was no empirical evidence to support differences in social economic conditions in countries where uprating was paid and in those countries where it wasn't. The Court should not put too much emphasis on the 1952 International Labour Organisation Convention, since this focused on social security systems in general and not specifically related to contributory pensions in particular. Under UK domestic law, the existence of reciprocal arrangements was not a requirement for the UK state pension to be increased. In addition, there was no pattern between those countries where reciprocal arrangements with the UK existed and those countries where they didn't. Once the UK government had decided that all pensioners should receive a UK state pension (regardless of which country they lived in), then it was irrational not to pay the same amount to everyone on an on-going basis. paras 73-78 = The UK Government's submission = The UK Government restated that the UK social security and taxation system is designed for the benefit of residents of the UK. They also argued that there were distinct differences between those pensioners living abroad that received the annual increase versus those that don't. There was no practical way in which the factors that influence the annual increase - inflation, economic growth, and fluctuations in exchange rates - could be compared (or aligned) between countries. The UK government contended that National Insurance Contributions paid into the National Insurance Fund cannot be equated to contributions to an occupational or private pension. There are no guaranteed entitlements. UK pensioners living abroad fall into two groups - those that live in countries where social security bilateral agreements with the UK have been negotiated (in which case, the UK pensioners receive the annual increase) and those that live in countries that do not have social security bilateral agreements with the UK (in which case, the UK pensioners do not receive the annual increase). The UK government argued that these are two different groups of pensioners and the UK government were well with their rights to treat them differently. If they were to be treated the same, then this would \\"negate the power to enter into bilateral treaties of this kind\\". paras 79-82 = The Courts Assessment = The Applicants believed that they were in the same position as those UK pensioners that lived abroad and received the annual increase - \\"National Insurance Contributions have no exclusive link to retirement pensions\\". They form part of the revenue which is used to pay a number of social security benefits, and because of this, the two different groups of UK pensioners living outside the UK can be regarded as the same. National Insurance Contributions go towards maintaining a minimum standard of living for residents of the UK. UK pensioners living outside the UK cannot be compared with those living in the UK due to \\"differing economic and social conditions\\". *The Court did not believe that the two groups of UK pensioners living abroad (those countries that have bilateral agreements, and those that don't) could be regarded as the same. paras 84-90 The Court agreed unanimously that the complaint under Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 8 inadmissible; Rejected unanimously the UK government's preliminary objection concerning the admissibility of the complaints of the applicants, other than Carson herself, and agreed, by eleven votes to six that there had been no violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. = Dissenting Opinions = The six dissenting judges agreed that Article 14, taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No 1 had been violated, and that Article 14 on its own had also been violated. All of the Applicants were in the same boat even though their countries of residence may be different. The majority approach regarding \\"residence\\" seemed self contradictory, and inconsistent with the spirit of Article 14, and the conclusion of the majority regarding the characteristics of UK pensioners living in the UK and those living in \\"frozen\\" countries was wrong because, other than \\"country of residence\\", there is no difference between UK pensioners living abroad - they all paid into the same system and therefore all of them are entitled to a UK State Pension which is based on the number of contributing years. Whilst the majority of the judges decided that even though all UK pensioners living abroad had made equal contributions to the National Insurance system that does not mean that they can be treated the same. The majority argued that the State pension has multiple sources, but those dissenting could not see the relevance of that and because all UK pensioners living abroad paid into the system they should all be treated the same. The right to a UK state pension and the right to be treated the same is based on the rules by which a pensioner receives a UK state pension. All pensioners living abroad (whether or not they received the annual increase) had a common characteristic - their buying power was decreased every year based on the drop in currency exchange rates. Those pensioners who lived in the UK received inflationary increases every year. Those pensioners living abroad who received the increase received the same increase as those in the UK regardless of the increase of the inflationary rate in their own country. For those countries that had higher inflationary rates then UK pensioners living in those countries would find their UK state pension depreciating compared to those pensioners living in the UK. Those pensioners living in countries like South Africa who did not receive annual increases found that their UK state pension was depreciating at an even faster rate. In Carson's case this was significant. In the period 2000-2005 she found that her weekly UK state pension had fallen by 28%. Comparing this to a pensioner living in the UK the comparative loss increased further with time. The dissenting judges could see no relevant differences between the those UK pensioners that lived abroad and received the annual increase and those that lived abroad and didn't receive the increase, and could see no justification for such a radical difference in the UK state pension received. In addition, they were not persuaded by the UK government to decide otherwise and that their argument went against the spirit of Article 14 of the Convention. Whilst the UK state pension system is designed to ensure that the financial needs of pensioners living in the UK are taken into account the dissenting judges could see no justification for treating them unfavorably and unequally. There will always be differences in the increases in inflation for each country and the impact that this has on the buying power of the UK state pension. The fall in the sterling exchange rate has been consistent for over a century, and the impact that this has on UK pensioners living overseas in \\"frozen\\" countries can cause irreparable deterioration in the real value of their UK state pension. The complete denial of any increases represents a disproportionate difference which cannot be justified. UK pensioners living overseas do not receive health benefits, such as the National Health Service and nor do they pay UK taxes - this is no reason as to why they should not receive the annual increase since, UK taxes forgone are less than the housing, healthcare and social welfare benefits which are payable to pensioners living in the UK but not those who live abroad. Dissenting opinions The UK Government prevailed; Carson and the other Applicants lost their appeal and they had run out of Courts to appeal to.

It is an arched road bridge with sculptural decoration by Josef Winterhalder. It is the second largest Czech bridge with the richest sculptural decoration following the Charles Bridge hence it is sometimes referred to as the \\"Little Charles Bridge\\". It was built by Count V√°clav Adrian of Enkenvoirt in 1737.The statues were added around 1744 when they were ordained. Today the bridge is designed for pedestrian traffic only.  Description  The bridge that spans the Oslava river has a straight, unbroken ground plan, it is 62 meters long and 8 meters wide. The bridge deck is slightly arched and thus the highest bridge point is 6.2 meters above the river. The railing is 0.5 meters wide, each of the three triangular pillars, which are connected by elliptical arches, is 2 meters wide. The span of the largest arch is 10 meters, its height is 5 meters. A total of twenty limestone sculptures beautifies the bridge, ten on each side. They are about 2 m high, made of one piece of material. The bridge itself is built of stone and brick, it is plastered. The road is paved with granite cobblestones. In the past, the bridge was built to connect the N√°mƒõ≈°≈• nad Oslavou castle with the town. In modern days a main thoroughfare between T≈ôeb√≠ƒç and Brno led through it until 1986.  History  The bridge was built after 1733, when the estate owner Jan Filip Werdenberk died. The estate went to V√°clav Adrian of Enckevoirt who initiated the bridge construction on the site of a previous bridge pulled down by the flood. New bridge's decoration was already in the patronage of the other estate owners ‚Äì Marie Francis and Hanus Leopold of Kufstein. Both were very pious Catholics and thus had the bridge fitted with twenty statues of saints and angels. The ensemble was to be completed in 1744. Two years later Haugwitz family bought the estate. In 1812 the bridge was damaged by the July flood and Henry William III Haugwitz had it repaired. The bridge underwent additional reconstructions in 1907, in 1932 and in 1984. In 1984 the sculptures were restored as well and their copies were made. The originals were placed in the castle, in the underground hall called Lutheran. During the great flood of 1985, the bridge was not significantly damaged, however it suffered from the heavy traffic, on average 5000 cars per day. One year later a new bridge over the Oslava river was completed and all the bridge traffic was diverted to it. Further reconstruction took place in 1989 and was completed three years later. However, in 2019 it was announced that the bridge is in a state of disrepair despite the 1989 reconstruction. At that time a reinforced concrete slab spanning the stone arches was put in to strengthen the bridge structure. However, it prevented it from expanding and shrinking with temperature changes instead and this caused cracks to develop in its structure. New reconstruction is scheduled to start in 2020 with the budgeted cost in millions of CZK.  Statues  On the bridge there are 16 statues of saints and 4 statues of angels created between 1737 and 1744. Originally it was assumed that all the statues were sculpted by Josef Winterhalder the Elder, but a formal analysis and preserved sketches proved that he involved in the creation of only eight to twelve statues. However, the rest of the figurative decoration was created by other authors, mainly by the Czech sculptor Alexander Jel√≠nek, according to his design. The angels at both ends of the bridge, the Archangel Gabriel, the Archangel Michael, the Archangel Rafael and the angel at the gates of heaven, were supposed to protect the entrance to the town. The statues of saints represent a celestial army with patrons of the town and the owners of the estate. They are mostly saints who were popular at the time the sculptures were designed and who are often portrayed (St. John of Nepomuk, St. Anne, St. Francis, St. Leopold, St. Wenceslaus, St. Theresa, St. Cajetan, St. Philip of Neri).  Recognition  It was declared a Czech cultural monument in 1958. It is part of the N√°mƒõ≈°≈• nad Oslavou urban monument zone since 1990. In 2012 the Czech National bank issued a 5000 CZK commemorative gold coin as part of the Bridges in the Czech Republic series. The coin was designed by Martin Da≈°ek.

The act was assented on 2 October 2019 and commenced with immediate effect. With the commencement of the act, New South Wales became the last state or territory in Australia to decriminalise abortion. Legislative features The Abortion Law Reform Act 2019 allows a medical practitioner to perform an abortion on a person who is not more than 22 weeks pregnant and can give informed consent. If the person lacks the capacity to give informed consent to the termination, the medical professional can obtain permission from a person lawfully authorised to give consent on the person's behalf. Abortions after the 22 weeks gestation period can be performed if the specialist medical practitioner has consulted with another specialist medical practitioner. Medical practitioners are also required to assess whether the patient will need counselling. The Act also requires conscientious objecting medical practitioners to inform the patient about their conscientious objection and to provide them with information about accessing other medical practitioners and transferring the patient to another practitioner or health service willing to conduct the termination. The Act also requires medical practitioners to provide appropriate medical care and treatment to a person born as a result of a termination. The Act removes abortion from Section 4(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. It makes it an offence for an unqualified person to carry out or to assist in a termination; punishable by seven years imprisonment. The Act also makes it an offence to intimidate someone into having an abortion performed including for the purpose of sex selection. In addition, it is also an offence to intimidate someone into not having a termination performed. History =Legislative passage= The Abortion Law Reform Act 2019 was first introduced as the Reproductive Health Care Reform Bill into the New South Wales Parliament's lower house, the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, by independent Member of Parliament (MP) Alex Greenwich on 1 August 2019. The private member's Bill had fifteen sponsors including New South Wales Health and Medical Research Minister Brad Hazzard. MPs were granted a conscience vote on the Bill. The Bill passed its third reading with amendments on 8 August 2019; with 59 in favour and 31 against. The bill attracted heated demonstrations and counter-demonstrations by both pro-choice and pro-life groups. The Reproductive Health Care Reform Bill was then introduced to the Parliament's upper house, the New South Wales Legislative Council, by the NSW Labor upper house leader Penny Sharpe on 20 August 2019. The Bill passed its third reading with amendments on 25 September 2019. The amended bill was then returned to the Legislative Assembly as the Abortion Law Reform Bill on 26 September 2019. The Legislative Assembly accepted the amendments on the same day. These amendments included requiring that terminations after 22 weeks be performed at a public hospital; making attempts to forcibly coerce or prevent an abortion a criminal offence punished by two years imprisonment; requiring a medical practitioner to provide medical care and treatment to a child born as a result of termination; and banning sex-selection abortions. The Bill was granted royal assent on 2 October 2019 and became law.

She is best known for her 1946 novel Desert Town and the 1970 supernatural thriller The Possession of Joel Delaney, both of which were adapted into films. Life and career Stewart was born in San Francisco in 1922. She grew up in Los Angeles with her father, a promoter of silver mines. Her first published works were serialized stories for Collier's magazine. The first of them, first published as \\"Bitter Harvest\\" from November 24 to December 8, 1945, was quickly optioned by Hollywood producer Hal B. Wallis and became the basis of Desert Fury, a film noir by Lewis Allen starring Lizabeth Scott, John Hodiak, and Burt Lancaster.. Stewart later developed the story into her first full-length novel with the title Desert Town. After this early success, Stewart continued to submit material to Collier's, often coming-of-age stories that were popular in the slicks. She wouldn't publish another novel until 1962, The Stars Abide. This was followed by several other books sharing the themes she had established in her debut: odd love triangles, dysfunctional families, and more or less explicit homosexual relationships. At least one of those books, The Surprise Party Complex, dealing with disenchanted teenagers living in Hollywood, seems to have been turned into a spec script, but no film was produced. After a detour toward the historical novel with Casey in 1968, Stewart finally settled as an author of thrillers with supernatural elements in the 1970s, starting with The Possession of Joel Delaney, which became her second title to be adapted into a film, directed by Waris Hussein and starring Shirley MacLaine and Perry King. Stewart's final novel, The Nightmare Candidate, was published in 1980. For much of her adult age she lived with her husband in Key West, Florida, where she died in 2006. Reception and impact While Desert Town has been marketed as an early example of pulp fiction, Stewart's early novels in particular have been praised for the depth hidden beneath the raunchy dialogue and the relationships between innocent females and almost clich√©d males. Author and poet Sarah Key wrote that Stewart's female characters were \\"ahead of their time, often outcasts from conventional society, sometimes aided by supernatural forces\\". Stewart's work is also noted for its early depictions of homosexual relationships. Noir expert Eddie Muller called the film adaptation of Desert Town \\"the gayest movie ever produced in Hollywood's golden era\\".Eddie Muller: Dark City: The Lost World of Film Noir, St. Martin's, New York 1998, , p. 183.

Situated in Olympic National Park, its nearest higher peak is Mount La Crosse, to the northeast, and an unnamed glacier lies in the north cirque between the two peaks. The Anderson massif lies to the north of White Mountain. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Quinault River and Duckabush River. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, White Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Olympic Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Olympic Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall (Orographic lift). As a result, the Olympics experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. In terms of favorable weather, June to September are the best months for climbing the mountain. Geology The Olympic Mountains are composed of obducted clastic wedge material and oceanic crust, primarily Eocene sandstone, turbidite, and basaltic oceanic crust. The mountains were sculpted during the Pleistocene era by erosion and glaciers advancing and retreating multiple times.

Serving as an origin story for protagonist Nathan Drake from the video games of the same name created by Amy Hennig, the film stars Tom Holland as Drake and Mark Wahlberg as his future mentor Victor Sullivan along with a supporting cast that includes Antonio Banderas, Sophia Taylor Ali and Tati Gabrielle. Uncharted is scheduled to be theatrically released in the United States on July 16, 2021 in IMAX, RealD 3D, and Dolby Cinema by Sony Pictures Releasing.  Premise  The film will serve as a prequel to the games, while revealing the origins of Nathan Drake and Victor Sullivan.  Cast  * Tom Holland as Nathan Drake: A young fortune hunter who claims to be a descendant of famed English explorer Sir Francis Drake. * Mark Wahlberg as Victor Sullivan: A fellow fortune hunter who becomes Nate's mentor and father figure. * Antonio Banderas * Sophia Taylor Ali * Tati Gabrielle  Production  = Development = In 2008, film producer Avi Arad stated that he was working with a division of Sony to develop the film adaptation of Uncharted. In response to a question posed to Richard Lemarchand, lead game designer of Naughty Dog, on whether he would like to see a film adaptation of Uncharted, he replied \\"no comment\\". Since then, Columbia Pictures has confirmed that an Uncharted film is being developed. The film was at first to be written by Thomas Dean Donnelly and Joshua Oppenheimer and produced by Avi Arad, Charles Roven, and Alex Gartner. As of June 30, 2009, it was confirmed that the Uncharted film had been in development for the last year-and-a-half. Nathan Fillion expressed an interest in playing Nathan Drake, and started a campaign on Twitter to encourage fans to support him in the endeavor. In an August 2010 interview, Naughty Dog told PlayStation University how close they really were with the development of the movie and that they had trust with all who were working on it. On October 8, 2010, it was announced by Doug Belgrad and Matt Tolmach, co-presidents of Columbia Pictures, that David O. Russell had been set to write and direct the film, an action-adventure based upon the first game in the series. The film would be produced by Avi Arad, Charles Roven, and Alex Gartner. Following a screening of Russell's film, The Fighter, he was approached by a fan of the Uncharted series who asked whether he had considered Nathan Fillion for the role of Nathan Drake for the upcoming film due to the high number of requests for him to fulfill the role. Russell was unaware of the interest in Fillion and who he was and seemed to quickly dismiss the idea. On November 24, 2010, an interview with Mark Wahlberg was published by MTV with the actor discussing his involvement in the film adaptation of the popular franchise. He stated that Russell was currently writing the script and was excited for what he had in store, hoping to shoot in the middle of 2011: \\"I'm obviously in whatever David wants to do but the idea of it is so off the charts: Robert De Niro being my father, Joe Pesci being my uncle. It's not going to be the watered- down version, that's for sure.\\" On May 26, 2011, it was reported that Russell had departed the film to direct Silver Linings Playbook. On July 6, Variety reported that Neil Burger was stepping in for Russell. Burger landed the offer after the studio and producers Avi Arad, Charles Roven and Alex Gartner sparked to his new take on the film. Burger spoke out about the film in July, saying the following: > We're re-writing the script from scratch, and I'm just jumping into that > literally right now, about to close the deal and leap off. Until the > screenplay is written you never know who's going to be acting in it or not. > But there are a lot of good actors out there who even look like Nathan Drake > and who could do it. I love the project, I think it's a great adventure and > it's a wild insane ride ... the game is and the movie will be. I mean it has > pretty great character at its core, Nathan is a bit of a con man, a hustler > ... knows his stuff, ballsy..it's great. Absolutely. And then you know you > have to do what a movie does best, as well ... build on what's cool about > the game and then make it into a movie. Yeah there will be (balance) in this > one, this one is a very great adventure, and it's just a matter of pulling > out the very cool intense stuff that works for the film story, and making > sure the story supports those elements and also makes us really connected to > the character. On August 23, 2012, Burger dropped out to work on Divergent and the studio hired the husband and wife team of Marianne and Cormac Wibberley to rewrite the film. In an interview with IGN, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg said they were asked to write the film multiple times, but declined all of them. On February 4, 2014, Deadline reported that Seth Gordon would direct the film with the latest script being written by David Guggenheim. Production was set to begin in early 2015. The film was originally scheduled for release on June 10, 2016. On November 12, 2014, the studio hired Mark Boal to write the film. After Wahlberg, Chris Pratt was in talks to portray Nathan Drake, but he reportedly declined the offer. On June 24, 2015, Seth Gordon left the project to work on Baywatch. In April 2015, the script written by David Guggenheim was leaked, having been obtained in the Sony Pictures hack. On August 5, 2015, Sony Pictures Entertainment pushed the film's release date back to June 30, 2017. In an interview with Game News Official, Nathan Drake's voice actor Nolan North stated that he believed that fans did not want a movie. Charles Roven did reveal to Collider that what they were working on was pretty exciting, there was a director that they did not have at the moment, and they were not ready to cast that vote until they were actually ready to cast. In April 2016, Neil Druckmann, who had worked on previous Uncharted games, said that the most important aspect of the film is the character relationships. On July 29, 2016, Variety reported that Joe Carnahan was writing the draft of the film's script. On September 1, 2016, the film was removed from Sony's release calendar due to not having a director or cast, but Sony was still moving forward with the film. On October 25, 2016, Shawn Levy was announced to be directing the film. Carnahan said to Collider that he and Levy are knowledgeable about the game, and had been hard at work getting the characters right. The filming was set to begin in early 2017. In early January 2017, Carnahan posted a photo on his Instagram to show that the script of the film had been completed. In May 2017, Tom Holland was cast as a young Nathan Drake, with the movie serving as a prequel to the games. Television writer Rafe Judkins was brought on to rework the script. On December 19, 2018, it was announced that Levy had departed the film to work on Free Guy. On January 14, 2019, Variety reported that Dan Trachtenberg had signed on to direct the film. In June 2019, The Hollywood Reporter confirmed that the movie is set to release on December 18, 2020. On August 22, 2019, Deadline reported that Dan Trachtenberg had exited the film, with the film scheduled to go into production in early 2020. The film will become the first feature production of Sony's PlayStation Productions. On September 27, 2019, The Hollywood Reporter informed that Travis Knight will direct the film. In November, Wahlberg returned to the project to star alongside Holland in the role of Victor Sullivan. In December 2019, Knight left the project due to scheduling conflicts with Holland, which resulted in the film losing its December 18, 2020 release date. = Pre-production = In January 2020, Ruben Fleischer entered talks to replace Knight as director, with the film's release date pushed back to March 5, 2021. In February 2020, Fleischer was confirmed as director, with the film's plot serving as a prequel to the games. The film will take inspiration from the fourth game in the series, Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. In March, Antonio Banderas, Sophia Taylor Ali and Tati Gabrielle were added to the cast, with a new script from Art Marcum and Matt Holloway. = Filming = Principal photography began on March 16, 2020, shooting in areas around Berlin. Production was expected to take place at Babelsberg Studio, before moving to Spain. Filming was shut down in mid-March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was believed filming had resumed on July 15, 2020, however, Sony Pictures clarified, while production has not yet resumed, they were undergoing preparations with the hope to start production soon. Production officially resumed on July 20, shooting in areas around Germany, with proper social distancing and mask requirements being implemented on and off the set. On August 5, 2020, Banderas temporarily left production after he tested positive for COVID-19, during the pandemic. On August 26, 2020, Banderas recovered from COVID-19, with the intention of returning to production imminently. On September 16, 2020, filming moved to Berlin, with set photos being released online.  Marketing  In May 2020, Sony entered in a promotional partnership with Hyundai Motor Group to showcase their new models and technologies in the film.  Release  Uncharted is scheduled to be theatrically released on July 16, 2021 in IMAX, RealD 3D, and Dolby Cinema by Sony Pictures Releasing. The film was originally set for release on June 10, 2016, but was delayed to June 30, 2017. The film was later delayed to December 18, 2020, and then to March 5, 2021, after Knight's departure. It was further delayed to October 8, 2021, with Ghostbusters: Afterlife taking its release date due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film was then moved up to July 16, 2021, taking the original release date of the untitled Spider-Man: Far From Home sequel.

It was co-founded by Beth Gould and Martin Rowe in 1994 and released its final issue in 2007. Scholar Gary Francione says Satya became the main journal that promoted animal welfare after the demise of The Animals' Agenda in 2002. The magazine was available free at restaurants and health food stores in New York City and its content was eclectic, blending lifestyle articles with political and intellectual ones, and tackling both animal rights and social justice issues. Satya was named for Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy of Satyagraha and its stated mission was to increase \\"dialogue among activists from diverse backgrounds and engaging readers in ways to integrate compassion into their daily lives.\\" Regular contributors to Satya included scholar Rynn Berry and author Mark Hawthorne. Ecofeminist author pattrice jones wrote her 2007 book Aftershock: Confronting Trauma in a Violent World after an article she wrote for the magazine. Among the many other authors and activists who collaborated with Satya are Peter Singer, Carol J. Adams, Matt Ball, Howard Lyman, John Robbins and Will Potter. In 1999, Martin Rowe edited the book The Way of Compassion: Survival Strategies for a World in Crisis based on the work of Satya. It was well received by scholar Richard Foltz. Authors Pete McCormack and pattrice jones praised Satya's approach and articles. Legal scholar Gary Francione criticized it for focusing on animal welfare politics instead of abolitionist veganism, which, according to him, is the only effective strategy to reduce systematic animal suffering. For their part, moral philosopher Peter Singer and author Bruce Friedrich wrote an article in Satya pointing out that countries with stronger animal welfare laws have also higher rates of veganism and vegetarianism, and that their implementation has placed the issue before millions of people as important.

Since 2002 she has also been an advocate for UK state pension parity for UK expatriates.  Early life  Born 1 September 1940 in Brighton, England, Carson is the only daughter of Harry Groombridge, musician and bandleader who died in 1960. She was educated at Mary Datchelor Girls‚Äô School in London and the Royal College of Music where she studied violin with Alan Loveday. In 1960, she married US actor Robert Allen Carson (aka Paul Carson), marriage dissolved 1966. Career = Aviation and aerobatics = In the 1980s Carson was British Delegate to the Aerobatics Commission (CIVA) of the F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale (FAI), and was elected Secretary of CIVA and Chairman of its Judging Sub-Committee. She served in organisational roles including Contest Director, British Team Manager and International Jury member. In 1984 she co-wrote (with Eric M√ºller) Flight Unlimited. In 1986 Carson published Flight Fantastic: The Illustrated History of Aerobatics, earning the FAI's Paul Tissandier Diploma. In 1998, Carson contributed articles to Encyclopaedia Britannica on Aerobatics and Stunt Flying. In September 2019 Carson published a new aviation biography Camel Pilot Supreme: Captain D V Armstrong DFC, with Pilot magazine critic Philip Whiteman saying: \\"Deeply researched, hugely informative\\" = PR and advertising= In 1989 Carson relocated to work in Johannesburg, South Africa as a copywriter at Ogilvy & Mather, Grey Response, D‚ÄôArcy Direct and Bates International, winning several local and international awards, including a 1991 SPADA (South Africa); a 1992 DMA International Gold Echo; and a 1997 DMA International Silver Echo. Carson subsequently freelanced while producing biographical works: Jeff Beck: Crazy Fingers, published USA 2001, with Q-Magazine critic Michael Leonard saying: \\"The finest and probably final word\\". = Books on King Richard III= Richard III With a lifelong interest in King Richard III of England Carson published Richard III: The Maligned King (2008, 2009, 2013, 2017), a revisionist analysis of his reign based on non-Tudor sources. Carson concluded that the King's remains still lay under the Greyfriars Church in Leicester where he was originally buried and that the site ‚Äòwould now probably lie beneath the private car park of the Department of Social Services‚Äô editions of 2008, 2009, pp. 269-270. While she was still in South Africa the Looking For Richard Project was initiated in the UK and following her return in 2011 Carson was invited to join the Project as historical consultant. The Project's aim was to find the lost grave of Richard III and his mortal remains which meant excavating the same Social Services car park that Carson had written about. Of Richard III: The Maligned King, Philippa Langley, who had founded the Looking for Richard Project said that ‚ÄòIt was the first book I had read to make this claim.‚Äô. As well as being historical consultant, Carson contributed to the scripting and copywriting of the International Appeal that saved the dig from a ¬£10,000 shortfall. In 2013 after revising The Maligned King Carson published Richard III: A Small Guide to the Great Debate. In 2014 members of the Looking For Richard Project collaborated to produce a report of their research, edited and published by Carson, entitled Finding Richard III: The Official Account of Research by the Retrieval and Reburial Project. In 2014 Carson was awarded Honorary Life Membership of the Richard III Society. In 2015 Carson published her fourth Ricardian book, Richard Duke of Gloucester as Lord Protector and High Constable of England, with Ken Hillier saying in the Ricardian Bulletin: \\"A compelling narrative\\". Articles by Carson have been published in magazines including the Richard III Society's Ricardian Bulletin, and twice in the Society's annual journal The Ricardian, in 2005 and 2012. Her media appearances include BBC Radio 4 Great Lives: Richard III (2015), and a news item University of Leicester find human remains in car park in search for Richard III. Carson states: \\"It's my belief we simply don't know as much as we're led to think we know about Richard III and his period, and an open mind serves us better than one that runs along well-worn paths.\\"  UK State Pension legal challenge  In 2002 Carson brought a legal action against the UK Government seeking Judicial review of its 'frozen pension' policy. The case contended that the failure of the UK Government to pay to pensioners resident in certain overseas countries the annual inflation uprating to their UK State Pension, which was paid to residents in other countries, constituted discrimination in contravention of the Human Rights Act 1998 based on EU Human Rights legislation. The UK State Pension was payable in countries like the UK, the European Economic Area (EEA) and a number of disparate countries (the United States, for example), whilst not being payable in predominantly Commonwealth countries such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa. The civil action was held in the Administration Court of the Queens Bench Division of the High Court. Carson lost her case, with the Honourable Mr. Justice Burnton saying that the decision to uprate the UK State Pension was legislative rather than judicial. Carson was given leave to appeal, and the appeal was heard in 2003. Carson lost this appeal, but was given leave to appeal, this time to the House of Lords. This appeal heard in 2005. Carson also lost this appeal. With each loss in the UK courts adverse costs were awarded against her. In 2008, Carson took her appeal to the ECHR, in Strasbourg, where she was joined by 12 other \\"frozen\\" pensioners from Canada and Australia. They lost this case and in 2010 they appealed to the Grand Chamber of the ECHR in 2010. This final appeal was lost by 11 votes to 6.

Rana Datasatya or possibly Ranaditya Satya on his coins, was a ruler in the area of Sindh, modern-day Pakistan, in the 5-6th centuries CE, probably circa 480 CE. His coins employ a sun symbol together with the portrait of the ruler, and have on the reverse a of fire of the type seen on Sasanian coinage, in which the traditional attendants of Sasanian coinage are replaced by a legend in Brahmi script. The legend in Brahmi reads 14px14px14px14px14px18px Ranna Datasatya. The coins of Ranaditya Satya are considered as modelled on the coins of Peroz I, particularly from the portrait type. These coins are the latest known of the series of Sasanian-type \\"coinage of Sindh\\", which were minted in the area of Sindh in modern Pakistan, from Multan to the mouth of the Indus river, on the model the coinage of Sasanian Empire rulers Shapur II down to Peroz I, and are covering approximately the period from 325 to 480 CE. Sasanian rulers from the reign of Shapur I did claim control of the Sindh area in their inscriptions. Shapur I installed his son Narseh as \\"King of the Sakas\\" in the areas of Eastern Iran as far as Sindh. These coins are often attributed to the Hephthalite Huns, whose Alchon Huns tribe invaded India in the 5th century. According to R.C.

Ranjith and produced by Kalaipuli S. Thanu., starring Rajinikanth, Radhika Apte, Winston Chao in lead roles. This album marks the first collaboration between Rajinikanth and Santhosh. The soundtrack album featuring five songs with lyrics written by Kabilan, Vivek, Umadevi and Arunraja Kamaraj was released on 12 June 2016, at Chennai and was also released in Telugu, Hindi and Malay languages. Santhosh Narayanan won the Best Music Director Award at the 2017 Ananda Vikatan Cinema Awards. Initially, he was nominated for the Best Music Director ‚Äì Tamil award at the 2017 Filmfare Awards South, along with Arunraja Kamaraj, for Best Lyricist ‚Äì Tamil, Best Male Playback Singer ‚Äì Tamil for the song \\"Neruppu Da\\". However, Shweta Mohan won the Filmfare Award for Best Female Playback Singer ‚Äì Tamil for \\"Maya Nadhi\\".  Overview  Kabali, marks the first collaboration of Santhosh Narayanan with Rajinikanth, and also his third collaboration with Pa. Ranjith. He started composing for the film, in 2015. According to Thanu, S. P. Balasubrahmanyam, who usually sings the introduction songs of films starring Rajinikanth, was not hired for this album because he was not in the city at the time of recording. \\"Ulagam Oruvanukka\\" is the introduction song of the film sung by Ananthu, Santhosh Narayanan, Gana Bala with lyrics written by Kabilan, Vivek and Roshan Jamrock performed the rap portions of the song. It is depicted as a rap number that exactly depicts the style of the Superstar, this one should be a visual treat. The lyrics brings out the energy that the actor carries towards the masses. The tune, though, sounds like a bit like a Rahman number. The second song, \\"Maya Nadhi\\" by Ananthu, Pradeep Kumar, Shweta Mohan written by Umadevi is a melodious song. Sharanya CR, from The Times of India, who reviewed the album, stated that \\"Santhosh has kept the structure such that the singers have the opportunity to explore various expressions and sangathis. The song evokes a subtle intimacy through the lyrics and the rendition of the singers, though the keys overpower the vocals in a few places.\\" \\"Veera Thurandhara\\" is the third song from the film sung by Gana Bala, were Pradeep Kumar lent additional vocals and Lawrence R and Roshan Jamrock performed the rap portions of the film. The song is a westernized classic mix. Raps in the middle were catchy as well. There is an in-built silence that emphasises the lyric before the rap portion kicks in. The trumpet and percussion definitely add punch to the song. \\"Vaanam Paarthaen\\" is a slow-paced melody number, sung by Pradeep Kumar, which is a song portraying about a lost love/lost life. This song is situational and is set to create a bigger impact when watched in theatre along with the situation. \\"Neruppu Da\\" is an energetic number sung and written by Arunraja Kamaraj, with dialogues by Rajinikanth. The song also created goosebumps for the film. It is a high energy song to define Rajini's mass. Santhosh has put in all of his efforts to fit this song in the places of Rajini's dialogues, walk and laughs. And he successfully lived up to the immense expectations people had on Theme music. Thanks to Arun Raja's killing voice which evokes every crazy Rajini fan. Rajini's dialogues in between add more goose bumps.Tremors are to be witnessed in theatres whenever 'Nerupu da' takes charge. \\"Thoondil Meen\\" is the bonus track of the film, sung by Pradeep, Kalyani and Dhee, which is considered to be a reprised version of \\"Vaanam Paarthaen\\".  Release  Think Music acquired the audio rights for the Tamil version, as well as the dubbed Telugu, Hindi and Malay versions. Initially, producer S. Thanu decided to organise a grand audio launch event in Malaysia, on 30 May, where both the Tamil and Telugu versions will be released. Later, the makers decided to push the audio launch from 11 June, then to 13 June in a grand manner. However, since Rajinikanth was not in Chennai, and was holidaying in America, the makers dropped the idea of a grand launch event and composer Santhosh Narayanan announced that the songs will be released directly in all streaming platforms on 12 June 2016. The tracklist of the film was released on 9 June 2016, which features five songs. After a 30-second audio clip was unanimously leaked through the internet, the makers released the album on Sathyam Cinemas, Chennai, on 11 June 2016, a day before the scheduled audio launch. The event was held at the presence of crew members, director Pa. Ranjith, composer Santhosh Narayanan, producer S. Thanu and Soundarya Rajinikanth in attendance, the first copy of the audio CD was handed over to Soundarya, by the crew members. The production house unveiled an official app for the film at the event. The lyrical videos of the songs were released by Think Music, through their official YouTube channel on 12 June 2016. The song teaser of \\"Neruppu Da\\" was released on 16 June 2016, and went ahead with 9 million views upon its release. The audio of the Hindi version was released on 12 June 2016, when the Tamil version was released. The audio of the Telugu version was released on 26 June 2016 at a pre-release event held in Hyderabad.

Post the film's release, an unreleased track \\"Thoondil Meen\\" which was not included in the film, was launched on 24 August 2016.  Track listing   Background score  The original background score composed by Santhosh Narayanan was released on 10 August 2016. It features nineteen original compositions used from the film. The scores were released in jukebox format through YouTube, and digitally through all streaming platforms.  Reception  Sharanya CR, from The Times of India, reviewed it as \\"A perfect treat for the Superstar's fans, and Overall, Kabali feels like a Santhosh Narayanan album composed for a Rajnith film, with the Rajinikanth factor remaining in the background, albeit in a low-key manner. If you are ready for this change, you are sure to like this.\\" Behindwoods stated that \\"Having Superstar as lead, one may try commercial ways of song composition. But Ranjith and Santhosh have ensured that there are no commercial compromisations. Thanks to Santhosh, for presenting 'Rajinism' in a different style. An album composed whole heartedly keeping visuals and situations in mind.\\" India Today, stated it as \\"A phenomenal theme music and an intriguing soundtrack from Santhosh Narayanan.\\" Indiaglitz rated the album 3.75 out of 5 stars, and stated \\"Santhosh Narayanan has scripted a new grammar for Superstar and it is going to be pretty hard for others to outdo it.\\" Indian Express also gave favourable reviews, stating \\"Neruppu Da is a stand out composition, while Maya Nadhi and Vaanam Paarthen might be goldies after years pass by.\\" Studioflicks rated 3.75 out of 5, stating \\"As on marking the final verdicts for the album, one thing is so clear that all songs are bounded to screenplay as it brings different feeling in respective of tracks. Maybe, it‚Äôs an usual style by Santhosh Narayanan, but when you think it from Rajinikanth fan perspective, it is definitely a different dimension of Thalaivar. Especially, the numbers like ‚ÄòMaya Nadhi‚Äô and ‚ÄòVaanam Parthen‚Äô, are really heart-binding that keeps you so much addicted, while ‚ÄòNeruppu Da‚Äô is a massive blaster of this album.\\" Filmfare gave the album 4 out of 5 stating, \\"Santhosh Narayanan hasn‚Äôt let the fact that he was composing for a Rajini vehicle get to him and made a fresh, rocking album that would be well-liked by all the old and young fans of the superstar. Can‚Äôt wait now to watch the film on big screen!\\" BollywoodLife gave the album 4/5 stating \\"Santosh Narayan has come up with an album that will be remembered for a very long time, just as the movie will be when it hits the screens. What big composers like AR Rahman could not deliver for Rajinikanth in the last few years, the young Santosh Narayan has done it with a single album.\\"  Chart performance  The album broke several records on digital media within a week and has received rave reviews with the majority of views coming from India, Malaysia, Singapore, USA, UAE and UK. While the lyric videos received 10 million views on YouTube, the song \\"Neruppu Da\\" topped the charts of Saavn, on Top 15 Weekly Countdown, iTunes and as well as local radio channels. The audio CDs of Kabali had a record breaking sales, which was confirmed by Swaroop Reddy of Think Music in a press interaction. The album became one of the most streamed songs of Jiosaavn. Paramdeep Singh, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman of Saavn said.\\"The Kabali album is all set to enter the Top 10 streamed Tamil albums of all timeon Saavn soon. It is clearly one of the most talked about regional albums of the year thus far.\\"  Album credits  All songs composed by Santhosh Narayanan Musician credits * Guitars - Keba Jeremiah, Pradeep Kumar (Acoustic & Slide), Joseph Vijay, Jhanu Chantar (Electric) * Flute - Vishnu Vijay * Bass - Naveen, Jhanu Chantar, Pradeep Kumar * Drums - Tapass Naresh * Additional Keys - Sat Richard * Trumpet - Vijay * Flute - Vishnu Vijay * Pianica - Sajan Shenoy * Strings - Macedonian Radio Symphonic Orchestra * Percussion Arranged and Recorded By - R.

He received his medical qualification from the University of Zurich in 1925 before becoming a resident at the Institute of Pathology Anatomy in Zurich and the Winterthur Hospital. He began training in pediatrics in 1928 at the Zurich Children's Hospital, under the director Guido Fanconi, and was appointed assistant medical director in 1930. He completed a doctoral thesis in 1936 on childhood leukemia and in 1937 he became the director of neonatology in what is now the University Hospital of Z√ºrich, remaining in the position until his retirement in 1970. He served as president of the Swiss Society of Paediatrics from 1959 to 1962 and was nominated for membership of the Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. Willi died suddenly on 16 February 1971 in Zurich. Research Willi gave his name to Prader‚ÄìWilli syndrome, a genetic disorder of childhood obesity and intellectual disability that was first described by Willi, Andrea Prader and Alex Labhart in 1956. Although they presented their findings at international conferences and in a Swiss medical journal, their report did not stimulate much medical interest until the 1960s, when their observations were noted in France, the United Kingdom and the United States. Willi's other research interests included the effects of gestational diabetes on the newborn, the hematological effects of ascariasis infection, and the definitions of different childhood leukemias. He was among the first to recognise the potential for bone marrow aspiration to be used as a technique for diagnosing hematological diseases.

Troop Strengths  The 4th Ukrainian Front (including the 1st Czechoslovak Corps under Ludv√≠k Svoboda) under Ivan Petrov and the 2nd Ukrainian Front under Rodion Malinovsky (including the 1st Romanian Army under Nicolae Macici and the 4th Romanian Army under Nicolae DƒÉscƒÉlescu), were to push back the German troops gathered in the Western Carpathians. The Axis forces were composed of the 1st Panzer Army (Gotthard Heinrici), the 8th Army (Hans Kreysing), and parts of the 17th Army (Friedrich Schulz) and the 1st Hungarian Army (Dezs≈ë L√°szl√≥). The German defensive lines were based not only on the mountainous terrain but also on several lakes and rivers.  The offensive  The offensive began on the same day as the much larger Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive, while the East Prussian Offensive was opened a day later. = Offensive of the 4th Ukrainian Front = On January 12, at 8:15 a.m., the 38th Army (Colonel General Kirill Moskalenko) of the 4th Ukrainian Front attacked after heavy artillery preparation with two Rifle Corps (the 101st and 67th). Behind its left flank, the 52nd Rifle Corps was held in reserve for a follow-up attack. On 15 January, the breakthrough through the German XI SS Panzer Corps (General Matthias Kleinheisterkamp) was achieved and could be pursued up to 18 km in the next few days. On January 16, Jas≈Ço (in present-day south-eastern Poland) was captured by the 70th Guards and 140th Rifle Division of the 101st Rifle Corps. On 18 January, to the south, the 1st Guards Army (General Andrei Grechko) opened its offensive against the German XI Army Corps (General von B√ºnau) over the Ondava river. The 4th Ukrainian Front used about 215 tanks and self-propelled guns, 134 of them with the 38th Army and only 42 tanks in the 1st Guard Army because of the mountainous terrain. The front of the German 253rd Infantry Division (Lieutenant General Carl Becker), deployed in the area 25 km south of Jas≈Ço, from Polany to south of Stropkov, was torn apart by the Soviet 11th and 107th Rifle Corps. The German troops were pushed back up to 22 km and the next day Pre≈°ov was captured by Soviet troops. Further to the south, the Soviet 18th Army (Lieutenant General Anton Gastilovich) attacked the positions of the German XXXXIX Mountain Corps (General Karl von Le Suire), in the section of the Hungarian V. Corps, and the city of Ko≈°ice (in present-day Eastern Slovakia) was taken. = Offensive of the 2nd Ukrainian Front = The left wing of the 2nd Ukrainian Front simultaneously launched its offensive from northern Hungary and invaded the Slovak Ore Mountains. The Soviet 40th Army (Lieutenant General Filipp Zhmachenko) pushed the Hungarian 1st Army back through the Rosenau cauldron to Ro≈æ≈àava, crossed the river Saj√≥ and captured the city of Brezno (Pleshevets‚ÄìBreznovsk Offensive or Ple≈°ivec - Brezno Offensive). To the left of it, the Soviet 27th Army (Colonel-General Sergei Trofimenko) accompanied the advance on Zvolen. = Final Phase = By the end of January, the troops of the 4th Ukrainian Front reached the German defensive lines on the river So≈Ça east of the line ≈ªywiec - Jablonka - Liptovsk√Ω Hr√°dok - Liptovsk√Ω Mikul√°≈°. The advance of the 4th Ukrainian Front was stopped west of Strumie≈Ñ, ≈ªywiec and Jablonka, east of Liptovsk√Ω Hr√°dok and Liptovsk√Ω Mikul√°≈°. The heavily defended town of Bielsko-Bia≈Ça was captured by the 1st Guards Army and the 38th Army. The 2nd Ukrainian Front continued the fighting until mid- March and reached the Hron River. = Losses and Consequences = The Red Army crushed 17 divisions and 1 brigade of the Axis powers, making 137,000 prisoners, according to its own not always verifiable sources. In addition, it destroyed or captured 2,300 guns, 320 tanks and 65 aircraft, also according to its own data. Large parts of Slovakia and the southern areas of Poland were liberated from the German occupiers. The Red Army puts its own casualties at 78,988 (including 16,337 dead and 62,651 wounded). The Romanian 1st and 4th army lost 12,000 soldiers (2,500 dead) and the 1st Czechoslovak Corps 970 men (260 dead). In addition, 359 tanks, 753 guns and 94 aircraft are said to have been lost on the Soviet side. Germany lost control of the Slovak Ore Mountains, and their strategic resources.

The short, which contains no dialogue, is Padovan's second animated film following The Mods. In 2017, he published a children's book adaptation of the story in Italian. Plot In an Italian city, there is a sunflower in a pot on a window sill in a boy's room containing a globe, maps, and an orrery (shown in close up at the start). The Sunflower's strength waxes and wanes with the light of the Sun. One night, as the Moon shines brightly on the Sunflower, which is drooping, and so takes no notice, one of its petals happens to fall. In the morning, the Boy takes a watering can and pours a measure of water such that a small pool forms in the pot. That night, because of the pool of water, the Sunflower sees the Moon's reflection for the first time and stirs, as though surprised by the beauty of the celestial body. Realising from the experience that the Moon can only be seen by means of reflected water, the Sunflower contrives to pull out another of its petals, so that the Boy will water it once more. The Sunflower continues on like this till at last there is only one petal left. Unexpectedly, in the middle of the day, as the Sun shines the Moon crosses its path and briefly takes its place in the clear blue sky. As the Boy is peering through his telescope at the eclipse, the Sunflower, able to see the Moon itself and not a reflection of it for the first time, turns its two leaves inward, forming the shape of a heart as revealed by the shadow it casts, in a declaration of love. As the credits begin to roll, photographs of the Boy begin to appear showing him growing to manhood. The Sunflower, too, grows new petals, and witnesses more eclipses of the Sun, and so more sights of its beloved Moon, as the years go by. Themes Silvia Vacirca remarks that the Sunflower appears to \\"fall in love\\" not with the Moon, but its reflection (since it is impossible for it to \\"look up\\" at the Moon at night). Antonio Padovan and some other production sources usually frame the story in terms of unobtainable, impossible love, or even forbidden love. It turns out, however, that it is not impossible: the Sunflower does at last see the Moon: fairy tales teach us that \\"nothing is impossible.\\" Production =Background= In 2005, executive producer Marco Savini founded the BigRock School Institute of Magic Technologies, the first training centre in visual effects in Italy, housed in a renovated farmhouse in Ca 'Tron, in the Roncade countryside of the Veneto region, where filmmaker Antonio Padovan grew up before moving to New York City where he is based. In 2014, Padovan directed his first short animated film in Italy, The Mods, which won the Giotto Special Prize at the Giffoni Film Festival, the largest children's film festival in the world. =Filming= The Little Sunflower that Fell in Love with the Moon was produced as one of two final thesis projects in the master's in computer graphics of eighty students who worked on it over a period of six weeks out of their intensive six-month course. Padovan \\"took care of the first steps of the project\\" and personally \\"set the cameras directly in the 3D scene,\\" using HTC Vive technology courtesy of Stormborn Studio (known primarily for their virtual reality games) and the Master VR I group. Padovan has uploaded a short video on Vimeo in which he takes the viewer on a tour of BigRock's facilities and demonstrates the use of the technology, while another video shows what it looks like exclusively from the point of view of the director. Many of the eighty students had more than one task to perform for the film, and some, like Chiara Piseddu, were involved at several stages: > [D]uring the first weeks of the thesis I was in the 3D Modelling group... > When the 3D models were almost ready... I moved into the Layout department, > where we basically set up the... set... and optimized it, so that we could > have a light and speed scene for the renders. Once the 3D models in the > scene were ready and lighters and shaders were working on it, I moved again > to the Rendering department. We worked on the render tests to set up the > render settings and then we sent the renders of the entire movie during the > nights and weekends, so we could use all 80 computers as a render farm. I > also had some time to help... with some ideas and animations that they used > in the Making Of movie. The \\"making of\\" movie, which shows the steps as outlined above, has been posted to Vimeo. =Music= While there is no dialogue in the short, the film features an original score composed by Filippo Zattini and performed in collaboration with the Ariggo Pedrollo Conservatory of Music. Release and reception An advance private screening of the thesis film for the BigRock students and their families on their graduation day was arranged at in Silea, the occasion marked with a red carpet, photocall and a golden statuette for award winners called \\"BigOscar\\", in a parodic reference to Hollywood's Oscars,on 26 February 2016. The world premiere of The Little Sunflower that Fell in Love with the Moon took place in July at the 12th , in the UNICEF section. =Critical response= Silvia Vacirca speaks admiringly of the discipline and determination required for the animation of a single petal, and goes on to remark that this is a film full of petals; she finds the animators' tenacity \\"frightening\\". =Online platform= The short film is available in its entirety on Vimeo. Related works =Conference presentation= Padovan, Savini and Michael John Gorman (CEO, Science Gallery Dublin) made a joint presentation in Venice on 10 December 2015 on the subject of science and technology in the arts and creativity (Scienza e tecnologia tra arte e creativit√†). =Children's book= Padovan adapted his story as a children's book with illustrations by Marina Carosi, who is from Padovan's home town of Conegliano, published by Le Brumaie 30 April 2017. It was launched at the in Turin.

Though it was written is two parts, its plot is extended with inheritors in another separate novel Shevalna Shatdal. Background Liludi Dharati was first serialized as a weekly installments in Janmabhumi, a Gujarati newspaper, from 15 November 1956 to 14 September 1957. It was written by Madia on insistence of Sopan, an editor of Janmabhumi. In the preface of the book, Madia mentions that he expected to complete the series in four or five months but it took longer than that. The title is based on Santu's nature. The incarnation of a woman is like green earth which never dries. The writer has incorporated the local dialects of Saurashtra region in the novel ingeniously as he himself belongs to the land where the novel is set. His descriptions seem indigenous and full of vitality. The novel narrates the region specific festival of Bhim Agiyaras and a sport of coconut throwing. Plot This novel narrates the life of trapped and confused woman named Santu under strange circumstances and her miserable plight. The story is set in the remote village near the mountain Girnar namely Gundasar. Though the main story line moves around a farmer family of Hada Patel, it also includes smaller accounts of other supportive characters, giving a picture of the village life, especially elaborate negative characters and their negativity. Hada Patel has three sons. The elder one has left the village and turned a monk, the second one dies due to some disease and story commences with the last son Gobar and his fiance Santu. The story progresses depicting the struggle of pregnant Santu bearing the blame of her husband's murder. The other major characters are Mandal (cousin of Gobar), Shadul (son of a landlord), Ragha Gor, a Brahmin hotel owner. Reception Bhagvanbhai H. Chaudhari in his article \\"Chunilala Madia's Liludi Dharati: A Narrative centered on Saurastra Region\\" mentions that though Chunilal Madia wanted to develop the novel a chronicle, however he fails as \\"characters portrayed in novel Liludi Dharati does not manifest the universal life incorporating the constant changing nature\\" However since as society or destiny are shown as the central elements which manage the entire human life, the novel shows the vague form of plot called chronicle. Critic Nalin Raval considered it a time- dominated or period novel. Critic Dilavarsinh Jadeja opines that \\"the true picture of bare reality of rural life and the emphasis towards it should be considered Madiya's specialty among Gujarati novelists\\". Adaption Liludi Dharati was adapted into Gujarati film with the same name in 1968 by Vallabh Choksi. It was the first colour film of Gujarati cinema.

It is a member of it, along with other 200 galaxies in cluster. IC 1993 is a galaxy with several spiral arms in its disc, and it has a Hubble classification of (R')SA(s)bc, indicating it is an intermediate spiral galaxy with ring on its outer edges. It is a remote galaxy, far from center of Fornax Cluster. It is at the edge of Fornax Cluster. Near the galaxy is bright foreground star that makes deep observations more difficult, so the galaxy's apparent magnitude is 12.6. Its size on night sky is 2.5' x 2.2' which is, along with it distance, proportional to real size of 45,000 light-years. IC 1993 is one of the 25 galaxies known to have rings or partial rings. Most resemble local collisional ring galaxies in morphology, size, and clumpy star formation. Clump ages range from to yr, and clump masses go up to several √ó solar masses, based on color evolution models. The clump ages are consistent with the expected lifetimes of ring structures if they are formed by collisions. There are 15 other galaxies that resemble the arcs in partial ring galaxies but haven't evident disk emission. Their clumps have bluer colors at all redshifts compared to the clumps in the ring and partial ring sample, and their clump ages are younger than in rings and partial rings by a factor of ~10. In most respects, they resemble chain galaxies except for their curvature. Several rings are symmetric with centered nuclei and no obvious companions. They could be outer Lindblad resonance rings, although some have no obvious bars or spirals to drive them. If these symmetric cases are resonance rings, then they could be the precursors of modern resonance rings,which are only ~30% larger on average. This similarity in radius suggests that the driving pattern speed has not slowed by more by ~30% during the last ~7 Gyr. Those without bars could be examples of dissolved bars.

After completing his primary education, he followed his father into the trade. His first literary efforts date from these years. Later, from 1839 to 1841, he took private preparatory lessons for graduate school and, in 1842, was admitted to the University of Rostock, where he studied philology.Eintrag (1) on Friedrich Eggers in the Rostocker Matrikelportal After only a short time there, he moved to Leipzig to engage in historical studies with Wilhelm Wachsmuth. Another move took him to Munich to study classical archaeology. He returned to Rostock in 1844.Eintrag (2) on Friedrich Eggers im Rostocker Matrikelportal After receiving his doctorate in 1848, he moved to Berlin. There, he made the acquaintance of the historian, Franz Theodor Kugler, who commissioned him to prepare a report on the reorganization of the Prussian art administration process. Kugler also introduced him to the literary society \\"Tunnel √ºber der Spree\\".Helge Dvorak: Biographisches Lexikon der Deutschen Burschenschaft. Band II: K√ºnstler.

He also employed his earlier professional skills to teach at the Bauakademie and pursued his literary ambitions, but remained largely unknown. It was then that he began what became his best known work; a five volume biography of the sculptor Christian Daniel Rauch, but he died before it was finished. It would be completed by his brother, Karl Eggers. Eggers at Tunnel √ºber der Spree, drawing by Adolph von Menzel In 1871, he was engaged by the , where he was involved with the fine arts.

The Rams went 1‚Äì7‚Äì1 and amassed 96 points while their defense allowed 292 points. It was their worst season since the winless 1946 campaign. Shortly afterwards, and following a disastrous, 41‚Äì0 season finale home loss to previously winless (0‚Äì9) Villanova, head coach Ed Danowski resigned. Speculation grew around five coaches, all former Fordham players, rumored as replacements. In order of likeliness the candidates were Vince Lombardi, at the time a backfield coach with the New York Giants; Johnny Druze, at the time a line coach with Notre Dame; Harry Jacunski, at the time a line coach with Yale and two long shots who were each successful in the high school ranks. They were Ray Riddick, at the time head coach of Lowell High School's powerhouse program in Massachusetts and Leo Paquin, in charge of Xavier High School's program in Manhattan. In the end none of the five were chosen. Instead, sighting poor attendance numbers and financial losses of $100,000 per year, the school decided to drop its football program on December, 15th. Alumni, many hoping Lombardi would be named head coach, led a campaign to cover all operating costs for the 1955 season and honor an already announced schedule in the process. The university however stood by their decision. After more pushing, the alumni movement was finally abandoned in May, 1955. With that came the lost opportunity at hiring, arguably, the single greatest football coach of all time. They also lost the services of freshmen quarterbacks Chuck Zimmerman and Jim Reese who had platooned the freshman team to a promising 3-1 record. Reese transferred to Minnesota where in 1958 he became the first Golden Gopher to throw for 200 yards in a game. Zimmerman transferred to Syracuse where in that same season he threw for over 700 yards while leading the Orangemen to the Orange Bowl.

They moved around Indiana frequently, following Bouslog's father's teaching jobs. Harriet studied at Indiana University, and earned an LLB in 1936. In 1936, Williams met and married Charles Bouslog. She followed him to Boston, where he was attending graduate school at Harvard University. Harriet Bouslog continued her education at Portia Law School.  Career  In fall of 1939, Charles got a job as an instructor at the University of Hawaii, and the pair moved to Honolulu. Bouslog worked at a law firm while studying for the bar exam. On December 23, 1941, she passed the Hawaii Bar Exam, and was the eighth woman admitted to the bar in the territory. She and her husband were uncomfortable with the inequality in Hawaii's plantation society, and only grew more unhappy when World War II began and Hawaii was put under martial law. They decided to move to Washington, DC. Bouslog worked at the National War Labor Board in Washington, DC. She also became a lobbyist for the Committee for Maritime Unity and the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union. Bouslog was called back to Hawaii when the ILWU needed a lawyer for 400 sugar plantation workers who were facing criminal charges after the 1946 strike. She teamed up with Myer Symonds, a lawyer from San Francisco. They were able to have many of the charges dismissed, and none of the workers went to prison. After the sugar strike, Bouslog and Symonds gained a reputation for representing those who couldn't pay for a lawyer. In 1948, Helen Lake Kanahele and Priscilla Yadao asked Bouslog to do something about the death sentence given to James Majors and John Palaliko in the Morgan's Corner murder. Bouslog took on the men's appeal, and convinced Governor Oren Long to stay the execution 15 minutes before it was scheduled to begin. Her appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit was denied, but by then the grassroots activism started by the ILWU had reached Governor Samuel King, who commuted the sentence. Bouslog's work on the Majors-Palakilo encouraged Hawaii lawmakers to abolish the death penalty in 1957. Bouslog represented Jack Wayne Hall and the six other members of the Hawaii seven after they were arrested in 1952 for violating the Smith Act. While representing them, she gave a speech at an ILWU meeting about the trial. This was reported to the judge, who put her in contempt of court while the Hawaii Bar Association investigated the matter. Her law license was suspended by the Territorial Supreme Court, but she appealed it all the way to the United States Supreme Court. The decision was reversed on June 29, 1959. Bouslog left the Bouslog and Symonds firm in 1978, but continued practicing on her own. Bouslog was awarded the Allan F. Saunders Civil Liberties Award by the ACLU. In 1989, she was admitted as a fellow of Indiana University's Academy of Distinguished Alumni. She died on April 18, 1998 at St. Francis Hospital in Honolulu.

Her friendship with author Margaret Mitchell led to Myrick's role as a technical advisor and dialect coach during the production of Gone with the Wind (1939), ensuring the film accurately portrayed the accents, customs, and manners of the South. Due to this expertise she has been called the \\"Emily Post of the South\\". Myrick also was a columnist, reporter, and associate editor for Macon-based newspaper The Telegraph, working at the paper for fifty years. Early life and education Myrick was born to James Dowdell Myrick and Thulia Katherine Myrick (n√©e Whitehurst) on February 20, 1893 on the 1,000-acre Dovedale Plantation in Baldwin County, Georgia, the fifth out of eight siblings. She studied education at Georgia Normal and Industrial College from 1910 to 1911, and taught physical education there following her graduating. Myrick also taught at the Student Normal School of Physical Education in Battle Creek, Michigan from 1913 to 1914, where she also studied at the American Medical Missionary College. In 1916 she moved to Hastings, Nebraska, where she was the public school's physical education supervisor. The next year Myrick attended a physical education program at Harvard University during the summer before moving back to Georgia. Career =Physical education= Myrick worked for the Georgia Department of Education from 1918 through 1922, after which she served as director of physical education at Lanier High School for Girls from 1923 to 1928. =The Telegraph= While working at Lanier High School, Myrick started writing an advice column geared towards young girls and women called \\"Life in a Tangle\\" for Macon's Telegraph. The articles were published under the pseudonym \\"Fannie Squeers\\" and quickly became popular, leading Myrick to quit teaching and begin working for the Telegraph full-time in 1928. She continued her work as a columnist, wrote recipes, features, and obituaries. Myrick joined the Georgia Press Association through which she became acquainted with a variety of journalists and reporters, including Sherwood Anderson and, notably, fellow Georgia native Margaret Mitchell. Myrick and Mitchell soon became close friends, often visiting each other in Macon and Atlanta, respectively, \\"sit[ting] up all night talking\\". Additionally, Myrick became a member of the Macon Writers' Club. She briefly also wrote for Telegraph-owned The News in 1940, and was editor of the Telegraphs Sunday- edition Georgia Magazine. After the outbreak of World War II, Myrick began working as the Telegraphs war editor; after the war she served as farm editor starting in 1946, producing a page each Sunday, and she was made associate editor in 1948. She was given an award by the Women's National Press Club in 1950. Despite retiring as associate editor in January 1967, Myrick continued to publish two editorial columns a week for over a decade ‚Äì her last column for the Telegraph was published on August 17, 1978, less than a month before her death. =Gone with the Wind= Myrick (center) coaching Olivia de Havilland and Vivien Leigh during production of Gone with the Wind. When production first started on the 1939 film adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's novel Gone with the Wind (1936), Mitchell recommended to producer David O. Selznick that Myrick should be a consultant on the film. Myrick spent six weeks in Los Angeles coaching the actors on how to speak with a Southern accent (Selznick International wrote in a letter that she was \\"one of the best authorities on this matter, who will come to the studio from Atlanta just for this particular job\\"), and her voice was recorded and pressed onto records for the actors to use as reference. Myrick would later explain that she \\"went out there [to Hollywood] fully prepared to argue and to quote authority to them that the Southern people do not talk like Negroes, but the Negroes like Southerners\\". She also continued to act as a technical consultant during filming, providing insight on how to make the film's production design as authentic as possible. Myrick also re-watched each recorded scene to check for mistakes. Myrick was against the decision to cast Hattie McDaniel as the character Mammy, as she thought McDaniel didn't have the \\"dignity, age, [or] nobility\\" for the role. McDaniel went on to win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance, becoming the first African American to win an Oscar. Overall Myrick worked on the production for seven months, earning $125/week from January to July 1939. Following the film's release, Myrick gained prominence discussing her work across the country, earning her the title \\"the Emily Post of the South\\". Her first freelance article, \\"Pardon My Un-Southern Accent: Why Gone with the Wind Won't Jar Southerners\\", appeared in the December 16, 1939 issue of Collier's, and she wrote an additional article for Southern Living in October 1967 about the experience. When NBC first premiered Gone with the Wind on broadcast television on November 7, 1976, Myrick was a main presenter of an hour-long introductory program broadcast on WSB-TV. Years after her death, Myrick's coverage of the film's production‚Äîa total of 58 columns that she wrote for the Telegraph while in California‚Äîwas compiled into a 1982 book titled White Columns in Hollywood: Reports from the Gone with the Wind Sets, edited by Richard Barksdale Harwell. Conservationism and agriculture Myrick had a passion for agriculture and farming throughout her life. Her work as farm editor for the Telegraph brought her statewide praise and even national recognition. Myrick often promoted the use of blue lupine as a winter forage crop that would prevent erosion, building soil and holding water, and in 1949 a conservationist group in Dooly County named Myrick the \\"Bloomin' Lupine Queen\\". In 1950 she wrote a children's book titled Our Daily Bread about environmental conservationism that was used as an official textbook in Georgia, North Carolina, and Tennessee. In 1956, the Progressive Farmer bestowed upon her their Woman of the Year in Service to Agriculture award, and the National Association of Soil and Water Conservation Districts recognized her work with a special citation in 1963. Additionally, Myrick was a member of the Macon Chamber of Commerce's livestock and farming committees. Personal life and legacy Myrick was close friends with fellow journalist and author Margaret Mitchell, and remained friends with Mitchell's widower John Marsh following her sudden death; Marsh would die three years later in 1952. During World War II, she helped organize Red Cross events and salvage campaigns, and she served on the Bibb County War Price and Rations Board. Myrick was a charter member of the Macon Little Theater in 1934, and was the theater's president from 1947 to 1948. She also appeared in over twenty-five stage productions. Myrick also watercolor painted as a hobby. Myrick died on September 3, 1978 and was buried at Memory Hill Cemetery in Milledgeville. She never married and had no children. She was added to the Georgia Press Association's Georgia Newspaper Hall of Fame in 1984. In 2008, Myrick was inducted into the Georgia Women of Achievement Hall of Fame.

All featured a rear mid-engine layout, a first for a Ferrari sports car. Major racing accolades include the 1962 European Hill Climb Championship, two overall Targa Florio victories, in 1961 and 1962, and \\"1962 Coupe des Sports\\" title. At first the SP-series used Vittorio Jano-designed, V6 Dino engines in both SOHC 60¬∞ and DOHC 65¬∞ forms. Later, Ferrari introduced a new SOHC 90¬∞ V8 engine designed by Carlo Chiti. All used dry sump lubrication and were mated to a 5-speed manual transmission. In total only six chassis were produced with various engine configurations. Many times they were modified and converted into a different specification. The tubular steel chassis, tipo 561, featured all-round independent suspension and disc brakes. All shared the same wheelbase and open body style with some variations. The rear mid-engine layout experience was soon carried over to the V12-powered Ferrari P-series of sports prototypes. They arrived in 1963. Later, by 1965, Ferrari introduced their first mid-engined Dino sports prototype, the 166 P, powered by a V6 engine. The Chiti V8 engine did not carry over to any successor. 246 SP At the 1961 special press conference, Ferrari unveiled their first mid-engined sports car, the Ferrari 246 SP. Although the front-engined 250 Testa Rossa had many racing successes during the late 1950s, the emergence of rear engine competitors in Grand Prix and sports car racing indicated that Ferrari required new design to stay competitive. Enzo Ferrari publicly denied in January 1959 that a rear engine car was in the works, however during this same year he privately tasked Carlo Chiti with developing both a rear engine Formula One car and a rear engine sports car, to be introduced by the 1961 racing season. Chiti decided Jano's existing 2.4 litre 65¬∞ Dino V6 design was suitable for use in both of these designs, due to its light weight and compact size. Development work proceeded through 1960 and early 1961, with the 246 SP completed in time for the 13 February 1961 press conference where it was introduced to the public. The model proved its capabilities at the 1961 Targa Florio, which Wolfgang von Trips and Olivier Gendebien had won outright. With this the 246 SP scored one more point for the 1961 World Sportscar Championship for Ferrari. For the 1962 World Sportscar Championship in the Sportscar class cars under 3000 cc, the 246 SP won two out of three rounds, including the 1962 Targa Florio and \\"1962 Coupe des Sports\\" title for Ferrari. Only two cars were produced (chassis 0790 and 0796) and both were later converted into other types, with 0790 becoming a 196 SP in early 1963 and 0796 becoming a 250 P test mule before being destroyed in a crash. = Bodywork = Ferrari 246 SP during 2010 Le Mans Classic The 246 SP's bodywork was a collaboration between Carlo Chiti and Medardo Fantuzzi, the owner of the Carrozzeria Fantuzzi. During the design process, solutions to reduce drag were tested in a wind tunnel. This resulted in the adoption of several new, innovative features, including a very low bonnet, high rear bodywork flush with the windscreen top and a vertical tail fin. A prominent detail were the two apertures, or air intakes in the front of the car. This solution was concurrently introduced on the 1961 Ferrari 156 Formula One car, dubbed the \\"sharknose,\\" and on the 1961 250 TRI61. This front end styling had first appeared on a trio of Maserati 250Fs that Fantuzzi re-bodied in 1958 for racer Ross Jensen and team owner Temple Buell (son of the architect with the same name). Fantuzzi's suggestion that the twin intakes would improve air penetration was confirmed by Chiti's wind tunnel testing, leading to the adoption of this style throughout Ferrari's 1961 racing cars. The bodywork was hand-shaped in Fantuzzi's workshop from 22 gauge aluminum sheet over wire forms. Major panels were designed to be detachable for easy maintenance access. Fantuzzi assigned one individual worker to oversee construction of each body shell. This division of labor, coupled with the use of traditional hand-built fabrication, resulted in slight differences between individual bodies. During the course of early testing by Wolfgang von Trips and Ritchie Ginther, Ferrari engineers discovered that the aerodynamics of the body caused instability at high speeds. This aerodynamic instability was thought to be the cause of a dramatic rollover crash during testing at Modena Autodrome, which resulted in bruising for test driver von Trips and minor cosmetic damage to the vehicle. The issue was solved by the removal of the vertical fin seen at the car's introduction and the addition of a tall rear spoiler, suggested by Ginther based on his wartime experience with aircraft. For the 1962 racing season, Ferrari introduced a slightly changed body style for all Dino SP cars, including the two 246 SPs which were re-bodied. All windscreens and rear bodywork were lowered in response to an FIA regulation change, improving aerodynamics and driver visibility. Chassis 0796 received a body with a slightly longer front end (often called the \\"long-nose\\" style), matching those of the newer SP-series cars, however 0790 remained with the earlier \\"short- nose\\" front bodywork. Numerous other body modifications were performed during the course of the 246 SP's competition career, including many changes in intake/vent configuration to optimize air flow to the engine, brakes and driver. All SPs retained the \\"sharknose\\" front end until 1963, when even the 246 SPs were converted to a single front intake style. Windshield heights were also changed and side windows modified and/or removed, in order to improve visibility and cockpit temperatures. Despite these improvements, the 246 SP gained a reputation for having an extremely hot cockpit, with von Trips reportedly remarking \\"You could grow tomatoes in the cockpit during a seven- hour race.\\" =Engine and Transmission= The engine, mounted longitudinally and amidships, was a Tipo 171S 65¬∞ Dino V6 unit based on the earlier Tipo 143 used in the 246 F1. The block and heads were cast from Silumin alloy. The total capacity of from of bore and stroke was the same as the engines used in the 246 F1 and the 1960 Dino 246 S. The 65¬∞ engine had twin overhead camshafts per cylinder bank driven by a timing chain, two valves per cylinder, and a 9.8:1 compression ratio. Resulting power was at 8000 rpm. The engine was fed by three Weber 42DCN carburettors and used two 14mm Marchal spark plugs per cylinder with two coils and Magnetti Marelli distributors. A dry sump lubrication system was used, with pumps for oil pressure/scavenging driven off the cams. The oil cooler and reservoir were located in the front of the vehicle. Two engine short blocks were manufactured for each 246 SP chassis, with a single set of cylinder heads swapped between them as needed. The 246 SP used a 5 speed transaxle designed by Engineer Giorgio Salvarani, similar to that used in the 156 F1. It was mounted to the rear of the car, behind the engine. It integrated in a compact package 5 straight cut, non-synchromesh forward gears, one reverse gear, a hydraulically-actuated multi-plate clutch, a ZF-style limited slip differential and mountings for inboard disc brakes. This transmission was shared among all Dino SP series cars. = Chassis, Suspension and Brakes = The 246 SP chassis was a tubular space frame constructed from round steel tubing by oxygen-acetylene welding. Durability was prioritized over weight savings during chassis design and construction, as Ferrari engineers attempted to ensure reliability during harsh endurance races. Fully independent double wishbone suspension was used on all four corners, with coil springs and Koni shock absorbers. The suspension design was extremely similar to that of the 156 F1. Rack and pinon steering was also used, a new technology for Ferrari. Disc brakes manufactured by Dunlop were used on both the front and rear. Front and rear discs were both in diameter. Front discs were conventionally mounted outboard at the hub uprights, while the rear brakes were mounted inboard at the transaxle. =Racing=  Chassis 0790  Willy Mairesse & co win 1962 Targa Florio in 246 SP s/n 0796 The first example produced, s/n 0790 was presented at the 1961 press conference. Its first outing after a couple of tests was the 12 Hours of Sebring, with Richie Ginther and Wolfgang von Trips driving. Although the car performed well, comfortably leading the field 3 hours into the race, it did not finish due to von Trips breaking a steering arm after jumping a curb and going off-track. The first major victory for the car and its series came at the 1961 Targa Florio race. The winning team consisted of Wolfgang von Trips, Richie Ginther and Olivier Gendebien. Later, the same trio scored a third place in the 1000 km N√ºrburgring despite engine and handling issues caused by wet, cold weather. The 246 SP 0790 was entered in the 1961 24 Hours of Le Mans with Ginther and von Trips as drivers. They managed to set the fastest lap in practice but retired when the car ran out of fuel on the Mulsanne straight due to a miscalculation. Later the same year, another broken steering component during practice prevented Richie Ginther and Giancarlo Baghetti from completing the 4 Hours of Pescara. 1962 started slowly, when an engine problem hindered the Rodriguez brothers from completing the 12 Hours of Sebring, in which they represented the N.A.R.T. team. Later in May, Phil Hill and Olivier Gendebien took a first place at the 1000 km N√ºrburgring, again under rainy conditions. 0790 was then airfreighted to Mosport Park to compete in the Players 200 Trophy race with driver Innes Ireland. Ireland retired on lap 13 with engine problems. In August, Mike Parkes won the Guards Trophy at the Brands Hatch, driving 0790 against Innes Ireland's Lotus 19. By 1963, 0790 was converted into 196 SP specification.  Chassis 0796  The second car of the series, s/n 0796, was also built in 1961. It competed alongside 0790 in the 1961 Targa Florio, driven by Phil Hill and Olivier Gendebien, but crashed during the first lap with Hill driving. After the car was re-bodied, Hill and von Trips competed at the 1961 1000 km N√ºrburgring, but again retired after a crash with Hill at the wheel. 0796 was not seen in competition until the following season. In 1962 Phil Hill and Ricardo Rodr√≠guez drove 0796 for N.A.R.T. at the 3 Hours of Daytona Continental, finishing second. Later the same year, Rodriguez and Gendebien aided by Willy Mairesse won in 0796 at the Targa Florio. Afterwards the car was extensively modified for its Le Mas participation, which it entered but did not finish due to a transmission failure. The Rodriguez brothers retired after 14 hours. By the end of the year 0796 was used as a development mule for the 250 P, having a 3.0-litre V12 engine installed amidships on an extended chassis. 196 SP The 1962 Ferrari 196 SP was a smaller-engined variation on the original 246 SP design, equipped with a 2.0-litre, SOHC 60¬∞ V6 Tipo 190 engine. The 5 speed transmission, chassis, brakes and suspension were all unchanged from the 246 SP. The 196 SP was introduced at Ferrari's 24 February 1962 press conference alongside the 248 SP, 286 SP, the 250 GTO and the 156 F1. At the model's introduction in 1962, a single 196 SP chassis (s/n 0804) existed. By 1963 chassis 0790, 0802 and 0806 were converted to 196 SP specification, resulting in a total of four of this type made. Thanks to the 196 SP and driver Ludovico Scarfiotti, Ferrari claimed the 1962 European Hill Climb Championship in the Sports Cars class. Scuderia Ferrari 196 SPs also claimed two 2,000 cc class wins at the 1962 and 1963 Targa Florio. =Specifications= The 2.0-litre V6 engine was mounted in the middle of the car, at its rear. The 60¬∞ angle engine was configured with only a single overhead camshaft and two valves per cylinder. Bore and stroke were respectively, and the resulting capacity was . Those measurements were identical to those of the Dino 196 S engine, from which this engine was heavily derived. The power output was at 7500 rpm, thanks to three Weber 42DCN carburettors and a 9.8:1 compression ratio. The engine used a single spark plug with two ignition coils. All SP series models introduced in 1962, including the first 196 SP, were initially fitted with Fantuzzi bodywork in the style of the later \\"long-nose\\" 246 SP bodies. This included the distinctive twin front air intakes first seen in 1961 and the low windscreen, slightly longer front, and lower rear bodywork that distinguished the later 1962 bodies from the original 1961 246 SP bodies. Later in 1963, SP series cars raced by Scuderia Ferrari were converted to a single front air intake. Some 196 SPs have since been converted back to twin front intake bodywork. =Racing=  Chassis 0804  The chassis s/n 0804 was the only original Ferrari 196 SP. In 1962, it was entered at the Targa Florio race. Lorenzo Bandini and Giancarlo Baghetti finished second overall, winning the 2,000cc class. Later in May 1962, the same duo contested the 1000 km N√ºrburgring but did not finish the race after the engine sump plate cracked. Ferrari decided to compete in 1962 European Hill Climb Championship with a 196 SP. Chassis 0804 was loaned to Scuderia Sant'Ambroeus along with driver Ludovico Scarfiotti. As Scuderia Sant'Ambroeus was managed by the Ferrari sporting director Eugenio Dragoni and factory personnel were used for race support, this was a Scuderia Ferrari entry in all but name. Scarfiotti won five of the six hillclimb races the team entered between June and August, against competition including Porsche drivers Heini Walter and Jan Greger. These results allowed Scuderia Sant'Ambroeus and therefore Ferrari to win the 1962 European Hill Climb championship title. In November 1962, 0804 was sold to NART and subsequently resold to an independent racing driver named Buck Fulp. Fulp raced the car at several events during the December 1962 Nassau Trophy Races. He finished first at the \\"5 Lap Governor's Trophy under 2-litres heat\\" and fourth overall (second in class) at the \\"17 Lap Governor's Trophy\\". He failed to finish the main Nassau Trophy race, but was classified 34th overall in the race results.  Other Chassis  The s/n 0802 was converted into the 196 SP specification in 1962, after being rebuilt from an accident. It had previously been configured as a 286 SP and a 268 SP. In 1963, the car was entered by Scuderia Ferrari in the Targa Florio, driven by Lorenzo Bandini, Ludovico Scarfiotti and Willy Mairesse. They finished second place overall, also scoring a class win. The V8-powered 268 SP s/n 0806, was also converted into a 196 SP. In 1963 the car was raced by Doug Thiem in the US in various races under the USRRC series. At the 1963 Bahamas Speed Week, Bob Grossman drove the 196 SP to a class win in Sport 2.0 category in the 25 Lap Governor's Trophy, being seventh overall. Later during the same meeting, he finished 15th overall and second in class at the Nassau Trophy. In 1964, Tibor von Imrey used the car in the SCCA series. The last of the 196 SP race cars was converted from a 246 SP chassis, s/n 0790. It would also be the last of the SP-series cars as the conversion took place in 1963. Edoardo Lualdi-Gabardi and Ugo Bini contested the Targa Florio of the same year, to no avail. Driving for the Scuderia Sant'Ambroeus, Lualdi-Gabardi won six hillclimb races out of twelve he entered in 1963. At the challenging Trento-Bondone hillclimb he scored a respectable sixth place. In 1964, Leandro Terra raced 0790 and won the Vermicino-Rocca di Papa hillclimb. Then he entered the Targa Florio with Cesare Toppetti but did not finish it. His last race in the 196 SP was with a fourth place at the GP Campagnano on Vallelunga. 286 SP The Ferrari 286 SP was the second model to make its debut at the 1962 press conference and was similar to the 196 SP. Like the 196 SP and the revised 1962 246SP, it had revised bodywork with a redesigned windscreen and tail to comply with new regulations. Only one example was produced, but never raced. S/n 0802 was presented to the press in February and converted into the 268 SP by May, the same year. The 286 SP had no successor because the large-capacity V6 was soon discarded in favour of the new Chiti-designed V8 engines, that could deliver similar performance. =Specifications= The single overhead camshaft, 60¬∞ Dino V6 engine received a wider bore and longer stroke at respectively. The resulting total capacity was . Those measurements did not exist on any previous Dino-engined model. A compression ratio of 9.5:1 combined with three Weber 42DCN carburettors helped produce a power output of at 6800 rpm. Also a single spark plug per cylinder with a single coil were used. 248 SP The Ferrari 248 SP was the third new variation of the SP series introduced at the 1962 press conference. The 248 SP was fitted with a single overhead camshaft, 2.4-litre V8 engine, this time fed by four twin-choke Weber carburettors. It was the first fully Ferrari-developed 90¬∞ V8 engine, as the Ferrari 801 powerplant was Lancia-based. Designed by Carlo Chiti as a replacement for the Dino V6, but the engine was only used in two models and did not bear any successors. Two examples were produced and both were subsequently modified to become larger displacement 268 SP models. =Specifications= The new tipo 199 V8 had a total capacity of from of bore and stroke. It was designed with a single overhead camshaft per cylinder bank configuration. The engine used four twin-choke Weber 40IF2C \\"Speciali\\" carburettors which mounted directly to the cylinder heads without manifolds. The barrels of this unusual carburetor design were angled at 45¬∞, resulting in a reduced overall height of the engine. Following testing, these were thought to inhibit induction and were replaced with more conventional Weber 40DC carburetors on the 268 SP. The 248 SP engine produced at 7400 rpm. A single spark plug per cylinder and a single ignition coil were mounted. The compression ratio was 9.8:1. =Racing= The first V8-engined, SP-series car was created in 1962. The s/n 0798, was demonstrated at the start of season press conference by Ferrari in February and before April, not being involved in any racing, the engine was modified with a longer stroke to a 2.6-litre specification. The second Ferrari 248 SP, s/n 0806, was also created in 1962 but actually participated in racing. It was entered by N.A.R.T. in the 12 Hours of Sebring, the same year. Bob Fulp with Peter Ryan arrived at the finish line on a thirteenth position overall and a third in class. After only a single race, by May 1962 the car was converted into the 268 SP. 268 SP The Ferrari 268 SP was a derivative version of the 248 SP also fitted with a V8 engine. It featured a bigger displacement with a stroke increased to . The resulting capacity was 2.6 L, intended to be more competitive in the 3.0-litre Sport and Prototype classes. Only three examples existed, but all were converted from other models and only one (chassis 0798) remains in 268 SP configuration. =Specifications= The new tipo 202, updated V8 engine had of bore and stroke. The resulting capacity was now . The cylinder bore was unchanged from the 248 SP engine, with the increased capacity derived from a 2.5 mm longer crankshaft throw. Weber 40DC carburetors mounted on individual manifolds replaced the 40IF2C carburetors used on the 248 SP, in an attempt to improve air induction. SOHC configuration and single ignition remained the same as on the 248 SP. The new engine also had the same (9.8:1) or slightly lower (9.6:1) compression ratio as on the 2.4-litre V8. The power output rose to at 7000 rpm, only slightly more than the 286 SP could produce. =Racing=  Chassis 0798  The first Ferrari 268 SP was converted from a 248SP chassis, s/n 0798. The engine was enlarged to 2.6-litres. The car's bodywork was further enhanced for improved aerodynamics, including a full-width windscreen. Scuderia Ferrari drivers Giancarlo Baghetti and Ludovico Scarfiotti drove 268 SP chassis 0798 in the 1962 24 Hours of Le Mans, but they retired after 18 hours due to transmission failure. Later the same year, 0798 was acquired by Luigi Chinetti's N.A.R.T., and entered in the Nassau Trophy. Driven by Lorenzo Bandini, 0798 finished eighth overall and third in class in the trophy race. In 1963, 0798 was sold by N.A.R.T. to independent racing driver John 'Buck' Fulp, who entered it into a series of races in the United States. At the 1963 12 Hours of Sebring he and Harry Heuer placed 34th place overall and eighth in class, despite retiring early with a broken suspension. Fulp then competed at the 1963 Bahamas Speed Week, placing fifth overall and second in class at the \\"25 Lap Governor's Trophy\\", and eleventh overall and another second in class at the Nassau Trophy. Subsequently, 0798 was bought back by Luigi Chinetti and sold again, racing in SCCA events through the 1960s until it was purchased by Ferrari collector Pierre Bardinon. 0798 is the only extant 268 SP and retains its original 2.6 L engine, although it underwent numerous bodywork modifications during its racing career that were reversed during a restoration by Bardinon.  Chassis 0802  In 1962, the 286 SP chassis 0802 had a tipo 202 V8 engine installed, becoming the second 268 SP. During a practice at the 1962 Targa Florio with Phil Hill driving, 0802 suffered a major accident due to a stuck throttle. 0802 was unable to compete due to major damage. Phil Hill was sidelined and co-driver Olivier Gendebien was reassigned as a third driver for the 246 SP chassis 0796, the eventual winner of the race. Chassis 0802 was subsequently rebuilt and converted into a 196 SP.  Chassis 0806  The last 268 SP, s/n 0806, was modified from a 248 SP in 1962. Scuderia Ferrari entered it at the 1000 km N√ºrburgring with the Rodriguez brothers driving. They did not finish the race as Pedro Rodriguez crashed on the 8th lap. Later in 1962, 0806 was repaired and converted into 196 SP specification.

Career Born in Bonn to a bricklayer father, Heuser was one of sixteen children. He had thirty amateur fights before making his professional debut on 2 August 1929 at light heavyweight with a points win over former European champion Fernand Delarge.\\"Adolf Heuser, die ‚ÄúRheinische Bulldogge‚Äù\\", Boxen.de, 25 January 2012. Retrieved 28 September 2019 In November 1930 he beat Dutch champion Piet Brand, and in January 1931 challenged for Ernst Pistulla's German light heavyweight title, the fight ending in a draw. After seven straight wins, including victories over former French champion Moise Bouquillon, former Belgian champion Jack Etienne, and reigning Belgian champion Gustave Limousin, he faced Pistulla again in September that year, with both the German and European light heavyweight titles at stake. The fight again ended in a draw. Heuser travelled to the United States in October 1931 for a series of fights. After being unbeaten in his first twenty fights, he suffered his first defeat in December when he lost a points decision to Patsy Perroni in Cleveland. He won all of his remaining fights on the US trip, before returning to Germany after suffering an ear injury. In June 1932, Heuser knocked out Jose Martinez de Alfara in the first round in Valencia to take the vacant IBU European light heavyweight title. Later that year he returned to the US for another series of fights, and after five straight victories, including a decision win over NBA world champion George Nichols, in March 1933 he challenged Maxie Rosenbloom for the NYSAC world light heavyweight title at Madison Square Garden; Rosenbloom beat a tired Heuser by unanimous decision, inflicting only the second defeat of Heuser's career. Heuser went on to lose his last three fights of his second spell in the US. Back in Germany, Heuser won four fights before challenging Adolf Witt in August 1934 for the German (BDB) light heavyweight title, the fight ending in a draw. Over the next three years, Heuser beat Hans Sch√∂nrath and Arno K√∂lblin, his only defeats in this period in over thirty fights coming at the hands of Merlo Preciso and Karel Sys. In August 1937 he again challenged Witt for the German title, this time knocking him out in the eighth round to become German champion. In February 1938 he beat Sys on points, and the following month stopped Gustave Roth in the seventh round to add the IBU world and European titles. He had been due to fight John Henry Lewis for the NYSAC world title, but the fight was cancelled after the NYSAC controversially stripped Lewis of the title. Instead, he made a successful defence of his European title against Preciso in September 1938. He moved up to heavyweight and in March 1939 beat Heinz Lazek to become European heavyweight champion. Heuser was initially ordered to defend this European title against Italian champion Sante De Leo (who had previously accepted a challenge to face Lazek), which prompted the German authorities to threaten to withdraw from the IBU in protest, but in July 1939 Heuser faced Max Schmeling in front of 70,000Some sources state 80,000, e.g. Bauer, Joe (2011) \\"Wo der Bayernk√∂nig Richard Wagner vor der Pleite rettete\\", Stuttgarter Nachrichten, 13 March 2011.

The following month, Heuser fought Preciso in what should have been a defence of his European light heavyweight title, and although he won the fight, he had lost the title at the weigh-in after failing to make the weight. In March 1940 he challenged Jean Kreitz for the German title; Kreitz was controversially declared the winner, but the fight was declared a no contest the next day. The two fought again for the title in September, this time with Kreitz stopping Heuser in the eighth round. Heuser moved back up to heavyweight, and after losing to Walter Neusel, a draw with Lazek and a win over K√∂lblin led to a challenge for Lazek's German heavyweight title in February 1942; Heuser knocked Lazek out in the third round to become German champion once again. He retained the title with a drawn fight against Neusel in June, but in September Neusel stopped him in the ninth round to take the title.

Dhanush. The film features seven songs, with three instrumental compositions. The single track, \\"Why This Kolaveri Di\\" was released on 16 November 2011, prior to the soundtrack release, and became one of the most streamed songs of all-time. It was officially released, after a leaked version, becoming popular on the internet. All the songs have lyrics written by Dhanush, except \\"Idhazhin Oram\\" was written by Aishwarya Dhanush. The entire soundtrack album was released on 23 December 2011, and gained positive reviews. Behindwoods.com, listed the soundtrack album of 3, as one of the composer's best works till date.

Background  According to the composer Anirudh, the film's director Aishwarya R. Dhanush, wanted a light hearted song about love failure, with the former quickly composed the tune within 10 minutes. Dhanush then began working on the lyrics, for about 20 minutes, in which the first line he sang was \\"Why This Kolaveri?\\" (). Dhanush sang the song in broken English, as a Tamil person might if his knowledge of English was limited. The song is also called a 'Soup' song, where 'Soup' is a colloquial Tamil word which refers to young men experiencing love failure after a beautiful relationship.  Development  All the songs in the film were recorded at A. R. Rahman's AM Studios in Chennai. The song \\"Why This Kolaveri Di\\", which was adjusted in downtempo has been built around an ancient south Indian folk rhythm using ancient folk instruments like nadaswaram, shehnai, saxophone, urumee, thavil, drums, acoustic guitar, keyboards mixed with electronic synths and scratches, utilizing the singing style of Tamil folk culture. The words of the song are in a simple form of Tanglish, a mixture of Tamil and English, which strikes a chord with the college students that lap up songs in this genre. The words have been described as \\"nonsensical\\" by some and an evocation of \\"Tamil street humour\\". Dhanush has stated that the choice of words allows it to be a very relatable song. The song \\"Idhazhin Oram\\" was written by his wife Aishwarya R. Dhanush, while all the other songs were written by Dhanush. The song was sung by Ajesh, a winner of the Airtel Super Singer.

On the whole, an album that will sell like hot cakes.\\" Rediff rated the album 3 out of 5, and summarised that \\"All the songs in 3 are good and come with appealing instrumental arrangements, even if the lyrics are a bit bland. Composer Anirudh has obviously taken pains to come up with an intriguing collection.\\" Moviecrow rated the album 7 out of 10, stating with a bottomline that \\"This dream debut by Anirudh is mighty impressive. The director Aishwarya D should be commended for her vision. She has given Anirudh and Dhanush the freedom to explore in music and lyrics. Anirudh has proven that 'Kolaveri' was no fluke. The music is fresh, experimental and delightful - worth buying.\\" Indiaglitz gave a positive review stating \\"The entire album of '3', which explores the various faces and phases of love, is a bonanza to music lovers. No other film in the recent past celebrated love with these many songs.\\"  Controversy  The song, \\"Why This Kolaveri\\" being one of the most streamed Indian songs, gained controversy upon its release. Javed Akhtar, a poet, lyricist and scriptwriter slammed the song for its insult to sensibility. In April 2012, a petition was filed in the Kerala High Court seeking a ban on the song citing negative influence on children, claiming to inciting violence and aggression. The song was also faced criticism for its allegedly misogynistic lyrics.

To continue her work in Goethean science and the promotion of holistic science and environmental issues, Colquhoun founded an educational charity, The Life Science Trust, in 1992. When The Trust purchased a plot of land in the Lammermuir hills in 1996, she directed the Pishwanton Project, which Colquhoun described as: > \\"A pioneer experiment in the sustainable and therapeutic integration of a > variety of activities that might normally be seen as mutually exclusive, for > example agriculture, horticulture, medicinal plant cultivation, ecological > conservation and research, education, the arts, community living and > business. The Pishwanton Project is thus an innovative, land-based project > which provides a pioneer focus for sustainability in the 21st century.\\" Pishwanton Wood educates visitors and promotes conservation to this day. Colquhoun also wrote New Eyes for Plants: A Workbook for Observing and Drawing Plants in 1996. Outside of the world of academia, Colquhoun was a founder of the Helios Fountain, a gift shop in the Edinburgh Grassmarket which closed in 2015 after several decades of business.  Personal Life  Colquhoun married David Bathgate, an Edinburgh mountaineer, in 1970 at the age of 23. The couple divorced in 1977.

There she won a scholarship to attend a new grammar school in Monmouthshire where she developed a love for maths and physics.  Finding work  Bussell left school in 1933 during the Great Depression, a time where it was difficult to find work. She sat a Civil Service entrance exam in 1934, where she did not gain one of the 4 vacancies on offer to 2,000 testers. That same year, she came 2nd in an exam to join Great Western Railway, where only the first place recipient claimed entry to the company. However, Great Western Railway soon after had a vacancy in Cardiff in the Drawing Office, part of the Civil Engineering Department. Bussell contacted the company to remind them of her 2nd place exam finish. From this, she was able to gain a position as a tracer in August 1934.  Career and interests  In 1942, the GWR Chief Civil Engineer appointed Bussell as Junior Technical Staff as Draughtsman (female). Bussell transferred to British Rail, where she was promoted to various roles: * Assistant Draughtsman in 1948 * Technical Assistant in 1957 * Engineering Assistant in 1966 * Senior Engineering Assistant in 1971 Bussell was a member of the British Railway's Management Staff.

During the Second World War, as Colonel in the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC), he was appointed \\"Surgical Penicillin Officer\\" in the Eighth Army in North Africa. In this capacity he was involved in the very earliest assessment of the use of Penicillin in war wounds. His reports concluded that Penicillin in this context, should be used early in the treatment of infected wound rather than at the later stage of chronic suppuration.  Early life  James Jeffrey was born in Polwarth, a district of Edinburgh, son of Sir John Jeffrey, later Under Secretary of State for Scotland, and his wife Jean Stuart Jeffrey (n√©e Sneddon). He went to school at George Watson's College, from where he went on to study at the University of Edinburgh Arts Faculty, graduating Master of Arts (MA) in 1925. He then studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh Medical School qualifying MB ChB. During his time at University he was president of the Edinburgh University Union and president of the Students' Representative Council. He was awarded a university blue for rugby union.  Surgical career  In 1939 he was awarded the degree of Doctor of Medicine (MD), for a thesis entitled Regional ileitis; a clinical and pathological study. 'Regional ileitis was the tern then in use for what in now generally called Crohn's disease. Although there had been earlier descriptions, most notably that by Sir Kennedy Dalziel, it was Burrill B Crohn and his colleagues in a seminal 1932 paper who gave the first comprehensive account of the clinical and pathological features. Crohn and his colleagues considered that 'terminal ileum is alone involved' while Jeffrey like Richard Lewisohn was to show that other parts of the gastro- intestinal tract could also be involved.  War service  Jeffrey was called up in 1939 and served as a major in the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) with the British Expeditionary Force in France and was evacuated from Quiberon Bay back to England. He then served with the RAMC in West Africa and later in Tripoli with the Eighth Army. During that posting, Professor Howard Florey and Professor Hugh Cairns arrived from Oxford bringing with them 'most of Britain's Penicillin production' for it to be assessed in the treatment of battle wounds, as wound infection in this situation was a common problem. Jeffrey was promoted to Lt Colonel and appointed Surgical Penicillin Officer in the team which carried out the assessment. The initial report on 15 casualties was given by Pulvertaft in 1943. The full results were published in the British Medical Journal, as one of the first accounts of the use of Penicillin in battle wounds. In this report he emphasised that the use of Penicillin did not remove the need for early and thorough wound debridement, and this was endorsed by the War Office report on its use in war wounds. After the war Jeffrey published a review on the place of Penicillin in military surgery. = Post war career = On demobilisation he became consultant surgeon in the RIE and Chalmers Hospital. Family He met Mary Goldthwaite from Montgomery, Alabama in 1938 while working as a ship's doctor on a Cunard liner. They married on 12 August, 1939. They had three daughters and one son.

McCartney said in an interview with the BBC that the title of the book came from one of his grandchildren who \\"...used to call me 'Grandad' - just happened one day to say 'Grandude' and it kind of stuck...So the other kids started calling me 'Grandude'\\". The title is also a reference to McCartney's 1968 song \\"Hey Jude\\". McCartney started making up stories about Grandude, who he conceived of \\"as a kind of retired hippie having adventures with his grandchildren\\". McCartney said in an interview with the BBC that \\"I imagined him as a sort of eccentric old guy. He's got a grey beard, a little bit of a ponytail, so he's a little bit groovy. He has a little hat and a bow tie. And he has this magic compass so when he rubs that you can go anywhere\\". McCartney has stressed that Grandude is not based on him as he is not personally possessed of magic powers. Plot The book is about a grandpa and his three grandchildren with a magic compass on an adventure. The group \\"ride horses with a cowboy in the desert, face an army of crabs on a tropical beach and dodge an avalanche while having a picnic up a mountain\\".

Empire concludes by writing that there is an \\"all-round risk-averseness here that's puzzling. The book concludes with everyone safely tucked up in bed...But every gleeful scenario ends badly, with Grandude and the chillers fleeing when some avalanche or stampede invariably kiboshes the thrills.

Announced in September 2019, it is intended that up to a million trees will be planted between 2020 and 2024.  Announcement  The planned Great Northumberland Forest was announced by Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Theresa Villiers at the Conservative Party Conference on 27 September 2019. It was part of a package of measures that were presented as leading to a carbon-neutral United Kingdom by 2050. The plans had been championed by the Member of Parliament for Hexham, Guy Opperman, who stated that the proposed forest would help absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, increase the provision of green space in the region for recreational purposes and provide the nucleus for a new forestry/timber industry. The scheme was welcomed by Greenpeace but they noted that it was only a fraction of the 700 million new trees that they say need to be planted before 2030.  Planned forest  It is intended that up to one million trees will be planted across of land in Northumberland between 2020 and Spring 2024. A variety of tree types will be planted in the forest, rather than solely conifers which have been used in other new forest schemes. A new organisation, the Northumberland Forestry Partnership, will be established to assist local residents, landowners and environmental groups to plan for the new forest. The forest will initially be planted at three sites on government-owned or newly acquired land. The Forestry Partnership will then look to expand the forest by identifying new sites suitable for afforestation, of which there is an estimated in the county. Planting was timed to commence ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), which was scheduled to take place in Glasgow in November 2020 before its postponement to November 2021.

J. Watson, was a Scottish editor and scholar, remembered as a supporter of the Scottish Gaelic language.  Early life  Carmichael was born 9 August 1870 in Lismore, Scotland, the only daughter of four children born to Alexander Carmichael, an exciseman and author, and Mary Frances MacBean Carmichael. She was raised in the Uists. She was one of the first women undergraduates enrolled at the University of Edinburgh.  Career  Carmichael founded the Celtic Union in 1894, and the Women Students' Celtic Society at the University of Edinburgh, after being barred from joining the all-male University Celtic Society. She helped her father to transcribe and edit the Carmina Gadelica (1900), and later worked on a revised edition of his landmark work. She supported the study and preservation of the Scottish Gaelic language as the acting editor of the Celtic Review from 1904 to 1916. Gaelic scholars consider her the likely model for John Duncan's illustration, St. Columba on the Hill of Angels (1904). In 1904, Carmichael attended the annual meeting of the Caledonian Medical Society, in her role as editor of the Celtic Review. She lectured in Glasgow on \\"The Evil Eye\\" in 1906. She also contributed articles to the An Deo-Ghreine magazine; her 1905 essay, \\"Some Things Women Can Do\\", begins: \\"It is no exaggeration to say that, if our women would put their hearts into the Gaelic movement, the future of the language would be assured, and there could be no talk of Gaelic being doomed.  Personal life  Carmichael married William J Watson, a professor of Celtic at the University of Edinburgh, in 1906. They had two sons; the older son died in childhood. Their younger son, James Carmichael Watson, a Celtic scholar who was killed in World War II in 1942. She died 30 November 1928 in Edinburgh, aged 58 years. In 1974, a portrait of Carmichael was presented to the Department of Celtic at the University of Edinburgh, by her nephew, Michael Carmichael.

Republic of Moldova, North Macedonia, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Ukraine and former Yugoslavia),Fauna Europaea and in the Middle East. In the East it reaches Iran. These insects apparently are extending their distribution from east towards more western and northern areas. Description Dorsal view Close-up of the head Nagusta goedelii can reach a body length of about . The slender and slightly hairy body is yellow to cinnamon-brown, but some darker specimen can be brown or reddish with greenish veins. The head is more than twice as long as the width and it has protruding ocelli. It shows two characteristic horn-like thorns just behind the antennae. Antennae show the same color as the body, with lighter rings. The posterior lobe of the head ends in a cylindrical neck. The pronotum is almost hexagonal and carries two broad and rounded apophyses in the shape of an obtuse cone. The diameter of the anterior femurs is at least three times the diameter of the mid and posterior ones, while the tibiae are all of the same thickness. Biology The species has only one generation per year (univoltine). Mating and egg laying take place in spring. The larvae reach the adult stage in August and September. The imago overwinters. In warm, sunny regions these assassin bugs live on deciduous trees, especially on oaks (Quercus species), more rarely on shrubs. These bugs feed exclusively on other insects and possibly arachnids and lepidopteran larvae. They are recorded to prey flatid planthoppers (Metcalfa pruinosa), the larvae of Macrophya punctumalbum, the cricket Arachnocephalus vestitus, but also several diptera. Bibliography *E. Wachmann, A.

Murugan, had musical score by Rajesh Ramalingam and was released on 25 September 2009. The film was dubbed into Telugu as Droham. Plot The film begins with a scared Madhavi (Mohana) running in the street from some rowdies in the middle of the night. She then bumps into Mahesh (Ramji) and tells him about her past. A few years ago, Madhavi was a carefree young woman who lived in a remote village with her wealthy parents. She befriended Nandha (Sajith Raj) who told her that he was a wealthy businessman in Mumbai and she eventually fell in love with him. Her parents then found her a groom: Mahesh who worked in a software company in Chennai and lived with his parents. Madhavi, who was not keen to marry Mahesh, decided to elope with her boyfriend Nandha and they came to Mumbai. Nandha turned out to be a fraud who had sold many women to a brothel and he did the same to her. In the brothel, Madhavi refused to prostitute herself so she was subjected to physical abuse by the pimps. Madhavi then managed to escape from the brothel. Back to the present, Mahesh takes her home and he convinces her parents to marry her, and they accept. Two days after the marriage, Nandha enters their house and Madhavi is shocked to see him. Nandha is none other than Mahesh's brother. Nandha's father (Nizhalgal Ravi) hated Nandha for being an irresponsible person whereas his mother (Rekha) loved him and blindly believed him. Nandha challenges Madhavi that he will have sex with her and he stops her first-night on multiple occasions. Thereafter, Madhavi becomes pregnant which came as a great shock to Nandha. Madhavi then exposes the true nature of Nandha to her husband and her parents-in-law. An angry Nandha tries to kill Madhavi but Nandha's mother who was ashamed of her son's criminal activities kills him.

Only one suspect, a German national, was arrested on suspicion, but later cleared from involvement. Alleged crimes Between 2000 and 2002, a total of 10 men died in the coastal town under suspicious circumstances, causing the local population to spread around rumors of a multiple murderer operating in the area. Authorities were called in, but they could only conclusively prove that one of the victims were murdered, while the others, whom most of them lacked any external injuries to their bodies, had likely passed away from other circumstances (alcohol intoxication or suffocation). =Confirmed murder= * Jos√© Antonio Castillo Torres (26) - In early March 2002, the body of Castillo, a local photographer, was found on the road leading to a bar named \\"El Oro\\", around 200 meters away from his house. A married man with a 5-month-old child, Jos√© had left the house early on the day before his murder, as he had to deliver some photographs, after which he was seen partying in \\"El Integral\\". After having a few drinks, he left the premises around 1 o'clock in the morning, riding home on his bike. When examined, it was revealed that he had suffered a fracture of his cranium, coupled with bilateral sinking of the eyes, as well as multiple other fractures to his frontal parietal lobe. Robbery was ruled out as a motive, as his backpack, which contained his two cameras and many photographs, was still present at the crime scene. =Suspected murder= * Jos√© Santos Merlo Acu√±a (80) - on October 8, 2000, Merlo's body was found floating at the anchorage of San Juan del Sur's bay. The investigation found that the suspect was not in Nicaragua at the time.No external injuries were observed, and the death was ruled a suffocation. *Jos√© Casimiro Salas Ch√°vez (52) - On New Year's Eve, 2001, Salas' lifeless body was found on the rocky riverbank of the Rio Escondido an estuary near San Juan del Sur. He had suffered from blunt trauma, forming a sharp lesion on the left part of his neck, and later drowned by submerging into the water. * Unidentified (approx. 45) - date of death unrecorded. When located, the decedent reeked of alcohol, and likely suffocated as a result from heavy drinking. According to authorities, he most likely had fallen over and began having convulsions, resulting in his death. * Marcelino Jos√© Salina (65) - body found on March 25, 2001, in the Nacascolo sector. No physical injuries were present on the body, and it was theorized that, similarly to the unidentified man, Salina had fallen into a sewer and died from convulsions induced by alcohol. * Tranquilino Barberena Jim√©nez (67) - found on June 25, 2001, in the park area. When transported to the San Juan Health Center, it was determined that Jim√©nez had a heart attack, quickly followed by a cardiac arrest. * Mario Antonio Ch√©vez (21) - found on October 9, 2001, hanged with a sheet from his bedroom ceiling. The medical examiner determined the death as \\"asphyxiation by hanging\\". * Sergio Enr√≠quez V√©lasquez (46) - Ecuadorian expatriate; lifeless body found on the estuary on October 22, 2001. No signs of physical trauma were found upon examination. * Jos√© Barbosa Molina (68) - found on December 7, 2001, on the west side of Loma del Indio. The coroner's ruling was that there were no signs of external injuries to the body. * Jes√∫s Bernardo Flores Aguirre (73) - found on December 18, 2001. No signs of external injuries were found on the body. =Disproven= * Manuel Gonz√°lez - Nearly killed in a brutal attack in the town, during which his fingernails were ripped off. Initially thought to be a victim of the Psychopath, Gonz√°lez himself later confirmed that it was a man with whom he had quarreled at the time. Suspect Only one man was ever charged with any of the murders: A German national, who allegedly had lived illegally in Managua on an expired visa from January 22, 2001 until April of that same year. He was accused of being responsible for at least seven of the deaths by the local population, and on March 22, 2002, he was arrested by the police. On May 9, however, he was allowed to walk free, but was required to attend court every Friday. In an attempt to find evidence, Nicaraguan authorities investigated the suspect's past through Interpol, and sent in some of his belongings for test: the most notable of which was a book about two twin brothers, one of whom would become a psychopath and mafia hit-man, which would serve as possible evidence. In the end, the suspect was only charged with the deaths of Salas and Castillo by the Rivas Department Police. After a few months, he was dismissed by Justice Marianela Paredes on October 9th, citing abandonment of the trial, as none of the prosecuting parties managed to present any substantiate evidence against the accused.

The film explores the origins and growth of the electronic music genre known as synthwave, charting its rise in popularity from the underground online music scene to its recent mainstream exposure following use in retro-themed soundtracks, notably the 2011 film Drive and more recently the television series Stranger Things. Production The Rise of the Synths initially began as a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter in 2016 before later moving platforms to Indiegogo. The film had its world premiere at the In-Edit Festival in Barcelona on 1 November 2019, with its international premiere on 15 November in London at the Doc'n Roll Festival. Cast The film contains various interviews with both established and upcoming synthwave artists, exploring their sources of inspiration which range from early electronic pioneers such as Giorgio Moroder, Vangelis and Tangerine Dream to a collective love of 1980's films and video games.IFFR Artists featuring in the film include: * Carpenter Brut * Gunship * Perturbator * Electric Youth * The Midnight * Nina * Power Glove * Dance with the Dead * Robert Parker * Waveshaper * OGRE Sound * Miami Nights 1984 * Valerie Collective (College, Maethelvin) * Lazerhawk * 80's Stallone * John Bergin * MPM Soundtracks * Night Crawler * Scandroid * Mecha Maiko Reception Reviewing the film, Cinemania said, \\"It will delight music lovers and fans of synthesizers\\". Rob Dyson of ForeverSynth says director and writer Ivan Castell \\"hits all the right notes in terms of why and how the music and iconic imagery appeals - even to those who weren't born in the 70s or 80s.\\" Inaki Ortiz Gasoc at El Contraplano said \\"The aesthetic is careful and prevents this from being a classic boring documentary of talking heads\\" with \\"some fantastic film performances following the canons of the musical movement with its Delorean\\". Jorge Loser at Espinof commented that \\"Carpenter's voice serves as a connection between blocks with creative tips and reflections on his career and his role in this whole new movement.\\" The view from the Guardian's Bill Beaumont-Thomas was more mixed, with him praising the film's ‚Äúadmirable production values‚Äù, particularly the ‚Äúimpressively produced interstitial [fictional] segments‚Äù, but that the documentary was ‚Äústylish but shallow‚Äù and ‚Äútrades deep analysis for platitudes and boring asides‚Äù.  Soundtrack  The film's original soundtrack is composed by OGRE Sound. In support of the film, Lakeshore Records also released an Official Companion Album in 2017 which received positive reviews and featured exclusive music from various synthwave artists.

At 10:45 as the aircraft approached Koh Samui Airport, the crew contacted the control tower and were informed that runway 17 was active. The tower also advised that the weather was mild with rain southeast of the airport. Due to changing wind conditions on the ground the crew was instructed to use runway 35. While attempting to line up for runway 35, errors caused the crew to perform a missed approach. The tower directed the aircraft to make left turn to avoid mountains and flight 125 started left roll with flaps fully extended in heavy rain. The crew became disoriented and began descending while still in a left roll. The aircraft crashed into a coconut farm southwest of Koh Samui Airport, with the loss of all 33 passengers and 5 crew.

The bridge with one preserved passage tower was built between 1555 and 1560 by Benedict Volch of Ferrol. It was part of the access road to the town of St≈ô√≠bro from Plze≈à and Prague. Today the bridge is designed for pedestrian traffic only. It was declared a Czech cultural monument in 1958 and has been part of the St≈ô√≠bro heritage zone since 1992.  Description  From a technical point of view, the bridge consists of two parts. The first part includes two arches crossing the river M≈æe and the second part consists of three smaller arches that serve as the \\"flood bridge\\". The bridges are not coaxial and there is a bridge gate between them that is supported by a 5.15 meter wide pillar. The tower facade is decorated with letter sgraffito, and the original hexagonal pyramid roof is covered with pantiles. The bridge tower complemented the fortifications of the then very important and rich upper town. It also served as a road toll collection point. The bridge is made from sandstone blocks, it is 60 m long, its width is almost 6 meters. Sandstone used for the construction was mined in local quarries near Tƒõchlovice. The bridge protector saint is St. John of Nepomuk. The original sculpture by Lazar Widman dates back to 1721. The original was moved to the town museum. The replica placed on the bridge was sculpted by Jaroslav ≈†indel√°≈ô in 2005 during the bridge reconstruction. The structure is still preserved in its original form, except for the US Army inscriptions added in 1945, which can be found above both tower portals .  Reconstruction  Until 2000, the historic bridge served road traffic. In 2001, the major overhaul of the tower and the bridge began. The bridge disrepair has further deteriorated during the 2002 flood. The restoration of the tower, the St. John of Nepomuk statue and the bridge itself continued steadily until 2005 when the reconstruction of the inundation part of the bridge body started. The repair proceeded as the funds were made available. In 2015, after 15 years of gradual repairs, the extensive bridge renovation was concluded with the overall cost reaching nearly CZK 20 million.  Recognition  There are only two bridges with bridge gates in the Czech Republic: the Charles Bridge in Prague and the stone bridge in St≈ô√≠bro. The St≈ô√≠bro bridge, an exceptionally valuable Gothic-Renaissance monument from the mid-16th century, was declared a Czech cultural monument in 1958. It has been part of the St≈ô√≠bro heritage zone since 1992. In 2011 the Czech National bank issued a 5000 CZK commemorative gold coin as part of the Bridges in the Czech republic series.The coin was designed by Zbynƒõk Fojt≈Ø.

Biography  Natalia Mela born in Kifissia, Athens and grew up in an upper-class household with historical origins. She was the granddaughter of the \\"Makedonomachos\\" Pavlos Melas and Natalia Dragoumis. Her father was Michail Melas and her mother was the daughter of Ioannis Pesmazoglou, founder of the National Bank of Greece along with Georgios Stavros. Her grandmother from the side of her father was of the Dragoumi family and was the sister of Ion Dragoumis and daughter of Stephanos Dragoumis. 260x260px At 1942 she was enlisted at the Athens School of Fine Arts, with professors such as Kostas Dimitriadis and Mihalis Tompro. She worked at the workshop of Athanase Apartis. She then became a member of the United Panhellenic Organization of Youth, abbreviated EPON and of Greece's Communist Party (KKE). However, after the murder of Kitsos Maltezos she left both organizations. After her graduation, at 1948, she worked for a period of time along her professor Dimitris Pikionis for a stele at the tomb of the bishop Chrysanthos and later for the Monument of the Fallen in Leontio, Nemea in the Peloponnese. She also constructed busts for Stephanos Dragoumis and Georgios Pesmazoglou, where the influence of Pikionis is obvious. In a few years she opened her own workshop in a house in Vasilissis Sofias Avenue and later in Mourouzis Street. Where many Greek artists paid her visits such as Nikos Engonopoulos, Yannis Tsarouhis, Andreas Empirikos and Yiannis Moralis. She was a founder of the artistic team \\"Armos\\". At 1951 she married the architect Aris Konstantinidis (1913-1993) with whom she had two children, Dimitri and Alexandra. For the next ten years she mainly worked for Karolos Koun's Theatre where she was responsible for the stage production.  Artistic Creation  Natalia Mela in the beginning worked with marble and rock, while in the end of 1960s, when she returned from Paris, where she had learned to work with oxygen, she instead focused more on metal, adopting the teaching of abstract art, which was at its heights at the period. This is the period where she abandoned the Hellenocentism of Athens and turned to Paris' Modernism. She used \\"ready-made\\" materials, which she bought from Athinas Street. She drew inspiration from subjects of nature, such as birds and animals (she has created many statues of crows,capricorns,taurs,goats and pigeons) and Greek mythology as well.

It was described at the time by a local journalist as \\"the jammedest jam\\" he had encountered, and was very difficult to clear, with hundreds of men working for six weeks to clear it, eventually using steamboats and dynamite. The jam was also a major tourist attraction, with thousands of spectators every day.  Background  After the Wisconsin Territory was established in 1836, large amounts of Native American land were ceded to the United States via the 1837 Treaty of St. Peters (informally known as the White Pine Treaty). Much of the land was covered in vast pine forests, and logging activities started soon after. This was a winter activity, as the trees were so large that the only way to move them through the forests was by horse-drawn sleds. Teams of lumberjacks cut down trees all winter and collected them by the shores of the St. Croix River or its tributaries. Pine is light and floats well, so the logs could be easily transported downstream by the river. The logs were marked with the relevant company's timber mark and then released into the river when the snow melted and the water rose in spring. Workers known as \\"river pigs\\" guided the logs down the river and kept them moving, especially at difficult places like shallows, rapids or sharp bends. Downstream, the logs were caught in the log boom at the St. Croix Boom Site, where they were sorted by owner, bundled into rafts and then sent to the sawmills.  Causes and start of the 1886 log jam  Dalles of the St. Croix with the bend at Angle Rock In the area now covered by Interstate State Park, the St. Croix River runs through a narrow gorge, the Dalles of the St. Croix, and makes a 90 degree turn at Angle Rock. The spring of 1886 was very dry, so the water level was too low to transport logs. This began to change when the Clam River dam was blown up by the hermit Robert Davidson, who claimed the dam interfered with his meadow lands. Davidson was later charged for blowing up the dam and jailed for contempt of court. The release of the Clam River water caused the St. Croix to rise slightly. Sluice dams on several other tributaries, including Kettle River and Snake River, were opened as well, and coincidentally, heavy rain storms caused the rivers to rise further. (reprint of ); abridged version Large numbers of logs were dumped into the river all at once, more than the river or the driving crews working along could deal with. Shortly after midnight on June 13, 1886, while the driving crews were asleep in their tents, the logs were caught at Angle Rock and quickly started to pile up. More and more logs ran onto the jam, including the 15 million feet of the Clam River drive. The Stillwater Messenger reprinted a report from the Taylor's Falls Journal about the start of the jam: An estimated 125 to 150 million board feet of pine became stuck in the log jam. For comparison, the average annual production of pine in the St. Croix valley between 1870 and 1889 was 241 million board feet.  Clearing the log jam  1886 log jam, Dalles of the St Croix, with bridge in background Smaller log jams could be cleared just by human labor, with river pigs releasing key logs, but this log jam was more difficult and dammed up the river. On June 18, 1886, the New York Times reported that the jam was over two miles long and the largest to ever occur in the Northwest, and four hundred men were working day and night to clear it, while it was still growing at a rate of 700,000 board feet per hour. The logs were owned by more than 100 companies, who joined forces and shared the costs of breaking the jam, which were about $75,000 in total. It was feared that the log jam could endanger the abutments of the two-year-old bridge at Taylors Falls (which until then had been thought to be safe), and some logs sticking out of the almost 70 foot high pile were sawn off. In attempts to clear the logs, two steamboats were used to tug at the front end of the jam. Using ropes, land-based steam engines and horses tried to pull out logs from the jam. Around six to eight million feet were released in this way. Finally, it was attempted to use dynamite bombs. On July 2, 1886, a 24-pound dynamite bomb was exploded, releasing a million feet of logs into the water and moving another 15 million feet out of the main jam. This had broken the jam in two, but also released most of the water that had been held back by the jam. As flowing water was necessary to get the logs moving, this could have impeded the work, but rain soon replenished the river. When a channel was cleared through the jam, only the logs on the banks still required clearing. Cleanup work involving at least 70 people was still ongoing in mid-September.  Tourist attraction  Log jams were a major disruption to the sawmills (the 57-day 1883 jam in the same area had played a part in causing the bankruptcy of Marine Mill in Marine on St. Croix), but also boosted the local tourism industry in Taylors Falls, so were highly welcome events there. Thousands of tourists per day came to see the jam, by special excursion train from St. Paul and by steamboat from Stillwater. Local hotels and restaurants were packed.  The end of log jams  To end the threat of log jams disrupting the industry, lumbermen organized and in 1890, Nevers Dam, said to be the \\"largest pile- driven dam in the world\\", was finished and the flow of logs downstream could be controlled.

It is famous for having been the place of the assassination of Jean Jaur√®s by Raoul Villain on July 31, 1914. On February 20, 1938, the owner Albert Wiedmer donated the marble plaque of the table on which Jaur√®s was assassinated to the municipality of Champigny-sur-Marne at the request of the city's mayor Albert Thomas, a friend of Jaur√®s. It was classified as a Historic Monument object in 1988. Yet the waiters still have the patrons believe the caf√© has kept the original table with a dark stain on a brighter wood that is said to be Jaur√®s's blood. The assassination is still remembered in the caf√©: in 1923, a commemorative plaque was added to the fa√ßade by the Human Rights League; a red and golden floor mosaic shows the date of Jaur√®s's death and the exact place where he fell. Additionally, a window shelters a part of Jaur√®s's chair, his hat with a bullet inside, and the two front pages of the newspaper L'Humanit√© of July 31 and August 1, 1914. On July 31, 1984, President Fran√ßois Mitterrand visited the Caf√© du Croissant to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the assassination. In a radio show, he told that in 1934 he had rushed to the caf√© to pay tribute to Jaur√®s. The establishment was re-opened in 2011 as the Taverne du Croissant. On July 31, 2014, President Fran√ßois Hollande and Germany's Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel visited the caf√© upon the centenary of the assassination of Jaur√®s.

SS-Panzerkorps) was a SS Corps created on July 24, 1944 in southern Poland on the basis of the remains of the headquarters of the in Crimea defeated V Army Corps and employed on the Eastern Front in 1944-1945 during World War II. There were no SS units in the Corps, the SS prefix in the name is explained only by the fact that the commander Matthias Kleinheisterkamp, was not a general of the Wehrmacht, but a SS obergroupenfuhrer. On February 1, 1945 the Corps was transformed to the XI SS Panzer Corps. History The Corps was formed in August 1944 in Western Galicia as part of the 17th Army, which was subordinate to Army Group North Ukraine (in October renamed Army Group A). It defended the front between Tarn√≥w and Pilzno until it had to withdraw to the Western Carpathians during the Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive (January 1945). It became part of the 9th Army tasked with holding a defensive line on the Oder River. On February 1, 1945 the Corps was upgraded to the XI SS Panzer Corps, and was ordered to destroy the Soviet bridgehead near K√ºstrin and relieve the Fortress, but failed.

It operates as an autonomous governmental agency under the Ministry of Finance and is managed by Central Directorate of National Savings. Historically, the operations of National Savings have been geared towards obtaining funds from individual savers in Pakistan in order to provide non- bank financing to the government's fiscal deficit. Towards this aim, the organization offers savings products with competitive interest rates, along with a 100% guarantee from the government treasury on all deposits. History The history of the National Savings Organization in Pakistan dates back to the British Raj when the Government Savings Bank Act, 1873 was promulgated. During the First and Second World War, the British government used the then National Savings Bureau (NSB) to raise funds to meet war-related expenses. After Pakistan acquired independence in 1947, the organization continued to operate as NSB, before being renamed to Central Directorate of National Savings (CDNS) in 1953. In August 1960, the CDNS was given the status of an \\"Attached Department\\" of the Ministry of Finance and made responsible for all policy matters and execution of various National Savings Schemes (NSS). The present structure of CDNS was set up in early 1972 under the Ministry of Finance. In August 2019, the government decided to turn National Savings Organization from a government agency to a corporation that will run under the government. Relevant legislation in this regard, Pakistan Savings Bill 2019, is prepared and being finalized. Finances The organization manages investments worth as of FY 2018-19; an amount that is 25% of the country's net savings - making it the largest financial institution in Pakistan. It has 7 million customers, of which 47% are female, leading it to become the financial institution that is closest to gender parity in the country. The organization sets the rate of interests itself, and revises them at its discretion to offer market-competitive products, and in turn, cheap financing for the government. Operations National Savings organizational structure is based on directorates and branches. The Central Directorate, or headquarters, is located in G-6 Markaz, Islamabad. The organization's regional directorates are located in Lahore, Gujranwala, Faisalabad, Karachi, Quetta, Hyderabad, Multan, Sukkur, Bahawalpur, Islamabad, Abbotabad, and Peshawar. Under these regional directorates, there are 376 branches of National Savings Centers across the country. Products The organization offers several savings and investment products; including prize bonds, saving certificates, and saving accounts. Most products are available to resident and non-resident Pakistanis, however, some products have restricted access and require specified criteria to be met before they are offered. These restricted access products are italicized in the following products list: * Prize Bonds * Premium Prize Bonds * Regular Income Certificates * Behbood Savings Certificates * Defence Savings Certificates * Special Savings Certificates * Short Term Savings Certificates * Pensioners Benefit Account * Shuhadas Family Welfare Account * Special Savings Account * Savings Account References Category:Pakistan federal departments and agencies ","title":"National Savings (Pakistan)"},{"id":"61905669","text":"Kamenka () is a rural locality (a settlement) in Brasovsky District, Bryansk Oblast, Russia.

Synopsis The documentary is based on the Bororo Fulani, a small village tribe of nomad people in Niger. They celebrate the end of rainy season every year in a ceremonial style. The tradition they celebrate is known as, \\"Gerewol.\\" During Gerewol, all the men and women of the tribe gather together to dance and sing as they celebrate the end of the rainy season. Men adorn themselves with beautiful jewelry and facepaint in order to attract the females in the village towards the men. Beauty is very important from an early age and they are taught to love themselves for what they look like and value their thinness. They make it their lifetime mission to be beautiful and feel beautiful for themselves and to others. As such, beauty breeds jealousy and it sparks envy and paranoia over looks and how others perceive each other. The first establishing shot of the film is of the group of people in the tribe singing around a fire during sunset. Later in the film, it shows the tribe in a line singing, while smiling and embracing the camera being in their face. They can be seen sitting with each other while putting cosmetics on, and getting prepared for the celebration. They perform different dances and sang different songs and enjoyed themselves. Cast * Director - Robert Gardner * Narrator - Robert Gardner * Cinematographer - Robert Gardner * Film editors - Robert Garnder, Robert Fulton * Dancers - The Bororo Fulani residents Production The Film what shot in the Niger Republic. Produced by the Film Study Center Harvard University. Produced by Robert Gardner. Published by Documentary Educational Resources Watertown Massachusetts 2005. Release information The film was released in 1980. Reception When the film was released, there was little to no reception from movie critics. According to IMDb, the film was given a 6.4 out of 10, which is a lower rating compared to Time Indefinite, another documentary he made over 10 years later. Based on a review made by Michael Lieber, the film was a success, but there are its pros and cons. For one, he praises Gardner for being creative and having superb filmmaking. In addition, it goes on to mention how Gardner was able to transition through each scene without using a visual cliche in it. When he does this, it helps evoke a sense of amazement of the Bororo style of dancing and it‚Äôs graceful movement. As for cons, Lieber states that the narration doesn‚Äôt mesh well with what the viewer sees on screen. When Gardner shows the tribe getting prepared and helping each other putting on cosmetics, the narration doesn‚Äôt help with what it‚Äôs presenting that it either overstates the case of what we are seeing, or the visual representation we see fails to match with the narration.  About the film  There are different Fulani tribes that can be located in Nigeria; the northern zones, the central zone, and the southern zones. These three zones span across a parallel between the East and the West throughout Nigeria. The north zone is known for their wet season rivers, the Komadugu Yobe and the Komadugu Gana, with the shores of Lake Chad. For the middle zone, it lies along the 12 Parallel of latitude. It is known for being the area of wet season rainpools with little water during the wet season. Finally, the southern zone is known for being an area of heavier rainfall, and being a marshy area, which is unsafe for cattle in the wet season, but providing in the dry season reasonable pasture and a comparatively easy water supply. There are four main tribes in the nomad tribe along Nigeria; Wo'dabe, Daneji-Hontor‚Äôbe group, Mare, and the Ful‚Äôbe Waila. # Wo‚Äôdabe- The Woda'be are in many respects the most interesting of the Fulani groups of the Emirate. The name ' Wo'da'be' is given by some of the Bornu Fulani as the verb ‚Äúwoda ‚Äú, which Gaden in his dictionary translates as ‚Äúto taboo; to have a taboo.‚Äù # Daneji- Hontor‚Äôbe group- The Hontorbe and the Daneji have been classified as a separate group, because they are so insistent on their being non-Woda'be, and because they maintain that they were originally one tribe with a common ancestor, whose name, however, they do not know. # Ful‚Äôbe Waila- The so-called Shuwa Fulani derive their origin from a section of Shuwa Arabs, who emigrated from eastern Bornu to Damagaram in consequence, it is said, of a tribal feud, and intermingled with the FulWe Waila. # Mare- In the Kaga District, some forty miles west of Maiduguri, are certain small sections of semi-nomad Fulani, who by long residence among the Shuwa Arabs as herdsmen, have for- gotten their Fulani tribal origin and call themselves by the names of the Shuwa tribes among whom they lived.

The ship was in service with the Royal Netherlands Navy from 1967 to 1986. The frigate was named after Dutch naval hero Tjerk Hiddes de Vries. The ship's radio call sign was \\"PAVC\\". She was sold to the Indonesian Navy where the ship was renamed KRI Ahmad Yani (351). Design and construction In the early 1960s, the Royal Netherlands Navy had an urgent requirement to replace its s, obsolete ex- American escorts built during the Second World War. To meet this requirement, it chose to build a modified version of the British as its , using broadly the same armament as the original design, but where possible, substituting Dutch electronics and radars. The Van Speijks were long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was standard and full load. Two Babcock & Wilcox boilers supplied steam to two sets of Werkspoor-English Electric double reduction geared steam turbines rated at and driving two propeller shafts. This gave a speed of . A twin 4.5-inch (113 mm) Mark 6 gun mount was fitted forward. Anti-aircraft defence was provided by two quadruple Sea Cat surface-to-air missile launchers on the hangar roof. A Limbo anti-submarine mortar was fitted aft to provide a short-range anti-submarine capability, while a hangar and helicopter deck allowed a single Westland Wasp helicopter to be operated, for longer range anti-submarine and anti-surface operations. As built, Tjerk Hiddes was fitted with a Signaal LW-03 long range air search radar on the ship's mainmast, with a DA02 medium range air/surface surveillance radar carried on the ship's foremast. M44 and M45 fire control radars were provided for the Seacat missiles and ships guns respectively. The ship had a sonar suite of Type 170B attack sonar and Type 162 bottom search sonar. The ship had a crew of 251. An order for four Van Speijks, including Tjerk Hiddes, was placed in 1962, with two more ordered in 1964. Tjerk Hiddes was laid down at the Amsterdam shipyard of Nederlandsche Dok en Scheepsbouw Maatschappij on 1 June 1964 and was launched on 17 December 1965. The ship was completed and entered service on 16 August 1967 with the pennant number F 804. =Modifications= All six Van Speijks were modernised in the 1970s, using many of the systems used by the new s. The 4.5-inch gun was replaced by a single OTO Melara 76 mm and launchers for up to eight Harpoon anti-ship missiles fitted (although only two were normally carried). The hangar and flight deck were enlarged, allowing a Westland Lynx helicopter to be carried, while the Limbo mortar was removed, with a pair of triple Mk 32 torpedo launchers providing close-in anti-submarine armament. A Signaal DA03 radar replaced the DA02 radar and an American EDO Corporation CWE-610 sonar replaced the original British sonar. Tjerk Hiddes was modernised at the Den Helder naval dockyard between 15 December 1978 and 1 June 1981. Dutch service history In 1969 Tjerk Hiddes participated in the NATO exercises Razor Sharp and Peace Keeper and also served with STANAVFORLANT. On 27 August 1978 she was present at the Navy days at Portsmouth. Tjerk Hiddes suffered from boiler problems, and in 1986 was put up for sale along with sister ships , and . The four ships then were purchased by Indonesia. Tjerk Hiddes was decommissioned on 6 January 1986 and transferred to the Indonesian Navy on 13 October 1986. Indonesian service history The ship was renamed Ahmad Yani on joining the Indonesian Navy, with the pennant number 351. By 2002, the ships Seacat missiles were inoperable and it was reported that propulsion problems were badly effecting the availability of the ships of this class. The ship's Seacat launchers were therefore replaced by two Simbad twin launchers for Mistral anti-aircraft missiles, and Ahmad Yani was re-engined with two Caterpiller 3616 diesel engines.

The organ was re-erected at the east end of the north aisle and was enlarged with several additions. A stained glass window by Ballantine of Edinburgh was erected in the tower in memory of Mrs John Northmore, the rector's sister. Gas lighting was introduced into the church, designed by Mr. Rouell of Newton Abbot, and executed by Mr. Willey of Exeter. The tower was restored by Messrs Dart and Francis of Crediton under the supervision of the architect W. D. Car√∂e between 1914 and 1915 at a cost of ¬£800 when the bells were all recast. Organ The earliest reference to an organ is 1527 when the Vicar purchased the organ from the Lady Chapel of Exeter Cathedral for ¬£5. 6s. 3d. (). In 1594 it was reported that the organ contained 82 pipes. In 1854 an organ was installed by H.P. Dicker of Plymouth. This was enlarged in 1870 by the same builder when it was moved to the end of the north aisle. In 1891 Hele and Company of Plymouth installed a new organ and it was used for the first time on Sunday 7 June 1891. This has been restored by the same company in 1901 and 1956. The organ now comprises 3 manuals and 23 speaking stops. A specification of the organ can be found in the National Pipe Organ Register. =Organists= *Thomas Leaman 1857 - 1865 (afterwards organist of St Mary's Church, Ilminster) *Theodore K√∂berlein 1865 - 1866 *Edward Moxhay Vinnicombe 1867 - 1869 (afterwards organist of Upton Church, Torquay) *George Hurrell ca. 1874 - 1893 (blind) *Edward Ellis Vinnicombe 1893 - 1901 (afterwards organist of St Peter's Church, Sudbury) *E.A.

On 12 August 1765 a license was granted by the Bishop of Exeter to cast the five bells into six. This was done in 1766 by Thomas Bilbie of Cullompton. In 1877 a treble and second were added to make a peal of eight. The tower contains a peal of 8 bells cast by John Taylor & Company of Loughborough in 1914 when the tower was restored. They were installed in the tower and dedicated on 3 February 1915.

Personal Benstrup was born in 1692Tops√∏e-Jensen in Gyldendal in the East Jutland town of Ebeltoft where his father was town clerk. Career From his start as a cadet in 1706 Knud Benstrup was on active service throughout the Great Northern War, in 1715 as a junior lieutenant in the ship-of-the-line Ditmarsken under Admiral Christian Thomesen Sehested in the Pommeranian campaigns. In 1723, after the war, he served as adjutant to Admiral Andreas Rosenpalm in Norway. From here, he was ordered home and sent, in the spring of 1714, to France where he would study the theory and mathematics of ship design and the practice of shipbuilding at Brest which at that time was a centre of excellence. From junior lieutenant in 1714, he was steadily promoted until his rank was Commander, senior grade (kommand√∏rkaptajn), in 1731. From his study of shipbuilding in France, he visited Holland to learn about the handling of timber and briefly visited Britain before returning to Copenhagen in 1729 where he was appointed fabrikmester at the naval dockyards of Holmen, two years after Admiral Ole Judich√¶r, who had led naval shipbuilding for many years, had been dismissed from that post following a court martial. Lieutenant Lauritz Bragen√¶s, who had been in England for the same period along with Diderich de Thurah, was appointed joint fabrikmester with Benstrup, but died shortly after. Thurah was then appointed in place of Bragen√¶s, but with the older Benstrup as his superior. Benstrup's first job in the Danish shipyards was to take over responsibility for the building of a ship-of-the-line designed by Rasmus Krag. The latter was most annoyed at being replaced and became a fierce opponent of Benstrup through the rest of his career. ;Benstrup's designs In contrast with Ole Judich√¶r's broad, slow sailing, unwieldy ships, Benstrup placed his main emphasis on ships with sharp, fine lines whereby the Danish fleet came to be in possession of various warships with good sailing qualities, and a much lower incidence of keel failure than previous ships. His system was not to the liking of all the fleet's officers, especially the older generation. The complaints about his construction methods should now be seen as without merit, as the Danish admiralty allocated smaller budgets per ship built, resulting in many smaller vessels rather than very large ships-of-the-line. In 1731, at the same time as his promotion to commander, he was named senior fabrikmester. ;Benstrup's ships The following ships-of-the-line are attributed to Benstrup's finer designsRoyal Danish Naval Museum - Database *Christianus Sixtus (1733) *Delmenhorst (1735) *Dronning Lovisa (1744) *Jylland (1739)Record card for Jylland *Ki√∏benhavn (1744) *Markgrevinde Sophia Christine (1732) *Norske L√∏ve (1735) *Ditmarschen Oldenburg (1732) *Prindsesse Charlotte Amalie (1731) *Prindsesse Lovise (1731) *Prindsesse Sophia Hedevig (1731) *Slesvig (1733) *Svanen (1730) *Tre L√∏ver (1730) *Wenden (1742)Record card for Wenden Plus the frigate Blaa Heyren (1734) and the armed trading ship Kongen af Danmark (1735) Court martial and imprisonment Problems began to mount for Benstrup with the launch of the ship-of-the-line Christianus Sixtus in 1733 Royal Danish Naval Museum - Christianus Sixtus , when it was discovered that the ship had a draught six inches deeper than planned.Nielsen E. Diderich de Thurah had spotted and warned of the potential problem earlier, noticing that much of the timber used in the ship's construction had been insufficiently seasoned, and thus was heavier. The extra draught would not, of itself, have been fatal as there were other ships in the fleet with deeper draughts. Benstrup was ordered by Admiral M Bille to strip out excess timber without altering the integrity of the hull but in doing so he departed from the design plans that had had royal approval. In 1734 a royal commission was established to investigate the problem.The commissioncomprising commanders Suhm, Krag, Neuspitzer and Coningh, and captains Thurah, L√ºtken og L√ºtzow, many of whom had fallen out with Benstrup decided by a majority and gave Benstrup a severe sentence - execution was suggested by Krag - which L√ºtken and L√ºtzow took heavy objection to. Here the characters of the main participants played a part. Benstrup was forceful, but honest and straightforward, but he had got on the wrong side of Count Frederik Danneskiold-Sams√∏e,Count Frederik Danneskiold-Sams√∏e was appointed head of the Danish navy in 1735 - see Balsved who was known to be both capable and ruthless. Other senior officers sided with the Count. To obtain clarity in the case, King Christian VI called them all in for a meeting where L√ºtken took the opportunity to express himself so boldly that he made enemies of both King Christian and Count Danneskiold. Benstrup himself got the opportunity later to present his defence against the accusations but did so without legal representation and in such a fierce and disrespectful manner that he was forced to face a court martial which deemed he had broken his terms of office and sentenced him to imprisonment in Kastellet, the military citadel and prison. Here he remained until 1739 when he was pardoned and released but banished from Copenhagen. Consequences The \\"problem\\" ship Christianus Sixtus served for 35 years, being decommissioned in 1769. With the removal of Benstrup, none of the remaining shipbuilders (Krag, Thuresen, and Thurah) proved up to the required standard, although Thurah retained the title and salary of fabrikmester for many years. Danneskiold prevailed on the newly formed Construction Committee to employ the Frenchman Laurent Barb√© as the main shipwright to the Danish navy. Banishment and death Forbidden to leave Denmark and banished from Copenhagen, but in possession of a pension, Benstrup chose to return to his home town of Ebeltoft where he lived until his death on 26 February 1742.

The name of the card game, Black Peter is probably derived from Petri.  Life  His parents were Johann Peter Petri and Christina Margaretha. Around 1780, Black Peter married Maria Katharina Neumann, the daughter of innkeeper and charcoal burner, Johann Georg Neumann (c. 1723-1803). Maria was born in 1759 in Schmelz (today a district of Neuh√ºtten, about 15 km from H√ºttgeswasen) and lived from 1765 in the hamlet of H√ºttgeswasen. It is no longer possible to determine where the marriage was contracted. With permission of the dukes of Zweibr√ºcken, Petri built a hut in H√ºttgeswasen, next to his father-in-law's dwelling, in which he lived with his family for eleven years. At that time he worked as lumberjack and charcoal burner. The charcoal produced in H√ºttgeswasen was needed for iron and copper smelting by the numerous smeltworks in the district (Amt) of Allenbach. In 1781, his first son, Johann Peter Conrad, (\\"Young Black Peter\\") was born in H√ºttgeswasen. The other children, Elisabeth Margaret (born 1784), John Christian (born 1787), Abraham (1788-1791), Catharine Elisabeth (1791-1792) and John Andrew (born 1792) were also born in H√ºttgeswasen. The remaining three of altogether nine children were not from H√ºttgeswasen: John George (born 1794/1795), Louise (born 1797/1798) and Leonard (born about 1803/1804). Old Black Peter's hut was burned down in 1792 during the French invasion. From this time he led an unsettled life with his family. The Petris left H√ºttgeswasen and lived until 1811 in many places in the Hunsr√ºck and on the right bank of the Rhine, especially in the area of the Odenwald. The father continued to work as a woodcutter, first for about six months for the villages of Beulich and Gondershausen, then for about a year in Schauren near Kempfeld, where he worked for someone in Hottenbach. After a six-month stay in Weiden near Hottenbach, he worked as a woodcutter at the glassworks in Soonwald for almost four years. After that he moved to M√ºnchwald for six months and then again for a short time to the area on the right bank of the Nahe. Petri committed numerous criminal acts such as thefts, burglaries and robberies. Together with Schinderhannes he stole two horses in August 1798 in Ellern. On 12 August 1798, he and Schinderhannes murdered Jewish cattle dealer, Simon Seligmann, in the forest near the Thiergarten forester's house. Three years earlier, the victim had observed the married Black Peter during a tryst with the wife of Polecat James (Iltis-Jakob) in the forest and had told her husband, who then killed his unfaithful wife in a quarrel. Petri was of medium stature and had a smooth and supposedly handsome face, coal-black hair and a dark side whiskers. Contemporaries described him, on the one hand, as a true predator, but on the other as a man who was moved to tears by the sight of a boy, probably because he thought of his children. During interrogations, Petri only incriminated thieves who had previously incriminated him and asked that this be noted in the minutes. He firmly believed that it would be advantageous to ask for a merciful punishment after confessing to each crime and was pleased when other crooks failed to do so. Petri was also very vain. He often mentioned at a more mature age that he had been a very handsome man. When he talked about other members of his family, he always mentioned whether he was a handsome man or not. When he once received tight fitting legwear, he showed them to everyone with obvious pleasure. He liked to recount the love relationships from his younger days. On occasions he showed a pious disposition. But he also thought he was beginning to doubt whether there was a God because he had prayed so much and his situation had not improved. When he spoke of deceased relatives or acquaintances, he always added the words \\"the blessed\\". Old Black Peter was often arrested and interrogated. At the beginning of year VII of the French Revolutionary Calendar, he was arrested in the Canton of Obermoschel and taken to Kaiserslautern and then Simmern. On the 29th Brumaire of year VII he broke out of the tower of Simmern and fled to the east of the Rhine into the Odenwald. In the spring of 1802 he stayed in the Soonwald, but escaped the authorities and, unlike his son, Young Black Peter, did not stand trial in Mainz together with Schinderhannes. In the Odenwald he was once again active as a highwayman, burglar and thief. After the robbery of a stagecoach between Heppenheim and Weinheim on 1 May 1811, in which Swiss merchant, Hans Jacob Rieter, was beaten to death, the then 59-year-old Black Peter was arrested in a general raid. Although he had been living in the Odenwald as a charcoal burner under the name Johannes Wild for a long time and had nothing to do with the robbery, his true identity came to light in the course of the investigations through statements made by fellow prisoners. The former accomplice of Schinderhannes, who himself was executed in Mainz in 1803, was extradited to the French authorities in Mainz on 11 November 1811 for his old crimes, where he was sentenced to life imprisonment together with another member of the Schinderhannes gang, Franz Delis. Petri probably died behind bars. After his death, his body was transferred to the Anatomical Institute of the University of Heidelberg, where allegedly his skeleton was also kept for a long time. Today the skeleton of Black Peter is considered lost, while one attributed to Schinderhannes still exists in Heidelberg today.  Family  Old Black Peter's children, as well as his wife Maria Katharina, who often took part in thefts, also became offenders. The son, Peter Petri, alias Young Black Peter, an accomplice of Schinderhannes, was sentenced to 15 years in chains in Mainz. Another son, Andrew Peter (nicknamed Charcoal Andrew) was sentenced to death for his involvement in the robbery of a stagecoach near Heppenheim in Mannheim, but this was commuted to life imprisonment because of his youth and inexperience.Website with detailed description of the robbery near Heppenheim and the fate of Andreas Petry The sons John George Petri and Leonard participated in thefts. The daughter Elisabetha Margaretha was sentenced in 1812 in Mannheim to six months imprisonment for complicity in a robbery, adultery and trickery. In 1813 the rest of the Petri family was arrested in the Simmern arrondissement for begging and vagabondage. The wife of Old Black Peter and a daughter later went into the poorhouse in Trier, where the latter fled. Nothing is known about her fate.

The event took place on August 2, 2019 at the Esports Arena in Santa Ana, California. It was the second event in the Unbreakable chronology. Nine professional wrestling matches were contested at the event. The main event was a singles match between Sami Callihan and Tessa Blanchard, resulting from winning the Mashup Tournament, to determine the #1 contender for Brian Cage's Impact World Championship at Bound for Glory. Also at the event, Rhino competed in his first match in Impact Wrestling since 2014, in which he defeated Moose. Other prominent matches on the card included Eddie Edwards versus Michael Elgin, Jake Crist defending the X Division Championship in a five-way match, Taya Valkyrie defending the Knockouts Championship against Havok and The North defending the World Tag Team Championship against Rich Swann and Willie Mack and Reno Scum in a three-way match. Production =Background= Impact Wrestling (then known as TNA) previously held a pay-per-view event titled Unbreakable in 2005. On July 11, 2019, Impact announced on its website that Unbreakable would return as an Impact Plus-exclusive monthly special. =Storylines= The event featured wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Storylines between the characters played out on Impact Wrestling and Xplosion. Main event match At Slammiversary XVII, Brian Cage defeated Michael Elgin to retain the Impact World Championship. Later that night, Sami Callihan defeated Tessa Blanchard in an intergender match in the main event. On July 11, it was announced that a Mashup Tournament would take place, in which wrestlers would be randomly paired as tag team partners and four qualifying matches would be taking place with the winning teams competing in a fatal four-way elimination match and the winning team would face each other in a match at Unbreakable to become the #1 contender for the World Championship at Bound for Glory. On the July 19 episode of Impact Wrestling, the teams of Callihan and Blanchard, Elgin and Willie Mack, Moose and Eddie Edwards and Jake Crist and Wentz qualified for the fatal four-way elimination match in the Mashup Tournament, which Callihan and Blanchard won, thus setting up a rematch between the two at Unbreakable. Championship matches At Slammiversary, Taya Valkyrie successfully defended the Knockouts Championship against Havok, Su Yung and Rosemary in a Monster's Ball match. It was later announced that Valkyrie would defend her title against Havok in a singles match at Unbreakable. On the July 19 episode of Impact Wrestling, Jake Crist and Wentz defeated the X Division Champion Rich Swann and Madman Fulton in a Mashup Tournament qualifying match after Fulton turned on Swann to help his Ohio Versus Everything teammate Jake Crist to pin Swann. This earned Crist, a title match against Swann on the following week's episode of Impact Wrestling, which Crist won to win the X Division Championship. It was announced that Crist would defend the X Division Championship against Ace Austin, Trey Miguel of The Rascalz and two unnamed opponents in a five-way match at Unbreakable. At Bash at the Brewery, The North (Ethan Page and Josh Alexander) defeated The Latin American Exchange (Santana and Ortiz) to win the World Tag Team Championship, thus making the tag title match between LAX and The Rascalz at Slammiversary, a three-way match, where North retained the titles. It was later announced that North would defend the titles against Reno Scum (Adam Thornstowe and Luster the Legend) and the team of Rich Swann and Willie Mack in a three-way match at Unbreakable. Undercard matches At Slammiversary, Rhino made his surprise return to Impact Wrestling being disguised under a mask as he rescued Don Callis from an attack by Michael Elgin by striking him with a Gore just after Elgin had lost his World Championship match to Brian Cage and attacked him. Cage and Elgin had a street fight rematch on the July 26 episode of Impact Wrestling, which ended in a no contest as Elgin attacked him backstage and continued the assault in the ring until Rhino appeared again and removed his mask to reveal himself and hit a second Gore to Elgin. Impact Wrestling later announced that Rhino would be competing in his first Impact Wrestling match since 2014 at Unbreakable. Moose had been involved in a feud with Rob Van Dam, whom he defeated at Slammiversary and expressed his dislike for former wrestlers of Extreme Championship Wrestling coming to Impact Wrestling, which led to Moose being announced as Rhino's opponent at Unbreakable. A few more matches were announced for the Unbreakable special including Eddie Edwards versus Michael Elgin and Madison Rayne in action. It was also announced that Scott Steiner would return to Impact Wrestling by teaming with Jordynne Grace and Petey Williams in a six-person tag team match. Event =Preliminary matches= The opening match was a tag team match between PPRay and the team of Chris Bey and Watts. PPRay won the match by executing a fireman's carry into a brainbuster on Watts. Next, Jake Crist defended the X Division Championship against Ace Austin, Adrian Quest, Danny Limelight and Trey Miguel in a five-way match. Crist performed a diving cutter on Limelight to retain the title. Next, Madison Rayne took on Ayoka Muhara. Rayne executed a Cross Rayne on Muhara to gain a victory. Next, Eddie Edwards took on Michael Elgin. After a back and forth match, Elgin delivered an Elgin Bomb to Edwards for the win. Next, Scott Steiner made his return to Impact Wrestling as he teamed with Jordynne Grace and Petey Williams to take on Dicky Mayer, Gentleman Jervis and Ryan Taylor in a six-person tag team match. Near the end of the match, Williams nailed a Canadian Destroyer, Steiner nailed a Frankensteiner and Grace executed a Grace Drive on all three opponents and then applied Steiner Recliners on all three of them for the win. Next, Taya Valkyrie would defend the Knockouts Championship against Havok. Near the end of the match, Havok prevented a Road to Valhalla attempt from Valkyrie until John E. Bravo interrupted by dragging Valkyrie outside the ring. This led to Havok hitting a chokeslam on Bravo and Valkyrie rolled her up to get a near- fall. Valkyrie then raked Havok in the eye and left the ring to get purposely counted out and retain the title. Later, Rhino took on Moose. After a back and forth match, Rhino nailed a Gore on Moose for the win. In the penultimate match, The North (Ethan Page and Josh Alexander) defended the World Tag Team Championship against the team of Rich Swann and Willie Mack and Reno Scum (Adam Thornstowe and Luster the Legend) in a three-way match. North nailed a tandem alley oop on Thornstowe to win the match and retain the World Tag Team Championship. =Main event match= In the main event, Tessa Blanchard took on Sami Callihan to determine the #1 contender for the Impact World Championship at Bound for Glory. Blanchard executed a Magnum on Callihan until Jake Crist interfered and caused the distraction. Crist then handed his X Division Championship belt to Callihan and he hit Blanchard with the title to win the match. After the match, Tommy Dreamer saved Blanchard from Ohio Versus Everything and put her over. Reception Andrew of SoCal Uncensored criticized the audio quality of the event, citing \\"From the poor mixing to the sounds in the ring not being picked up more clearly, and to the main live audio feed being broadcast in mono while the pre tapes were in stereo really hurt this show. I feel like if Impact had someone better running audio, this show would‚Äôve been really great. Instead, it hindered it and hurt my enjoyment of several matches, like Elgin vs. Edwards. The production really came off as amateurish as a result.\\" However, he praised some of the matches and in-ring performances, citing \\"Impact Wrestling had a good outing for their return to SoCal. Danny Limelight might‚Äôve had the best showing on the card out of all the locals. His performance in the X-Division match was the highlight of that match. Elgin/Edwards was the best match of the night.\\", with \\"Aside from the Knockouts title and Madison Rayne‚Äôs matches, everything on this show was solid. Don Callis and Josh Matthews were great on commentary too.\\" Larry Csonka of 411Mania considered it an average event and gave a rating of 6.0. According to him, Unbreakable \\"was an overall solid show, with Edwards vs. Elgin & Tessa vs. Sami being the best matches. But they really need to fix the sound levels on these shows as the crowd was once again poorly mic‚Äôd, which killed the show‚Äôs atmosphere.\\" Aftermath Rich Swann and Willie Mack retained in title contention as they earned a World Tag Team Championship match against The North at Bound for Glory. Rob Van Dam and Rhino defeated North in a non-title match on September 13 episode of Impact Wrestling, which resulted in RVD and Rhino being added into the tag team title match, making it a triple threat match for the championship at Bound for Glory. Taya Valkyrie and Havok continued their feud after Unbreakable as the two competed in a rematch for the Knockouts Championship on the October 11 episode of Impact Wrestling, where Valkyrie retained her title after John E. Bravo pulled out the referee while the referee was counting the pinfall for Havok, leading to the referee disqualifying Valkyrie. The feud between Tessa Blanchard and oVe continued after Unbreakable as Blanchard competed against OVE members in various matches. On the September 27 episode of Impact Wrestling, Blanchard defeated Dave Crist to qualify for a ladder match for Jake Crist's X Division Championship at Bound for Glory.

It became the home of Sir Gerard Noel Edwards, MP for Rutland in the early 19th century. It passed to Edwards' son Charles Noel, 1st Earl of Gainsborough in 1838 and then to Edwards' grandson, the Rt Hon Gerard James Noel, also MP for Rutland, in 1866; Gerard Noel substantially rebuilt the house laid out the gardens as well, in the 1870s. The design of the building, following the rebuilding, involved a main frontage of eight bays facing north east; there were round-headed windows on the ground floor and square windows on the first floor with a pediment containing a clock above. In 1936, following a debate, Rutland County Council chose by 18 votes to 6 votes to leave their previous facilities at Oakham Castle and to acquire Catmose House for use as their new headquarters. Changes were made to the property including the installation of a council chamber in a room with a marble fireplace and the conversion of part of the garden into a car park. Following changes to the layout of the building, the main access was from the south east, through a stone porch with an arched entrance; there was a balustrade above the porch and a window on the first floor. After implementation of the Local Government Act 1972, when Rutland was reconstituted as a district of Leicestershire, it became the local district headquarters. Then, following the re-incarnation of Rutland County Council in April 1997, it became the headquarters of the new unitary authority. A large extension was built to the north west of the house. When the police station in Station Road was closed, a local police enquiry desk opened in January 2015 in the reception area. The old police station was sold in 2016. Works of art in the building include a painting by Dorothy Snowdon (1921‚Äì2014) depicting an osprey.

It was printed and published by Alfons Siffer, who also published its Dutch-language counterpart, Het Belfort. The founders of the periodical came from the French- speaking Catholic bourgeoisie of Ghent, and included clergymen, lawyers and politicians. Canon Hector Hoornaert was an important influence, and Jean Casier the main financier. The first issue appeared in January 1884. Initially disseminated within Belgium, and largely comprising contributions from Ghent, from 1890 Le Magasin was also published in Paris, and from 1892 in Lyon, although the editorial committee remained based in Ghent. Around 1890 it became a more purely literary review, with Maurice Dullaert, Henry Carton de Wiart and Firmin van den Bosch taking a role. In 1891 the title was shortened to Le Magasin litt√©raire to reflect the new emphasis. The magazine had trouble competing with the literary review Durendal (founded 1894), and after Jean Casier's death it was wound up.

Like all Serial Box productions, it is available as an audio drama and an ebook. A print version is also available. The story is set in Prague in 1970, just after the Prague Spring. CIA spy Gabriel Pritchard engages in espionage against the KGB, particularly against Russian agent Tanya Morozova. His work is compromised when he is embroiled in a conflict between two warring groups of sorcerers known as the Ice and the Flame, who have infiltrated the intelligence agencies of all major world superpowers. Gabe and Tanya's loyalties to their countries and magical allies are tested as each group attempts to seize control of a Russian defector, who also happens to host a powerful elemental spirit. The story was followed by a second season in 2017. A third season is in development, but as of June 2018 it had not been greenlit. Plot Summary Season 1 Gabe Pritchard and Joshua Toms are CIA agents working in Prague in 1970. Two years ago in Cairo, Gabe experienced an accident in which he lost his memory of an entire day. Since that time, he has been afflicted by excruciating headaches. He botches a CIA mission due to one of these headaches, and his status at work falls into jeopardy. Tanya Morozova and her partner Nadia are both KGB agents and members of the Consortium of Ice. The Ice and the Flame are groups of sorcerers seeking to control all 36 hosts, human beings who are possessed by elementals. The Flame seeks to rid the world of all non-magic users, and the Ice wants to preserve the world as it is. Adula Zlata, a Czech college student, is one such host. Tanya tells Andula the truth about her identity, and Andula decides to accept the Ice's offer of protection. Gabe and Josh suspect that Tanya and Nadia are recruiting Andula for the KGB. Jordan Rhemes, a bartender and sorcerer, was in Cairo at the time of Gabe's accident. She informs him that his headaches are related to magic. He interrupted a ritual by Flame Acolytes in which they attempted to create their own host. As a result, the elemental involved in the ritual attached itself to Gabe. The attachment was imperfect, resulting in headaches and seizures. Rhemes refers Gabe to Alestair Winthrop, an MI-6 agent and Ice member. Alestair teaches Gabe basic sorcery and helps him learn to control the elemental. Alestair and Josh begin a physical relationship, despite the fact that same-sex relationships are stigmatized by both Czech society and their own intelligence agencies. Gabe discovers that the Ice is freezing hosts in stasis, preventing them from being used by the Flame while simultaneously imprisoning them. He reveals this information to Tanya; her loyalty to the Ice is shaken. Gabe accidentally uses his new powers to awaken a golem, which begins terrorizing Prague and murdering police officers. Gabe and Tanya work together to subdue the golem, leading to a tenuous alliance. The CIA plans Operation Anchises, in which they will extract a Russian scientist and defector named Sokolov when he attends a scientific conference in Prague. They call in Dominic \\"Dom\\" Alvarez from Langley, Virginia to assist with the operation. Gabe uses magic to start a brawl at the conference. Josh and Alvarez extract Sokolov during the chaos and take him to a safe house. Aleksander \\"Sasha\\" Komyetski, head of the KGB office in Prague and Flame Acolyte, discovers an illicit radio in Tanya's apartment. He uses the radio to blackmail her into invading the CIA safe house. Tanya attacks the safe house, but Gabe informs Dom that the KGB is on its way. Dom escapes with Sokolov, who is also a host. Gabe allows Tanya to escape rather than shooting her. When Dom's flight path deviates from its planned course, Gabe realizes that Dom is a Flame agent who now has Sokolov in custody. Gabe, Tanya, Nadia, Alestair, and Jordan work together to perform a ritual to bring down Dom's plane. Dom kills Sokolov and escapes via parachute; the CIA and KGB both try to piece together an understanding of these events without knowledge of the sorcery behind them. Background Max Gladstone pitched the idea of a serialized spy thriller to Serial Box founder Julian Yap. Gladstone was interested in the city of Prague but had no expertise about the Cold War or espionage. Yap approached Lindsay Smith for the project. Smith has degrees in Russian studies and computer security. As of 2017, she worked as a cyber-intelligence expert for a private security firm. Gladstone and Smith served as show runners; they began by writing a \\"bible\\" for the series which mapped out the characters and plot lines. They then teamed up with four other authors in order to produce the story. The first season was written in batches of four episodes, and each group of episodes was reviewed for consistency. Each episode was read, reviewed, and edited by the authorial team. Unlike some Serial Box productions, each episode builds on the previous ones and advances the overall plot. Though episodes are not designed to stand alone, the team wanted each episode to feel like its own small story, in the style of a television episode. Reception Publishers Weekly praised the writing team and called the drama \\"brilliantly conceptualized and executed\\". Writing for Locus, Liz Bourke praised the vividly-drawn characters and the consistency of the serial's tone despite multiple different authors. A reviewer from Tor.com praised the prose's quick wit and appreciated the complexity of the cast of characters.

His parents were quakers and he followed his father into the banking business in Ipswich. In 1810 he married Ann Dillwyn, daughter William Dillwyn and Sarah Dillwyn of Higham Lodge, Walthamstow. He built Alexander House for his family on the junction of St Matthews Street and Portman Road, which was used as student flats.

He retired around 1830 for health reasons and devoted himself to religious and worthy causes. Nevertheless, he retained some business appointments until his death: he was chairman of the Ipswich dock Commission and the Ipswich branch of the Suffolk Alliance Fire Office. He was also a director of the Ipswich Water Works Company. Other activities He played a major role in the local quaker community and in the temperance movement. He was a friend of Thomas Clarkson who lived in nearby Playford, Suffolk. They shared abolitionist sympathies. When he provided land for development in the 1850s, he ensured that some streets should be named after several abolitionists. These included Dillwyn Street which could refer to his father-in law, William or the anti-slavery MP, Lewis Weston Dillwyn, his brother-in law.

There was the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Squatters' Union and the Squatters Union of Victoria. Quadrant, a cultural publication based in Sydney ran a story titled the 'Excremental Politics of Squatters' Union' in 1989.  England Squatters in England have formed squatters unions. In London there was a squatters union in the 1970s and Piers Corbyn was an advocate. The union negotiated with the Central Electricity Generating Board so that squatters could access amenities. The still active Advisory Service for Squatters grew out of the union. In the city of Brighton and Hove, a squatters union was set up in the 1970s by Bruno Crosby. It later became known as the Sussex Housing Movement. The union occupied many houses for people to live in. A group which included Tony Greenstein made a deal with a landlord to live and repair a derelict hotel in Hove at 9 Lansdowne Place. Twenty people lived in the licensed squat for the next five years. Steve Bassam, now Baron Bassam of Brighton, squatted in Brighton and also participated in the union. In more recent times, the Squatters Network of Brighton (SNOB) proposed that licensed squats could be a way to solve the city's housing crisis.  Poland  In Polish osadnik communities, a settlers union (Polish: Centralny ZwiƒÖzek Osadnik√≥w Wojskowych) was founded by March 1922 and offered credit, funded scholarships at various universities of agriculture, and founded schools.  United States  In the United States squatter groups have taken on various names including clubs, associations, or unions. Solon Robinson who settled with his family in the area now known as Crown Point, Indiana established a squatters union in the 1830s. Land speculators were a problem for members. The union grew to 500 members. John Tipton spoke in support of the group. Perrine, Florida had a squatters union of farmers during the late 19th century. In more recent times squatters have formed unions to represent their interests. Examples include Homes not Jails in San Francisco. In New York City, residents in eleven squatted buildings successfully legalised with the assistance of the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board. These buildings included C-Squat and Umbrella House.

Purism claimed that the phone would become \\"the world's first ever IP-native mobile handset, using end-to-end encrypted decentralized communication\\". Purism has cooperated with GNOME in its development of the Librem 5's software. It is planned that KDE and Ubuntu Touch will also be offered as optional interfaces. The release of the Librem 5 has been delayed several times. It was originally planned to launch in January 2019. Purism announced on September 4, 2018 that the launch date of the Librem 5 would postponed until April 2019, due to two power management bugs in the silicon and the Europe/North America holiday season. Development kits for software developers, which were shipped out in December 2018, were unaffected by the bugs, since developers normally connect the device to a power outlet rather than rely on the phone battery. In February, the launch date was postponed again to the third quarter of 2019, because of the necessity of further CPU tests.

By May 2020, TechRadar reported that the call quality was fine, though the speaker mode was \\"a bit quiet\\" and the volume adjustment didn't work. The battery time, at 3-5 hours, and the inability of the phone to charge while turned on, they called \\"A stark reminder of the Librem 5's beta status\\". In December 2019, Purism announced that it will offer a \\"Librem 5 USA\\" version of the phone for the price of $1999, which is assembled in the United States for extra supply chain security. According to Purism's CEO, Todd Weaver, ‚Äúhaving a secure auditable US based supply chain including parts procurement, fabrication, testing, assembly, and fulfillment all from within the same facility is the best possible security story.‚Äù  Hardware  An initial rendering of the Librem 5 phone The Librem 5 features an i.MX 8M Quad Core processor, with an integrated GPU which supports OpenGL 3.0, OpenGL ES 3.1, Vulkan 1.0 and OpenCL 1.2 with the default drivers; however, since the driver used is the open source Etnaviv driver, it at present only supports OpenGL 2.1 and OpenGL ES 2.0. It has 3GB of RAM, 32GB of eMMC storage, a 13MP rear camera, and an 8MP front camera. The left of the phone features three hardware kill switches, which cuts power to the camera and microphone, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth modem, and the baseband modem.) The device uses a USB-C connector to charge its 3600mAh lithium battery. The 144mm (5.7\\") IPS display has a resolution of 1440√ó720 pixels. It is the first phone to contain a smartcard reader and two M.2 slots for replaceable cellular modem and WiFi/Bluetooth cards. It also has a 3.5mm headphone/mic jack, a single SIM slot and a microSD. =Mobile security= The hardware features three hardware kill switches that physically cut off power from both cameras and the microphone, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and baseband processor, respectively. Further precautionary measures can be used with Lockdown Mode, which, in addition to powering off the cameras, microphone, WiFi, Bluetooth and cellular baseband, also cuts power to the GNSS, IMU, ambient light and proximity sensor. The kill switch to cut the circuit to the microphone will prevent that the 3.5mm audio jack is used for acoustic cryptanalysis. Librem 5 is the first phone with easily-accessible hardware kill switches to cut the electrical current to the cellular baseband, Wi-Fi/Bluetooth and GNSS. This is possible due to the fact that these components are not integrated into the System on a Chip (SoC) like in conventional smartphones. Instead, the cellular baseband and Wi-Fi/Bluetooth are located on two replaceable M.2 cards, which means that they can be changed to support different wireless standards. The Librem 5 uses six separate chips (i.MX 8M Quad, RS9116, BM818/PLS8, Teseo-LIV3F, WM8962 and bq25895) in place of the integrated mobile SoC found in most smartphones. The downside is that it takes more energy to operate separate chips and the phone's circuit boards are much larger, but using separate components mean longer support from the manufacturers than mobile SoC's which have short lifespans. According to Purism, the Librem 5 is designed to avoid planned obsolescence and will receive lifetime software updates. The Librem 5 is the first phone to contain a smartcard reader, where an OpenPGP card can be inserted for secure cryptographic operations. Purism plans to use OpenPGP cards to implement storage of GPG keys, disk unlocking, secure authentication, a local password vault, protection of sensitive files, user personas, and travel personas. To promote better security, all the source code in the root file system is free/open source software and can be reviewed by the user. Purism publishes the schematics of the Librem 5's printed circuit boards under the GPL 3.0+ license, and publishes x-rays of the phone, so that the user can verify that there hasn't been any changes to the hardware, such as inserted spy chips.  Software  Phosh, the GNOME mobile shell, developed by Purism and GNOME (2018-05) The Librem 5 ships with Purism's PureOS, a Debian GNU/Linux derivative. The operating system uses a new mobile user interface developed by Purism called Phosh, a portmanteau from \\"phone shell\\". It is based on Wayland, wlroots, GTK 3 and GNOME. Unlike other mobile Linux interfaces, such as Ubuntu Touch and KDE Plasma Mobile, Phosh is based on tight integration with the desktop Linux software stack, which Purism developers believe will make it easier to maintain in the long-term and incorporate into existing desktop Linux distros. Phosh has been packaged in a number of desktop distros (Debian, Arch, Manjaro, Fedora and openSUSE) and is used by 8 of the 16 Linux ports for the PinePhone. The phone is a convergence device: if connected to a keyboard, monitor, and mouse, it can run Linux applications as a desktop computer would. Many desktop Linux applications can run on the phone as well, albeit possibly without a touch-friendly UI. Mobile/desktop convergence: the Librem 5 mobile, when connected to a keyboard, screen, and mouse, runs as a desktop computer. Purism is taking a unique approach to convergence by downsizing existing desktop software to reuse it in a mobile environment. Purism has developed the libhandy library to make GTK software adaptive so its interface elements adjust to smaller mobile screens. In contrast, other companies such as Microsoft and Samsung with Ubuntu (and Canonical before Unity8) tried to achieve convergence by having separate sets of software for the mobile and desktop PC environments. Most iOS apps, Android apps and Plasma Mobile's Kirigami implement convergence by upsizing existing mobile apps to use them in a desktop interface. Purism claims the \\"Librem 5 will be the first ever Matrix-powered smartphone, natively using end-to-end encrypted decentralised communication in its dialer and messaging app\\". Purism was unable to find a free/open source cellular modem, so the phone uses a modem with proprietary hardware, but isolates it from the rest of the components rather than having it integrated with the System on a Chip (SoC). This prevents code on the modem from being able to read or modify data going to and from the SoC.

Through comedy and farce, it explores the theme of hypocrisy, especially that based on social status.  Plot synopsis  The plot occurs between the years 1918-1928, in Montgomery, Alabama. Hortensia Reedmuller Banastre is a beautiful woman who comes from old money. She is the mother of two, and is trapped in a loveless, yet \\"socially appropriate\\" marriage. She falls in love with Hercules, a teenage black prizefighter. After Hercules dies as the result of a train accident, and the failure of the slow, for-blacks-only ambulance, Hortensia gives birth to their daughter, Catherine. To avoid the inevitable scandal, Catherine is raised by Hortensia's cook. However, the jealousy of Hortensia's son, Paris, who becomes increasingly crazed, threatens to upend the balance Hortensia has achieved in her life; and continued secrecy becomes impossible once Catherine, who clearly does not belong in either black or white worlds, becomes curious as to her lineage. After some emotional upheaval, however, the Hortensia and Catherine's lives settle into a new and happy order. Subplots in the novel include the view of Montgomery and its residents through the eyes of the black prostitutes Banana Mae Parker and Blue Rhonda Latrec, who divide the town by sexual categories, and the star-crossed film stars Grace Deltaven and Payson Thorpe.  Characters  * Hortensia Reedmuller Banastre: A wealthy, unhappily married woman who falls in love with a young black man, causing emotional upheaval in the lives of her family and herself. * Carwyn Banastre: Hortensia's husband and father of Horetensia's two sons. * Hercules Jinks: The young prizefighter with whom Hortensia has a love affair, resulting in the birth of their daughter, Catherine. * Paris Banastre: Hortensia's son, who's obsession with his mother threatens to upend all the family's lives. * Catherine: Daughter of Hortensia and Hercules. * Reverend Linton Ray: An inept, uptight reformer. * Blue Rhonda Latrec and Banana Mae Parker: Entrepreneurial prostitutes who make a living off of the sexual double standards of the local white men. * Grace Deltaven: Local girl who becomes a silent film star, and marries film idol Payson Thorpe.  Reception  New York Times reviewer Annie Gotlieb, analyzes Brown's view that passion is inherently innocent, but places the choices characters make in its name in the context of rules: \\"It's a grown-up novelist's insight that every freedom must be understood within the bounds of a shared social structure that can, if stretched, yield painful renewal; if shattered, tragedy.\\" Gotlieb laments Brown's need to fit the novel's plot into too-tight constraints: \\"It's rare to say that a book would be better if it were longer, but I suspect that in a less impatient era Southern Discomfort would have been a 700-page epic that slowly revealed the roots of character and the intertangling of disparate lives. As it is, the book often seems abrupt and arbitrary, jump-cut as if it were a two-hour movie... minor characters, like Hercules's boxing manager, Sneaky Pie, are so vivid that they cry out for more space. The plot moves in fits and starts. A fistfight between mother and son is perfectly rendered, but a later, even more crucial scene of violence is rushed and anticlimactic. The reader is left feeling charmed, moved - and a little bit cheated.\\" In a generally positive review, Kirkus nevertheless rates Southern Discomfort as, \\"Brown, less infectiously than in Ruby fruit Jungle or Six of One, celebrates anything-goes sexual exuberance and scampers up and down the ladder of social class.\\"  References   External links  * Category:1982 American novels Category:Novels set in Alabama ","title":"Southern Discomfort (novel)"},{"id":"61906482","text":"Ma Yugui (born 4 March 1995) is a Chinese athlete.

Biography  Roumpos was born in Georgitsi, near Sparta at 1873. He studied painting and sculpting at the Athens School of Fine Arts with professors suchs as Nikephoros Lytras and Broutos. Roumpos drew mostly portraits and busts, such the ones of architect Aristotelis Zahos, poet and play writer Polyvios Dimitrakopoulos, Rigas Feraios, Athanasios Diakos and others. A marble bust that he made of the poet Lorentzos Mavilis is placed at the square of the same name in Athens. The artist using realistic traits of the person that was Mavilis, due to the fact that Mavilis himself, at the age of 53, posed for Petros Roumpos. The bust was placed at its current location by the Athens Municipality at 1938. The same bust exists in other three copies: in Corfu, Ioannina and at the Offices of Greek Writers. Petros Roumpos' work includes funerary monuments, such as the one of the family of Georgios Athenogenous (1910), with a seated winged figure, at the First Cemetery of Athens, as well as the Monument dedicated to the High priests in Tripoli, with engraved details of the acts of the Arcadians during the Greek War of Independence.

They are off the C√¥te-Nord (North Shore) of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. Location The islands are in the municipality of C√¥te-Nord-du-Golfe-du-Saint-Laurent in Le Golfe-du-Saint-Laurent Regional County Municipality. The group of islands and rocks protect Ouapitagone Harbour and the Ouapitagone Strait. Islands include the main Ouapitagone Island, Lac Island, the Ouapitagone du Large Islands and the Cormoran Rocks. They give their name to the canton of Archipel-de-Ouapitagone. The islands are near the mouth of the √âtamamiou River. They are made of high granite rocks. Local fishermen have visited them for many years to harvest the abundant wolffish (Anarhichadidae). Navigators in the past often used the islands as a source of fresh water. Name Jacques Cartier mentioned the islands in 1535, and called them the Ysles Sainct Germain. The islands are called Ouapitougan on Bellin's map of 1744 and Wapitagun on an 1877 map by the hydrographer H. W. Bayfield. Later sources use Wapeetougone, Wapitagone, and Jupitagun. Some say these are variants of the Innu language word Shushupitagon, meaning \\"whetstone\\". Others say that Ouapitagone is the name of the rare white-winged cormorant, or could mean \\"place marked by the white droppings of cormorants\\". The Innu of the region call the Ouapitagone du Large island Matshatihk Kaiapit Ministukua, meaning \\"Island of the deformed caribou.\\" Navigation Between Point Sealnet and Ouapitagone Island to southwest there are many small islands and rocks as far as offshore. Only small vessels can navigate these waters, and the crew must have local knowledge of the Ouapitagone Archipelago. The Cormoran Rocks, from Ouapitagone Island, are marked with a light from a tower. Small craft can anchor in Ouapitagone Harbour, which is between Ouapitagone Island and the outer islands, but again local knowledge is needed to navigate the two entrances. The south coast of Lac Island has red, craggy cliffs more than high that have been stained white by seabirds.

The protesters consisted of mostly students from over 300 universities, and with no association with any particular political parties or groups. The protests were the most prominent student movement in Indonesia since the 1998 riots that brought down the Suharto regime. In several cities including Jakarta, Bandung and Padang, protesters clashed with the Indonesian National Police (Polri), resulting in the riot police firing tear gas and water cannons. In the capital city of Jakarta, the police confirmed that at least 254 students and 39 police officers are injured or being treated in hospitals. In Kendari, Southeast Sulawesi, two students died, one of them allegedly being shot during the violent clash. Another three protesters died in Jakarta. Background =Revision of Corruption Eradication Commission Law (RUU KPK)= The Revisions to Law no.30/2002 on Corruption Eradication Commission (RUU KPK) was ratified by the members of the People's Representative Council (DPR) who serve 2014‚Äì2019 term on 17 September 2019. Among the parliament, all parties under the government coalition, Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDIP), Golkar, Nasdem Party, People's Conscience Party (Hanura), United Development Party (PPP), National Awakening Party (PKB), as well as an opposition party National Mandate Party (PAN) unanimously approved the bill. The ratification was made in just 13 days since the initiation. The initiation of the bill was made on 5 September 2019 without any significant interruptions. On 11 September 2019, President Joko Widodo issued a presidential letter to the Ministry of Law and Human Rights to discuss the revision along with the DPR. The administration agreed with the revision on 16 September, and the bill was ratified on the next day. The revision was widely condemned by activists and experts for undermining the efficacy of KPK. Corruption is a significant political issue in Indonesia, and KPK, established in 2002, was a part of the reform demands that followed the overthrow of the authoritarian Suharto regime. Since its establishment, KPK has been known for targeting high-profile politicians and business people. The revision calls to reduce KPK's independent status by making it a governmental body, establishing an oversight council to monitor the commission, requiring KPK investigators official permission to conduct wiretaps, among others. According to a poll conducted by Tempo on 16 September, overwhelming 82.61% of the public opposed the revision and urged the President to veto the bill. Prior to the ratification, there were already numbers of small-scale protests going on in different cities. In Bali, hundreds of people gathered on 12 September 2019 to raise concerns over the bill. On the other hand, counter-protest by the pro-revision groups were also held in front of KPK headquarter in Jakarta. Some participants of the counter-protest reportedly admitted of being paid to participate without much knowledge on the issue itself. =Revision of Criminal Code Bill (RKUHP)= On 18 September 2019, the parliament discussed the bill on the revision of criminal code (RKUHP). The new criminal code has been under the creation for the past few decades, intended to replace the Dutch era set of laws. The amendment was previously introduced in 2015 by Yasonna Laoly, the minister of Law and Human Rights. Since earlier this year, conservative Islamic groups have been pushing again for an overhaul of the criminal code. The latest proposal includes several laws based on conservative religious interpretations, including the ban on premarital sex, living together outside of marriage, performing black magic, and abortion without reasons of medical emergency and rape. The draft criminal code also criminalises insult against the president, vice president, religion, state institutions and state symbols such as the flag and national anthem. The draft code was decried as \\"disastrous not only for women and religious and gender minorities, but for all Indonesians\\" by Andreas Harsono of Human Rights Watch. The vote was scheduled to be held on 24 September 2019, but facing the public outcry, the President announced to postpone the vote on 20 September 2019. However, there were still fears of the parliament pushing for the vote before the end of their term on 24 September 2019. Demands A student group by the name of the Alliance of Acting People released what is called as \\"seven demands\\" (7 Tuntutan). These demands are shared by most of the rallies across the archipelago. The demands consist of the following: # Urge a delay to re- discuss the problematic articles in the RKUHP # Urge the government and the parliament to revise the recently passed KPK Law and reject any weakening of efforts to eradicate corruption in Indonesia # Demand that the state investigates and try the elites responsible for environmental damage in several regions in Indonesia # Reject the problematic articles in the Labour Bill (RUU Ketenagakerjaan) which do not favour workers # Reject the problematic articles in the Land Bill (RUU Pertanahan) which are a form of betrayal of the spirit of agrarian reform # Urging the passing of the Elimination of Sexual Violence Bill (RUU PKS) # Encourage the democratisation process in Indonesia and stop the arrest of activists in various sectors The Executive Body of Students (BEM), a nationwide student organisation, also released what is called as \\"seven urges\\" (7 Desakan). The student rally in Jakarta on 24 September 2019 put up these demands. The demands consist of the following: # Reject the RKUHP, the Mineral Mining Bill, the Land Bill, the Correctional Procedure Bill, the Labour Bill, revoke the KPK Law and the Natural Resources Law, pass the RUU PKS and the Domestic Workers Protection Bill # Cancel the troubled KPK leaders chosen by both chambers of the People's Consultative Assembly # Deny TNI & Polri officials from occupying civilian positions # Stop militarism in Papua and other regions, release Papuan political prisoners immediately # Stop the criminalisation of activists # Stop burning forests in Kalimantan & Sumatra carried out by corporations, and address corporate forest fires, and revoke permits # Resolve human rights violations and prosecute human rights criminals, including those sitting in power circles. Restore the rights of the victims immediately. Protests While small-scale demonstrations were already held sporadically, mass protests took place on 23 and 24 September, the last two days before the term end of the incumbent parliament members. The protest spread nationwide, including Jakarta, Bandung, Yogyakarta, Surabaya, Malang, Palembang, Medan, Padang, Semarang, Surakarta, Lampung, Aceh, Palu, Bogor, Denpasar, Makassar, Balikpapan, Samarinda, Purwokerto, Tasikmalaya, Kediri, Tanjungpinang, Cirebon, Jombang, and others. =23 September= Students of various universities in the Jakarta metropolitan area responded to calls on social media to gather in front of the National Parliament Building in Jakarta. There was also a small presence of a student organisation, the Progressive Student for Anti-Corruption (MAPAK). On this day, both sides of the pro and anti-bill camps were present at the place. Anti-bill camp increased its number as time progresses, blocking the Gatot Subroto Avenue on the way to Slipi. Large numbers of farmers also joined the event from the afternoon to protest against the Land Bill, marching down from the Merdeka Palace. While there were attempts to block the Jakarta Inner Ring Road, the rally ended without significant altercation. Protesters shout slogans such as \\"DPR are fascist and anti-democratic\\". The protest in Jakarta was crowd-funded through KitaBisa. The number of protesters reached two thousand. Rallies were also held peacefully in other cities, including Yogyakarta, Bandung, Malang, Balikpapan, Samarinda and Purwokerto. Rallies in Yogyakarta, Bandung, and Malang gathered more than a thousand participants. =24 September= Polri officers and Brimob water cannons in front of the DPR/MPR Building in Jakarta, 24 September 2019. Greater Jakarta Metropolitan Regional Police received an announcement for another rally scheduled on 24 September 2019. In anticipation of the event, a total of 18,000 personnel was deployed around the parliament building. Another 252 police officers were dispatched for traffic control. On this day, students from the remote area including Bandung and Yogyakarta participated in the demonstration in Jakarta. At 16:00, the crowd was already occupying the Gatot Subroto Avenue in front of the parliament building. Student representatives demanded a meeting with the House leaders, which was rejected by the police. This prompted protesters to throw rocks and bottles into the building, and eventually, attempt to intrude into the site by breaking the fence. The police responded by launching water cannon into the protesters and firing tear gas to disperse the crowd. The clash continued until midnight. There was a reported case of police beating up a limp protester at the Jakarta Convention Center. The police acknowledged the destruction of three police and military vehicles as well as three police outposts. They also confirmed the arrest of 94 protesters, injury of 254 protesters and 39 police officers. Among them, eleven are reportedly hospitalised, and three are critically injured. The number of participants in the Jakarta protest reached tens of thousands. In Padang, thousands of protesters clashed with the police and security forces armed with water cannons. Protesters eventually overwhelmed the police and entered into the governor's office. Rallies were held peacefully in other cities, including Palembang, Semarang, Surakarta, Medan, Lampung, Aceh, and Makassar. Rallies in Palembang, Lampung, and Makassar gathered more than a thousand participants. =25 September= Vocational school students from various parts of the Jakarta metropolitan area continued the rioting in front of the parliament building. On one occasion, a molotov cocktail was thrown towards police barricades. The police apprehended 17 protesters, mostly underage students. The police reported that some of the protesters do not recognise the content of the bill. The police have confirmed the deaths of two protesters. One is a high school student who died in a traffic accident on the way to the demonstration in Jakarta. The other one, neither a high school nor university student, likely died due to suffocation. A journalist of Narasi TV was physically abused, and her mobile phone was seized by the members of Mobile Brigade Corps (Brimob) for attempting to film live footage during the demonstration in Jakarta. In Surabaya, the head of provincial legislative council Kusnadi reached out to protesters, explained that he has no authority to overturn the controversial bills and he also disagreed personally to the decisions made by the national parliament. =26 September= In Kendari, Southeast Sulawesi, two students died after a violent clash between the protesters and police in front of the provincial legislative council (DPRD) building. A student was allegedly shot, and the Indonesian Ombudsman has launched an investigation into the origin of the bullet. Southeast Sulawesi police chief denied the use of live rounds nor rubber bullets by the police force. Later that evening, another student succumbed to blunt force injuries to the skull, after attempts to operate on his injuries failed to improve his condition. Usman Hamid of Amnesty International demanded the authority for an immediate investigation and accountability. A board chairman of the Muhammadiyah Student League (IMM), to which the victims belong, demanded the removal of the Southeast Sulawesi police chief from its position. Solidarity rallies for the victims were held throughout the country. Rallies were continuously held nationwide, including in Surabaya, Magelang, and Ciamis. In Magelang, an employee of the Ministry of Transportation was injured during the evacuation from the riot. =27 September= Hundreds of students from the Muslim Students Association (HMI) held a protest and burned tires in front of the parliament building in Jakarta and elsewhere, demanding accountability for the two victims in South Sulawesi. A clash occurred between the protesters and riot police in Makassar, and one protester was hit by a riot control vehicle. =30 September= As the last parliament session was being held, protests are again being held in several cities. In Jakarta, protesters were blocked from protesting in front of the parliament building as it was barricaded by the police. Protests were held peacefully in Mataram, Pekanbaru, Yogyakarta and Kendari. Reactions President Joko Widodo denied the possibility of vetoing the ratification of RUU KPK. The Minister of Law and Human Rights Yasonna Laoly also assured that the President would not issue a presidential decree to repeal the revision. Widodo and Laoly both stated that the issue should be settled through the constitutional procedure by filing to the Constitutional Court. Laoly criticised the demonstration and urged not to normalise the forceful amendment of the legislation, citing the risk of legitimising governmental institutions. The Minister of Research, Technology and Higher Education Mohamad Nasir stated that the President warned university lecturers against student mobilisations. He stated that lecturers, who called upon their students to join the protest or lecturers whose students are found joining the protest would be sanctioned by the government. Oce Madril, the head of an anti-corruption study centre in Gajah Mada University, criticised the President's response, stating that he had failed to respond to the public resentment toward RUU KPK. He contrasted with the RKUHP, which was postponed, arguing that the President's lack of willingness to accommodate the voice of people would strengthen the allegations that there is corruptive power behind the legislation, and the President himself is a part of the corruption. Oce also stated that this event had devastated public trust toward President's commitment to eradicating corruption. The government of the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia have issued travel warnings to citizens who wish to visit Indonesia.https://m.detik.com/travel/travel-news/d-4719679/banyak- demo-di-indonesia-australia-keluarkan-travel-advice =Criticism on foreign media coverage= The student protests made headlines not only in the national media but also in international news outlets. However, many international news outlets focused only on the contentious Criminal Code (RKUHP) bill, in which one of its articles criminalises premarital sex. These outlets published articles implying that Indonesians were only protesting about \\"sex before marriage\\" bill or \\"sex ban law\\", dubbed by The BBC and The Japan Times respectively. This was criticised by the Indonesian media and activists, as the revision of the RKUHP is only one among several problematic bills that the students are protesting. The students have seven demands in total, encompassing several issues.

It is close to the east coast of the island, about 3 km south of Laxey and 6 km NE of Douglas. It is in the historic parish of Lonan, in the sheading of Garff. For administrative purposes it is in the parish district of Garff, and it is also in the House of Keys constituency of Garff. Geography Baldrine is located on the A2 road, the coast road between Douglas and Ramsey and the area includes three halts (or stations) on the Manx Electric Railway: Baldrine, Sunnycott and Garwick Glen. The River Gawne flows through the village and then through Garwick Glen down towards Garwick Beach at Garwick Bay (part of Laxey Bay). Also within the bounds of Baldrine is Ballannette Country Park, a nature reserve which includes a group of lakes and bird watching locations. The country park is a registered Dark Sky Park, where light pollution is restricted. History The name of the village dates back to at least 1643 and comes from the Manx words Bailey drine, which translates to \\"farm of the blackthorn\\". It has had two Primitive Methodist chapels, the first was built in 1843, under the direction of Anne Kelly, a resident of Barroose. Her husband, Thomas Kelly, sold of land for the chapel for 2 shillings. Anne Kelly laid the first stone, and prayed upon it for the head of the church to bless the building. The building would cost ¬£100 to erect. The second chapel was built in 1883 when the first started to exceed its capacity, at the cost of ¬£383. The new chapel could seat 118, and included a Sunday school for the local children. In 1850, the Liverpool Arms public house was opened in the village. The pub was shut in 2017, and the brewery that owned it put it up for sale, on the understanding that it would not longer be a pub. However, the local council did not allow the change of use, stating that the building should remain a pub. In 2018 Laxey Bay was designated as a Marine Nature Reserve.https://www.gov.im/about-the- government/departments/environment-food-and-agriculture/ecosystem-policy-and- energy/wildlife-biodiversity-and-protected-sites/protected-sites/marine- nature-reserves/?iomg-device=Mobile References Category:Isle of Man Category:Villages in the Isle of Man ","title":"Baldrine"},{"id":"61906822","text":"Aksel M√∏llers Have is an underground Copenhagen Metro station located at Aksel M√∏llers Gave, off Godth√•bsvej in the Frederiksberg district of Copenhagen, Denmark.

A key figure in the transmission of Greek thought and literary culture into a Syriac milieu, his monastery became the intellectual centre of the West Syriac world for the next three centuries. John was born in Edessa and raised by his mother, Aphtonia. (His surname means \\"son of Aphtonia\\".) His father was a rhetor. John himself was bilingual in both the Syriac language and Greek. At the age of fifteen he was sent to the monastery of Saint Thomas in Seleucia Pieria near Antioch. Sometime between 528 and 531, he left with several other Miaphysite-leaning monks facing persecution from the pro-Chalcedonian imperial authorities. They established the monastery of Qenneshre on the banks of the Euphrates near Jarabulus and elected John as their first abbot. According to the historian Zacharias Rhetor, John was part of the Miaphysite delegation that negotiated with the Emperor Justinian I in Constantinople around 531. A Syriac biography of John was written after his death by a monk of Qenneshre. John himself wrote in both Greek and Syriac. Among his surviving works are hymns; a commentary on the Song of Songs, which survives only in excerpts in catenae; and a biography of Severus of Antioch. His Greek hymns were often associated with the hymns of Severus. They were translated into Syriac a century later by Paul of Edessa, another monk of Qenneshre.

He gained a good reputation in this profession, even if considered a less careful dealer and a more solitary businessman than his father. Through his work at Christie's, he \\"consolidated its dominance of the London fine art auctioneering scene\\", continuing his father's work there. He oversaw several notable sales at the auction house, and passed the business along to his son, ultimately ensuring it remained in the family until 1889. Aside from his work as a businessman, Christie was an amateur classical scholar. He produced works on the Greek origins of Chess, Etruscan vase painting, elemental themes in Paganism, and Ancient Greek sculpture, for which he received generally favourable reviews. He befriended several notable contemporary scholars, such as Sir John Soane and Charles Townley, who encouraged his studies and provided him with rare antiquities. Early life Portrait of James Christie the Elder, 1778. James Christie was born in 1773, in Pall Mall, London, as the eldest son to James Christie the Elder, a prominent and successful auctioneer of London. M.A. Michael (2019). \\"Not Exactly a Connoisseur A New Portrait of James Christie\\". The British Art Journal (London: Robin Simon). 19:76.. (2019) He was educated at Eton College, where his family planned for him to take up an ecclesiastical career. Here, he entertained classical interests and his obituary reported that \\"he passed through that school with a reputation honourable\\". After his father's death in 1803, he abandoned the church, and took over the family business. Auctioneering While under James Christie's control, Christie's \\"consolidated its dominance of the London fine art auctioneering scene\\", according to Oxford Dictionary of National Biographer contributor Francis Russell. While few sales reached the dramatic heights of his father's tenure, Christie oversaw several notable sales in the auction house, including: William Young Ottley's collection of Italian Primitives in 1811, the models of Joseph Nollekens in 1823, and the large art collection of Thomas Lawrence in 1830. Unlike his father, who had several business partners throughout his life, Christie worked alone as an auctioneer, even as the firm expanded rapidly. Christie's auctioneering skills were well received, though not as highly as his father's. William Roberts, in his history of Christie's, claimed his \\"success as an auctioneer was only one degree less than his abilities as an author\\". William Henry Ireland (under the pseudonym 'Satiricus Sculptor, Esq.'), in his satire Chalcographimania (1814), favourably described Christie's skills as a dealer, being \\"the most classical of our auctioneering fraternity, having been gifted with scholastic education [...] As a vendor he ranks very fair\\". Despite this, he ridicules Christie for mistaking a painting of Frans Floris (under the name 'Florus') for a \\"chef-d'≈ìuvre ‚Äî Florentine\\", an anecdote he refers to as \\"supris[ing]\\" for Christie's \\"knowledge of several schools of painting\\", while hinting at his inferiority to his father. His obituary claimed he \\"raised the business he followed to the dignity of a profession\\", through his diligent study and \\"undisputed\\" taste in fine art. Scholarship and antiquarianism Aside from his family business, throughout his life, Christie was a committed historical and classical scholar. His first publication was An Inquiry Into the Ancient Greek Game (1801), a study on the origins of Chess claiming to find its origins in Ancient Greece, specifically the game of Petteia, and of \\"pastoral origin\\", i.e. the product of gradually improved folk tradition rather than one man's invention. The British Critic, approved of the book, having \\"certainly employed much learning and acuteness\\", they gave \\"high commendation to the classical turn and taste of the whole volume\\", though the work was criticised for some careless mistakes. Charles Tomlinson, in his brief history in Amusements in Chess (1845), quotes Christie at length and refers to his arguments as \\"ingenious\\". red figures upon a black ground\\" as proof of his thesis that the vases began as representations of \\"transparent figures\\" used in religious plays. Christie befriended the prominent classical collector Charles Towneley, who encouraged him in the study of Etruscan vase painting. The product of this study was A Disquisition upon Etruscan Vases (1806), printed privately and anonymously, and later republished as Disquisitions upon the painted Greek Vases (1825) under his name, with several sections expanded. The book attempted to prove the origins of the vase's figures in the Eleusinian Mysteries, speculating that the vases were representations of puppets used in religious plays, in which \\"dark superficies, in which transparent figures were placed,\\" or \\"opake figures, moved behind a transparent canvas,\\" were used, and that vase painters were hired to \\"trace [...] these phantasmagoric shadow projections\\" as funerary memorials for cult initiates. Additionally Christie created a Linnaean system of classification for these vases, now \\"generally regarded as his more lasting contribution\\" according to Noah Heringman. The 1810 The Monthly Review assessed Christie's book favourably as \\"highly interesting to the classical antiquary\\", though the reviewer notes that it \\"involves a great variety of curious subjects, all bearing more or less relation to the principal point\\" and \\"presupposes in its reader so much acquaintance with the mixed character of heathen mythology\\". The Gentleman's Magazine was equally impressed, \\"allow[ing] every credit to the ingenuity and sagacity of Mr. Christie\\", though they lament that \\"most of the ancient vases must remain unintelligible [...] therefore, Mr. Christie succeeds in some instances and fails in others, [and] no man living can do more.\\" The next work Christie produced concerned pagan religions, entitled An Essay on that Earliest Species of Idolatry: The Worship of the Elements (1814). This book surveyed elemental themes from many early European and Asian religions, notably including Chinese conceptions of the elements, which were the subjects of two coloured plates. The essay received a mixed review from The Monthly Review, praised as \\"generally founded on arguments that are at least plausible, and often on convincing facts\\", but criticised for Christie's \\"disposition to refer everything in Pagan antiquity to a scriptural origin\\". In 1822, Christie's considerations on a massive vase found in Hadrian's Villa, 'Dissertation on the Lanti Vase', were published in Outline Engravings, and Descriptions of the Woburn Abbey Marbles (1822) as an appendix. This vase was an exemplary piece of Greek pottery, decorated with classical masks and theatrical scenes, which had formerly been owned by the Lanti family. Alongside these historical interests, Christie had interests in fine art, poetry, and biblical studies. These fine interests were recognised, with his election into the Society of Dilettanti in 1824, a society of well- to-do classical scholars, and the Athenaeum in 1826. He was also the registrar of the Royal Literary Fund for several years, a society which he contributed to considerably, and a member of the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne, one of the oldest societies of its kind. Posthumously, his work on the history of Ancient Greek sculpture, An Inquiry into the Early History of Greek Sculpture (1833), was published by his son, James Stirling. The book was printed in 50 copies, for private circulation, though it had originally been intended as an introduction for the Dilettanti Society's Specimens of Ancient Sculpture, Vol. 2 (1836). After Christie's death, the Society's committee had decided against such a speculative essay for the volume's introduction, so it was scrapped in favour of an essay by another member, Richard Payne Knight. Personal life and death According to Ireland, \\"in private life his character will stand the test of the most minute inquiry\\". Christie befriended several contemporary scholars of note, all \\"of great moral and intellectual note\\" according to his obituary. Christie was a good friend of the Freemason and architect Sir John Soane, who shared his interests in ancient religions and cults. Christie sent several of copies of his books to Soane, and Soane invited Christie to the opening of the tomb of Pharaoh Seti I by lamplight, which Christie missed, lamenting that it \\"would be so particularly interesting to me as it would coincide so nearly with my speculations upon the lamplight exhibitions at Eleusis\\". Two contemporary portraits were made of Christie, an 1826 bust by William Behnes, which both Henry Corbould and Robert Graves sketched, and a 1821 drawing by E. Turner, now stored at the Victoria and Albert Museum. In 1824 he moved to 8 King Street, St James's Square, London, where Christie's \\"Great Rooms\\" had moved in the fall of 1823. After a prolonged illness, Christie died at his house on 2 February 1831, at the age of fifty-eight. His obituary was published in The Gentleman's Magazine. He left two sons George Henry Christie (d. 1887) and James Stirling (d. 1834). The eldest, George, took over Christie's business, partnering with Thomas H. Woods (d. 1906) and William Manson. James Christie the Younger's grandson, James H. B. Christie, was the last Christie to have a connection with the firm, and retired in 1889. From thereon, Christie's was no longer a family business.

Friction welding machines  State-of-the-art CNC technology is used by U-JIN Tech Corp both for automatic material transport and in cases where high accuracy is required. Due to the position measuring devices known from CNC milling machines, the length tolerance of the components can be maintained more accurately than with conventional hydraulic machines. It is even possible, to bring the spindle to a standstill in a given position so that the two eyes of a drive shaft can be positioned at an angle to each other. The two spindles of U-JIN's computer numerical controlled double-head friction welding machines are driven by servo motors that allow the angular position of their motor shaft to be controlled, as well as the speed of rotation and acceleration, since they are equipped with position sensors. If the spindles are controlled in the same way as CNC-controlled servo motors, angular accuracies of ¬±0.5¬∞ can be achieved, e.g. at both ends of a cardan shaft.Stephan Kallee: U-Jin: 12 t Friction Welding Machines - CNC 12DF-P Double Servo Motor Spindle Machine with 12 t Force.

Although the pieces were not originally organized into a collection by Bach himself (as were most of his other keyboard works, such as the Well Tempered Clavier and the English Suites etc.), the pieces share many similarities, and are frequently grouped and performed together under a collective title.Schulenberg 2006, 97. History The toccatas represent Bach's earliest keyboard compositions known under a collective title. The earliest sources of the BWV 910, 911 and 916 toccatas appear in the Andreas-Bach Book,Schulenberg 2006, 98. an important collection of keyboard and organ manuscripts of various composers compiled by Bach's oldest brother, Johann Christoph Bach between 1707 and 1713.

This indicates that most of these works originated no later than Bach's early Weimar years, though the early northern-German style indicates possible Arnstadt origin. Composition The works bear an early northern-German influence, with distinct contrasting sections and fugal passages ingrained into the rhapsodic material, as opposed to the more familiar, two-movement prelude and fugue format. Other early Bach works that follow this sectional, Buxtehude-influenced format include the Prelude (Toccata) and Fugue in E major, BWV 566,Williams 2003, 160. and Prelude and Fugue in A minor, BWV 551.Williams 2003, 131. Though the specific instrumentation is not given for any of the works, they are all strictly manualiter, as none of them call for pedal parts. Like Bach's other clavier works, these toccatas are frequently performed on the piano. Because of some of the organ-like textures, the pieces are sometimes performed on the organ.Schulenberg 2006, 99.

Commonly, these games are played with teams, with one team being considered ‚Äúgood‚Äù and another being ‚Äúbad.‚Äù During gameplay, players can use logic and deductive reasoning to try to deduce one another's roles, while other players can bluff to keep players from suspecting them. Examples of social deduction games include Mafia, in which only the mafia know who is mafia and what the mafia players' roles are; Bang!, in which only the sheriff's role is known to everyone; and Secret Hitler, in which only the fascists know who the fascists are. Other social deduction games include The Resistance, A Fake Artist Goes to New York, Coup, Deception: Murder in Hong Kong, Dracula's Feast, The Chameleon, Two Rooms and a Boom, Spyfall 2, Love Letter, Witch Hunt, and Crossfire. Social deduction games have been adapted to video games numerous times through mods or full games. One instances of such adaptations are custom maps for Warcraft III, both including Mafia, and variants with active gameplay in maps like Werewolf, Zerg Infestation, or The Thing. Other notable examples include Garry's Mod mod Trouble in Terrorist Town, Town of Salem, StarCraft II's Phantom Mode mod, and Among Us. One important element of strategy in some social deduction games is determining how long to stick to one's story in the light of information obtained from other players. A Monte Carlo tree search has been suggested for making decisions in social deduction games, like The Resistance: Avalon.

In the course of human interaction, one party will say or do something that causes negative emotional feelings for another. Negative social interactions can be intentional where one or both parties are involved in interpersonal conflict or unintentional where misunderstandings occur. Actions such as failure to recognize accomplishments or significant dates can cause hurtful outcomes within relationships. Hurtful communication more commonly occurs in intimate relationships where parties have disclosed more information to one another than stranger interaction. Hurtful communication has been studied in romantic relationship and parent- child relationships with findings having potential applications in sibling relationships, in-law relationships, work relationships, educator-student relationships, and friendships. In relation to other negative emotions such as anger or guilt, hurt is more often linked to interpersonal interaction. Interactions are adversely affected by hurtful communication. Hurtful communication negatively affects trust within a relationship resulting in more defensive behavior by both parties. Hurtful communication topics can be found interpersonal communication and relational communication research.  Defining hurtful communication  Types of hurtful verbal communications and actions: * Devaluationthe perception that one is not as close as thought. This can be a result of verbal or non-verbal communication where one party feels less important than they desire within the exchange. Often, devaluation is manifest through betrayal and/or rejection. *Relational transgressionsthe violation of relationship norms which causes one party to feel betrayal. * Hurtful messages- words that result in pain. Commonly these messages are combinations of profanity, threats or attacks on appearance, competencies, origins or character. The content of the message and the delivery play a part in how a hurtful message is interpreted. Factors such as whether the hurtful communication was intentional and the frequency of occurrence has an impact on the meaning of the event. Types of hurtful communication include relational denigration, humiliation, aggression, intrinsic flaw, shock, tasteless humor, misunderstood intent, and discouragement as probable causes of hurt feelings. Hurtful communication is interaction that causes the victim to feel marginalized. The injured party most often is harmed by the undermining of self-concept causing loss of self-worth resulting in estrangement within the relationship as the victim has difficulty trusting themselves and the one who engaged in hurtful communication.  Use of hurtful communication  Communication is not exclusively a sender/receiver exchange of finite information. What is communicated through verbal and nonverbal communication is interpreted by both parties through a lens of schema of previous experiences and knowledge. Rather than scholarly research defining phrases and terms that universally are considered hurtful, researchers focus on what communication causes negative feelings in the victim. Expressions of honest feelings by one party can be devastating to the other such as professions of attraction to another person or expressing disinterest in continuing a romantic relationship. A child displaying disinterest in a parent's involvement could be considered hurtful communication just as a parent criticism could be hurtful to an adolescent. In less familiar relationships such as acquaintances or strangers, hurtful communication is more general and typically focused on observations such as gender, race, sexual orientation or identity, ethnicity, national origin, or religion often in the form of verbal slurs and hate words. The more familiar the relationship becomes, the more specific and personal hurtful communication potential.  Responses to hurtful communication  Guerrero, Anderson & Afifi (2010) noted three ways people react and respond to hurtful communication: * Active verbal responses- Verbally confronting the offending party. * Acquiescent responses- Acknowledging the offender's ability to inflict pain and surrendering. This action includes forgiveness. * Invulnerable responses- Avoidance of acceptance of a hurtful message often deflected through humor or ignoring. Rumination (over-focusing on the occurrence rather than solutions) may prevent one from moving past the infraction. It is probable that one or more (even all three) responses occur in when someone is faced with hurtful communication. In cases where the injured party perceived the hurtful communication intentional relational distancing often occurred which complicates resolution.  Application  Hurtful communication studies fall under relational communications which is an interdisciplinary subject with connections to psychology, sociology, and communication fields. Researchers have produced various studies over past two decades relating to hurtful communication. = Romantic Relationships = Scholarly research on the topic of hurtful communication in romantic relationships is more readily available than any other category. Romantic partners use communication to construct and evolve their relationship or as a means to sabotage stability. Partners rate their relationships based on the current communication (whether positive or negative). Perhaps due to the closeness and interdependency of romantic relationships, communication between romantic partners that is deemed hurtful has significant impact on current and future interaction.Young, Bippus, & Dunbar (2015) state the intimate knowledge of the significant other's hopes, fears and insecurities enable each party to inflict pain more deeply than others in one's life. Intimate knowledge of all aspects of another's life gives access that can be used both positively and negatively. In conflict interaction, observations from one's partner may be processed differently than a non-conflict interaction. Self-uncertainty often occurs after a negative exchange rather than partner-uncertainty. When both self-uncertainty and partner-uncertainty occur the relationship status is called into question. Malachowski et al., (2015) found when self-uncertainty or partner-uncertainty occurred, it was more likely the parties would engage in forgiveness after a hurtful communication event theorizing it was part of the coping mechanism to reduce relationship-uncertainty. = Parent-Child Relationships = The parent-child relationship is to some degree involuntary but both parties develop communication that provides the structure for the relationship. Relationships between parent and child is a deeply connected bond that evolves over time where familiarity and the changing dynamics can result in hurtful communications. The responsibility of parents to nurture their offspring has been theorized to result in more hurt feelings for the parents than the child when hurtful communications occur. While adolescence also feel pain from hurtful communications, adolescence may be less likely to verbalize their feelings perhaps due to the parent-child dependence that exists. Perceived rejection or betrayal between parent-child results in doubts of self, other and relationship as questioning of honesty, intimacy and closeness often occurs. Self-identity and family-identity is unstable when hurtful communication has or is occurring because eventually communication will be impaired. Since the attachment between parent and child differs from that of a romantic relationship, there is a difference in how hurtful communication is processed.

That small trickle of water became known as ‚ÄúBloody Spring‚Äù and the event has been called the ‚ÄúBloody Spring Massacre\\" since that time. The story of the massacre has been passed down through the Degler family, whose farm neighbored the Spatz homestead.  Massacre of the Spatz family  One version is that someone in the Spatz family killed an Indian and in retaliation his companions killed the entire family. George Frederick Degler, a German pioneer who settled in Berks County in 1738, is said to have had a reputation among the Indians of this area as a fair and kind man.https://www.ancestry.ca/boards/thread.aspx?mv=flat&m;=1&p;=surnames.stertzel However, by 1757, warriors of the Lenape, the original inhabitants of the Schuylkill Valley who had moved westward to the Ohio Valley, were attacking settlers south of the Blue Mountain in the vicinity of the Spatz and Degler homesteads. There are various versions of the Spatz and Degler stories, but no contemporaneous accounts (such as military journals or reports to colonial authorities) have been found. One popular version of the story is that after hearing Indian war whoops at the Spatz farm next door, the Deglers fled to nearby Fort Northkill, leaving their homestead unoccupied. Upon returning home weeks later, they found the house ransacked and a family chest brought from Germany by Mr. Degler chopped open.  Berks County and Tulpehocken Township During the French and Indian War  The word Tulpehocken is of Indian origin meaning ‚ÄúLand of Turtles.‚Äù At the time of the Bloody Spring massacre, Tulpehocken Township had become the frontier in the French and Indian War, as the few white settlers who had established farms north of the Blue Mountain fled southward. The French and Indian War is the only armed conflict in which people were killed within the borders of Berks County. Conrad Weiser, Pennsylvania's long-time ambassador to the Six Nations of the Iroquois in today's central New York, directed the construction of forts to protect the German farm families in the northern part of Tulpehocken Township (now Upper Tulpehocken Township established in 1820) from Native American attacks. One of these forts built for that purpose was Fort Northkill, erected in early 1756 following the initial Lenape incursion in November 1755. However, the small stockade (approximately 32 feet square) was poorly constructed, and the hastily built house inside was ill-suited to shelter refugees in inclement weather. On October 1, 1757, the Lenape from the Ohio Valley attacked again near Fort Northkill in Tulpehocken Township. An application was made to Conrad Weiser in Reading, PA for help. Captain Oswald sent two lieutenants and forty men to assist residents in that area. Conrad Weiser was forced to choose between the Iroquois and the Lenape tribes due to political pressures.Indian attacks on Berks County settlers 2-6-19 on the bctv.org YouTube channel William Penn signed a peace agreement with the Lenape tribe, who were not organized like the Iroquois. Lenape were most respected as native peoples after the peace treaty with William Penn was signed. However, as conflict between the English and the French escalated, the Iriquios became the pivotal tribe for alliance. As a result, Conrad Weiser had to allow the Iriquios and the settlers to ‚Äúrun over the Lenape.‚Äù German settlers forced the Lenape out of Berks County. The Lenape had been pushed up the Schuylkill River over time. Then the Lenape moved out of Berks County and westward towards Pittsburgh, but were resentful about it. Several generations after William Penn and the peace treaty, the Lenape adopted a lot of European ways and needed gunpowder and to have their families fed while they were gone. The French offered this support for the Lenape to return to attack settlers in Berks County in small raiding parties. The Lenape traveled on foot for these attacks. The Lenape lived in the Ohio Valley at the time of the Bloody Spring massacre and were angry about being moved there from Berks County. One hundred and fifty Berks County residents were killed and about 150 were kidnapped by the Lenape tribe during the French and Indian War. Some Berks County residents in 1755 were Amish, and did not believe in violence, and so were killed when the Lenape attacked their homes and kidnapped women and children to replenish the number in their tribe Often the kidnapped people would be ransomed back, but not always. At the end of the French and Indian War, a number of captives decided to remain with the tribes that kidnapped them because they had integrated into the tribe. The Reading courthouse has a display of Indian Massacres in Berks County in hallway between annex and main courthouse, marking the estate of people who died from wounds from Indian attacks, so the French and Indian War affects the legal history of Berks County as well through probate cases. Fort Dietrich Snyder was situated north of Strausstown and about two miles west of Fort Northkill. This fort was used as an observation post, from which burning homesteads could be seen for miles.  The Degler Chest  George F. Degler emigrated from Germany in 1738 and settled on what was then Berks County's northern frontier, near present-day Strausstown in Upper Tulpehocken Township in Pennsylvania. He brought with him a cedar chest, which would become a treasured family heirloom. After killing the Spatz family, the Lenape Indians went to the Degler home and ransacked it. It included breaking open a cedar chest Degler had brought from his native Germany with tomahawks. When Degler returned to his home, the Indians apologized for breaking the chest and repaired it. ‚ÄúAs a token of the regained friendship the Indians repaired the chest top which they had split and carved on it two fish, as a sign that the Deglers gave the Indians food; a heart symbol of friendship, and crossed canoe paddles, emblem of peace. Degler carved his initials on the chest, brought with him from his native Germany, and the year of the brief uprising, 1752.‚Äù The Indians repaired the chest and, as a token of renewed friendship, carved tribal symbols into it. They included two fish, a sign Degler had given them food; a heart, symbolizing friendship; and crossed canoe paddles, emblems of peace. To commemorate the event, Degler carved \\"GFD: 1752\\" on the chest. \\"The Degler family intended to preserve this chest and had it from one generation to the other as a relic of the fearful conflicts with the Indians which their forefathers had in the early settlement of the country.\\" Mrs. Minnie Degler Stertzel explained, a great granddaughter of the pioneer Degler. Mrs. Stertzel told of a family agreement regarding the Degler Chest that has been in force since that day in 1752. The chest would never be taken from the Degler homestead, but would remain there as a mute reminder of early pioneer struggles. ‚ÄúTo remind them of the fearful conflicts with the indians they had endured.‚Äù The chest has only been away from the homestead once. The occasion was a special Fourth of July celebration during World War II in 1942. Mrs. Stertzeil keeps a detailed family record of the chest's possession, tracing it from her great-grandfather to the prest day. The family ledger shows the following chain of ownership: George F. Degler, brought the chest from Germany, 1738. Ownership passed to a son, Frederick Jacob Degler, 1755. To John Frederick Degler, 1787 To George Frederick Degler 1827 to John W. Degler 1855 To Frederick Jacob Degler, 1888 To Phoebe Degler Henninger1914 To Dora Degler Henninger Wagner 1937 and now to Mrs. Stertzel. Mrs. Stertzel traces her lineage through Charles Degler, her father; to Jerry Degler, her grandfather and George Degler, her great-grandfather.  Haunting of Bloody Springs  The Spirit Society of Pennsylvania (SSP), a ghost investigative group, went to Bloody Springs in 2008 and one of its members allegedly saw the dead Spatz family in her mind's eye lying in the creek bed.

Location The river runs through the Basse-C√¥te-Nord between the Olomane and Little Mecatina rivers. It has a very irregular course of . Upstream from Lake Manet, about from its mouth, the river divides into two sections which meet again at Foucher Lake, further down. The river again divides into two channels before reaching the gulf, which one arm enters downstream from the hamlet of √âtamamiou and the other arm enters in Bussi√®re Bay. There is an impressive rapids near the mouth, but above this the river is calm. The mouth of the river is in the municipality of C√¥te-Nord-du-Golfe-du-Saint-Laurent in Le Golfe-du-Saint-Laurent Regional County Municipality. The river mouth is about west of La Tabati√®re and east of Natashquan. The Ouapitagone Archipelago is just south of the river mouth. Name In the Innu language the word \\"aitumamiu\\" means \\"splitting in two\\" or \\"lake with two outlets\\". The name is related to Itomamo. In the past it has been spelled Etamamu, Itamamiou, Hightomamiou, Aitomami, Etaumamiu, Itamamu and Itumamu. The present form of √âtamamiou was used on a regional map of 1913. At that time, two sections of the river were identified, but one was incorrectly shown as ending in Coacoachou Lake and the Bay of Wolves (Baie des Loups) in the west. The error was not corrected on the maps until 1950. The Innu call the river Uiahtehau, meaning \\"the leaves change color in the fall.\\" It is also called Mistamiskaikan Hipu. Watershed The river drains a watershed of around . The mountainous region is rich in wildlife such as hare, ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus), spruce grouse (Falcipennis canadensis), ptarmigan (Lagopus), boreal woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), moose (Alces alces), marten, Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) and porcupine. The waters are used by beaver (Castor canadensis), muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), otter, mink and migratory birds. European presence Around 1733 Jacques de Lafontaine de Belcour established a French trading post at the river's mouth. In 1764 the post was sold to the English, and apparently remained in business for another 100 years. The river was explored in 1892 by the surveyor Louis Poulin de Courval. He said the main mouth was a good harbor, and the river was a series of lakes with abundant salmon and trout, flowing through excellent hunting territory. The hamlet of √âtamamiou where the post stood is inhabited by a few families occupied in fishing and by an outfitter. Fishing Salmon swim up the √âtamamiou River for more than . The √âtamamiou inc. outfitter located from the river mouth belongs to the Unamen Shipu community of Innus. As of 2019 the √âtamamiou Outfitters had exclusive fishing rights over the river basin. They provide Innu guides, transportation by float plane, accommodation and a chef. There are six salmon pools with rocky sand bottoms. Fishing is mainly from boats. In addition to salmon there are many anadromous brook trout.

She later was associated for more than thirty years with the Wellcome Library of the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine where she was successively Assistant Librarian (1963-1970), Curator of Eastern Printed Manuscripts and Books (1970-1978) and finally, after having retired, a Tibetan Medical Consultant (1978-2001).Nigel Allan, 'Marianne Winder', Medical History, Vol. 45, No. 4, October 2001, p. 533-535 - accessed September 28, 2019) Biography In 1941 the Winders moved to Baldock in Hertfordshire - the High Street shown in 2007 Marianne Winder was born in September 1918 in Teplice in north-west Prague, in what was then the Austro-Hungarian Empire. She was the eldest of the two daughters of Ludwig Winder (1889-1946), a writer and literary critic, and Hedwig Winder (1891-1987). Her early life was bound up in the social milieu of the Jewish intelligentsia of Central Europe before its destruction during World War I. Franz Kafka was part of the literary circle the \\"Prague Circle\\" in pre-War Prague that included her father, and this no doubt influenced Marianne Winder's interest in German literature. When the political situation deteriorated in the 1930s the Winder family was forced to leave Prague to seek refuge in England.Obituary for Marianne Winder - Buddhist Studies Review, Vol 19, Issue 1 (2002) pg. 56-57 After the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, Winder fled on 29 June 1939, when he crossed the Polish border illegally with his family, his journey taking him across Poland and Scandinavia to England, where he arrived with his wife and daughter Marianne on 13 July 1939.Kurt Krolop, Ludwig Winder: sein Leben und sein erz√§hlerisches Fr√ºhwerk: ein Beitrag zur Geschichte der Prager deutschen Literatur.

On gaining her honours degree in 1948 she obtained a post as Tutorial Assistant in the Department of German at the University of Nottingham. At Nottingham she completed a Master's thesis on the etymology of High Middle German words, an excerpt from which was published in 1952 as a supplement to Maurice Walshe's dictionary, A Concise German Etymological Dictionary. As no etymological dictionary of High Middle German in medieval German texts existed at that time her contribution was significant in the field. Career The Wellcome Library, where Winder worked from 1966 to 2001 In 1953 Winder was appointed Assistant Librarian at the Institute of Germanic Studies at the University of London, where she continued her research on German language and literature. She was interested in the writings of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance on astrology. She defended a thesis on German astrological books from 1452 to 1600 and graduated in 1963 with a degree in Librarianship from University College London. Her dissertation was published in 1966 in The Annals of Science. At this time she accepted the position of Assistant Librarian in the Wellcome Library at the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine where she was to remain for the rest of her career. At the Wellcome Institute her linguistic knowledge proved to be very useful for cataloging and organising the collection. She collaborated with Dr. Walter Pagel, a pathologist and medical historian, and co-authored with him several articles including 'Gnostiches bei Paracelsus und Konrad von Megenberg' in Fachliteratur des Mittlelalters, (1968); 'Hervey and the \\"Modern\\" Concept of Disease', in The Bulletin of the History of Medicine, (1968); 'The Eightness of Adam and Related \\"Gnostic\\" Ideas in the Paracelsian Corpus' in Ambix, (1969). In 1972 she established the bibliography of Dr. Pagel's writings in Science, medicine and society in the Renaissance, in a tribute volume in his honour. On Pagel's death in 1983 she took charge of the publication of his complete work in two volumes, the first published in 1985 under the title Religion and Neoplatonism in Renaissance Medicine,Review of Religion and Neoplatonism in Renaissance Medicine (1985) - Isis: A Journal of the History of Science Society, Volume 78, Number 4, December 1987 - University of Chicago Press the second in 1986 entitled From Paracelsus to Van Helmont. Having converted to Buddhism she became Archivist for the Buddhist Society.Christmas Humphreys, A Popular Dictionary of Buddhism], Routledge, 2005, 224 p., p. 8. In 1957 she had published the German translation of Edward Conze's Buddhist Texts Through the AgesThe Middle Way - Volumes 30 - 32, 1955, p. 310 :\\"CONGRATULATIONS TO MISS MARIANNE WINDER Buddhist Texts Through the Ages, edited by Dr. Edward Conze, in collaboration with Miss I. B. Horner, Dr. D. Snellgrove and Dr. A. Waley, was translated into German by Miss Marianne Winder, and published in January 1957, as Im Zeichen Buddas by the Fischer Biicherei, S. Fischer, Frankfurt am Main.\\" but emphasized that she did not associate herself with all the points of view expressed in this autobiography, let alone with the passages on the President of the Buddhist Society Christmas Humphreys who, according to her, had had the most beneficial influence on her life. Winder spoke several languages including Sanskrit and Buddhist Pali. In 1958 she became deputy editor of the Buddhist Society's magazine The Middle Way and succeeded Mrs Carlo Robins as editor-in-chief from 1961 to 1965, when she was succeeded by Muriel Daw.World Buddhism - Volumes 10 - 11, 1961: \\"The Middle Way\\" has a new editor. Miss Marianne Winder, who has acted for some time as Assistant Editor, has been appointed Editor of The Middle Way, \\"the oldest and still the most influential Buddhist periodical published in the West.\\" The Middle Way is published by the Buddhist Society of London, whose president is Mr. Christmas Humphreys. It was founded in 1924. The previous Editor, Mrs. Carlo Robins, has borne the responsibility of editing the magazine for ten years, and she wanted, at least for a while, to be relieved of the task. Miss Winder, who recently acquired her Librarian's Diploma at the London University, speaks several languages and is a scholar of both Sanskrit and Pali Buddhism Winder was also interested in the language and culture of Tibet and took lessons in Tibetan at the School of Oriental and African Studies.Nigel Allan, op. cit.:\\"Having become proficient in Tibetan from attendance at language courses at the School of Oriental and African Studies\\" When the position of Curator of Oriental Manuscripts and Prints was created at the Wellcome Institute in 1970 she gained it. This was the beginning of Winder's second career. Second career Winder undertook to catalogue and classify the collections for which she was responsible and to place them within the reach of the specialists of Eastern Studies, a vast task which made them a leading source for the study of the medicine in Asian cultures. At the same time she began a collaboration with Rechung Rinpoch√© Jampal Kunzang which led to the publication in 1973 of Tibetan Medicine: Illustrated in Original Texts,Rechung Rinpoche, Tibetan Medicine: Illustrated in Original Texts, University of California Press (1973) - Google Books pg. viii for which she also wrote the Introduction and which, through its foreign editions in Chinese and French and its revisions, became a classic on Tibetan medicine and the first work in English on the subject.Dr. Terry Clifford, in Aspects of Classical Tibetan Medicine, Bulletin of Tibetology, Special volume, Sikkim Research Inst. of Tibetology, 1993, Always willing to learn, the new Curator attended all the classes of the English Tibetologist David Snellgrove.Cathy Cantwell, David Snellgrove: personal recollections of an inspiring teacher : It is surely a comment on David Snellgrove's extraordinary stature in Tibetan Studies that the classes drew not only University students in a strict sense, but scholars beyond SOAS, some of whom were well-established authorities in their own areas of expertise. For example, Marianne Winder of the Wellcome Institute attended all his classes. She was by then Curator of Oriental manuscripts and printed books at the Wellcome Institute. Retirement Upon her retirement from the Wellcome Institute in 1978 Winder was appointed Consultant in Tibetan Medicine at the Institute which allowed her to continue her work on the Catalogue of Tibetan manuscripts and xylographs, and the catalogue of thankas, banners and other paintings and drawings in the Library of the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine, which was published in 1989.Catalogue of Tibetan manuscripts and xylographs, and catalogue of thankas, banners and other paintings and drawings in the library of the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine - ebook - Wellcome Collection Her successor at the Wellcome Institute was Nigel Allan.Dominik Wujastyk and Nikolaj Serikoff, Nigel Allen. An appreciation, Medical History, 2005, July 1, 49(3), pp. 369-371: \\"He never allowed the memory of his predecessor and friend, the late Marianne Winder, to pass out of the mind of the Wellcome Library\\" In September 1985 she participated in an international workshop on the study of Indian medicine where she presented her paper 'Vaidarya' which was published in the Proceedings of the Symposium as Studies in Indian Medicine.Gerrit Jan Meulenbeld, I. Julia Leslie, Medical Literature from India, Sri Lanka, and Tibet, p. 64 In 1986 Winder organized a conference on aspects of classical Tibetan medicine in Central Asia together with a leading exhibition, 'Body and Mind in Tibetan Medicine', at the Wellcome Institute in London, and for which she also produced the exhibition catalogue.Body and mind in Tibetan medicine : an exhibition 7 April to 31 July 1986 at the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine - online catalogue - Wellcome Collection The Proceedings of the conference were under her direction and were published in 1993 under the title Aspects of Classical Tibetan Medicine.'Aspects of Classical Tibetan Medicine', Buddhist Studies Review, Vol 19, Institut de recherche bouddhique Linh-Son, Pali Buddhist Union, UK Association for Buddhist Studies, 2002, p. 57:\\"The following year, she organised a conference on 'Aspects of Classical Tibetan Medicine as reflected in Central Asia' and with it staged a major exhibition ('Body and Mind in Tibetan Medicine') for which she produced the catalogue. The conference proceedings were edited by Winder and appeared in 1993 under the title Aspects of Classical Tibetan Medicine.\\" Winder sat on the Council for Ambix, the Journal of the Society for the History of Alchemy and Chemistry, and acted as a consultant for the book Eastern Healing: the practical guide to the healing traditions of China, India, Tibet and India published just before her death. Marianne Winder died in London in April 2001 aged 82 after a short illness.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019. History This section of Detroit was annexed to the city in 1916, and in the early 1920s a large influx of Polich immigrants made their homes in the neighborhood. The new immigrants desired a church where Polish was spoken, and the Transfiguration Parish was founded in 1925. A frame church was quickly built, and in 1926 the cornerstone was laid for a new church and school, designed by Garstecki & Waier. The school was quickly completed, and had over 700 students the first year. A rectory was built in 1927, and a convent in 1929. The parish continued to grow through the 1930s and into the 1940s. By 1946, the school building, which also served as the church, was severely overcrowded, and a new church building was planned. in 1948, construction was started on the new church, designed by Narcyz Kostrzanowski and constructed by Arthur O. Misch Company. In 1952, a new rectory was constructed, and in 1961 an activities building was constructed. However, in the 1960s the size of the parish was shrinking. This trend continued through the following decades, and the school closed in 2005, with the building leased to a charter school until 2014. In 2012, other local parishes were merged with Transfiguration, and the parish renamed Blessed John Paul II. When Pope John Paul II was canonized in 2014 the parish name was changed to Saint John Paul II. Description The Transfiguration Roman Catholic Church Parish Complex contains six buildings: the church, shrine (with grotto), school, convent, rectory and activities buildings. They are all located near each other in a one-and-half-block area. The church is an Italian Renaissance style building constructed of multi-tonal brick, with limestone trim and a red clay tile roof. The facade has a three- story gable front with a five-story bell tower on one side. It has a central entrance, approached by three limestone steps which lead to a two-story tall limestone and mosaic tile clad entrance portico. Above the portico is a large rose window. The school is a two-story tall multi-tone red brick building with a rectangular footprint and a flat roof. It has a raised brick basement with a stone beltcourse above. The shrine is a small building surrounded by a wrought iron fence with brick pillars. The convent is a rectangular shaped, two-story tall brick building. It has an off-center brick porch. The rectory is a two- story tall brick building with a hip roof. The activities building is a modern brick building with a one-story and two-story section.

The Samad is available in three variants: The Samad-1, the Samad-2 (also known as \\"UAV-X\\"), and the Samad-3. The Samad family of UAVs is primarily used by the Houthi movement in the Yemeni civil war, where the drone's long range is used to strike targets in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Etymology The UAV was named after Houthi leader Saleh al-Sammad, who was assassinated by the United Arab Emirates 2018.  Design  The Samad is available in three models. All models have distinctive V-shaped tail fins and a pusher engine. Samad UAVs have a ventral protrusion and wing skids, which they use for takeoff and landing. The Houthis say they have designed and manufactured the Samad family of drones. They say that the Samad 1 was designed in 2018 and the Samad Samad 2 and Samad 3 in 2019. Independent analysts say the Samad-2 is probably of Iranian origin. According to James Rogers, of the Center for War Studies at the University of Southern Denmark, the Samad 3 is believed to be supplied by Iran. The Samad-1 is the base variant. It has a wingspan of approximately 3.5 meters. It has a range of 500 km and is for surveillance. The Samad-2 is 2.8 meters long and has a wingspan of 4.5 meters. It has distinctive V-shaped tail fins and is powered by a rear-mounted German or Chinese pusher-engine. It is also known as the \\"UAV-X\\", the provisional designation given to it in a UN report. The Samad-2 can carry either a reconnaissance or an explosive payload. The reconnaissance version carries a camera, a Nikon D810 digital camera in one model. The attack variant has a warhead of 18 kg of explosives mixed with ball bearings. The Samad-3 is an \\"extended-range\\" version with a conformal fuel tank mounted on the top of the drone. The dimensions are estimated at 4.5m wingspan, like the Samad-2. According to the Houthis, it has a range of 1,500 km and carries an explosive payload. Qualitatively, the Samad-3 is described as \\"inexpensive, small, slow and clumsy\\" and unlikely to strike targets with good accuracy.  Operational history  The Houthis have operated Samad UAVs since at least August 2018. The Houthis say a Samad-3 UAV was used to attack Abu Dhabi international airport on 26 July 2018. Analysis by Jeremy Binnie of Jane's of footage released by the Houthis of the attack says it is consistent with a Samad-2 or Samad-3, or also a different drone, the Hudhud 1. The UAE denied there was any drone attack on the airport. Two other alleged claims on a drone attack on the airport were reported by the Houthis, as well as two attacks on Dubai International Airport, all which were denied and unverified. An investigation by Bellingcat, published months before video of the attack was released, said \\"It is highly likely that a Houthi-led drone attack did not take place in Abu Dhabi and Dubai\\".Investigating Houthi Claims of Drone Attacks on UAE Airports Bellingcat, 7 Nov. 2018, retrieved 7 June 2019.

Their senior team play in the Leinster Senior League Senior Division. They also regularly compete in the FAI Cup, the FAI Intermediate Cup, the FAI Junior Cup and the Leinster Senior Cup. Foundation and early history One of Ireland's oldest football clubs, Liffey Wanderers were formed in 1885 on Pearse Street (then called Great Brunswick Street). Founding members were dockworkers from Dublin Port. Writers Aileen O'Carroll and Don Bennett have described the club as being at the 'centre of the athletic tradition of the docklands' in its early years. The club was favoured by dockworkers from South Dublin leading to its clubhouse being attacked by gangs and rival fans from North Dublin. Officials and club members had frequently to carry their own goal-posts to the 'away' venues, as well as sometimes having to fight off attempts by rival club supporters to make off with them. Stewarding at football games in nineteenth-century Dublin was very often carried out by jarvies, fifty or sixty 'hard' men, who kept over-enthusiastic supporters clear of the touch-lines by means of horsewhips. Golden Era Playing in the regional Leinster Senior League, then a de facto second-tier of football in Ireland, the early years of the twentieth century would see success for the Liffey's. The club claimed the Junior Combination Cup in the 1904‚Äì05 season, and won the Empire Cup (an All-Ireland Junior Cup) three times in-a-row between 1904 and 1906. Liffey's were allowed to keep the trophy to commemorate the achievement, and today it sits in FAI headquarters on permanent display. A member of the Cup winning side in those years was future Ireland international and Barcelona manager Patrick O'Connell, then just a teenager. Decline The club remained a junior club in the Leinster Senior League and never stepped up to senior-level in the Irish League. The effects of World War I, the Irish War of Independence and the Irish Civil War between 1914 and 1923 were heavily felt by clubs like Liffey's as they lost many men to enlistment, recruitment and fatalities, and so the club went into hibernation. Following the partition of Ireland, Liffey's were re-established in 1924. They kept their junior status and did not join the newly established League of Ireland in 1921. Liffey's were immortalised in 1922 when Irish author James Joyce mentioned the club in his epic novel Ulysses. Roughly around 1940, the club went dormant for a second time, only to be re-established in 1945 by former players and other aficionados of waterfront football. Second Golden Era In 2010, Wanderers went out of existence for a third time. They were reformed in 2013 and entered the Leinster Senior League's sixth tier. On 17 May 2015, Wanderers lifted their first FAI Junior Cup, beating Sheriff YC 2‚Äì1 in extra-time at the Aviva Stadium. In what was their first ever appearance in the Cup's final stage, Lee O'Connor and Stephen O'Callaghan both scored to bring the trophy Wanderers' way. Two years later, on 13 May 2017, Wanderers claimed the FAI Intermediate Cup in what was, again, their debut appearance in a cup final. They won after beating Cork side Cobh Wanderers at the Aviva Stadium 5‚Äì4 in a penalty shootout after the score was tied at 2‚Äì2 at the end of extra-time. Goals from Clayton Maher and Aidan Roche and five out of six penalties scored in the shoot-out ensured the cup went to Dublin. In May 2018, the club beat Dublin Bus to cap off an fifth straight promotion since their re-emergence in 2013, thus enabling them to play in the Leinster Senior League's Sunday Senior Division. The club announced on the same day that their original, historic club-house in City Quay would be returning to the club after many years.

He became involved in various disputes and earned a reputation for being untrustworthy, but was supported by the governor of the colony. He went bankrupt in 1754, a few year before the British captured Quebec in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham (13 September 1759). Early years Jacques de Lafontaine de Belcour was born Versailles, France, on 22 September 1704. His father was Jean-Baptiste de Lafontaine, a musician of King Louis XIV at Versailles, and his mother was Bernardine Jouin. He came to Canada in 1726 as the secretary of the new Governor of New France, Charles de Beauharnois. On 24 October 1728 he married Charlotte Bissot in Quebec, who bought a dowry of 4,000 livres. They had twelve children. Lafontaine entered a partnership for ten years with his father-in-law, Fran√ßois-Joseph Bissot (1673‚Äì1737), to trade with the Indians and hunt seals at Mingan on the Labrador coast. The enterprise did not succeed. In 1732 Bissot agreed to pay him 2,000 livres to cover his losses and the partnership was dissolved. Lafontaine thought he could succeed on his own, and in 1733 leased Mingan from Bissot, then in 1734 broke the lease so he could exploit a valuable concession that Beauharnois and the intendant Gilles Hocquart had granted him. This was a monopoly for nine years on the Indian trade and seal fishery between the mouths of the √âtamamiou and N√©tagamiou rivers on the C√¥te-Nord. Lafontaine became involved in various property disputes and controversies concerning his trade with the Indians and the rights to trap seals in the waters between Mingan on the mainland and the islands of the Mingan Archipelago. Around 1733 he established a French trading post at the mouth of the √âtamamiou River. He also established a fur-trading and seal-fishing post at Chevery, at the mouth of the N√©tagamiou River. The Poste-de-N√©tagamiou is now an archaeological site. Councilor In 1736, with the support of Beauharnois and Hocquart, Lafontaine was made a junior Councillor on the Conseil Sup√©rieur, with a salary of 300 livres. He continued to spend most of his time on his commercial ventures and continued to be involved in legal disputes. From 1737 Fran√ßois Perrault operated the N√©tagamiou River post in Labrador in association with Jacques de Lafontaine de Belcour. In 1740, Fran√ßois Perrault, his son Jacques Perrault and Charles Levreau, took a lease on the N√©tagamiou post. In 1737 Lafontaine was involved in a quarrel between the governor and the intendant when it was found that Hocquart had given Fran√ßois-√âtienne Cugnet a lease on Tadoussac for a very low annual payment of 4,500 livres. Lafontaine and Guillaume Est√®be publicly offered to pay an additional 9,000 livres, but were ignored by Hocquart. From November 1740 to September 1741 Lafontaine was interim lieutenant general at Montreal for civil and criminal affairs in the royal jurisdiction. He made a second marriage on 7 August 1751 to Genevi√®ve Lambert, who gave him three children. His business affairs expanded to include land on the c√¥te Saint- Jean, a whale-fishing concession at a place named Apet√©py on the Labrador coast and a sawmill on the Chaudi√®re River, funded through loans and partnerships. Lafontaine went bankrupt in 1754. Last years Lafontaine stayed in Quebec after the British conquest of New France, and in the fall of 1760 was appointed commissary and attorney general for the south shore by General James Murray. In October 1763 Lafontaine wrote to the Earl of Halifax accusing Murrary of various misdeeds, mostly fabricated. Murray was later completely vindicated. Lafontaine died on 18 June 1765 in Quebec. A detailed inventory of his property by the notary Lemaitre La Morille on 11 July 1765 listed just five books: Pratique civile et criminelle (Civil and Criminal Practice) by M. Lange, Philosophie morale (Moral Philosophy) by Louis Delanclache, Dictionnaire fran√ßais-latin (French‚ÄìLatin Dictionary), Oeuvres de Virgile (Works of Virgil) and Instructions generales sur la juridiction consulaire (General instructions on consular jurisdiction).
