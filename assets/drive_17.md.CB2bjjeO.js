Miss Florida At 20 years old, Ellen Meade won the title of Miss Manatee County. She then went on to compete in the Miss Florida pageant, where she was crowned Miss Florida, 1973. Following her state win, Meade headed to Atlantic City to represent Florida in the Miss America pageant. While she didn't take home the title of Miss America, she did grab a win with a talent award. During her time as Miss Florida, Meade toured the state of Florida, emceeing and performing. Early career Meade began training in the arts at the age of seven. Her training began as a student with the Florida Ballet in Sarasota, Florida. In her early years, she trained under the direction of Madam Jean Spear, who founded Sarasota's first professional ballet troupe in 1962. Meade studied five days a week in ballet as an elementary student and later began training as a roller skater, practicing for hours on a concrete slab her father built in the family's backyard. By the time she was 12, Meade was competing in both state and regional skating championships and was headed for nationals. With a performance set to a backdrop of Stravinsky ballet, \\"Firebird,\\" Meade competed in and won the North American National Championships at the age of 14. At 16, and still a senior in high school, Meade had begun studying modeling and acting after being discovered by a talent scoutEllen Meade Schools and notably, had opened her first school for the arts—in her own backyard. Her love of the arts would continue to propel her into new arenas, and at 17, she was developing a growing interest in pageantry. By the late 1960s, Meade began entering local and state-level pageants. She entered and won the state Roller Skating Beauty Queen title, at 17, then continued on to take the title of Roller Skating Queen of America at nationals. Mentored by Rene Hardin, she began by competing in several small local pageants and grabbed the title of Miss Manatee County at the age of 20. Following her local win, Meade went on to compete in the Miss Florida pageant where she took the top honor, and was crowned Miss Florida, 1973. That year she represented her home state of Florida in the Miss America pageant, held in Atlantic City. Meade took home a win in the talent portion of the competition, but Rebecca Ann King was crowned Miss America 1974. In 1974, Meade crowned Delta Burke as the new Miss Florida and helped prepare her for the Miss America Pageant, where Burke also won a talent award.Ellen Meade Schools Meade has also appeared in print, on stage and in television and film during the course of her career. Miss Dogpatch USA Following her reign as Miss Florida, Meade traveled to Arkansas to participate in the Miss Dogpatch USA pageant. She won the title of Miss Dogpatch USA and embarked on a year of travel around the country representing Dogpatch USA. It was in Arkansas where she also met her future husband, Craig Thomas, who, at the time, was the star of the Li'l Abner show in the Dogpatch USA themepark. Professional life Meade attended Manatee Junior College and went on to become a pageant coach. Meade has mentored many pageant contestants, who have gone on to win national, state and local titles. She currently produces, directs and emcees the Manatee County annual pageant as well as several other smaller pageants and serves as a pageant judge throughout the nation.

It is a low-budget, campy sci-fi movie about an android revolt a million years in the future after humans have become too lazy and selfish to take care of themselves. The film was a major influence on cult director John Waters who has said that Sins of the Fleshapoids \\"really shows what an underground movie was.\\"NPR Plot summary One million years in the future, human beings have created a race of human-looking androids called Fleshapoids to fulfill their every desire. As a result, humans have become selfish and lazy as they no longer need to work or do anything to take care of themselves. One day, a Fleshapoid named Xar (Bob Cowan) revolts, kills his female human master (Gina Zuckerman) and hooks up with a female Fleshapoid named Melenka (Maren Thomas), who services Prince Gianbeno (George Kuchar) and Princess Vivianna (Donna Kerness). While Xar and Melenka fall in love in secret, the marriage between the Prince and Princess is falling apart. As the Princess tries to deceive her husband and run away with her lover, Ernie (Julius Middleman), the Prince uncovers the Fleshapoids' illicit romance and attempts to stop them. But Xar flips out again and he and Melenka kill the Prince. But, with death also comes life, as Xar and Melenka's unusual lovemaking produces a cute baby robot. Production Sins of the Fleshapoids was the first film Mike Kuchar directed himself after co-directing movies with his twin brother George Kuchar for many years. However, on the commentary track of the Other Cinema DVD release, Mike reveals that George did shoot a quick sequence in which a semi-nude Princess Vivianna admires herself in a mirror. The film was shot in 16mm and has a musical soundtrack, but all of the dialogue, rather than being spoken, is printed in giant word balloons that appear directly on the screen. Financing from the film came from the paychecks Mike Kuchar earned while working a day job as a photo retoucher. However, after the film became a modest midnight movie success, Mike was able to quit his job and live off of the income he made from Sins of the Fleshapoids and other films.

Commonly known as the decorated pholiota, it is distinguished by its fruit body which is covered with pointed brown, curved scales on the cap and stem, and by its white gills. Found in the eastern United States, France, and Pakistan, it is saprobic, growing on the decaying wood of hardwood trees. L. decorosa was first described by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck as Agaricus decorosus in 1873, and the species has been transferred to several genera in its history, including Tricholoma, Tricholomopsis, Armillaria, and Floccularia. Three American mycologists considered the species unique enough to warrant its own genus, and transferred it into the new genus Leucopholiota in a 1996 publication. Lookalike species with similar colors and scaly fruit bodies include Pholiota squarrosoides, Phaeomarasmius erinaceellus, and Leucopholiota lignicola. L. decorosa is considered an edible mushroom. Taxonomy and naming The species now known as Leucopholiota decorosa was first described by Charles Peck in 1873, based on a specimen he found in New York State; he placed it in Tricholoma, then considered a subgenus of Agaricus. In 1947, Alexander Smith and Walters transferred the species into the genus Armillaria, based on its apparent close relationship to Armillaria luteovirens; the presence of clamp connections in the hyphae, the amyloid spores, and the structure of the veil and its remnants. The genus Armillaria, as it was understood at the time, would later be referred to as a \\"taxonomic refugium for about 270 white-spored species with attached gills and an annulus.\\" Smith later transferred the species to the genus Tricholomopsis; however, he neglected the amyloid spores, the recurved scales of the cap cuticle, and the lack of cells known as pleurocystidia, features which should have ruled out a taxonomic transfer into the genus. In 1987, the species was transferred yet again, this time to the genus Floccularia. The appearance of a specimen at a 1994 mushroom foray in North Carolina resulted in a collaboration between mycologists Tom Volk, Orson K. Miller, Jr. and Alan Bessette, who renamed the species Leucopholiota decorosa in a 1996 Mycologia publication. Leucopholiota was originally a subgenus of Armillaria, but the authors raised it to generic level to accommodate L. decorosa, which would become the type species. In 2008, Henning Knudsen considered L. decorosa to be the same species as what was then known as Amylolepiota lignicola, and considered the two names to be synonymous. However, Finnish mycologist Harri Harmaja rejected this interpretation. Originally, Harmaja believed Lepiota lignicola sufficiently distinct from other similar taxa to deserve its own genus Amylolepiota, which he described in a 2002 publication. He changed his mind in 2010, writing \\"the differences between the type species of both genera are small and are thus best considered as differences at the species level\\"; with this he transferred the taxon to Leucopholiota, and it is now known as Leucopholiota lignicola, the second species in genus Leucopholiota. The genus name Leucopholiota means \\"white Pholiota\\" (from λευκός, leukós), referring to the gills and the spores; it was proposed in 1980 by Henri Romagnesi who originally described it as a subgenus of Armillaria. The specific epithet decorosa, though intended for \\"elegant\\" or \\"handsome\\", actually means \\"decent\\", \\"respectable\\", \\"modest\\", or \\"decorous\\". L. decorosa is commonly known as the \\"decorated Pholiota\\". Phylogenetics Phylogenetic analysis based on evidence from ITS and large subunit ribosomal RNA sequence data have not confirmed that Leucopholiota decorosa belongs in the family Tricholomataceae. However, the analysis does show it to be phylogenetically related to Phaeolepiota aurea, a species of unclear status in the Agaricales, and it confirms that L. decorosa does not belong in the family Agaricaceae. According to the species authors, L. decorosa would fit best in the tribe Biannularieae of the Tricholomataceae as described by Rolf Singer in his comprehensive monograph on the Agaricales. This tribe also contains the genera Catathelasma and Armillaria. Description The gills of the mushroom are closely spaced and white. The caps of L. decorosa, initially conic or hemispherical in shape, later expand to become convex or flattened in maturity. The caps are typically between in diameter, with surfaces covered with many small curved brown scales. The edge of the cap is typically curved inwards and may have coarse brown fibers attached. The cap is cinnamon brown, darker in the center. The gills are spaced together closely; they have a narrow (adnexed) attachment to the stem, and their edges are \\"finely scalloped\\". The stem is tall by thick, and like the cap, is covered with scales from the bottom to the level of the annular zone; above this point the stipe is smooth. The partial veil is made up of brown fibers \\"that flare upward as an annulus.\\" It is roughly the same thickness throughout the length of the stem, or may be slightly thinner near the top. The flesh is white and thick, and has a firm texture; its odor is indistinct, and the taste either mild or bitter. The spore deposit is white. The spores are hyaline (translucent), roughly elliptical in shape, have thin walls, and are amyloid, meaning they absorb iodine stain in Melzer's reagent. Additionally, in acetocarmine stain, they appear binucleate (having two nuclei). They have dimensions of 5.5–6 (more rarely 7) by 3.5–4.0 µm. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are club-shaped, translucent, and four-spored. The cheilocystida (cystidia on the gill edge) are club-shaped and 19-24 by 3–5 µm. The cap cuticle is a trichodermium—a type of tissue composed of erect, long, threadlike hyphae of same or different lengths, and originating from an interwoven layer of hyphae that ascends gradually until terminal cells are somewhat parallel to each other. The trichodermal hyphae are thin-walled, measuring 7.6–22.0 µm, and stain yellowish in Melzer's reagent. The hyphae comprising the cap tissue are thin-walled and 5–10 µm in diameter, while those of the gill tissue are also thin-walled, and 3.5–7.0 µm, and interspersed with oleiferous cells (characterized by strongly refractive, homogeneous contents). Clamp connections are present in the hyphae of all tissues. Edibility According to one field guide published in 2006, Leucopholiota decorosa is edible, based on the following comment by McIlvaine and MacAdam, written in 1900: \\"it is of good consistency and flavor, having a decided mushroom taste.\\" Other older sources report the edibility as unknown. Similar species The species Pholiota squarrosoides has a similar outward appearance, but it may be distinguished by its brown spores and sticky cap surface underneath the scales. In the hedgehog pholiota (Phaeomarasmius erinaceellus), the overall size is smaller—cap diameter —and the spores are cinnamon-brown. Some species in the genus Cystoderma also appear similar, but can be distinguished by microscopic features, like the presence of spherical (rather than club-shaped) cells in the cuticle of the cap, and also their habitat—Cystoderma usually grows on soil, rather than wood. The only other species of Leucopholiota, L. lignicola, may be distinguished from L. decorosa by the following characteristics: free gills in L. lignicola compared with adnexed gills in L. decorosa; L. lignicola tends to grow on the wood of Birch, and preferably in old-growth forests; L. lignicola is restricted to boreal forest, compared to L. decorosa that grows in temperate regions; L. lignicola has a wide distribution throughout northern coniferous forests in Eurasia. Habitat and distribution Leucopholiota decorosa is a saprobic species, deriving nutrients from decaying organic matter, particularly the rotting branches and stumps of deciduous trees. One field guide notes a preference for sugar maple. It grows singly or in bunches, clustered together at the base of the stem. In Ohio, it typically fruits from late September to mid November. In addition to its known distribution in mostly eastern North America, Leucopholiota decorosa has also been collected from France. In 2007, it was reported from the Astore District of Pakistan, at an altitude of about .

Written before he was even sixteen, the work was part of a long tradition of poets imitating Spenser. The Palace of Pleasure is an allegory based on Book II of Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene and describes the adventure of Sir Guyon as he is taken by airy sylphs to the palace of the \\"Fairy Pleasure\\". According to Hunt the poem \\"endeavours to correct the vices of the age, by showing the frightful landscape that terminates the alluring path of sinful Pleasure\\". Background After Hunt entered into a series of competitions run by the Monthly Preceptor calling for the submission at the age of 15, his father Isaac Hunt collected his son's childhood poetry to publish them. Among these was The Palace of Pleasure, which was printed by James Whiting in 1801 in Hunt's Juvenilia after his family managed to collect over 800 subscriptions for the volume. The Palace of Pleasure was the final work in the volume, which was reprinted four times before 1805.Roe 2005 pp. 50–56 Attached to the beginning of the poem is a preface that shows Hunt discussing life in artistic and heroic terms, and he refers to himself when he describes \\"a Muse, who is entering into public in her sixteenth year, bashful on her first exhibition, and listening with trembling expectation, as she passes, to the shouts of disapprobation or applause that burst from the surrounding multitude.\\"Blunden 1930 qtd p. 31 Poem The poem is an allegory based on Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene Book II. The Palace of Pleasure describes the adventure of Sir Guyon as he is taken by airy sylphs to the palace of the \\"Fairy Pleasure\\". She is similar to Spenser's enchantress Arcasia, and, like Spenser's hero, Guyon is tested by an offer of pleasure by allegorical figures including Delicacy, Young Wantonness, and others. The Bacchian pleasure that they offer Guyon is revealed to be a sort of poison. As Guyon seeks to repent, he is attacked by creatures from hell and the allegorical figure connected to justice:Roe 2005 p. 56 And next him started on the knight, I wot, A most surprising fiend, whose visage pale Was branded all about with dusky spot Made by the fiery iron, heavy bale To him that doth with impious hand assail The laws of righteous Justice; and he hight Foul Infamy, ay driv'n by Woe and Wail, And pointing Scorn of moderation light, And brazen-tongu'd Reproach, ne silent in the night. (lines 298–307) Eventually, Guyon is saved by the allegorical character Content and her allies Temp'rance, Repentance, and others. They take him mountain where he is able to come back to his senses and continue on adventuring.Roe 2005 pp. 56–57 In the final moments of the poem, it is Glory who gives him the encouragement to perform his political duty:Duff 1994 p. 83 \\"Go,\\" sun she, striking her exalted lyre, \\"Go lift th' oppress'd, and beat th' oppressor low; Go, where sad Justice sees her sons expire, And Tyranny quaffs down the tears of Woe! Eternal peace shall chear thy breast below, And when Heav'n calls thee to its arms above, Immortal splendour beam around thy brow! Go; Virtue calls thee; watch her guiding eye; When Virtue draws the sword, tempests and storms defy!\\" (lines 531–540) Themes It is possible that Hunt derived his model of adapting Spenserian stanzas from James Thomson's use of them in The Castle of Indolence.Kucich 1991 p. 105 In terms of Romantic poetry, Hunt's poem is related to the allegories found in Percy Bysshe Shelley's Queen Mab and The Revolt of Islam along with those in Robert Southey's Thalaba and Curse of Kehama.Duff 1994 p. 82 Hunt's Spenserian adaptation influenced John Keats's later use of Spenser as a model. However, Keats did not rely on the moral interpretation of spenser found in The Palace of Pleasure but instead on the side of Spenser emphasising the beautiful.Kucich 1991 p. 148 Of the works that imitate Spenser's use of the \\"Bower of Bliss\\" in Book II of the Faerie Queene, The Palace of Pleasure is connected to Southey's Romance and William Jones's Palace of Fortune. The only real difference between Hunt's and Spenser's version is the name of the tempter and that Hunt moved the setting from a Bower to a castle. Like Southey, the poem's allegory is focused more on political justice than morality.Duff 1994 pp. 82–83 Hunt would later rely on the same Spenserian \\"Bower of Bliss\\" for the basis of a pleasure garden in The Story of Rimini written years later although he places more emphasis on the sexual aspects in the later work than on the meaning of the scene.Edgecombe 1994 p. 82 The poem, according to Hunt, \\"endeavours to correct the vices of the age, by showing the frightful landscape that terminates the alluring path of sinful Pleasure\\".Duff 1994 qtd. p. 83 In Guyon's story, many of the images connect to the description of Barbados. The land is a tropical paradise that tempts people with pleasure. This is biographically connected to Isaac Hunt's problems that come from his time in Barbados.Roe 2005 p. 57 NotesReferences * Blunden, Edmund. Leigh Hunt and His Circle.

History In 2007 Oswego Medical Center was purchased by HMC/CAH Consolidated, Inc. and the name changed to Oswego Community Hospital. The facility had in recent years been previously sponsored by and affiliated with Mt. Carmel Regional Medical Center of Pittsburg, Kansas with help from St. John's Regional Medical Center in Joplin, Missouri. At some point in the past decade, EmpowerHMS purchased Oswego Community Hospital. During this time, a sponsorship agreement was signed with Labette County-owned, privately funded Labette Health of Parsons, Kansas, in December 2010, bringing the only two hospitals in Labette County together with a cooperative agreement.Two Hospitals Will Work Together OCH provided a wide variety of services, including General Medical care, Senior Mental Health programs, a 24-hour Emergency Department, ExpressCare, multiple daytime walk-in clinics, a wound care program, various radiology, sexual assault and abuse help, laboratory, observation, physical therapy, dietary services, respiratory care, Swing Bed, a pharmacy, pastoral care, and out- patient services. A portable CT Scanner and MRI truck were also available on- call, and OCH had contracted with EagleMed to provide emergency air transport to more qualified hospitals. On February 13, 2019, Oswego Community Hospital abruptly closed its doors, \\"citing [a] failure to expand Medicaid\\" and \\"low patient volumes.\\" However, later in 2019, Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt announced his office had executed a search warrant as part of a broader investigation of the hospital's operator, EmpowerHMS. In June 2020, federal indictments were unsealed, revealing that several persons associated with EmpowerHMS were indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice for their alleged role in a $1.4 billion fraudulent billing scheme. In April 2020, the hospital's assets, including the former hospital site, a former clinic location, and other real estate, were purchased out of bankruptcy by Oswego NeuroPsych Hospital, Inc.

There is evidence for a pre-Norman religious site, and on this a Benedictine priory was founded by the first Norman Lord of Egremont William Meschin, and was dedicated by Archbishop Thurstan Wilson, Rev J, The Registers of St Bees Priory, The Surtees Society 1915. of York, sometime between 1120 and 1135.Todd J M, Chronological outline of village history St Bees History project newsletter 15th Jan 1977 From sculptural and charter evidence the site was a principal centre of religious influence in the west of the county, and an extensive parish grew up with detached portions covering much of the Western Lakes.See John M. Todd The pre-Conquest Church in St Bees, Cumbria The Priory was dissolved in 1539, and since then the buildings have been the Anglican church of St Bees parish, and is now a grade I listed building. The Pre- Norman Church Window showing the arrival of St Bega at St Bees The remains of the 10th-century cross in the graveyard Romanesque lintel circa 1120, showing St Michael fighting a dragon There is sculptural and place-name evidence for the existence of a pre-Norman religious site; though no existing buildings from that time. The St Bees place-name is derived from \\"Kirkeby Becok\\" - the \\"Church town of Bega\\", which was used in the 12th Century. St Bega is a mysterious figure from pre-Norman Britain, and is said to have been an Irish princess who fled across the sea to St Bees to avoid an enforced marriage.John M Todd. St Bega - Cult, Fact and Legend, Transactions of Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and Archaeological Society Volume LXXX 1980 Legend has it that she then lived a life of piety at St Bees. The most likely period for her journey would have been sometime in the thirty years after 850, when the Vikings were settling Ireland. The continuance of the cult of St Bega following the arrival of the Normans is recorded in the Register of the Priory by the swearing of oaths on the \\"Bracelet of St Bega\\". This relic was touched as the means of taking a binding oath; oaths are recorded up to 1279, and offerings to the bracelet were made as late as 1516. In the graveyard is a cross shaft dating from the 10th century, showing Viking influence, and from the same era is a cross shaft of the Cumbrian spiral- scroll school, now in the church, both of which testify to this being a pre- Norman religious site. Pre-Norman parish boundaries suggest that St Bees had considerable pre-Norman influence in the west, and it has been suggested that St Bees was a \\"minster church\\" serving the west coast, but there is no firm evidence.John M Todd, The pre-Conquest Church in St Bees, Cumbria: a possible minster?, Transactions of the Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and archaeological Society, Vol III, 2003. The Priory=Founding The Normans did not reach this part of Cumbria until 1092. William Meschin, supported by Archbishop Thurstan, used the existing religious site to found a Benedictine Priory not earlier than 1120 and not later than 1135. The priory was subordinate to the great Benedictine monastery of St Mary's Abbey, York and had a Prior and six monks. To endow the Priory, there were many original grants of property and churches from local lords including the parish of Kirkeby Becok itself; stretching from the coast at present-day Whitehaven to the River Keekle, and down to where the river \\"Egre\\" (Ehen) falls into the sea. Also granted were the chapel of Egremont, churches at Whicham and Bootle, land in Rottington and the manor of Stainburn at Workington. St Bees was therefore the principal religious centre in the west of Cumbria, and the large number of existing medieval grave slabs of the local nobility testify to its to its importance. Growth and decline Later grants endowed the Priory with the churches of Workington, Gosforth, Corney and Whitbeck, and the chapels of Harrington, Clifton, Loweswater and Weddicar. These and a number of other gifts made St Bees the third-richest monastic house in the county. The Priory was enlarged in about 1190 by construction of a new chancel at the east end, and further enlarged ca. 1270-1300 by the addition of a chancel aisle to the south of this.Todd J M, St Bees History Newsletter No.3, Feb 1977 In its most prosperous and active period, the 14th-15th centuries, the Priory had not only a large church, but an impressive range of monastic domestic buildings. None of the priors rose to great prominence in the wider church, though two became Abbots of York. Possibly the relative isolation of St Bees meant that it was out of the mainstream of monastic politics. However its proximity to the Scottish border had disadvantages. It is known the Priory suffered in 1315 from Scots raiders, when after the Battle of Bannockburn James Douglas came south and raided the Priory and destroyed two of its mansions.Collison C, Ye Boke of ye Busie Bee\\" Dickinson, Millom, 1940 There is also an undated raid, possibly 1216, 1174 or further back in the reign of king Stephen. The monks were active in early coal mining, and the earliest reference to mining in the Whitehaven area is in the time of Prior Langton (1256–82), concerning the coal mines at Arrowthwaite.Hay D, Whitehaven an illustrated history\\", pub Michael Moon, Whitehaven 1979. Apart from the usual husbandry, we have evidence the monks ran a mill in the village. Charter 423 of the priory refers to a grant of all the water in Rottington for the use of Priory sometime between 1240 and 1265. Despite this prosperity it is likely, as with many monastic houses, that the Priory was running down by the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries, as the large chapel in the chancel south aisle at the east end appears to have become ruined about 1500, but not rebuilt.Todd J M, St Bees History Newsletter No. 15 1981 This can be seen in Buck's view of the Priory dating from 1739, and some of the ruins are still visible. The Dissolution Bucks' view of 1739. It shows the remains of the cloister, and right, the ruined chancel of the monastic church. The nave continued in use as the parish church after the closure in 1539 as a monastery.thumbright300px The monastic Priory was dissolved on 16 October 1539. The nave, tower and transepts continued in use as the Parish Church, and some of the cloister range was retained as a residence for the parish priest. This was finally demolished in 1816, when a new vicarage was built and the theological college was founded. Otherwise the monastic chancel at the east end was rendered roofless and the east arch of the tower was infilled with a dividing wall. The chapter house and east range of buildings were demolished. Burials in the priory *William de Lancaster I *Anthony de Lucy, 3rd Baron Lucy (d. 1368) *Prior Thomas de Cotyngham The Parish Church Following the Dissolution, the nave continued in use as the parish church. But by 1611 it was necessary to undertake considerable repairs, including the large bell tower which was structurally repaired to prevent further collapse; it had deteriorated to not far above the present arches. There was continuing attention by a series of small repairs going through the 17th and 18th Centuries. In the 18th Century the west door was not used, probably because the land abutting the door had passed into secular ownership, and the congregation entered via a north porch. By the early 1800s the building was in a poor state of repair. However, help was at hand from an unexpected quarter. The Theological College In 1816 George Henry Law, Bishop of Chester, in whose diocese the Priory then was, founded the St Bees Theological College.Park, Rev Dr T St Bees College - Pioneering Higher Education in 19th Century Cumbria 2008, . It was the first Church of England college for the training of clergy outside Oxford and Cambridge and was an immediate success due to its more vocational approach. The monastic chancel, which had been roofless since the Dissolution, was re-roofed to become the main college lecture room and library. The students lodged in the village and the Principal was also the Vicar of St. Bees. The college was very successful; training over 2,600 clergy, but closed in 1895, both at the prospect of falling numbers as it could not award degrees, and its vulnerability as a private institution as students now favoured the larger colleges that had sprung up using the St Bees model. Restoration The 19th century was the great era of restoration, helped greatly by the presence of the Theological College and the increasing prosperity of the village. The West door came into use, a new vicarage was built to the west, and the last of the monastic cloister was demolished. The nave and transepts were re-roofed, and to accommodate a new organ in 1867 the west Gallery was taken down. The altar was moved from under the tower east into a new chancel which occupied one bay of the monastic choir. The tower was re-built in the Romanesque style to the design of William Butterfield when the eight bells were installed in 1858. The north and south aisles were partly rebuilt and completely furnished with new stained glass. In 1899 the present magnificent \\"Father\\" Henry Willis organ was installed. Present use The church continues in use as the parish church of St Bees. In 1953 the Butterfield Romanesque spire was removed, and the bells were re-hung. In the 1960s the central pew arrangement was removed to give a centre aisle, and in the 1980s a doorway was built between the church and the monastic choir which now acts as one of the parish rooms. In the lapidarium in the south aisle there is one of the finest collections of effigies and carved stones in the county, including a very fine incised stone of Prior Cotyngham,Ryder P. The medieval cross slab grave covers in Cumbria. CWAAS extra series XXXII and there is a comprehensive history display created in 2010. Architecture St Bees Priory in 2008All of the church buildings in use at the Dissolution are still standing and in use by the parish. However, nothing remains of the domestic buildings of the monks. The magnificent Norman west doorway of the Priory dates from 1150-1160,Mary C Fair \\"Romanesque beakhead ornament in Cumberland\\". Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and Archeological Society Transactions Vol LXVI (1941)Pevsner N, The buildings of England, Cumberland and Westmorland. 1967 and is the most richly decorated in the county, with three orders of columns, zig-zag and beak-head decoration. Opposite in the west courtyard is a fine romanesque lintel, which may have served an earlier church, dating from Ca. 1120.English Romanesque Art 1066-1200, Ed; Zarnecki & others The six nave arcades are Early English arches sitting on the original Norman pillars and the base of the tower is Norman but the arches are Early English. The east wall of the north transept has plain Norman windows above the chapel altar, and there is a fine Norman window on the north side of the present chancel, though with Victorian plate tracery. The St Bega chapel in the north transept has two fine Norman windows above the altar. Flanking the altar are the two sculptures of St Bega and the Virgin Mary by Josefina de Vasconcellos which make up the \\"Vision of St Bega\\" (1950). In the 19th Century two large cinquefoils were inserted by Butterfield into the medieval east walls of the transepts. The side aisles are a Victorian restoration down to the string course. At the east end, beyond the present chancel wall by Butterfield, is the monastic chancel of about 1190, still almost complete, with a fine range of lancet windows on the north side, and on the south an arcade of arches (now infilled and with modern windows) which would have led to the 14th Century chapel in the chancel aisle. The monastic chancel is currently separated from the body of the church by the altar wall, though there is a modern connecting doorway. It is currently used as a parish room. Beneath the elevated wooden floor of the present building is the original stone floor of the medieval church. Outside to the south of the chancel are the remains of the chapel built 1270-1300, which may have fallen due to structural problems before the Dissolution. In the ruined fragment of the south wall can be seen the top steps of the monk's night stairs and a squint window, while to the east the north jamb is all that remains of what must have been a very impressive window. St Bees Man During an archaeological dig in 1981 in the area of the 14th-century ruined chapel at the east end, a number of medieval burials were uncovered, and the remains of an earlier building on a different alignment to the Priory was found. The most significant find was of a man aged 35–45 in a lead coffin in a stone vault, given the name St Bees Man, whose body was in a remarkable state of preservation. It has now been established that he was Anthony de Lucy,C J Knusel et al - The identity of the St Bees lady, Cumbria: An osteobiographical approach. Medieval Archaeology - vol 54, 2010. a knight, who died in 1368 in the Teutonic Crusades in Prussia. Although the body was about six hundred years old, his nails, skin and stomach contents were found to be in near-perfect condition.Text of lecture given by John M Todd at the Post Graduate Seminar on Medieval history, Lancaster University, Sept, 1987, and later at Oxford, Copenhagen and St Andrews universities. After his death the vault was enlarged to take the body of his sister, Maud de Lucy, who died in 1398. The probable effigies of both Maud and Anthony can be seen in the extensive history display which includes the shroud in which he was wrapped.

It is located approximately southwest of Highway 1 and southwest of Brooks.  History  Travers was once a booming town along the Canadian Pacific Railway between Medicine Hat and Aldersyde. Travers gets its name from one the railway's surveyors in 1914. The first settlers to the area were Pete Brodie, William Dunlop, A. Keene, Tom Emelson, Fred VanHolm, J.W. Murphy, and Sidney Thurlow. Traver's first grain elevator was built by Home Elevator Co. in 1914 next to the new railway, followed by an Ogilvie and United Grain Growers elevator. Settlers of the area at the time had to receive their mail at Sundial, 15 miles southwest of Travers. George Shirley opened a post office 4 miles north of Travers in 1909. Soon after another was opened at a store in Rosemead, 3 miles southwest of Travers. When the railway came Rosemead post office and store was relocated to Travers. With the arrival of the railway, Travers had a bank, barber shop, butcher shop, harness shop, two hardware and lumber yards, two blacksmiths, two livery barns, restaurants and boarding houses, garages and machine dealers, three grocery stores, pool room, men's clothing store, hotel and real estate office.

It is currently authorised for European Championship rounds of road racing and Swedish Touring Car Championship events. History Built in 1949 as a 1.55 km dirt track, the inaugural race was the first Kanonloppet on 4 June 1950. For the second Kanonloppet in 1952, the surface had been paved with asphalt and the length was now 1.6 km. It was extended to 2.0 km in 1953 with the addition of the Björkdungskurvan section (later renamed to Tröskurvan). In 1958 it was additionally extended to 3.172 km with the Velodromkurvan section (Velodrome bend). In 1961, 1962 and 1963 non- championship Formula One events were hosted here, which saw the likes of Stirling Moss, Jim Clark and Jack Brabham battle it out on-track. 1967 a race called Swedish Grand Prix was held there, won by Jackie Stewart. In 1979, the circuit hosted the Swedish motorcycle Grand Prix won by Barry Sheene. The circuit was forced to close for two years after a crash on 8 August 1970 during a touring car event.

One of the two classical flanking wings designed, by Geddes Hyslop in 1934 Charles Geddes Clarkson Hyslop (29 December 19001939 England and Wales Register – 13 November 1988)England & Wales, Civil Registration Death Index, 1916-2007 was a 20th-century British architect, trained at the British School in Rome. Linked with the Bloomsbury set, his work, mostly in the classical style, was fashionable amongst the British upper classes and intelligentsia in the years immediately surrounding World War II. He is remembered today as a restorer of country houses, a designer of knowledgeable pastiches rather than as an innovative architect.  Architecture  Hyslop began his architectural career during the early 1930s. His connections with the Bloomsbury Set and a circle of friends, which included such Victoria Sackville-West, Harold Nicolson and James Lees-Milne, ensured his access to the leading society patrons and aesthetes of the day. One of his earliest works, in 1933, was on the St. Helier estate, a new planned community, extending Morden, Surrey to the south and east. Geddes designed the community's modernistic brick Bishop Andrewe's Church, Wigmore Road.(Nikolaus Pevsner), Surrey (\\"Buildings of England\\") revised by Ian Nairn and Bridget Cherry), 1971:446 In 1934, The 2nd Lord Faringdon employed Hyslop to remodel Buscot Park and restore it to an approximation of an 18th-century appearance. This was achieved by removing the 19th century extensions and alterations which obscured the clean and simple lines of the neoclassical house. To restore some of the space lost by the demolition of a large wing, Hyslop created two flanking pavilions in a classical style, \\"which suit the house to perfection\\", John Julius Norwich observed, Norwich, The architecture of southern England? 1985:486 with temple fronts to the south and north. The pavilions and house were given a unified composition by linking high box hedging, complete with topiary pilasters. The interior of the mansion received a similar treatment: Victorian decoration was removed and 18th century ceilings, fireplaces and motifs were acquired and installed. Small rooms were merged to accentuate the sense of light and space needed to accommodate Lord Faringdon's large political houseparties.Buscot Park At Buscot, and in smaller neo-Georgian settings, Hyslop introduced actual Georgian fittings. At Great Swifts, a neo-Georgian house that Hyslop designed c. 1935, he installed an early 18th-century staircase from Tangier House, Taunton, and brought in fine wall panelling from Ashley Park, Walton-on-Thames, and a rococo chimneypiece from a house at Blackheath, London.John Newman, West Kent and the Weald (\\"Buildings of England\\") 1981:247 During World War II Major Hyslop, Royal Engineers, as he was commissioned,Sir Leonard Woolley, ed.

He was employed converting Greenlands, Hambleden, Buckinghamshire as a Government administrative staff college in 1945, occasioning the loss of some apparently not–very–characteristic or notable interior work by Norman Shaw; the commission was extended to include conversion of the north range to dormitory bedrooms in 1946, the conversion of the stable block to a library in 1951, and development of a freestanding dormitory on a butterfly-wing-plan, with a \\"bold flying staircase\\", in 1955.Nikolaus Pevsner (Elizabeth Williamson, ed.), Buckinghamshire (\\"Buildings of England\\") 1994:368 Hyslop's preference for working in the classical styles was severely tested in the years of austerity and building restrictions immediately following World War II. This is most apparent in Cambridge, where he designed a student hostel, King's College: West Road: Garden Hostel. Built between 1948 and 1950, its utilitarian austerity is softened by the adjacent King's College Fellows' Garden. Despite the imposed restrictions, Hyslop still managed to impart some classical ideals of proportion and height through the use of brick pilasters; further reference to an earlier form of architecture is provided by Oeil-de-Boeuf windows pierced on the floors above the entrance.Cambridge 2000 project Building on his functional college works, Geddes was commissioned as architect for the Staff College at Henley-on-Thame. The post–war work was not all austerity, however, as some wealthy patrons still existed. The Countess of Rosebery, one of the founders of the Edinburgh Festival, in 1950, persuaded her husband, the Earl of Rosebery, buoyed by his mother's fortune, to have the Rosebery's Scottish seat, Dalmeny House, restored. Considered one of Scotland's finest houses, the mansion had been damaged by fire during the war.Rosebery, p6. The resultant work, executed \\"sensitively\\" according to Hugh Montgomery- Massingberd and Christopher Sykes,Montgomery-Massingberd and Sykes 1997:101 involved the use of older materials such as original bookcases and 18th century fireplaces imported from elsewhere.Rosebery, p6.

Geddes Hyslop died in 1989.  Legacy  Geddes Hyslop's contribution to British architecture was his talent for designing buildings in complete empathy with their surroundings. In part, he achieved this by the re-use of materials salvaged from older buildings faced with demolition, this is especially true of his interiors. Hyslop did not design huge futuristic buildings intended to startle the senses, but works that were almost unremarkable, in the sense that their harmony with adjacent buildings, rendered them part of an existing composition. Yet his work was remarkable, for showing a complete understanding of proportion, perspective and historical accuracy.

It is a perennial that is native to Mexico. It is a vine with pink or white flowers (Antigonon leptopus 'alba' ). Invasive species This plant is listed as a category II invasive exotic by Florida's pest plant council. Invasion of A.leptopus on caribian island St.Eustatius significantly increased arthropod abundance and caused biotic homogenization. Specifically, uninvaded arthropod communities were distinctly different in species composition between developed and natural sites, while they became undistinguishable after A.leptopus invasion. Moreover, functional variables were significantly affected by species invasion... Invaded communities had higher community‐weighted mean body size and the feeding guild composition of invaded arthropod communities was characterized by the exceptional numbers of nectarivores, herbivores, and detritivores. Taxa indicated as omnivorous (e.g., ants) that seem intrinsically generalistic appear to primarily suffer from A. leptopus invasion and may be particularly sensitive to the habitat structural effects of A.leptopus. Increased coverage of A. leptopus leads to a significant decrease in the abundance of predatory lizards of the genus Anolis. Source: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gcb.15091 Description Habit Antigonon leptopus is a fast-growing climbing vine that holds on via tendrils, and is able to reach 25 ft or more in length. It has cordate (heart- shaped), sometimes triangular leaves 2½ to 7½ cm long. The flowers are borne in panicles, clustered along the rachis. Producing pink or white flowers from spring to autumn, it forms underground tubers and large rootstocks. It is a prolific seed producer. The seeds float on water. The fruit and seeds are eaten and spread by a wide range of animals such as pigs, racoons and birds. The tubers will resprout if the plant is cut back or damaged by frost. The form with white flowers  Uses  Antigonon leptopus was prepared for consumption by the aboriginal inhabitants of Baja California in a way somewhat reminiscent of preparing popcorn. The seeds were toasted by placing them in a flat basket made of flexible twigs torn into strips and woven to make a solid surface. On top of the seeds were placed live coals, and with both hands the basket was shaken so that the coals came up against the seeds, toasting them, but not burning the basket. When the toasting was finished, the burned-out coals were removed. Using this method, a major portion of the seeds burst open, exposing a white meal. Afterwards, the seeds were separated from the husks from which they had emerged by dextrously tossing them into the air with the basket, in the same way, that wheat is winnowed in Spain. The seeds were then ground and the resulting meal was eaten. Alternatively, the seeds could be boiled and made into fried cakes. and it is use for making tea.

In 1836, he moved to Green Bay, in the Wisconsin Territory and published his own paper, the Green Bay Wisconsin Democrat. He was also a publisher of the first newspaper in Madison, the Wisconsin Enquirer. While in Green Bay, he first entered politics, serving as a Democrat in the lower chamber of the Wisconsin Territorial Assembly during the first and second sessions (1837-1840). In 1840, he moved his plant and paper to Kenosha, then known as \\"Southport\\", and renamed the paper the Telegraph. In Kenosha, his brother Christopher Latham Sholes managed the paper, and eventually purchased the business from Charles. In 1843, he foreclosed a lien on the Wisconsin Enquirer and moved that company to Milwaukee, where the paper was renamed the Milwaukee Democrat. That same year, however, Sholes stopped production of that paper and began publishing a new paper called the American Freeman, affiliated with the abolitionist Liberty Party. Sholes was managing editor of that paper until 1846.http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&term;_id=2625&search;_term=sholes In 1847, Sholes returned to Kenosha and made his home there. He was elected Mayor of Kenosha, serving from 1852 to 1856. And was elected as a Republican to represent Kenosha in the Wisconsin State Assembly for 1855, he was also chosen as Speaker of the Assembly that year. Later that year, he was the Republican nominee for Lieutenant Governor of Wisconsin, but was defeated by Democrat Arthur MacArthur, Sr., who went on to briefly serve as Governor due to a controversy over election fraud in the gubernatorial election. Along with Zalmon G. Simmons, he was the founder of the Wisconsin State Telegraph Company, and in 1855 he became president of that company. Sholes returned to politics one more time in 1865, earning election to the Wisconsin State Senate on the National Union Party ticket for the 1866 and 1867 sessions. He died in 1867, after the legislative session was over, but before the official expiration of his term as Senator. He was married to Sarah Elizabeth McKinney. Together they had nine children, though only three lived to adulthood.

The Iberian Peninsula in the 3rd century BC. The Belli, also designated Beli or Belaiscos were an ancient pre-Roman Celtic Celtiberian people who lived in the modern Spanish province of Zaragoza from the 3rd Century BC.  Origins  Roman authors for unknown reasons wrote that the Belli were of mixed Illyrian and Celtic (Belgic) origin and probably related with the Bellovaci, who were said to have migrated to the Iberian Peninsula around the 4th Century BCPliny the Elder, Naturalis Historia, III, 29.Strabo, Geographikon, III, 4, 12. and part of the Celtiberians. There is an overwhelming amount of evidence that the ancestors of the Celtiberian groups were installed in the Meseta area of the peninsula from at least 1000 BC and probably much earlier.  Location  The Belli inhabited the middle Jiloca and Huerva river valleys in Zaragoza province with their territories stretching up to the Guadalope and upper Turia valleys, close to their neighbours and clients, the Titii. Their early capital was Segeda (Poyo de Maya – Zaragoza; Celtiberian mint: Sekaiza), subsequently transferred to nearby Durón de Belmonte and later offset by Bilbilis (Valdeherrera, near Calatayud – Zaragoza; Celtiberian mint: Bilbiliz). Other Belli urban centers included Nertobriga (La Almunia de Doña Godina – Zaragoza; Celtiberian mint: Nertobis), Contrebia Belaisca (Zaforas de Botorita – Zaragoza; Celtiberian mint: Contebacom Bel), Beligiom (Piquete de la Atalaya de Azuara – Zaragoza; Celtiberian mint: Belikiom), Lesera (El Forcal) and Belgeda (Belchite – Zaragoza). It is plausible that by the 2nd Century BC they exerted some form of control over the strategic frontier towns of Belia (sited somewhere between the Huerva' and Aguas Vivas' rivers; Celtiberian mint: Belaiscom), Osicerda (El Palau de Alcañiz – Teruel; Iberian designation: Usercerte), Damania (Hinojosa de Jarque – Teruel; Celtiberian mint: Tamaniu) and Orosis (La Caridad de Caminreal – Teruel; Celtiberian mint: Orosiz), facing the Iberian Lobetani and Edetani peoples of the modern Valencia coastal region.  Culture  Example of a bronze hospitality token in the Celtiberian Celtic language The most culturally advanced of the peoples of southern Celtiberia, the Belli were the first Celtiberian tribe to adopt coinage in the aftermath of the 2nd Punic War and to post laws in written form on bronze tablets (Tabulae), using a modified Northeastern Iberian script (known as the Celtiberian script) for their own language. In this script and language they inscribed the characteristic Celtiberian 'hospitality tokens' which are small bronze objects, in two halves, each half being retained by people who stood in hospitality relationship to one another. These would act as a sort of identity card, and were probably used as safe-conducts or other warranties. The two halves have been found in places several hundreds of kilometres apart, which implies that the various Celtic groups maintained a system of communications throughout at least central Spain. The most complete Celtiberian text we have on the bronze 'hospitality tokens' that acted as a sort of identity card is from the Belli and reads lubos alisokum aualoske kontebias belaiskas meaning 'Lubos of the Aliso family, son of Aualos, from Contrebia Belaisca' showing the self-description of this man, by paternity, extended family and territory which is characteristically Celtic.  History  During the 3rd-2nd centuries BC, the Belli joined the Celtiberian confederacy alongside the Arevaci, Lusones and Titii, with whom they developed close political and military ties – in 153 BC the Numantines even elected the Belli General Caros as leader of the Celtiberian coalition army that ambushed the Consul Quintus Fulvius Nobilior at the battle of Ribarroya, at the Baldano river valley in the beginning of the first Numantine War.Appian, Iberiké 44-45. Prior to that, they had been forced in 181 BC to accept Roman suzerainty by Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus the Elder,Diodorus Siculus, Bibliothekes Istorikes 29, 28.Appian, Iberiké 42. but this did not prevent them from resisting further Roman encroachment of their lands as well as fighting off Turboletae raids and the Iberian Lobetani people.  Romanization  Defeated in 143 BC by Proconsul Quintus Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus,Appian, Iberiké 76. and faced with the fall of Numantia in 133 BC and the subsequent collapse of the Celtiberian confederacy, the Belli territory was incorporated into Hispania Citerior province though little is known of their history afterwards. The Belli appear to have remained independent until the Sertorian Wars of the early 1st Century BC, when they were gradually pushed back from the upper Jiloca by the Edetani who seized Beligiom, Belgeda, Damania and Orosis, therefore losing all the lands east of the Huerva River. Around 72 BC they and their Titii allies merged with the pro-Roman Uraci, Cratistii and Olcades tribes to form the Late Celtiberian people (Latin: Celtiberi) of romanized southern Celtiberia.

The tubes are closed at one end, and they contain a concentric inner tube. Flow is thus separated into the colder inner flow down the tube and the heated flow upwards through the outer sleeve. As Field tubes are thus dependent on thermo-syphon flow within the tube, they must thus always have some vertical height to encourage the flow. In most designs they are mounted near-vertically, to encourage this. They are named after Edward Field,\\"A short history of the steam engine,\\" Cambridge University Press Archive their inventor, and were originally developed for steam fire-engines where speed of raising steam was important. More recently, Field-tube boilers have been most widely used by French manufacturers, either for small vertical boilers, or as a marine boiler. The use of this type of Field tube has also been researched for the transfer of heat from nuclear reactors, vacuum condensers and heat exchangers. The thimble-tube boiler has some similarities, in that its water-tubes are also single-ended. The simpler thimble tube does not have the inner tube of the field-tube, therefore its flow is mixed, turbulent and dependent on random boiling. For this reason, thimble tubes can only be short, so are used in large numbers, and usually horizontally as their flow is not coherent enough to benefit from a gravity gradient. Field tubes are however more complex and expensive to manufacture. Field-tube boilers therefore use fewer and longer tubes (giving the same heating area for a reduced number of tubes). Field- tubes are always submerged, i.e. the upper end of the tube is mounted into the boiler below the water level, otherwise flow into the cold side of the tube cannot be replenished. The principal advantage claimed for Field-tube boilers is that there are none of the expansion problems experienced in boilers with simple tubes. Secondly, as Field-tubes are connected from just one end, their replacement and maintenance is simpler. One drawback of the field-tube is a tendency for mud and scale to accumulate in the bottom of the tube, potentially blocking circulation. The closed tube ends are also difficult to wash out. Providing an excessive dead space there as a mud reservoir would have poor circulation, thus risking local overheating. Efforts must thus be made to ensure that all tubes are equally heated and that all have strong circulation within them, encouraging enough flow to scour the tubes free of sludge.  Field-tubes as thermic syphons  Where a simple vertical boiler requires additional heating surface, particularly where this is directly exposed to the furnace so as to raise steam more rapidly, field-tubes may be installed in the roof of the firebox, almost down to the level of the firebed. They thus act as a form of thermic syphon. As they are only mounted at one end and are free to expand in the heat, many of the usual expansion problems of thermic syphons are avoided. To encourage adequate circulation though, tubes should not be closer than 30° to horizontal, and longer tubes may need to be steeper than this.  De Poray boiler  De Poray boiler, sectioned The De Poray boiler is French in origin. Its defining characteristic is its patented double combustion chamber, intended to increase combustion efficiency, thus reducing fuel costs and smoke emissions. The secondary chamber is mounted adjacent to the first and consists of a refractory ring of reduced diameter to the first combustion chamber. This ring is heated by radiation from primary combustion, thus maintaining a high temperature. Any unburned combustion gases leaving the first chamber are heated by this incandescent ring and together with the supply of secondary air are encouraged to ignite. In the vertical form of the De Poray boiler, the main heating surface is composed of vertical Field tubes in this secondary combustion chamber. A steel radiation bell is hung in the centre of the chamber, beneath the outlet flue, and the combustion gases are directed to pass over this, heating it. Heating of the tubes themselves is partly by convection from the gases, partly by indirect re- radiation from this heated bell. This permits a lower operating temperature for the tubes, also a more even heating. This is claimed by the makers to encourage more uniform boiling within the tube, thus faster steam-raising. An unusual feature of this boiler is that the field tubes are not rigidly attached to the boiler shell, but merely gasketed into place. The thickened ends of the tubes are formed to a taper and the tubeplate holes are reamed to match. A paper gasket is sufficient to seal the joint. Inspection or removal for replacement is thus simplified. As the boiler is always under greater pressure than the atmosphere, the tubes self-tighten under pressure and avoid leaking. Obviously the boiler must never be placed under vacuum, so a vacuum valve may need to be provided.  Niclausse boiler  1911 Encyclopædia Britannica The Niclausse boiler is another French design, used for both land and marine use. It uses long Field tubes set at a shallow angle to the horizontal, as per the Babcock & Wilcox boiler. These Field tubes are linked into vertical sets by headers at their upper end. This header is a double pipe, with two sections linking the inner and outer waterspaces separately. Above the boiler and outside the flue gas enclosure, a steam-and-water drum links these headers together.Harris, Model Boilermaking, pp. 63,65 It was notably used in some of the last pre-dreadnought battleships (circa 1900) of the French,Jean Bart Italian, RussianVaryag class and British navies. Although performance of this boiler has been good, washout is difficult and sludge build-up can be a problem. With careful design and regular maintenance the type gained a reputation for reliability and the quick replacement of a failed tube, which made it suitable for naval practice, less so for commercial use. Niclausse boilers gave poor fuel economy when coupled with turbines operating at low speed, in addition to copious quantities of smoke and sparks. As such, they fell out of favor for naval shipbuilding once steam turbines became commonplace (see Danton class battleship for example).  Dürr boiler  A very similar type, used in German warships, was the Dürr boiler. This did not use sectional headers, but single chambers. By 1901, the Royal Navy had ordered eight Dürr boilers from Germany, to be installed as a trial on board the Marathon-class cruiser .

The first reference to the term weblet seems to have appeared in a report produced for NASA numbered RNR-94-017, dated back on October 6, 1994 and entitled \\"Spinning a Useful Weblet\\". The definition this document used in relation to a weblet was as follows: \\"A highly interconnected portion of the World Wide Web devoted to a particular end, usually maintained by a single individual or organization and located at a single site.\\" Description A weblet is similar to, but different in several ways from a minisite or microsite. Although a weblet is similar in that it is a type of Internet web design, its main differences are as follows: # It is a site that is \\"usually maintained by a single individual\\". # Another key difference is that weblets allow users the option to download content and read it when they're off-line with a feature called a “Downloadable Weblet”. The fact that weblets can be downloaded provides the unique ability for users to both display and download professional looking content with a polished appeal, similar to that of a brochure, magazine or glossy hand out. Downloads can be in the form of one or more pages and references can span multiple pages that link between individual pages for viewing offline. Creating a downloadable weblet requires an approach slightly different from creating normal Web pages. # Weblets are meant to assist non- technical, non-web-savvy people to better publish professional looking web content without the use of identical-looking web templates and without having to know anything about programming in HTML and other computer programming languages. This allows non-developers an easier and quicker way to create and keep up their web site or a supplementary extension to an existing, primary website, by use of subdomains. Concluding remarks from Al Globus and Chris Beaumont of NASA included the comment that \\"indexing issues need to be worked out.\\" Also, the article mentions that web content requires rigorous editing and reviewing. The complexity of creating web content continues to be difficult and has acquired a reputation for being sloppy and of low quality. They further mention that although the Web is a superb means of disseminating technical information to a large audience at low cost, these documents must constantly be kept up to date. A sustained large effort would be needed to provide a significant utility to update web sites in a much easier way. SInce 1994, better software has been developed to enable non-technical users to update their websites as weblets; these continue to improve. Today non- technical users are able to use tools that they are already familiar with such as their Word Processor, Spreadsheet, Presentation and Publishing software to update content on their website that dynamically generates HTML and Adobe Flash websites and publishes these to weblet servers. The term weblet is also used by Microsoft as a means to modify settings that control the functionality of an Enterprise portal. Also, web applications referred to as webapp can also be purchased or designed, uploaded and executed as an added component to a weblet. In addition, there are many add-ons called weblet tools available to help the non-technical user. There are tools to optimize the weblets for Search Engine Optimization (SEO), streaming video, voice annotation and other functionality. References * NASA Spinning a Userful Weblet.

It has its operations in United Kingdom and Pakistan. The group owns the UK's second-largest wholesaler serving 125,000 independent retailers and caterers from 64 warehouses nationwide. They also run the UK's third-largest pharmacy chain, Well Pharmacy based in Manchester. They are also well known for owning the Best-one, Bargain Booze and Central Convenience stores. In Pakistan it is the largest shareholder of United Bank, while its subsidiary Bestway Cement is the largest cement-maker in Pakistan with a total capacity of more than 8 million tons per annum. Business=Pharmacy In July 2014 Bestway Group acquired the Co-operative Group's stores branded as The Co-operative Pharmacy, the UK's third largest pharmacy, for £620 million. They have since been rebranded as Well Pharmacy. Cement The Group set up its first cement plant in 1995 in Hattar in the KP Province of Pakistan, with an initial investment of US$120.0 million. The plant's initial capacity was 0.99 million tonnes per annum, this was enhanced to 1.17 million tonnes per annum at a cost of US$10 million in 2002. Bestway Group expanded its operations by setting up a 1.8 million tonnes per annum cement plant in Chakwal, Punjab Province, Pakistan, at a cost of US$180.0 million. Civil works for Bestway Chakwal-I were initiated in January 2005, the Kiln was fired in May 2006 and the plant went into production in June 2006. Though Bestway cement brought investment in Pakistan, the local people claim that Bestway Group did not fairly compensate the previous owners of the land. A case was brought against Bestway Group and is pending in the Supreme Court of Pakistan. In May 2006 the Group announced plans for a second 1.8 million tonnes per annum capacity plant adjacent to its existing operations in Chakwal at a cost of US$150.0 million. To augment its presence in the cement industry, Bestway bid for 85.29% equity of Mustehkam Cement Limited. The Company's bid of approximately US$70.0 million was accepted in September 2005. The plant started production in December 2005 just one month after acquisition. In 2010 the production capacity was further enhanced to 1.1 million tonnes per annum at a total cost of US$70.0 million. Over the last few years, Bestway's cement capacity has increased from 1.1 million tonnes to 6.0 million tonnes per annum; Bestway Cement is the largest exporter of cement to Afghanistan. Banking In October 2002 Bestway Group successfully bid for a controlling share in United Bank Limited (UBL). This was a total investment of approximately US$210.0 million. The bank has transformed itself from a loss- making static public sector entity into a profitable dynamic private enterprise. Profit before tax has grown from US$48.0 million in December 2002 to US$206.5 million in December 2010. In 2005 for the third consecutive year the CFA Association of Pakistan conferred upon UBL's Investment Banking Group the ‘Largest Corporate Finance House’ award. In February 2005 UBL became the first bank in South Asia to launch the EMV enabled credit card. In June 2005 with the launch of ‘UBL Money’ a fixed instalment personal loan product, UBL became the only bank in Pakistan to launch a complete suite of consumer financing products. In August 2005 UBL became the first bank to achieve the ‘Authorised Derivatives Dealer’ status in Pakistan. As of December 2010 the bank's asset base had increased to US$8.5 billion, with UBL emerging as the second largest private bank in Pakistan. Today, UBL has over 1,300 branches in Pakistan; a significant presence throughout the Middle East; Subsidiaries in UK and Switzerland; a branch in New York and Representative Offices in Beijing and Kazakhstan. In 1987 the Bestway Group established the Bestway Foundation. Every year the Group contributes approximately 2.5% of its profit to the Foundation, which helps support charities and contributes to help the local community. In the last decade Bestway Foundation has invested in 35 inner city schools in as part of the Specialist Schools & Academies Program. History In 1976 Sir Anwar Pervez established Bestway's first wholesale warehouse in Acton, West London. This was followed by warehouses in Southall (1981), Hackney (1983), Park Royal (1984) before expansion around the country. In 2005, the Group acquired Batley's plc, and in 2010 purchased Bellevue and Martex. In April 2018, Bestway acquired the Bargain Booze and Wine Rack brands for £7m. Awards and nominations In January 2013, Bestway was nominated for the Business of the Year award at the British Muslim Awards.

He was also a successful and experienced general for the crowns of both Sweden and of Brandenburg, but is best remembered as the eponymous hero of Heinrich von Kleist's play Der Prinz von Homburg.also Prinz Friedrich von Homburg, or in full, Prinz Friedrich von Homburg oder die Schlacht bei Fehrbellin  Life = Childhood and youth  Frederick was born in Homburg (the present Bad Homburg vor der Höhe), the seventh and youngest child of Landgrave Frederick I of Hesse-Homburg, who died in 1638, leaving the children to be brought up under the care of their mother, Margaret Elisabeth of Leiningen-Westerburg. At his mother's wish Frederick was educated by private tutors together with the sons of his cousin, George II, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt, in Marburg. In 1648 he broke his leg and spent some time convalescing in Bad Pfäfers. When Field-Marshal Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne, appeared in the vicinity, Frederick was sent by his mother to conduct negotiations for the safety of Homburg. Turenne found the prince so engaging that he wanted to take him straight away into his army and to pay for his military education. Frederick's mother however opposed the idea, and it came to nothing. At the age of 16 he made the Grand Tour through Italy and France, and was then signed up as a student at the University of Geneva, although he did not follow a real course of academic study: he learned dancing, riding and fencing, and polished his knowledge of the French language.  Military career  Since his elder brothers preceded him in the succession, he decided on a military career and in 1654 became a colonel in the army of the King of Sweden, Charles X Gustav. Frederick II of Hesse-Homburg: bust by Andreas Schlüter, cast by Johann Jacobi (vestibule of Schloss Bad Homburg) In 1659 during the storming of Copenhagen during the Northern Wars Frederick was so seriously wounded that his lower right leg had to be amputated. He was promoted to major-general (Generalmajor) and from then on had a wooden leg. Frederick was chosen by Charles X as the Statthalter of Livonia, but after the king's death things changed considerably, and Frederick left Swedish service in 1661. In the same year he married Margareta Brahe, a wealthy Swedish widow, who died in 1669. With her wealth he bought estates in Brandenburg and became a friend of the Elector Friedrich Wilhelm I of Brandenburg. In 1670 Frederick married the Elector's niece Princess Luise Elisabeth von Kurland, after moving from the Lutheran to the Reformed church and entering the service of Brandenburg as a general. In 1672 he received the command of all the forces of Brandenburg. In 1672 and 1674 he fought in the Dutch War, among other places in Alsace against the French army commanded by Turenne. As commander of the Brandenburg cavalry, during the Swedish invasion, on 28 June 1675 in the Battle of Fehrbellin he attacked the Swedish army without orders to do so, causing them heavy losses. In the event this move contributed decisively to the victory of Brandenburg but also to the displeasure of the Elector. In the years 1676-1678 he took part in the campaigns in Pomerania and Prussia and negotiated on behalf of the Elector of Brandenburg the Treaty of Saint-Germain of 1679.  Landgrave of Hesse-Homburg  After leaving military service he lived as a Junker in Brandenburg. After the death of Georg Christian, his second eldest brother, who had mortgaged to Hesse-Darmstadt the landgraviate of Hesse-Homburg and the town of Homburg, Frederick redeemed them, and took up residence there himself. In 1681, after the death of his brother Landgrave Wilhelm Christoph of Hesse- Homburg, Frederick took over the governance of the territory as Frederick II. He was however forced to return the territory of Bingenheim, which Wilhelm Christoph had occupied, to Hesse-Darmstadt, in exchange for financial compensation. He had the Baroque Schloss Bad Homburg constructed, and involved himself, with little success, in the local economy with the establishment of a glassworks and a salination plant. More successful was the settlement of Huguenot and Waldensian refugees from France, in Friedrichsdorf and Dornholzhausen. His court alchemist, Paul Andrich, made him a prosthetic leg with springs and silver mounts - whence his nickname \\"the Landgrave with the silver leg\\". In 1690 his wife died, having borne him 12 children. At the age of 59 Frederick married for a third time: the widow Sophie Sybille von Leiningen-Westerburg, a connection of his mother's family, who bore him three more children. Frederick died in 1708 in Homburg, apparently from pneumonia, after a last journey to Leipzig to meet Charles XII, King of Sweden.  Children  Frederick II was married three times: in 1661 to Countess Margarethe Brahe (1603–1669); in 1670 to Princess Louise Elisabeth of Courland (1646–1690); and in 1691 to Countess Sophie Sybille of Leiningen-Westerburg (1656–1724).

The character of the prince in the play however has little apart from the name in common with the historical personage. The drama in its turn has inspired an opera, Der Prinz von Homburg, by Hans Werner Henze (written 1958, performed 1960) and a number of films, including Marco Bellochio's Il Principe di Homburg, released in 1997.

It was played at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on October 6, 2009. The Twins won the game 6–5 in extra innings and advanced to the 2009 AL Division Series where they were swept by the New York Yankees; the Tigers failed to qualify for the postseason. A tie-breaker was necessary after both teams finished the season with identical win–loss records of 86–76. The Twins, who had won the regular season series against the Tigers, 11 games to 7, were thus awarded home field due to a rules change prior to the 2009 season. It was the third tie-breaker played in MLB from 2007–2009. It was also the second consecutive tiebreaker for the AL Central title after 2008, when the Chicago White Sox defeated the Twins to win the division. The Twins became the first (and, as of 2018, only) MLB team to contest tie-breaker games of any sort (divisional and/or wild card) in consecutive seasons. The tie-breaker is counted as the 163rd regular season game played by both teams and all events in the game are added to regular season statistics. This was the Twins' final regular season game at the Metrodome as the team moved to Target Field for the 2010 season. The tie- breaker was later named the Best Regular-Season Game of the Decade by Sports Illustrated. Background The Tigers led the AL Central for periods at the start of the season in April, ultimately tying for the lead on May 10 and taking the lead outright on May 16. The Tigers held at least a share of the divisional lead from then onwards, holding their largest lead of 7 games on September 6. Although the Tigers went 16–12 in September, their second-best month by winning percentage in 2009, they won just 1 of 4 games in October. The Twins went 16–11 and 4–0, respectively, over this same stretch to tie the Tigers for the divisional lead after the 162-game regular season. More broadly, the Tigers were 48–39 over the first half of the season while the Twins were 45–44 but the Twins came back in the second half going 41–32 leading up to the tie-breaker while the Tigers went 38–37 over the same span. The Twins won 11 of the two teams' 18 match-ups that season prior to the tie- breaker. This late-season competition for the AL Central title included a four-game series between the two teams from September 29 to October 2. The series, played at the Tigers' home field Comerica Park, started with a day- night doubleheader caused by a rainout the night before when the series was scheduled to start. The final game of the series featured moments of contention between the two teams. In the third inning, Nate Robertson hit Denard Span. Minnesota starter Scott Baker hit Marcus Thames with a pitch the next inning. Thames responded by sliding hard into second base to break up a potential double play that inning. Twins' reliever Jose Mijares then threw behind the Tigers' Adam Everett in the eighth inning. Umpire Angel Hernandez warned Mijares and the Tigers bench, Tigers' manager Jim Leyland argued with Hernandez, and he was ejected. Despite the warning Minnesota's Delmon Young was hit in the knee with the first pitch in the ninth inning by Jeremy Bonderman. Bonderman was immediately ejected as was Tigers' catcher Gerald Laird who argued with Hernandez and the benches cleared, though there was no brawl. Bonderman was suspended for three games, and Tigers' hitting coach Lloyd McClendon—who had been acting as manager following Leyland's ejection—was suspended for a game. McClendon, Leyland, and Laird were all fined. Ultimately, the four-game series was split with two wins for each team, and the Tigers maintained a two-game lead with only three games remaining for each club. The Tigers lost two of their next three games to the Chicago White Sox, whereas the Twins swept the Kansas City Royals in a three-game series leaving both teams tied with an 86–76 record. A tiebreaker game would decide the winner of the Central division while the loser would be eliminated from playoff contention. Prior to the 2009 season, home field advantage in a tiebreaker game was decided by a series of coin tosses held towards the end of the regular season that would decide the home teams of all possible tiebreakers. A rule change following the 2008 season altered this process, leaving the site determined on a series of performance-based criteria beginning with the head-to-head record between the two teams that were tied. Therefore, the Twins took home-field advantage in this game, by virtue of winning the season series against the Tigers 11–7. The game was the third MLB tie-breaker in as many seasons, a record number for the league. While October 5 had been the original scheduled date for a potential tiebreaker game, a scheduling conflict with the Minnesota Vikings, who were co-tenants of the Metrodome with the Twins, resulted in the tiebreaker game being moved a day later to October 6. Game summary alt=A man in a blue baseball jersey, gray pinstriped pants, a batting helmet, and black gloves runs the bases. The game was scoreless through the first two innings. Detroit took a three-run lead in the third inning which started when Curtis Granderson walked, advanced on a ground out, and scored on a single by Magglio Ordóñez to center field. Ordóñez was then brought home via a two-run home run by Tigers' first baseman Miguel Cabrera. The Twins responded in the bottom of the inning, with Matt Tolbert singling to lead off the inning, advancing to second base on a single by Denard Span, and then moving to third on a flyball out. Tigers' starter Rick Porcello attempted a pickoff throw to first which hit the baserunner Span and went past the first baseman Cabrera. Span was out but Tolbert was able to score on Porcello's throwing error. The score remained 3–1 until the bottom of the 6th inning. Porcello got the first two batters of the inning out but then allowed a home run to Jason Kubel to bring the game within one run. Porcello then walked the next batter, Michael Cuddyer, and was relieved by Zach Miner. The Twins loaded the bases against Miner, but did not score again in the inning. Scott Baker, the Twins' starter, walked the first batter of the 7th and was relieved by Jon Rauch though no runs scored. The Twins took a 4–3 lead in the bottom of the 7th with a leadoff single by Nick Punto and a two-run home run by Orlando Cabrera. The Tigers responded, tying the game at 4 with a home run by Ordóñez in the top of the 8th off of Matt Guerrier. Guerrier allowed another two walks in the inning and was relieved by closer Joe Nathan who escaped the inning with no further scoring. Nathan remained in the game, holding the Tigers scoreless in the 9th, while Tigers' closer Fernando Rodney did the same to Minnesota to force extra innings. Jesse Crain replaced Nathan in the top of the 10th and hit Aubrey Huff who was pinch hitting for Wilkin Ramirez. Don Kelly then pinch ran for Huff, and scored on a double by Brandon Inge to give the Tigers a 5–4 lead. The Tigers inserted Clete Thomas for Ordóñez in right field as a defensive replacement in the bottom of the 10th. However the Twins retied the game at 5–5 as Cuddyer led off the inning with a triple and, following a Delmon Young groundout and a walk to Brendan Harris, scored on a single by Tolbert. Alexi Casilla pinch-ran for Harris and advanced to third on Tolbert's single. Nick Punto then hit a fly ball to left-fielder Ryan Raburn. Casilla attempted to score on the play, but inadvertently inched off the base before the ball was caught, and had to return to the base before breaking for home. Catcher Gerald Laird successfully tagged out Casilla to complete the inning-ending double play. Both teams were held scoreless in the 11th. The Tigers threatened to score in the top of the 12th, with a walk by Cabrera and a single by Kelly with one out. Twins pitcher Bobby Keppel then intentionally walked Raburn to load the bases, hoping he could induce a double play. Then, Keppel threw a fastball close to batter Brandon Inge with his first pitch. Inge believed he was hit by the ball and should advance to first, which would force a go-ahead run to score with the bases loaded, but home plate umpire Randy Marsh ruled the pitch did not hit Inge and allowed the at- bat to continue. Tigers' manager Jim Leyland would say later that \\"the replay kind of confirms that it did hit him,\\" but Marsh maintained that replays were \\"inconclusive.\\" Inge ultimately grounded into a force out at home and Laird would strikeout to close the top of the inning with no scoring. Carlos Gómez led off the bottom of the 12th with a single for the Twins and advanced to second on a ground-out. With first base open, the Tigers intentionally walked Delmon Young to bring up Casilla. Casilla atoned for his earlier base-running blunder by hitting a ground ball through the right side of the infield. The base hit allowed the speedy Gomez to score from second without a play, thus giving the Twins a 6–5 walk-off victory. Aftermath The tie-breaker win clinched the American League Central for the Twins and earned them a spot in the ALDS, in which they were swept by the New York Yankees in three games. The Tigers became the first team in MLB history to have a three-game division lead with four games remaining and lose the division. MLB tie-breaker games count as regular season games and this game affected certain statistical races for the 2009 season. For example, Jason Beck of MLB.com noted that if the umpire agreed with Brandon Inge on the contentious 12th inning call Inge would have tied for the most hit by a pitch in the American League. Twins' catcher Joe Mauer won the 2009 American League batting title, and his final batting average for the season moved from .364 to .365 in the game. The game was later chosen by Sports Illustrated as the Best Regular-Season Game of the Decade.

Ray.  Plot summary  Henry Lorimer is one of the two owners of downsized H & L Lumber Company camp, who returns one day to give the good news that he has negotiated a new contract with the U.S. government. The plan is to cut down the entire tree population in Antler Valley, a place where lumbering previously has been impossible because of the resistance from the fierce inhabitants. Adams, who is to co-sign the deal, expresses his surprise over the plan. Lorimer is determined to go through with the plan and brings his men to the site, led by the tough foreman Hodge Mason. As the work proceeds, a number of \\"accidents\\" occur, and Lorimer believes that the Cain family is responsible. Lorimer goes to see them but they claim to have nothing to do with it, and the reason is they know Lorimer is working for the military and a valuable cause. A young man named John Gordon comes looking for a job, and flirts with Lorimer's daughter Perry as soon as he enters the company premises. She shows no interest in the arrogant man. Still, he is hired to help lumbering. One night, John discovers a forest fire and the men start extinguishing it. Lorimer is killed by a tree falling in the effort and Perry takes charge of the company in his place. The camp manager, Frank Barnes, asks Perry to marry him, and Adams tries to buy her share of the company, but she refuses them both. It turns out the entire Cain family was killed in the fire, and the suspicions about their involvement are abandoned. John is put on household work after burning his hands in the fire, and the accidents continue to happen in the forest. When a man falls to his death after his safety rope is cut, Frank talks to the sheriff. Suspicions arise that the cook, Eric, who is an immigrant, is the one responsible. The next accident is a dynamite explosion that causes the earth to move and stop the lumber transport by train to its destination at the sawmill. Eric is cleared of suspicion, and John tries to investigate the cause of the accident. He is almost hit by a bullet when he is riding in the forest, but instead the entire supply of dynamite is ignited and explodes. The others soon suspect John of trying to sabotage the lumbering. More dynamite is delivered, and John develops a plan to reveal who the saboteur is by claiming to have proof of the culprit. He shows them a bullet as proof and hides the bullet by his bnk bed. In the night Mason, the foreman, retrieves the bullet from its hiding place and is seen by Olaf, who knows about the plan. Olaf tells John about it by writing him a note which he passes to him during a card game in which both John and Mason takes part. Mason picks a fight with John in order to get a chance to shoot him, but Frank breaks it up. The next day John tells Perry that he believes Frank to be in cahoots with Mason. He also reveals to her that he is the son of late owner Hamilton, who got a share of the company as inheritance on the condition he serve as a lumberjack for some time. Since Frank is in the forest to clear up for the transport with dynamite, john and Perry suspect he is to do further sabotage to the train transport. They ride into the forest to stop him, but Perry is rendered unconscious after a blow to the head. Frank lets the train run towards the stack of dynamite he has prepared, and where Mason is ready. The lumber cars manage to pass before the dynamite disintegrates the rail and the rest of the train. John finds Perry and brings her back to camp. The sheriff arrives to apprehend both Frank and Mason.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/81043/Law-of-the-Timber/  Cast  *Marjorie Reynolds as \\"Perry\\" Lorimer *Monte Blue as Hodge Mason *J.

It stars James Murray and Joan Marsh. The film was known as The Big Thrill in the United Kingdom. Plot summary Mark \\"High Gear\\" Sherrod has been a race car driver for the past five years and is now at the height of his career. His co- driver Ed is the widowed father of Jimmy. Ed promised his wife before she died that he would send Jimmy off to a fine military school after winning the \\"big race\\". The day before the race finds Jimmy and Ed at home in their apartment, with Mr. and Mrs. Cohen visiting, and reporter Anne Merrit sneaking into Mark's hotel room for an exclusive interview. Mark agrees to give her the interview she needs over a dinner table. She break the date she already has for the night with her boss Larry Winston and goes out with Mark. Larry Winston walks into the same restaurant Mark and Anne are dining at, and sees them. Larry walks over to their table and has Anne introduce him to Mark. The two men become rivals. On the day of the race, Mark gets behind when a tire goes flat. He enters the track again and starts to take the lead. While on the last lap, Mark loses control of his car and spins out just as he is about to pass the car in the lead. His car comes to a stop and before he can move out of the way, he is hit dead on by another car going full speed. Mark somehow comes out of this accident unscathed, but his partner Ed is killed. Jimmy, now an orphan, is staying with the Cohen's. Mark returns and the Cohen's decide to tell him they would like to adopt Jimmy. Before they are able to however, Mark asks Jimmy if he wants to come and live with him at his hotel. Jimmy accepts, Mark promises to send him to that military school, and Mrs. Cohen silently bursts into tears. Mark sends Jimmy to the URBAN Military Academy and hits the track again with his new co-driver Howard. Unfortunately, Mark is plagued by crude flashbacks of Ed and the accident. He tells Howard he is through with racing and walks away. Strapped for cash, Mark leaves his fancy hotel, moves in with Mr. and Mrs. Cohen, and takes a job as a taxi driver to pay for Jimmy's school. While waiting for customers, Mark gets into a fight with another cabbie for being in the wrong space. Anne, who has been unable to find Mark since he moved, spots him in his taxi and finds his new residence through his license number. Anne promises to not mention Marks \\"fall from fame\\" and has dinner with him. While dropping Anne off at her office, Mark is spotted by Larry Winston. Larry asks Anne who her taxi driver was and when she does not tell him, he comes to the correct conclusion on his own. Larry promises to Anne that he will not say anything about Mark's new career, but later breaks his promise when he delivers his news report the next afternoon. Mark hears this report on the radio and becomes infuriated. Jimmy also hears the report with his school mates and is laughed out of the room. Mark hurries to confront Anne and does not believe her when she says she didn't say anything. While there, he gets into another argument with two other cabbies. Jimmy comes to the conclusion that Mark cannot afford to keep him at URBAN, so he sneaks out of a window and returns to the Cohen's apartment for a \\"surprise visit\\". Mark is at first happy, but then becomes upset when Jimmy refuses to return school. Two rival cab drivers go to Mark's home and begin tearing up his cab. Mark goes out and gets into an all out brawl with them. Jimmy gets caught up in the middle and is hit in the head with a flying wrench, which \\"crushes\\" his skull. Anne tells Mark more or less to drive Jimmy to this hospital as quick as he can. Over time, Jimmy recovers and is later seen in the hospital talking to friends. Mark returns to racing and wins another big race, with Anne right by his side.

Research  Michele Boldrin conducts ongoing research in dynamic general equilibrium theory, focusing specifically on the sources of business fluctuations, growth and development, technological innovation, and intellectual property. Collaborating with David K. Levine, Boldrin examines the role played by competitive versus monopolistic markets in growth and innovation. They posit that little evidence exists for the presence of increasing returns at the aggregate level, and thus argue that there is no reason to believe that increasing returns play an important role in actual economic growth. This implies that, in theory as in practice, competitive markets favor and promote continued growth and innovation, whereas monopoly power is not necessary and probably harmful to technological change and economic development. Their theory concludes that existing claims for the necessity of intellectual property in the process of growth and innovation are greatly exaggerated.  Books  * Michele Boldrin and David K.

He believed that one of the most common causes of sickness and chronic disease was an unhealthy diet and lifestyle. Originally a dentist, Estes was unhealthy at the age of thirty and began a raw food diet to improve his health. He later began speaking on the topic in lectures around the country.Google Newspapers Estes also believed in breathing techniques that would achieve maximum absorption of oxygen. One of his books, Raw Food and Health, published in 1927Google Books is still popular in the Raw, Living Food community today. Early life and family life Estes was born in Missouri and died in Los Angeles County, California at age 75 years.California Death Index When interviewed for newspaper and magazine articles in the 1920s–1930s he claimed to be approximately 15 years older than records show that he actually was. Estes was the son of Louis A. and Emma Medora Estes. Estes graduated from Northwestern College of Dentistry. and originally practiced dentistry in Chicago, Illinois. His first wife was Clara Augusta Neimann Estes (1872–1936), and he had three children from this marriage—in birth order, two daughters. Clara Lucille (born c. 1909) and Phoebe Estes (born c. 1911), and a son, St. Louis Estes, Jr. (born c. 1913) Circa 1928, Estes and his second wife (marriage 1922-1923), Esther Moraine Estes (born Esther Moran in Kentucky in 1895), settled in Van Nuys, California at the adobe built Spanish style ranch hacienda located on 10 acres at the corner of Bessemer and Woodman Avenue, which formerly belonged to American actor Noah Beery, Sr. In February 1930, Clara Estes filed suit in Los Angeles County California Superior Court against Estes for $500,000 for desertion and non-support, and for the same dollar amount against \\"Esther Moran\\" for alienation of affection. Estes responded that he had obtained a divorce against Clara Estes in Mexico in 1922. The suits were eventually settled out of court. During the late 1920s through the 1930s, Estes was particularly active with health lecture tours in various cities throughout the United States, including Carnegie Hall in New York City. Mrs. Estes and whatever number of children were generally included in both the promotion and the tour program itself according to newspaper coverage of the day. In addition to his book \\"Raw Food and Health\\", Dr. and Mrs. Estes established a company called \\"Back to Nature\\", along with a magazine publication by the same name. \\"Back to Nature\\" also had a complete line of vitamins (with a photo of the Estes children on the label) and health food products. In the late 1930s, Estes and his wife moved to San Francisco, California, where their last child, St. Louis Estes VII, was born. They later returned to Southern California and were residing in Van Nuys, California, at their respective deaths. In Los Angeles, CA in March 1941 Dr. St. Louis Estes filed for Bankruptcy, listing his debts as $245,369 (including an unpaid Federal income tax bill of $104,000), and assets of $4,400 (including $600 worth of health foods). Estes and his wife had 12 children (six boys and six girls) by 1938, raising them all on a raw food diet from birth. It was decided that Estes would name the boys, which he did as \\"St. Louis Estes\\" with the suffix \\"II\\" thru \\"VII\\". Mrs. Estes named all the girls. The family employed a man by the name of \\"Prince de Vigni\\", who claimed to be the last surviving member of the royal family of Silesia, to tutor their children four hours each day.TIME magazine Death Estes slipped and fell around the large pool at the family ranch hacienda in Van Nuys, California. He fell into a coma and never recovered. According to his death certificate (Los Angeles County D/C #6879), and due to his service in the Spanish–American War, Estes died at the Veterans Administration Hospital, West Los Angeles, California, He and his wife, Esther Estes, are buried at Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City, California.

While later Gong albums in the 1970s onwards did refer to elements of the Gong mythology, they were not seen as succeeding the Radio Gnome Trilogy in the same way as 2032. The year 2032 is mentioned quite often in Daevid Allen's early Gong mythology writings. The album brings together again many of the Radio Gnome Trilogy era Gong lineup, specifically Daevid Allen, Steve Hillage, Gilli Smyth, Miquette Giraudy, Mike Howlett, and Didier Malherbe. The album describes how the heretofore invisible Planet Gong, home of the pot head pixies and octave doctors, will finally make contact with Earth in the year 2032. The album's main themes are world peace and ecology.  Recording  Recorded at A-Wave Studio in London, it was produced and mixed by Steve Hillage, with additional production by Daevid Allen at the Bananamoon Observatory in New South Wales in Australia.  Release  The album is available in CD and a limited edition double LP format. The double LP comes with an LP size booklet with lyrics, and a poster portraying the numerals 2032.

In 1921, Hordern purchased another four seaplanes, two Curtiss three-seater 'Seagull' flying boats, a ten-seater Short twin engined craft, and a Short sporting seaplane. With no expense spared, he equipped the Acielle and set out to complete the first aerial navigation of the entire Australian coastline, covering around 150 miles per day.History of Rolls Royce Chassis Number 2142 Eventually the Acielle was sold on again, and was next used as a pleasure yacht,\\"Ketch driven ashore\\", The Argus, 13 September 1929. then refitted by the Australian Iron and Steel Company for a trip to investigate iron ore deposits on the northwest coast of Australia.Kempsey Heritage Inventory  Shipwreck event  It was during this expedition, two days out from Sydney en route to Derby, Western Australia, on 11 September 1929, that the Acielle foundered in a strong southeasterly gale. Her captain, Smith, and the crew of four endeavored to reach the shelter of Trial Bay, New South Wales, but the vessel was overwhelmed by the violent seas, and ran ashore south of Smoky Cape Lighthouse. The vessel was valued at £2500 and was insured.  Wreck site and wreckage  The Kempsey Heritage Inventory states that the ship's anchor at the Heritage Hotel of Gladstone, Kempsey, is believed to have come from the Acielle. The anchor is believed to have lain under the sand but was frequently exposed by sea movement. The anchor was dragged from the sand by a member of the Jordan family who is a fisherman at Hat Head. In 1974, it was transported to Gladstone Hotel (now renamed to the Heritage Hotel) and accepted by Jim Tedd, the then publican of Gladstone Hotel. It was placed in the garden of the hotel and remains there.

New made his screen writing and directorial debut in 2013 with the short film Ticking. He co-wrote the 2014 independent film Chicken, and co-wrote and directed the 2014 independent film A Smallholding. Biography and career New was born and raised in Swindon, Wiltshire, United Kingdom, and comes from a working-class background. His father was a truck driver and his mother held various short-term jobs, and New has an older brother. According to his own account, New \\"ran away\\" from Swindon in order to attend the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London. Living in London was a major change for him: :...coming from a place where nothing was happening, Swindon, to suddenly this massive place, London, where there were huge amounts of things happening[,] I think I just ran around going, \\"Oh my God, oh my God,\\" like a kid in a toy shop. It was a big thing for me to meet people who weren't living purely a consumer experience, because in Swindon, people rightly or wrongly live a very normal life. They go to work, they buy nice things and have nice holidays and bring up their kids. Unfortunately, there's something wrong with me which means that doesn't work, and I came to London and met loads of people for whom that doesn't work, either—where money wasn't an issue, where possessions weren't an issue, a whole different code of beliefs and faiths. New financed his education by soliciting small donations from hundreds of people he knew. While at RADA, New sang in Stephen Sondheim musical play Assassins (he has a tenor singing voice), and performed in Joe Orton play The Erpingham Camp as part of his A-levels in 2005. He graduated from the school in 2006. Theatre work New has extensive theatre credits. His first professional stage credit occurred just weeks after graduation, when he appeared in the summer of 2006 as Mosby in the Elizabethan-era play Arden of Faversham at the White Bear Theatre in London. A reviewer for The Stage remarked that he played the villainous role with \\"brooding menace\\". That December, he appeared as Horst opposite theatre veteran Alan Cumming in a production of Bent, by Martin Sherman, at Trafalgar Studios in London. Susannah Clapp, reviewing the play for The Observer, said New is \\"an actor whose huge talent is unusually matched by his restraint.\\" His performance won him an Evening Standard Award nomination for the Milton Shulman Award for Outstanding Newcomer of 2006,; and a What's On Stage.com Theatregoers' Choice Award nomination for Best London Newcomer of the Year for 2006. In February 2007, New took on the role of Louis in The Reporter, a play by Nicholas Wright about the mysterious suicide of BBC journalist James Mossman in 1971. The play was produced by the Royal National Theatre at the Cottesloe Theatre in London. New starred opposite Ben Chaplin. David Benedict in Variety called New's Louis \\"nervy, charged-up but controlled\\", and said the \\"strain of the relationship's illegality creates the play's strongest sequence.\\" Philip Fisher for The British Theatre Guide had equally good things to say, noting that \\"New, who received universal plaudits for his performance opposite Alan Cumming in Bent once again shows real talent as Louis.\\" In October 2007, New played Dromio of Ephesus in William Shakespeare The Comedy of Errors. The comedy was mounted by the Royal Shakespeare Company, and New was part of the national touring cast.; The play marked New's Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) debut. When The Comedy of Errors neared the end of its tour, New took on the role of Viola in the RSC's production of William Shakespeare's Twelfth Night. The play is about a shipwrecked woman who adopts a male identity, only to discover her long-lost twin brother is also on the island. The Neil Bartlett production was a gender-bending one, in which the female roles were played by men, and the male roles by women. John Lithgow co- starred as Malvolio. Charles Spencer, writing for The Daily Telegraph, was harsh in his appraisal: \\"...in Chris New's performance, apart from an opening sequence in unconvincing drag, there is no attempt to capture Viola's femininity. He just comes over as a strangely charmless, somewhat priggish gay young man.\\" Michael Billington in The Guardian had few good things to say about the production as a whole, but highly praised New's performance: :One idea that does pay off is the casting of a young male actor, Chris New, as Viola. Since the character spends much of the play in masculine attire as Cesario, our attention is constantly drawn to Viola's preoccupation with the sinfulness of disguise and the pathos of her situation. New, clad in an Edwardian cream-coloured suit, has an especially good moment when, in response to Olivia's enquiries about his origins, he pauses guiltily before announcing: \\"I am a gentleman.\\" Caught in a gender trap of his own making, New artfully reminds us that everything Viola says about herself is in heavily inverted commas. Other reviewers found both the production and New's performance outstanding. David Benedict, writing in Variety, said Bartlett brought a \\"mature emotional intelligence...to one of Shakespeare's most-produced plays\\", and found much to praise in New's characterization of Viola. The male-playing- female-playing male conceit, he said, relieves New \\"of the distracting business of allowing auds to see how well or ill he pulls off the task of female impersonation. This allows him much more room to explore depth of emotion in both guises, something he accomplishes with truly arresting poise.\\" What's On Stage's anonymous reviewer also greatly enjoyed New's performance, noting: \\"Playing a woman who in turn plays a man, New is superbly deft and delicate, richly deserving of further accolades.\\" New subsequently starred as Simon Bliss in a July 2008 revival of Noël Coward 1924 comedy, Hay Fever at the Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester, England. Critic Mark Powell wrote in Metro News that \\"It's hard to see how this reasonably plush production could have been cast much better as Belinda Lang and Chris New...arguably grate the most joyously as the passive-aggressive mother and son...\\" Alfred Hickling in The Guardian also enjoyed New's work, noting that he played Simon Bliss \\"like [an] overgrown toddler[] in evening wear\\", while Natalie Anglesey in The Stage praised his performance as \\"exuberant\\". In December 2008, New appeared as the college student Ricardo in the Young Vic production of Colin Teevan and Paul Heritage's play Amazonia.; In October 2009, New played Joe Orton in the original London production of the dark comedy Prick Up Your Ears, by Simon Bent. The concept for the play came from New's roommate. New contacted actor and comedian Matt Lucas, who was looking to do a play. Bent agreed to script the work, and Sonia Friedman came aboard as producer and Daniel Kramer as director. On 23 and 24 April 2010 New joined a Young Vic production of the dance-play Pictures From an Exhibition (based on a musical suite by Modest Mussorgsky) at the Sadler's Wells Theatre in Islington, London. Due to the much larger stage at Sadler's Wells, the cast expanded from nine characters to 17. New joined the cast for the two days of performances at Salder's Wells. Reviewer Graham Watts noted that New blended with the original cast seamlessly, and called his performance \\"a very effective portrayal of Mussorgsky.\\" New followed up playing selfish lover Steven in Peter Nichols new play Lingua Franca at the Finborough Theatre in London in July 2010. Critic Michael Billington praised New's casting. In September 2011, New played the title role in Edward II by Christopher Marlowe at the Royal Exchange Theatre. Alfred Hickling had high praise for New's performance as Edward II, a decidedly non-sympathetic role. \\"Chris New's Edward earns pity, if not respect. His incessant vacillation is perfectly illustrated in the childish manner with which he folds his abdication papers into a crown, as if the realm of England were something that fell out of a cracker.\\" David Chadderton, writing for The British Theatre Guide, found New equally praiseworthy: \\"The production is held together by a superb pairing of Chris New as Edward and Samuel Collings as Gaveston and later as the sinister murderer Lightborn. There is never any doubt about the sexual nature of their relationship and the bond feels genuine, and, while neither character is particularly attractive, they both have great charisma.\\" Interestingly, although New has not necessarily sought out gay-themed plays or characters, Ben Walker in Attitude magazine noted in 2011 that it's this work which has attracted the most acclaim. New co-starred in a revival of Philip Ridley 1991 play The Pitchfork Disney in February 2012. The play ran at the Arcola Theatre in London.; Lyn Gardner, critiquing the play for The Guardian, called New's one of several excellent performances in the play. After an absence from the stage for nearly a year, New appeared in the Chris Dunkley play Smallholding at the Nuffield Theatre at the University of Southampton Highfield Campus. David Penrose, writing for the Portsmouth News, said that New and co-star Matti Houghton provided performances of \\"energy and great emotional weight. Both are charismatic, highly physical performers, being funny and manic.\\" The HighTide Festival Theatre production then moved to the Soho Theatre in the City of Westminster, London, in January 2014. In the summer of 2013, New directed the play The Precariat at the Finborough Theatre. New subsequently wrote the short play A New Play for the General Election in 2015. It debuted under his direction at the Finborough Theatre in April 2015 to mixed reviews.; ; ; New played the title role of Tom Wingfield in the Nottingham Playhouse production of Tennessee Williams' The Glass Menagerie in March 2016, for which he won raves from the Nottingham Post. In 2017 New and Mark Edel-Hunt played Daniel Quinn in City of Glass, adapted by Duncan Macmillan from the first novel of Paul Auster’s New York Trilogy, and the graphic novel by Paul Karasik and David Mazzucchelli. The play had its premier in March at HOME in Manchester and continued at the Lyric Theatre in London in April. A cast of four adults and a child played sixteen parts and a narrator. \\"The ensemble […] are excellent\\", writes The Arts Desk. The 59 Productions, Lyric Theatre, HOME and Karl Sydow production was nominated for the UK Theatre Awards 2017 design award. In March 2017 New performed a reading of Tibor Fischer’s Portrait of the Artist as a Foaming Deathmonger. New played the part of pilot Lars Koch in Ferdinand von Schirach’s courtroom drama Terror at the Brisbane Festival in September 2017. The Lyric Theatre production previously had its UK premier in June 2017, with a different cast.; “Chris New as Lars Koch, the pilot, is stunningly adamant and fragile”, writes Meredith McLean in the AU review. \\"Chris New plays the dignified Koch with convincing restraint\\", says Jo Litson in Limelight magazine. New returned to the Royal Shakespeare Company for the 2018 summer season. He played the Cardinal in a modern dress production of John Webster’s The Duchess of Malfi, directed by Maria Aberg, at the Swan Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon. The RSC warned its audience stating: \\"Please note The Duchess of Malfi contains violence, scenes that some people may find distressing, and a lot of blood!\\" The play opened to positive reviews.; Film work New made his cinema acting debut alongside Tom Cullen in the romantic-drama film Weekend in 2011, a film directed by Andrew Haigh. Karen Durbin, writing for The New York Times, called New one of the \\"faces to watch\\" for his outstanding performance. His performance won him a nomination as Best Newcomer at the 2011 BFI London Film Festival Awards. New was scheduled to voice the character of Gregor Samsa in the 2011 film Metamorphosis, based on the short story \\"The Metamorphosis\\", by Franz Kafka. For reasons which are unclear, the character was voiced by a different actor. (The film was finally released in 2012.) New auditioned for the role of Jesus Christ for an American network in 2012, but did not get the part. New suspects he was turned down because of his sexuality, but cautioned, \\"There could be a million reasons why you might not get a job and gay people have to be careful about blaming [homophobia], because they're reinforcing their own closet door.\\" In 2012, New and playwright Freddie Machin adapted Machin's play Chicken for the cinema. Television director Joe Stephenson and his production company, B Good Picture Company, picked up the script for filming in September 2012. New was cast alongside actor Scott Chambers and actress Yasmin Paige in the drama, which focuses on two brothers squatting on a piece of land who come into conflict with the new landowner. Scheduling conflicts forced New to drop out of the project as an actor. The film was released in 2015, and played several festivals before finding an international distributor. New made his cinema directorial debut in April 2013 with the short film Ticking, which premiered at the Nashville Film Festival. New returned to cinema in 2014, directing the micro-budget film A Smallholding. New had previously starred in the stage play of the same name by playwright Chris Dunkley. The film was produced by Man in Rum, and the budget was raised entirely on Kickstarter, a crowd-sourcing funding Web site. Principal photography on the film wrapped in early March 2014. New co-wrote the film with Dunkley, and also acted as its cinematographer, film editor, and sound editor. Personal life New is openly gay, having come out of the closet \\"professionally\\" in 2006. Worried about the impact of being known as a \\"gay actor\\" on his career, he discussed the issue with Bent co-star Alan Cumming (who has been open about his bisexuality for decades). After weighing the risks, New decided to come out as gay. New says, however, that as an individual he has never been in the closet. He told Attitude magazine: \\"To understand the psychology of not necessarily wanting your sexuality to be a major part of you but having it made a major part of you by the people around you. All people talk about with me is, 'Are you out?' And yeah, I am, I always have been and I don't see a problem with that. I've never hidden it. My first agent tried to make me hide it so I fired her.\\" New entered into a civil partnership with graphic designer David \\"Dav\\" Watson in 2011. This relationship ended in 2016. New is a friend of actor Ian McKellen, and often helps McKellen learn scripts and run lines.

It is situated in the middle of the largest forest in Moldova, Codrii Moldovei. The soil of this zone, a type of chernozem, is favorable for various kinds of plantations. Currently, the most grown cultures are common for the central zone of Moldova, some of them are grapes, corn, cherry and sour cherry trees and many more. The Botna River, which crosses the village, is a tributary of the Nistru River. The river can dry out completely during summer months. The river doesn't cause floods, due to its low depth and pollution. Ulmu is located strategically, at equal distances from Chișinău, and the Romanian border and other villages from the same district. The E581 highway is being constructed in the vicinity.  Etymology  It is believed that the name of the village is derived from a kind of tree that is specific to this region, Ulmus (from Latin Ulmus). Unfortunately this kind of tree, due to the human activity, is rare, because of its usage in peoples' households and farms.  Ulmu today  Ulmu is a village with a medium count of inhabitants. Due to the immigration, the population count have been suffered a decline. The education in Ulmu is provided by a high school and a kindergarten. The high school from this village is named after the well-known, Romanian writer, Mihai Eminescu, there is also a post office, a newly built hospital (from 2011), some stores and a culture house. As of 2010, the construction of a new auto magistrale has begun. It aims to link the neighboring villages of Văsieni, Ruseștii Noi and Ulmu itself to the European magistrale M1 directly. There are some negotiations with the government to allocate funds to pave the road. The mobile phone and 3G internet coverage is being provided by 3-4 antennas which are situated on village's key points. There is also a cable operator, which is very popular here. The buses and minibuses circulate according to an established schedule from Chisinau, it takes around 30–40 minutes to get from Ulmu to Chisinau and vice versa. Both young men and old men are privileged by the village hall. Thus, the village has many attractions for the youth, like soccer fields, libraries, playgrounds and for the old men it has a public eatery and a nursing home.

He plays acoustic and electric guitar, lap steel, dobro steel, harmonica, bass and keyboards. He was a contestant on the second The Voice UK music competition in 2013, performing Pink Floyd's \\"Wish You Were Here\\" as his blind audition.  Biography = Early life  Reynolds was born in Portsmouth, Hampshire, England. The family moved around a lot with his father's work and eventually settled when Rob was two years old in Harrogate, North Yorkshire. He attended Rossett High School. At the age of 15 he started singing blues and jazz in local venues, formed Burt Reynolds and the Boardwalkers and joined various other bands. He started learning the guitar at 16 which gave him the ability to write his own material. His father died in August 1993, and he moved to London in early 1994.  The career years  ;1990s Reynolds soon found a manager in the form of veteran, Carl Miller, who'd been Cat Stevens personal manager and started on his first project when Carl introduced him to Alvin Gibbs of punk veterans UK Subs, through Carl and Alvin, Reynolds came to the attention of then-fledgling London based Indie record company, Invisible Hands Music. Initially signed in 1995 to a development deal, IHM put Reynolds out on the road supporting Midge Ure for eight months and followed that with shows with Procol Harum, Big Joe Turner, China Crisis and Errol Brown, he recorded some early demos with a band that included drummer Chuck Sabo (Natalie Imbruglia), It Bites keyboard player John Beck, produced by Dexy's Midnight Runners bassist Nigel Ross-Scott. The debut album, Waiting for the Tide, was recorded in the summer of 1996 at Jacob's Studios in Farnham, Surrey with an all-star cast featuring drummer Darren Mooney from Primal Scream, bassist Jon Noyce from Jethro Tull, keyboard player Reg Webb of Lenny Kravitz and produced by ace guitarist Greg Bone (Seal, Sting, Take That) and sound engineer Robin Black, Wings, The Who, and Pink Floyd. The first single was a cover of the Harold Arlen and Ted Koehler jazz standard \\"Stormy Weather\\" (the only cover on Waiting for the Tide). It received the Single of the Week accolade by Jazz FM. On the release of single \\"Take It Easy\\" Reynolds continued travelling the country performing live sessions on dozens of BBC and ILR stations and was invited to launch the nation's newest terrestrial television network Channel 5 with its first afternoon show Five's Company, hosted by Nick Knowles. ;2000s A period of writing and touring followed, which resulted in the release in 2000 of a self- produced seven-track mini-album entitled Samsara Never Sleeps, recorded at Skyline Studios Epsom. The UK music monthly Mojo Magazine made Samara Never Sleeps one of their four 'Critics Choice' for the month. After a period of recording for a label in Germany, which included sessions with the Munich Symphony Orchestra and some 5.1 Surround mixes, Rob returned to London in the autumn of 2002 and recorded his third album, Sightseeing. Sightseeing saw Rob hit his peak as a singer, writer and producer, bringing together his rocking live band and a host of top guest's including, guitarist Steve Harris (Gary Numan), keyboard player Richard Cottle (Seal), and percussionist Miles Bould (Sting). The first single, \\"Sweet Mother\\", hit the airwaves in July, staying on the BBC Radio 2 playlist for five weeks; and Radio 2 invited Rob to perform two tracks live to a massive radio audience as part of their Great British Music Debate. Regional radio racked up over 40 playlists including PBS106.7FM. In Europe the single was A listed by the Netherlands and Belgium's equivalent of Radio 1. 2004 saw Reynolds begin the year with a tour of radio stations around the country. 31 March 2004 heralded the start of a tour with Hazel O'Connor, taking him around the UK and The Netherlands. In February 2005 Reynolds played on the 'Best of British' stage at MIDEM in Cannes, France, in June Rob dueted on Hazel O'Connor's Hidden Heart (2005) album. Reynolds then twice toured Canada, performing showcases at Canada Music Week on the first tour and in the second tour playing at NXNE. Later in the year 2005 he then played two sets at the Glastonbury Festival and won the Baltic Song Contest for England in Malmö, Sweden. During the year 2005 Reynolds also opened for other acts including: Paul Carrack, Amos Lee and Arthur Lee and Love. In 2006 Reynolds released his fourth album, a compilation of his work to date entitled The Curious World, drawn from his three studio albums. He then returned to Canada in 2007 to play NXNE, and tour with Hugh Cornwell from The Stranglers which would take him from Toronto to Montreal. Reynolds then went straight to Winnipeg to embark on his fifth album Coming Home, with Multi Juno award- winning producer Brandon Friesen. In 2008 Reynolds's long time friend and producer Tom Jackson in Switzerland, asks him to co-write the melodies and lyrics for a German band called Rauschhardt. They recorded the songs in Hanover and Berlin and the album is to be released in 2010, with guitarist Tom Rauschhardt, bass player Jäcki Reznicek, drummer Sebastian Reznicek and keyboard player Christoph von Haniel. In 2009 Reynolds completed the album Coming Home. He also made guest appearances on two songs with dance producer Boyan, and a duet with 1970s psycho/prog rockers Wally on their first album in 30 years. He played over 200 shows, including a French music festival in August 2009, Rochefort Accords, where he performed with Piers Faccini and B.J. Cole, vibraphone player Roger Beaujolais and Rob Arnos on sax.

Development The replica E-III was designed to give aircraft homebuilders the opportunity to construct a replica fighter and was intended to appeal to the pilot who is also a history buff. The aircraft fits into the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles category and has a standard empty weight of when equipped with the standard Rotax 503 engine. Optionally a half Volkswagen air-cooled engine can be used, putting the aircraft in the US Experimental - Amateur- built category. The fuselage is constructed from pre-welded 4130 steel tube, along with aluminum tubing that is bolted and riveted together. The wing is conventional aluminum construction, wire braced from a short kingpost and the whole aircraft is covered with aircraft fabric. Unlike the original E-III, which utilized wing-warping, the replica has ailerons. The landing gear is bungee suspended. The engine cowling consists of a spun aluminum nose bowl with a sheet metal wrap-around. The kits are supplied complete including paint and fabric, except for the engine, propeller and instruments. Of note, the kit does not include a replica machine gun. The factory estimates that an average builder can complete the aircraft kit in 300 hours. The company claims that the aircraft kit can be assembled using \\"normal hand tools consisting of hacksaw, hand drill, file, pop rivet gun, wrenches, and hand nico press tool.

This value is used primarily to describe imaging detectors in optical imaging and medical radiography. In medical radiography, the DQE describes how effectively an x-ray imaging system can produce an image with a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) relative to an ideal detector. It is sometimes viewed to be a surrogate measure of the radiation dose efficiency of a detector since the required radiation exposure to a patient (and therefore the biological risk from that radiation exposure) decreases as the DQE is increased for the same image SNR and exposure conditions. The DQE is also an important consideration for CCDs, especially those used for low-level imaging in light and electron microscopy, because it affects the SNR of the images. It is also similar to the noise factor used to describe some electronic devices. The concept has been extended to chemical sensors,S. Manghani and J.J. Ramsden, The efficiency of chemical detectors, J Biol Phys Chem 3:11-17, 2003 in which case the alternative term detectivityR.C. Jones, Detectivity: The reciprocal of noise equivalent input of radiation, Nature (London) 170:937-938, 1952 is more appropriate.  History  Starting in the 1940s, there was much scientific interest in classifying the signal and noise performance of various optical detectors such as television cameras and photoconductive devices. It was shown, for example, that image quality is limited by the number of quanta used to produce an image. The quantum efficiency of a detector is a primary metric of performance because it describes the fraction of incident quanta that interact and therefore affected image quality. However, other physical processes may also degrade image quality, and in 1946, Albert RoseA. Rose, A unified approach to the performance of photographic film, television pick-up tubes, and the human eye, J Soc Motion Pict Telev Eng 47:273-294, 1946 proposed the concept of a useful quantum efficiency or equivalent quantum efficiency to describe the performance of those systems, which we now call the detective quantum efficiency. Early reviews of the importance and application of the DQE were given by ZweigH.J. Zweig, Performance criteria for photo-detectors -- concepts in evolution, Photogr Sci Engng 8:305-311, 1964 and Jones.R.C. Jones, Scientific American 219:110, 1968 The DQE was introduced to the medical- imaging community by ShawR. Shaw, The equivalent quantum efficiency of the photographic process, J Photogr Sci 11:199-204, 1963J.C. Dainty and R. Shaw, Image Science, Academic Press, New York, 1974 for the description of x-ray film-screen systems. He showed how image quality with these systems (in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio) could be expressed in terms of the noise- equivalent quanta (NEQ). The NEQ describes the minimum number of x-ray quanta required to produce a specified SNR. Thus, the NEQ is a measure of image quality and, in a very fundamental sense, describes how many x-ray quanta an image is worth. It also has an important physical meaning as it describes how well a low-contrast structure can be detected in a uniform noise-limited image by the ideal observer which is an indication of what can be visualized by a human observer under specified conditions.H.H. Barrett, J. Yao, J.P. Rolland and K.J. Myers, Model observers for assessment of image quality, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 90:9758-9765, 1993Medical Imaging -- The Assessment of Image Quality, Int Comm Rad Units and Meas, ICRU Report 54, 1995 If we also know how many x-ray quanta were used to produce the image (the number of x-ray quanta incident on a detector), q, we know the cost of the image in terms of a number of x-ray quanta. The DQE is the ratio of what an image is worth to what it cost in terms of numbers of Poisson-distributed quanta: : \\\\mathrm{DQE} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{NEQ}}{q} . In this sense the DQE describes how effectively an imaging system captures the information content available in an x-ray image relative to an ideal detector. This is critically important in x-ray medical imaging as it tells us that radiation exposures to patients can only be kept as low as possible if the DQE is made as close to unity as possible. For this reason, the DQE is widely accepted in regulatory, commercial, scientific and medical communities as a fundamental measure of detector performance. Definition The DQE is generally expressed in terms of Fourier-based spatial frequencies as:I.A. Cunningham, Applied linear-systems theory, in Handbook of Medical Imaging: Vol 1, physics and psychophysics, Ed J. Beutel, H.L. Kundel and R. Van Metter, SPIE Press, 2000 : \\\\mathrm{DQE}(u) = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{NEQ}(u)}{q} = \\\\frac{q G^2 \\\\mathrm{T^2}(u)}{\\\\mathrm{W}(u)} where u is the spatial frequency variable in cycles per millimeter, q is the density of incident x-ray quanta in quanta per square millimeter, G is the system gain relating q to the output signal for a linear and offset-corrected detector, T(u) is the system modulation transfer function, and W(u) is the image Wiener noise power spectrum corresponding to q. As this is a Fourier-based method of analysis, it is valid only for linear and shift-invariant imaging systems (analogous to linear and time-invariant system theory but replacing time invariance with spatial-shift invariance) involving wide-sense stationary or wide-sense cyclostationary noise processes. The DQE can often be modelled theoretically for particular imaging systems using cascaded linear-systems theory.I.A. Cunningham and R. Shaw, Signal-to-noise optimization of medical imaging systems, J Opt Soc Am A 16:621-632, 1999 The DQE is often expressed in alternate forms that are equivalent if care is used to interpret terms correctly. For example, the squared-SNR of an incident Poisson distribution of q quanta per square millimeter is given by : \\\\mathrm{SNR}_{in}^2(u) = q and that of an image corresponding to this input is given by : \\\\mathrm{SNR}_{out}^2(u) = \\\\frac{q^2 G^2 \\\\mathrm{T}^2(u)}{\\\\mathrm{W}(u)} resulting in the popularized interpretation of the DQE being equal to the ratio of the squared output SNR to the squared input SNR: : \\\\mathrm{DQE}(u) = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{SNR}_{out}^2(u)}{\\\\mathrm{SNR}_{in}^2(u)}. This relationship is only true when the input is a uniform Poisson distribution of image quanta and signal and noise are defined correctly.  Measuring the DQE  A report by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC 62220-1)Characteristics of digital x-ray imaging devices - Part 1: Determination of the detective quantum efficiency, International Electrotechnical Commission Report IEC 62220-1, 2003 was developed in an effort to standardize methods and algorithms required to measure the DQE of digital x-ray imaging systems.  Advantages of high DQE  It's the combination of very low noise and superior contrast performance that allows some digital x-ray systems to offer such significant improvements in the detectability of low-contrast objects - a quality that is best quantified by a single parameter, the DQE. As one medical physics expert recently reported, The DQE has become the de facto benchmark in the comparison of existing and emerging x-ray detector technologies. DQE especially affects one's ability to view small, low-contrast objects. In fact, in many imaging situations, it's more important to detecting small objects than is limiting spatial resolution (LSR) - the parameter traditionally used to determine how small an object one can visualize. Even if a digital system has very high LSR, it can't take advantage of the resolution if it has low DQE, which prevents the detection of very small objects. A study comparing film/screen and digital imaging demonstrates that a digital system with high DQE can improve one's ability to detect small, low-contrast objects – even though the digital system may have substantially lower Limiting Spatial Resolution (LSR) than film. Reducing radiation dose is another potential advantage of digital x-ray technology; and high DQE should make significant contributions to this equation. Compared with film/screen imaging, a digital detector with high DQE has the potential to deliver significant object-detectability improvements at an equivalent dose, or to permit object detectability comparable to film's at reduced dose. Equally important, high DQE provides the requisite foundation for advanced digital applications - dual-energy imaging, tomosynthesis, and low-dose fluoro, for instance. Combined with advanced image-processing algorithms and fast acquisition and readout capability, high DQE is key to making such applications as these clinically practical in the years to come.

It was called to resolve the differences between the Patriarch of Antioch and the Maphrian of the East over their ecclesiastical jurisdiction in Mesopotamia and Persia. It aimed to regulate mutual relations and to resolve some difficulties that were frequently arising between two centers. Canons The assembly codified eight canons preserved in Bar Hebraeus' 13th-century nomocanon, the Kthobo d-Hudoye (Book of Guides): 1\\\\. The bishops and the monks in the Mar Mathai's Monastery, should submit to and obey the Maphrian whose seat is in Tigris 2\\\\. The Patriarch should not interfere in the administration of the Church in Tigris, unless when invited. In the same way the maphrian should not interfere in the Patriarchal See 3\\\\. When the Maphrian is present along with the Patriarch of Antioch he should be seated immediately at the right hand side of the Patriarch. The name of the Maphrian shall be mentioned immediately after that of the Patriarch, in the liturgy; and he should receive the Holy Qurbana after the Patriarch 4\\\\. When a Maphrian is alive, a Patriarch should not be installed without his concurrence, otherwise, the orientals shall have the right to install the Maphrian by themselves. The question of who should perform the laying on of hands on the new Patriarch - i.e., the Maphrian or the President of the Synod, shall be decided by four bishops, two each elected by the orientals and the westerners (Antiochan) respectively 5\\\\. The Archdiocese of Kurdu, Beth-Sabdaya and also Najran, provided, the Arabs agree to it, shall vest with Tigris administration 6\\\\. The mutual excommunications between the orientals and the Antiochans shall be withdrawn 7\\\\. A final decision was taken about the three bishops consecrated by the Patriarch in the see of the Maphrian 8\\\\. A bishop excommunicated by the Maphrian shall also be considered as excommunicated by the Patriarch Maphrian The word Maphrian is a transliteration of the Greek καθολικός (katholikos), meaning concerning the whole, universal or general. It was a title that existed in the Roman Empire where Government representative who was in charge of a large area was called ‘Catholicos’. The Churches later started to use this term for their Chief Bishops. ‘Maphriyono’ (Maphrian) is derived from the Syriac word 'afri', “to make fruitful’, or \\"one who gives fecundity\\". This title be used exclusively for the head of the Syriac Orthodox Church in the East. From the mid 13th century onwards, a few occupants of the Maphrianate were referred also as ‘Catholicos’, but the title never came into extensive usage. According to one of the most famous Maphriyans, Mar Gregorios Bar Ebraya (Bar Hebraeus), Apostle Thomas is the first in the Apostolic succession of the East. Bar Ebraya did not believe that the Eastern Church was an integral part of the Antiochian Church, due to the historical context of the time in which he lived. He did, however, vigorously defend his rights, as dictated by the church canons.

The title relates to the real Prince of Homburg at the Battle of Fehrbellin in 1675, Friedrich von Hessen-Homburg (1633–1708), but beyond the name and place there is little if any resemblance between the Romantic character in the play and the eponymous Friedrich, a successful professional soldier of many years' standing. The play has been filmed a number of times, and inspired the opera Der Prinz von Homburg by Hans Werner Henze (premiere 1960). Plot Action takes place at Fehrbellin and in Berlin, 1675. The Prince of Homburg, a young officer of the Great Elector (Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg), is exhausted after a long campaign. Walking in his sleep, he puts on a laurel wreath. Several noblemen notice this, and the Great Elector plays a trick on the Prince, which leads him to declare his love for the Elector's niece, Natalie. He is able to take one of her gloves. After waking from his dream the Prince is puzzled by the glove in his hand. When at the next council of war the plans for the next battle are being discussed, and duties are being handed out, the Prince is thrown into confusion by the appearance of Princess Natalie, who reveals herself as the owner of the glove, and he is distracted to the extent that he fails to take on board his orders, which are not to engage the enemy without a direct order to do so. Contrary to his instructions he attacks the enemy at the Battle of Fehrbellin – and wins. The Elector however is concerned above all with discipline. Regardless of the victory, he has the Prince arrested for disobeying an order and tried at a court martial, where the Prince is condemned to death. He fails initially to grasp the seriousness of the situation, and starts to be truly concerned only when he hears that the Elector has signed his death warrant. The reality of his situation only hits home when he is shown the grave that has been dug for him. In the famous and controversial \\"fear of death scene\\" (Todesfurchtszene) the Prince begs for his life, prepared to give up all that is dear to him in return. When the Elector hears of the Prince's reaction, he too is confused, possibly astonished, but claims to have the greatest respect for the Prince's feeling. Instead of simply pardoning him, however, he sets a condition: if the Prince can genuinely call his condemnation unjust, he will be pardoned. The question raises the Prince to a state of enlightenment: he conquers his fear of death and is prepared to \\"glorify\\" the sentence by a suicide. It remains debatable whether he really considers his sentence justified. Nor does it ever come to light to what extent the Elector may have planned all this to teach him a lesson. Meanwhile, Natalie, without a legitimate order, has recalled Kottwitz's regiment to obtain support for Homburg's pardon. In the face of the general pressure now put on him, the Elector now listens to his officers. Kottwitz is of the opinion that what counts on the field of battle is victory, and that there is nothing with which to reproach the Prince. Hohenzollern goes further and attributes the guilt to the Elector, as he caused the Prince's confusion and consequent insubordination by the trick he played on him, and therefore bears the responsibility himself. Finally the Elector asks the officers if they are happy to continue to trust themselves to the Prince's leadership – to which all say yes. The Prince learns nothing of his pardon, but is led blindfolded into the open air, in the belief that he is about to be executed. But there is no bullet: instead, the niece of the Elector crowns him with a laurel wreath. To his question whether this is a dream, Kottwitz replies, \\"A dream, what else\\" (\\"Ein Traum, was sonst\\"). The Prince faints. Characters * Friedrich Wilhelm, Kurfürst von Brandenburg * The Kurfürstin * Prinzessin Natalie von Oranien, his niece * Feldmarschall Dörfling, commander of a dragoon regiment * Prinz Friedrich Arthur von Homburg, general of the cavalry * Obrist Kottwitz, colonel of the regiment of the Prinzessin von Oranien * Hennings, infantry colonel * Graf Truchß, infantry colonel * Graf Hohenzollern, of the Elector's entourage * Rittmeister von der Golz and others Historical background In his Mémoires pour servir à l'histoire de la maison de Brandenbourg, Frederick the Great describes how Prince Friedrich of Hessen-Homburg in the Battle of Fehrbellin engaged in a self-willed and precipitate attack on the enemy – and won the battle. This seems to be an anecdote unfounded in historical fact, but Kleist made use of it as a source anyway and developed the subject matter freely. Particularly, Kleist changed the prince's action \\"without express orders\\" into action \\" against express orders\\". At the time when Kleist was writing the play, there were a number of topical instances of insubordination which could have provided the inspiration behind it: The weakness and passivity of the Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm III towards Napoleon's constant expansion of his power, was a great problem for many of his subjects and contemporaries. In the face of the threat presented by the French to the country's very existence a wave of Prussian patriotism arose, to which Kleist himself was not immune. The young Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia attacked the enemy without authorisation in 1806 in the Battle of Saalfeld. His attack was unsuccessful, and resulted in a defeat; the prince himself died in the battle. Nevertheless, many people praised his courage and his personal engagement for the fatherland, and he became posthumously a popular national hero. In 1809 under the command of Major Ferdinand von Schill many unsanctioned military actions against the French oppressors were carried out by the Prussian Freikorps. Schill found many followers and supporters among those who felt betrayed by the king's negligible resistance. Reception Relief showing the Prince of Homburg on the Heinrich von Kleist monument of 1910 in Frankfurt an der Oder The play was not published or produced during Kleist's lifetime. The author dedicated his work to Princess Marianne of Hesse-Homburg, the protagonist's great granddaughter and wife of Prince William of Prussia. The princess felt her family honour insulted by the play and blocked its productions. In a shortened version under the title Die Schlacht von Fehrbellin it had its premiere in Vienna in 1821, but after only four performances was taken off when Archduke Karl objected to it. In 1828 it was performed for the first time in Berlin, again in a shortened form, but after three performances the King banned it. This, Kleist's last play, met with resistance not only from his contemporaries. The fear of death scene was long held to be unperformable and was always omitted. Equally criticised were the prince's sleep-walking and the trick played by the Elector. This was because although these were things that were acceptable in comedy, they offended the rules governing the portrayed behaviour of the aristocratic figures of tragedy. This was a convention that really only disappeared shortly before the First World War, when it did become possible to portray an aristocrat as a figure of comedy, for example Baron Ochs in Hugo von Hofmannsthal's Der Rosenkavalier. Heinrich Heine praised the work as \\"as though written by the genius of poetry itself\\".„gleichsam vom Genius der Poesie selbst geschrieben“ For de la Motte Fouqué it was \\"the most divine poem ever to proceed from the pen of Kleist\\".„das göttlichste Gedicht, das je aus Kleists Feder hervorgegangen“ Friedrich Hebbel however commented that through the representation of the fear of death, an enlightenment of the protagonist was achieved that in other works could only be produced by death itself.Hebbel, Friedrich. Sämtliche Werke. Berlin, 1901. Vol. xi. P. 334, 3. Otto von Bismarck simply thought that the prince was a \\"weak reed – with his fear of death\\". It was a very popular piece however during the Third Reich, generally with a number of significant amendments to tailor it to contemporary circumstances. This resulted in its almost total neglect in the period after World War II and it returned only slowly to the German stage. Adaptations=Stage translations The play's popularity outside Germany may be traced to the famous 1951 Avignon production by Jean Vilar, with Gérard Philipe as the prince and Jeanne Moreau as Natalie. Incidental music for the production was commissioned from Maurice Jarre (his first score). The following year, the play was revived by Philipe and Jean Le Poulain at the Théâtre des Champs- Élysées. This version does not follow Kleist's original in some particulars. In the final scene, when a blindfold is removed, the prince finds himself in a church about to be married with Natalie. In 1976 the play was chosen to open the theatre in the Royal Exchange in Manchester. It was translated by Jonathan Griffin and directed by Caspar Wrede with Tom Courtney in the title role. In 2002, Neil Bartlett adapted and directed a co-production of the play performed in the Swan Theatre of the Royal Shakespeare Company's and at the Lyric Theatre Hammersmith. The Elector was played by James Laurenson, the Prince by Dan Fredenburgh and Count Heinrich by Will Keen. In 2009, Marie-José Malis toured, with a French-language version created with the help of Alain Badiou, explicitly asking whether there were any other possibility than the death of the Prince, and making discussion on the topic part of the experience of the play. The day before the staging in Arles, on May 14, 2009, she held a public discussion in the theatre, asking the public whether they had any suggestions as to how the play should end, as she herself was still undecided as to how to end the play. This fostering of discussion was itself an important element of the re-staging of the play. In the event, on that first night in Arles at least, the Prince and Natalia and a soldier friendly to their cause shoot their way out of the place in which the Prince is to be executed.http://www.lechangeur.org/IMG/pdf/LeMondeMalis.pdfhttp://blogs.rue89.com/balagan/2009/03/17/marie- jose-malis-met-le-prince-de-hombourg-sur-ecoute-93709 The Prince of Homburg, an English stage adaptation by Dennis Kelly, was premiered at the Donmar Warehouse from 22 July to 4 September 2010, with the Elector played by Ian McDiarmid. This adaptation altered the ending so that the Prince met with the Elector to accept the death sentence and to ask as his last wish that the Elector continue the war with Sweden rather than make peace. The Elector honours this dying wish of the Prince, though once the Prince has gone he tells his generals that he will only continue it three days and then make peace after all – he feels that the Prince almost lost him victory once by his impetuosity and will not lose it again at the Prince's request. Natalia scatters flowers where the Prince is to be shot, which he finds just before he is then shot, alone. The Elector then makes a speech exhorting his people to continue the war, but meets with hostile silence. This change of ending was criticised by drama critics, including Michael Billington of The Guardian In the Soviet Union, Kleist's play was disparaged as a \\"celebration of the Prussian military\\".

Other media Hans Werner Henze based on it his opera Der Prinz von Homburg, in three acts, first performed in Hamburg in 1960. It has also been filmed a number of times for cinema and television, most recently in two Italian versions: Il principe di Homburg, directed by Gabriele Lavia (1983) and Il principe di Homburg, directed by Marco Bellocchio (1997).

It was the first by-election gain by the Liberal Party from the ruling Conservatives in the Parliament of 1900–1906 and it can arguably be said to have set in motion the swing to the Liberals from the Tories which brought twenty by-election gains in all over the following months, leading to the Liberals landslide victory in the 1906 general election. Vacancy The election was triggered by the resignation of the sitting Conservative Member of Parliament (MP), James Kenyon. Candidates The Conservatives and their Liberal Unionist Party allies already had a candidate in the field, as Kenyon had made known his intention to stand down because of ill-health.The Times, 9 May 1902 p7 They had chosen Harry Lawson, the former Liberal MP.The Times, 14 April 1902 p10 Toulmin The Liberals re-selected their candidate from the 1900 general election George Toulmin, a Lancashire newspaper proprietor.The Times, 19 April 1902 p7 It was reported that at a meeting of socialists at Bury on 28 April 1902 it was agreed to support a socialist candidate at the forthcoming election, if one were nominated.The Times, 29 April 1902 p7 There were splits in the socialist camp however. The Independent Labour Party decided to dissociate itself from the decision of the Social Democratic Federation to bring forward a candidate The Times, 1 May 1902 p10 and chose to support Toulmin.The Times, 7 May 1902 p10 The Labour Representation Committee in Bury held a meeting to decide their position but declined in the end to stand a candidate. The traditional Lib-Lab alignment seemed to be holding in Bury with the trade unions in the cotton industry coming out strongly for Toulmin.David Howell, British workers and the Independent Labour Party, 1888–1906; Manchester University Press, 1983 p63 Issues=Irish Home Rule A principal issue in the election was the question of Irish Home Rule. This was the issue which had split the Liberal Party in 1886 and the constituency of Bury was typical of many at the time. The sitting Liberal MP, Sir Henry James had defected to the Liberals Unionists in opposition to Home Rule and he retained his seat unopposed at the 1886 general election. With Conservative support Bury had been held for the Unionist cause at each election since. When the by-election was called one of the first acts recorded was a public vote of support for Toulmin by the Irish Nationalist electors of the town, on the basis that they had received from him a satisfactory declaration of his sympathy with the cause of Home Rule. They urged all Irish voters in the constituency to vote for Toulmin to prevent the election of Lawson, who they described as a renegade on Home Rule and a coercionist.The Times, 5 May 1902 p12 A meeting of Roman Catholic voters in the town was held on 4 May 1902 to discuss the election but no resolutions of support for either candidate were passed. Levy on corn Taxation and the policy of Free Trade once more became central election issues at Bury.Peter Clarke, Lancashire and the New Liberalism; Cambridge University Press, 1971 p275 The Conservative government had introduced a duty on corn as a revenue measure to help meet the cost of the Boer War. The Liberal leader, Henry Campbell-Bannerman wrote to Toulmin deploring the government's proposed introduction of a duty on corn, claiming this would lead to the poorest in the community having to pay more for their bread or suffering some deterioration in the quality of their loaf and stating that this measure was the first step in the government's plan to reverse the country's traditional Free Trade approach. The Conservatives said most of any extra burden would fall on businessmen at home or abroad and what Lawson described in a speech as the 'middlemen' adding that the British consumer would have to pay only one extra penny on every 32 loaves.The Times, 6 May 1902 p8 The Times newspaper identified the one shilling corn duty as \\"the real horse [the candidates] are riding on\\". Education and the Boer War Other issues included the Education Bill. Toulmin apparently held strong views against the legislation Stephen Koss, Nonconformity in modern British politics; Batsford, 1975 pp 55–56 although as Bury had no school board as set up by the Elementary Education Act 1870, it was not thought to have such great resonance as elsewhere. The Boer War was also the subject of debate between the candidates. Joseph Chamberlain the great Liberal Unionist Secretary of State for the Colonies urged the electors of Bury not to support a party willing to surrender to the Boers.The Times, 7 May 1920 p10 The voters of Bury were probably as patriotic as any other men but the spiralling cost of the war was a real issue for them. First the government had raised income tax and now the corn levy was thought to herald a bread tax and it was this perception which fostered support for the Liberals rather than the pro-war Unionists.H V Emy, Liberals radicals and social politics, 1892–1914; Cambridge University Press, 1973 p129 Result The result was a Liberal gain from the Conservatives The Times, 12 May 1902 p6 perhaps against the odds. The Times, taking the temperature of local opinion in the constituency, had predicted a Unionist hold by a majority of around 500 votes. The corn tax issue seems to have been more of true vote winner for the Liberals than even political correspondents anticipated as Toulmin took the seat with a majority of 414 – a swing of 9% G R Searle, A New England? Peace and War,1886–1918; Oxford University Press, 2004 p297 and he continued to hold it at the next three general elections. The corn duty continued to play well for the Liberals at forthcoming by-elections in predominantly working class constituencies.Neal Blewett, The Peers, The Parties and The People: The General Elections of 1910; University of Toronto Press, 1972 p28 Government hopes that its unpopularity would soon fade were misplaced. The Conservative MP for Oldham, Winston Churchill conceded to Prime Minister Arthur Balfour six months after the Bury result that the corn tax remained 'very unpopular'.Clarke, Lancashire and the New Liberalism; p275 References Category:1902 elections in the United Kingdom Category:1902 in England Category:1900s in Lancashire Category:Elections in the Metropolitan Borough of Bury Category:By-elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom in Greater Manchester constituencies Category:By-elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom in Lancashire constituencies ","title":"1902 Bury by-election"},{"id":"24577471","text":"The Auburn Botanic Gardens are a botanical garden located in Auburn (a suburb of Sydney), New South Wales, Australia. It was established in 1977 and covers an area of . There are two lakes, a waterfall and bridges. Duck River winds through the garden. The garden is maintained by Cumberland Council. It is open daily, and there is a small entry fee on weekends. The Japanese gardens, which have hosted couples from overseas, are one of the main attractions. The Auburn Botanic Gardens attract thousands of visitors each year, including a significant number from outside Australia, who come to enjoy the surrounds of the gardens, which provide a variety of flora and fauna. The topography of the site, which slopes gently towards the Duck River, has been altered to create different perspectives and microclimates. Three habitats are intended to provide an experience of 'Australia' in the city – the woodlands theatre, the native garden and billabong, and the Australian rainforest. The gardens were opened by New South Wales governor Sir Roden Cutler on 11 September 1977. History Prior to construction, the area was mined for clay tile production early in the 1900s. The area was then used as a waste landfill site. These soils were eventually excavated to create the hills and lakes that now lie in the gardens. The gardens were designed by Eric Black, chief engineer of Auburn Municipal Council from 1949 to 1979. Community groups have added a bonsai garden and an aviary to the basic plan. The native fauna reserve, set up in consultation with Taronga Zoo, is a later addition by the council's parks and gardens department. The gardens owe their origin to the County of Cumberland planning scheme (1946–1951) which set aside the area along the banks of the Duck River for recreation. Both before and after the scheme, the council dumped rubbish and sewage along the banks and in brick and tile clay-pits for many years. In July 1968, Black presented a detailed report to the council on proposing a mixture of sporting grounds and intensive cultivation of the Duck River parklands. Black envisaged a series of gardens representing national styles from around the world. This vision was later reduced, though some elements survived, including the Japanese gardens and lake, the formal gardens and reflection pool, and the different Australian habitats. Construction work on the Botanic Gardens site began in 1969 and involved the excavation of the Japanese Gardens Lake. In 1973, hundreds of trees were planted in the Avenue of Remembrance, Garden of Trees and Woodland area. The next crucial step was when the Whitlam Government (1972–1975) pioneered federal government recognition of local government through direct funding. Through the regional development program, Auburn Council received funding in 1974 and 1975–76 to develop the gardens. Environment=Flora environmental make up of the gardens. The gardens have matured since their opening, to the extent that some areas have had to be replanted after maturing trees and plants came to the end of their life cycles. The New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Branch of the Department of Environment and Climate Change has identified the gardens as part of the recovery plan for certain environments and species, including Cooks River clay plain scrub forest, Acacia pubescens (downy wattle) and Wahlenbergia multicaulis (Tadgell's bluebell). Other plant species in the garden include pine, cherry blossom and azalea, which are present in the Japanese Garden. Species such as Frangipani, Lavender and Sage are found in the Scented Garden. Floribunda, grandiflora, petunias, garden roses and David Austin Roses are present in the Rose Gardens. The Garden's woodland area has a thick canopy of foliage with tremendous amount of vegetation that would produce damp littered leaves and a moldy floor. A remnant of Cumberland Plain Woodland, the woodland's structural form is an open-forest to low woodland with a shrub by understory. Fauna Opened in 1994, the Fauna Reserve contains wallabies, kangaroos, emus, rufous bettong and the common wombat. The Reserve is a built structure which allows the public to walk through and view native animals within their own environment. The aviary was officially opened on 5 December 1988 and it contains Australian and Asian bird species. Migrating birds also frequently visit the Botanic Gardens. Outside of the fauna reserve, animals such as peacocks, swans and other native birds wander around the garden freely.

History A Dark 'N' Stormy, Gosling Brothers' trademarked cocktail In early 1806,http://www.goslingsrum.com/discover_ourhistory.asp James Gosling set out from England with £10,000 in merchandise bound for America. The ship's charter had expired on the ninety-first day of the voyage, so they set in at the nearest port, Bermuda. However, instead of going on to America, Gosling set up shop on the island later that year. In 1824, the company rented their iconic store on Front Street that they have maintained for 127 years. The Goslings started formulating rum blends in 1860, and in three years, they had developed Old Rum, a dark, full-bodied rum. Originally distributed only in barrels and sold to those bringing their own bottles, the rum became more widely available with the introduction of bottling in Champagne bottles, the most widely available at the time. The bottles were salvaged from the British Officers' Mess and were sealed with black sealing wax. Soon, people were asking for more of the 'black seal' rum, prompting the change to the name Black Seal Rum.

The airport today is closed, but appears to be well-maintained. Now it is used as a sport complex and contains facilities for, among others football, rugby, running, and basketball. History Frejus Airport was built before World War I as a grass naval airfield. The airfield opened on 28 March 1912 with the first official test flight of a Canard Voisin. It continued to be used for test flights. For the tests a new unit was established called the CEPA (Commission d'Etudes Pratiques d'Aéronautique or the Commission for the Practical Study of Aviation). The CEPA's mascotte was the head of a Sioux in the shape of a question mark. In its long history of naval aviation, the raid by Roland Garros on 23 September 1913 between Frejus and Bizerte is noteworthy. During World War I the number of Navy (French: Aeronavale) aircraft grew from about thirty to over a thousand. After the armistice of the Great War, many flight test centers were closed, but Fréjus remained open. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s Fréjus played a major role in testing new aircraft for the aéronavale. The first expansion of the center occurred in 1923, and by 1924 the airfield consisted of 9 hangars and a starting track for land-based aircraft. The CEPA participated in the first French aircraft carrier trials in the 1920s. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s multiple land-, sea-, and carrier aircraft types were tested. The second expansion was begun in 1931, growing to 156 hectares, the size it would remain until dissolution in 1995. The bases most memorable hangar (Caquot) was built in 1935 After the Battle of France in May and June 1940, Frejus was part of Italian-occupied France, and airport operations were suspended. However, the Italian Royal Air Force (Regia Aeronautica Italiana) did not use the airfield. On 15 August 1944, United States Army parachute units, which included the 4th, 5th and 6th parachute battalions and 1st Indian Army Pathfinders, dropped into southern France between Frejus and Cannes as part of Operation Dragoon. Their objective was to capture the area, destroy all enemy positions, and hold the ground until the United States Seventh Army came ashore. Frejus Airport was seized from the Italian and German forces in the area and came under American control. Twelfth Air Force combat engineers arrived at the airport with the amphibious forces and laid out a 6000' sod runway, aligned east-west (08/26), making the airport operational for combat aircraft by 26 August. It was designated as Advanced Landing Ground \\"Y-12 St. Raphael/Frejus\\".IX Engineering Command ETO Airfields General Construction Information The 79th Fighter Group flew P-47 Thunderbolt combat operations from the airfield against the retreating German and Italian forces from Frejus until mid-October 1944.Maurer, Maurer. Air Force Combat Units of World War II. Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History, 1983. . Once the combat unit moved out, Frejus became a transport airfield, supporting C-47 Skytrain resupply and also casualty evacuation flights, until being returned to French control on 20 November 1944.Johnson, David C. (1988), U.S. Army Air Forces Continental Airfields (ETO), D-Day to V-E Day; Research Division, USAF Historical Research Center, Maxwell AFB, Alabama. After the war, an asphalt runway was laid down north-south and the airport operated under ICAO code LFTU until 1999. The runway and taxiway appear to be in very good condition, but are marked with large X's to indicate the closure of the air field. No evidence of wartime use remains.

It is not known when Ruaidhri became chief, so it is not certain if an annals entry of 1248 refers to him. It states \\"The entire of Conmaicne Mara was plundered by the English. The English went upon an expedition against O'Flaherty, who defeated them, and killed numbers of them.\\" An entry of 1256 - \\"Mac William Burke set out on a predatory expedition against Rory O'Flaherty; he plundered Gno-More and Gno-Beg, and took possession of all Lough Oirbsion (Lough Corrib)\\" - leaves no doubt that by then he ruled the area. It is not known when he ceased to be chief. The annals for 1273 state that \\"Roderic O'Flaherty was banished from West Connaught\\", but not by whom, or under what circumstances. James Hardiman says of him: > he found, by experience, that it was safer to rely on the battle-axes of his > bold Galloglas (Gallowglass) than on appeals to the sovereign against Anglo- > Norman outrage in Ireland. In his time the Joyces, a family of British > extraction, settled in the northern part of the territory, by the permission > and under the protection of the O'Flaherties. These years also marked the final eradication of any authority the Ó Flaithbheartaigh had over their original homeland of Uí Briúin Seóla. The rest of their history as an independent people would be as rulers of Iar Connacht, or as it is now known, Connemara. Hardiman goes on to say: > Before the close of the thirteenth century, the O'Flaherties became masters > of the entire territory of Iar-Connacht, extending from the western banks of > Lough Orbsen, to the shores of the Atlantic. Separated from the rest of the > kingdom, in that peninsulated, and then almost inaccessible district, they > interfered but little in the external transactions of the province, and are, > therefore, but seldom noted in our Annals for the two succeeding centuries.

She was known for delicately detailed paintings that captured flowers, plants, and birds in their natural settings. Although she began as an oil painter, she later gained a reputation as an expert in watercolor painting. She was the only woman among a group of seven artists in the early years of the American Watercolor Society. Some of her work was published as illustrations in books and magazines and on greeting cards. Early life Calla Lilly, , Brooklyn Museum of ArtFidelia Bridges, May one of a series of twelve color print illustrations, 1876, collection of the Boston Public Library. Fidelia Bridges was born in Salem, Massachusetts, to Henry Gardiner Bridges (1789-1849), a sea captain, and Eliza (Chadwick) Bridges (1791-1850). She was orphaned at the age of fifteen when her mother and father died within months of each other. In 1849, Henry Bridges fell ill and was taken to Portuguese Macau, where he died in December. Eliza died in March 1850, just three hours before the news of her husband's death arrived in Salem.A Forgotten Master Artist, Fidelia Bridges. Salem Patch. Retrieved March 16, 2014. The couple left four children, Eliza, Elizabeth, Fidelia, and Henry. They were living at 100 Essex Street, now known as the Fidelia Bridges Guest House, but moved to a more affordable home on the same street after their parents' death. Fidelia's older sister Eliza was a schoolteacher and became the guardian of her younger siblings. Fidelia took up drawing during her convalescence from an illness. She became a friend of the artist and art school owner Anne Whitney. After she regained her health, Fidelia became a live-in mother's helper in the household of William Augustus Brown, a Quaker who had been a Salem ship-holder before moving to Brooklyn, New York, where he became a successful wholesale produce merchant.Dearinger, David B (2004). Paintings and Sculpture in the Collection of the National Academy of Design. Hudson Hills Press. . The Bridges moved to Brooklyn, too, and in 1854 Eliza established a school there. Eliza died in 1856 of tuberculosis, and Fidelia and her older sister Elizabeth then ran the school. Early career and education Bridges, however, soon abandoned teaching in order to concentrate on her drawing lessons. In 1860, after being inspired by her friend Anne Whitney, she enrolled at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia with William Trost Richards and became very close to his family. By 1862, she had her own studio in downtown Philadelphia. Having remained friends with the Richards family, she accompanied them to Lake George and Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania and New Jersey on sketching trips. He was a Pre- Raphaelite advocate and her style was greatly influenced by him. Richards said of her work that it was \\"the unaffected expression of a great joy in the beauty of nature— a joy which is after all the fountain of all that is finest in art; and one could not see the rich treasures of Miss Bridge's portfolios of studies without feeling this.\\"William Farrand Felch; George C. Atwell; H. Phelps Arms. The Connecticut Magazine. Connecticut Magazine Company; 1900. p. 583–588. Through Richards, Bridges met museum curators and patrons of the arts, several of whom became collectors of her paintings. She exhibited her works at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. In 1865, Bridges left Philadelphia and established a studio on the top floor of the Browns' house in Brooklyn, where Anne Whitney also worked and lived with her companion Adeline Manning, a painter from Boston. Career and studies in Rome After the American Civil War she studied for a year in Rome and lived and traveled with Adeline Manning and Anne Whitney. She maintained her style of intricate botanical works in oil. Bridges returned to the United States in the fall of 1868. Her works were then exhibited at the National Academy of Design. In 1871, watercolor was a respected medium and she quickly gained popularity with her watercolor depictions of flowers and birds. Her pictures, however, were not mere photographic reproductions of what she saw; with the imagination of the true artist, she infused her subjects with a deep poetic meaning. Bridges \\"combined the temper of romanticism with the technique of a scientist,\\" according to Frederick Sharf's biography of her.Carol Kort and Liz Sonneborn. A to Z of American Women in the Visual Arts. New York: Facts on File, 2002. pp. 32-33. . Fidelia Bridges, September, illustration of Twelve Months series, published by Prang, 1876Fidelia Bridges, A Garden in Bloom, watercolor and gouache, 1897Fidelia Bridges, Irises Along the River, before 1923 Bridges was considered a specialist in her field and focused on the beauty and serenity of microscopic details in nature. One of her favored sites was Stratford, Connecticut, where she enjoyed the wildflowers and other subject matter in the area's flats and meadows. The birds found in the green salt grass lined banks of the Housatonic River were also of interest. She made some of her best paintings of the scenes from her summer visits from 1871 to 1888 with Oliver Ingraham Lay and his family. Paintings such as Daisies and Clover and Thrush in Wild Flowers are examples of her works during this period. She lived in Stratford, Connecticut by 1890 when she ministered to the ailing Lay who died that year.David Bernard Dearinger. Paintings and Sculpture in the Collection of the National Academy of Design: 1826-1925. Hudson Hills; 2004. . p. 351. She was elected as a National Academy of Design associate in 1873 and one year later became the only woman of seven artists in the American Society of Painters in Watercolor (now The American Watercolor Society). She exhibited her work sporadically from 1863 until 1908. In 1876, she exhibited three paintings at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition. That year, many of her paintings were reproduced and sold by publisher and lithographer Louis Prang. St. Nicholas Magazine and the August 1876 edition of Scribner's Monthly contained her illustrations. She illustrated John Burrough's Bird and Birds published by Scribner's Monthly by 1877.\\"Scribner's Monthly for 1877-1878: Out-of-Door Papers\\" Denton Journal. December 8, 1877. p. 1. This success eventually led to a job as a designer for Prang's firm. For this job Bridges designed Christmas cards and she kept the job until 1899. Bridges visited England between 1879 and 1880. During that time she visited her brother Henry, who worked there as a tea-taster and traveled to China in the commission of his work. Her works, which reflected an Oriental aesthetic with plain background and asymmetrical compositions, were exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts. Some of her compositions are similar to that of the Flower and Bird series of Japanese woodblock print artist, Hiroshige.Katherine E. Manthorne. The Voice of Nature. Newington-Cropsey Cultural Studies Center. Retrieved March 17, 2014. After her extended visit to England, Bridges returned to the Browns home, where she continued to work and live much of the time. She spent a year working as a governess to Mark Twain's three daughters starting in 1883; Twain was also a collector of her work. In collaboration with the illustrator and book editor Susie Barstow Skelding, she created several books of poetry with her bird illustrations, including Winged Flower Lovers, and Songsters of the Branches during the 1880s.\\"Books and Authors: A Review of the Literary Field. Brief Notes about New Books.\\" The Atlanta Journal- Constitution. October 23, 1887. p. 5. Her illustrations of birds were published in an 1888 book of poems, What the Poets Sing of Them and the book Favorite Birds. Bridges exhibited her work at the Palace of Fine Arts at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. Personal life Fidelia Bridges, Bridges never married, but had good friends and relationships throughout her life. She moved to Canaan, Connecticut in 1892 and lived in a cottage on a hill, overlooking a stream and with a beautiful flower garden that attracted birds and became the subject of many paintings. She led a quiet lifestyle, and occasionally traveled to Europe and New York. She continued to exhibit her works, including the American Society of Painters, Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and the National Academy of Design. Along with artist Howard Pyle, Bridges became a sustaining member of the American Forestry Association, which was founded to protect forests in the United States following \\"an eloquent plea\\" from President Theodore Roosevelt.\\"Forestry Society Grows: Many New Adherents to the Cause of Woodlands.\\" The Washington Post. April 16, 1907. p. 15. Bridges died following a stroke just a few days before turning eighty-nine, on May 14, 1923 in Canaan, Connecticut.

He specialized in portraying comprimario roles and was admired for his comic timing. He has appeared on several Live from the Metropolitan Opera broadcasts and Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts. Early life and education Born in Jersey City, New Jersey to Harry and Ella Sliker, Sliker started studying music at a young age and began singing on local radio programs at the age of 7. After graduating from Henry Snyder High School, he enlisted in the United States Navy in 1942. He spent the majority of World War II serving in the Mumansk Run in the Northern part of the Atlantic Ocean. After the war, he took a job as a purser for the United States Lines shipping company; notably serving on the SS United States when it captured the trans- Atlantic speed record on 4 July 1952. In 1948 he married Myra Warren whom he later divorced. While working for the United States Line, Sliker pursued university studies; first at Rutgers University and then Harvard University where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a bachelor's degree in languages in 1950. He concurrently studied music at the New England Conservatory where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in vocal performance in 1951.newenglandconservatory.edu He then lived in Cuba for a year to study languages further, by this time already having mastered six languages. Singing career In 1958 Sliker made his debut at Carnegie Hall in a sold out concert of Bach chamber music where he performed cantata Tritt auf die Glaubensbahn, BWV 152 under the baton of Václav Nelhýbel. He returned to the recital hall at that concert house for his New York City recital debut on March 7, 1959 where he performed a program of Bach, Joseph Haydn, and Johann Rosenmüller works. The New York Times music critic John Briggs wrote of his performance: > \\"Mr. Sliker revealed a resonant voice of good range and power, well in focus > most of the time, smoothly and expressively handled, and with sufficient > agility to negotiate the florid passages of the baroque music he performed. > He made it evident that he is a performer with imagination, who understood > quite well what the music on his program was about, and showed considerable > skill in communicating it to his audience.\\" In 1959 Sliker joined the roster of singers at the New York City Opera where he appeared in a number of comprimario roles through 1961. He notably portrayed one of the Seven Deadly Sins in the world premiere of Hugo Weisgall's Six Characters in Search of an Author on April 26, 1959 and sang in the 1959 production and cast recording of Douglas Moore's The Ballad of Baby Doe with Beverly Sills in the title role.

It is located along the Cuyahoga River in Northeast Ohio on the western edge of the county. The population was 28,904 in the 2010 Census and was estimated at 29,646 in 2019. The city is counted as part of the Akron Metropolitan Statistical Area and the larger Cleveland–Akron–Canton Combined Statistical Area. Part of the Connecticut Western Reserve, Kent was settled in 1805 and was known for many years as Franklin Mills. Settlers were attracted to the area due to its location along the Cuyahoga River as a place for water- powered mills. Later development came in the 1830s and 1840s as a result of the settlement's position along the route of the Pennsylvania and Ohio Canal. Leading up to the American Civil War, Franklin Mills was noted for its activity in the Underground Railroad. With the decline of the canal and the emergence of the railroad, the town became the home of the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad maintenance shops through the influence of Marvin Kent. In 1864 the town was renamed Kent in honor of and in gratitude for Marvin Kent's efforts. It was incorporated as a village in 1867 and became a city after the 1920 Census. Today Kent is a college town best known as the home of the main campus of Kent State University, founded in 1910, and as the site of the 1970 Kent State shootings. Historically a manufacturing center, education is the city's largest economic sector with Kent State University being the city's, and one of the region's, largest employers. The Kent City School District and the Kent Free Library provide additional education opportunities and resources. Many of Kent's demographic elements are influenced by the presence of the university, particularly the median age, median income, and those living below the poverty level. The city is governed by a council-manager system with a city manager, a nine-member city council, and a mayor. Kent has nearly 20 parks and preserves and hosts a number of annual festivals including ones related to Earth Day, folk music, and the U.S. Independence Day. In addition to the Kent State athletic teams, the city also hosts a number of amateur and local sporting events at various times during the year. Kent is part of the Cleveland-Akron media market and is the city of license for three local radio stations and three television stations and includes the regional affiliates for National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). Local transportation infrastructure includes a public bus service and hike-and-bike trails. As the home of the Davey Tree Expert Company, Kent is known as \\"The Tree City\\" while residents are referred to as \\"Kentites\\". The city has produced a number of notable individuals, particularly in politics, athletics, and the entertainment industry. History The region was originally inhabited by various tribes of American Indians, including the early Mound Builders. Around 1780, Captain Samuel Brady achieved notoriety for his activities in the area, including his famous leap of over the Cuyahoga River to avoid capture by an unknown band of American Indians. The site, known as Brady's Leap, is now a city park. This book gives 1790 as the date, but several other sources give 1780 as the date. Settlement by Europeans began in the late 1790s and early 19th century. As part of the Connecticut Western Reserve, the area was divided into survey townships in 1798 and almost all of what is now Kent was originally part of Town 3 Range 9, which would eventually be known as Franklin Township.Brown and Norris, p. 431; \\"The present territory of Franklin, Town 3 Range 9...\\" See also :File:Portage County 1826.jpg Aaron Olmsted, a wealthy Connecticut merchant, had purchased the township and named it for his son Aaron Franklin Olmsted. Comes from page 24 of the Combination Atlas Map of Portage County by L. H. Everts, published in 1874, which is included as part of the 1978 Atlas. Franklin Township was surveyed in 1803 and settled in November 1805 when John Haymaker and his family moved west from Warren to the banks of the Cuyahoga River. They were joined by John's brother George and their father Jacob Haymaker and their families early the next year, and built a gristmill in 1807. Initial growth in the area was slow, but eventually two small villages would develop due to the potential for power generated by the Cuyahoga River that could be used in gristmills and manufacturing. The first village, known as Franklin Mills, or locally as the \\"Lower Village\\", developed mostly around the original Haymaker property. In 1818, Joshua Woodard arrived in the area and began constructing buildings just north of the village forming the \\"Upper Village\\" that would come to be known briefly as Carthage.Brown and Norris, p. 435 \\"...the twin settlements were known respectively as \\"Upper Village\\" and \\"Lower Village.\\" The name Carthage was afterward applied to the Upper Village.\\" Former P & O Canal lock and dam downtown In the 1820s, Franklin Mills was included in the route of the Pennsylvania and Ohio Canal (P & O Canal). When construction began on the canal in the mid-1830s, land speculation was rampant in many areas of northeast Ohio along the canal, including Franklin Mills. As a result, an industrial and business region was established along the east side of the river in what is now downtown Kent. Factories and mills were either planned or constructed along the Cuyahoga River, some of which either were never built or ultimately failed, due mostly to effects of the Panic of 1837. A lock and attached arch dam, however, was completed in 1836.Grismer, pp. 19–25. The canal officially opened in 1840, but would only operate into the 1860s. By the 1870s the canal was completely shut down. In the era leading up to the American Civil War, Franklin Mills was an active stop on the Underground Railroad, giving fugitive slaves shelter on their escape to Canada. There were three notable stops in Franklin Mills, one of which still stands as of 2010. During this period, from 1835 to 1839, noted American abolitionist John Brown moved to the village, operating a tannery along the Cuyahoga River with Zenas Kent. In 1863 the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad was constructed through Franklin Mills, due largely to the efforts of local businessman Marvin Kent, son of Zenas Kent. Marvin Kent had started his own railroad company, the Franklin and Warren Railroad, in 1851 after Franklin Mills, already home to several Kent family ventures and properties, was bypassed by the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad that same year. Kent was also successful in getting the village named as the location of the railroad's maintenance yards and shops in 1864. The geographic location along the railroad and being home to the shops reinvented and revitalized the village as an important stop on the east-west line between St. Louis and New York City. The shops would open in 1865 and the railroad would play an important part of Kent's industry and development through the early 20th century before the shops were completely shut down in 1930. To honor Marvin Kent, the village was renamed Kent in 1864, although this change was not official until the village was incorporated on May 6, 1867.Grismer, pp. 29, 37, 124, 125. John Davey came to Kent in 1881 as head grounds keeper at Standing Rock Cemetery, and planted several trees, landscaped the cemetery, and performed experiments on trees. In 1901, he published his theories on tree surgery with his book The Tree Doctor, and later established the Davey Tree Expert Company in 1909. The efforts of Davey and the presence of Davey Tree led to the establishment of \\"The Tree City\\" as a nickname for Kent, which is reflected in the city's seal.Grismer, p. 233. The company continues to be headquartered in Kent and serves as the city's largest private employer. Lowry Hall, one of the original campus buildings of Kent State UniversityAfter a fire destroyed the Seneca Chain Company in 1909, one of the city's main industries at the time, city leaders created the Kent Board of Trade in 1910, a forerunner to the Chamber of Commerce. The new Board was successful later that year in having Kent selected out of twenty northeastern Ohio cities as the site of a new teacher training college, which became known as the \\"Kent State Normal School\\". The twenty cities were: Ashtabula, Canton, Chagrin Falls, Columbiana, East Liverpool, Geneva, Hubbard, Hudson, Kent, Lorain, Massillon, Medina, Poland, Ravenna, Salem, Seville, Urichsville, Wadsworth, Warren, and Youngstown. The site for the school was on of land donated by William S. Kent, son of Marvin Kent, on what was then the eastern edge of town. By 1929 the school was renamed Kent State College after the establishment of a college of liberal arts and degrees in the arts and sciences and in 1935 was renamed Kent State University after it was given authorization to grant advanced graduate degrees. The bill giving Kent State university status was signed into law by Ohio governor and Kent native Martin L. Davey, son of tree surgeon John Davey.Hildebrand, Keller, and Herington, p. 20. During the 1950s and 1960s the growth of Kent State University combined with the effects of suburbanization resulted in significant population growth for the city, rising from just over 12,000 residents at the 1950 census to over 28,000 by 1970. Black squirrels were brought to the campus from Canada in 1961 by Kent State University head groundskeeper Larry Woodell. The squirrels have become an icon for both KSU and the city and are often used as unofficial mascots and symbols. See also: \\"Black Squirrel Sightings\\" (April 29, 2010). In early May 1970, protests began on the campus of Kent State University over the United States' invasion of Cambodia in the Vietnam War. These protests and demonstrations, which included rioting in downtown Kent on May 2, culminated in the Kent State shootings on May 4, 1970, where four students were killed and nine were wounded by the Ohio Army National Guard.Hildebrand, Keller, and Herington, pp. 165–166. Several memorials have been placed at the site over the years and commemorations have been held annually since 1971. In 2010 the entire site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Also during the late 1960s and into the 1970s, construction of Haymaker Parkway, completed in 1975, brought changes to the city's layout while eliminating ongoing problems with traffic congestion and blocked rail crossings. In 1995, Kent received national attention when the city's water was named \\"Best Tasting Municipality Water\\" at the Berkeley Springs International Water Tasting. The water and mayor Kathleen Chandler were featured on the March 3 episode of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Since then, Kent has placed in the top five a total of six times with the most recent being a fifth-place finish in 2011. See also: Kent City Water Scores Big Again (March 27, 2011). In 2003, the 1836 arch dam was bypassed to meet water quality standards set by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. To preserve the historic dam, a small park was built behind the dam and the river was rerouted through the old canal lock. During warm-weather months, water is pumped over the dam. The park, known as Heritage Park, was formally dedicated in May 2005. Redevelopment Downtown developments completed or under construction in March 2013 Beginning in 2008, several redevelopment projects in the downtown area, some of which had been discussed for decades, were put into motion and resulted in nearly $110 million in total investment from public and private sources. The first of these was the Phoenix Project, a development privately financed by Kent resident Ron Burbick that renovated and expanded a section of commercial space along East Main Street. Included in the project was construction of a pedestrian alleyway lined with small shops, eventually known as Acorn Alley, which opened in 2009. A second phase of Acorn Alley opened in late 2011. Other aspects of the redevelopment, which include a 360-space parking deck and bus transfer station, a hotel and conference center, and three separate mixed-use buildings, began to take shape in 2010 following the demolition of several buildings in a four block area. New offices for Ametek and the Davey Tree Expert Company opened in late 2012 along with several new small businesses on the first floors of each building.

The hotel, operated by Kent State University, opened in June 2013 and the new parking garage, operated by the Portage Area Regional Transportation Authority (PARTA) opened April 30, 2013, as the Kent Central Gateway. In addition to parking, the facility functions as PARTA's main bus transfer station and has storefronts on the ground level facing East Erie Street. Included in the redevelopment was the purchase and renovation of the old Kent hotel, which first opened in 1920. After being mostly vacant since 1979 and completely vacant since 2000, it re-opened on April 1, 2013, as the new home to the Kent location of Buffalo Wild Wings and also houses offices, a wine and jazz bar, and apartments. A five-story mixed-use building called The Landmark was completed in 2014 and construction started in November 2015 on an additional five-story mixed-use building featuring microapartments, scheduled to be completed in 2016. The developments attracted the attention of The Plain Dealer and The New York Times and earned the city and university the 2013 Larry Abernathy Award from the International Town–Gown Association in recognition of the positive town–gown cooperation and collaboration. KSU College of Architecture and Environmental Design building, completed in 2016 Additional development has been ongoing on the campus of Kent State University and the largely residential neighborhood located between downtown Kent and the western edge of campus. The university began buying properties in that neighborhood in 2007 and by December 2012 had acquired 43. Construction of the University Esplanade extension, designed to link campus with downtown, started in August 2012 after several of the buildings in the area, most of which had been rental homes, were demolished or moved. The Esplanade extension continued a segment of the Portage Hike and Bike Trail that extends to Dix Stadium and was completed in October 2013. Kent State constructed a $48 million, facility for the College of Architecture and Environmental Design along the Esplanade extension and also relocated the former home of May Prentice, the first female faculty member at Kent State, to the extension as the home for the Wick Poetry Center. Construction on the architecture building started in October 2014 and was completed in August 2016. In total, there are plans totaling approximately $150 million for several other facilities and upgrades across campus, including a new building for the College of Applied Engineering, Sustainability and Technology and a renovation and reorganization of the facilities for the School of Art. The city and county have also seen developments in the same area. A new county municipal courthouse on East Main Street was completed in April 2014, and in 2015, Kent City Council approved the sale of the city hall complex to a private developer for construction of a five-story apartment building on the site, which opened in August 2016. Geography Kent is located in west-central Portage County in Northeast Ohio approximately northeast of Akron and southeast of Cleveland.Grismer, p. 202, for population years 1870–1930. It is bordered by Franklin Township on the north and east, Brimfield Township on the south, and Stow on the west. Other nearby communities include Brady Lake and Ravenna to the east and Sugar Bush Knolls and Streetsboro to the north. It is included in the Akron Metropolitan Statistical Area and the larger Cleveland–Akron–Canton Combined Statistical Area. Located on the western end of the Glaciated Allegheny Plateau, the topography of Kent includes rolling hills and varied terrain. The Cuyahoga River passes through the city, cutting a gorge with a drop of nearly adjacent to the downtown area. The United States Geological Survey lists the city's elevation at above sea level at a point near Kent's geographic center. Elevations vary slightly within the city limits with several buildings on the Kent State University campus at altitudes in excess of and points as high as . According to the United States Census Bureau, as of 2010 the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Climate The four main seasons in Kent: from top left clockwise, winter, spring, summer, and fall Kent's climate is classified as a humid continental climate in the Dfa Köppen climate classification meaning it typically has very warm, humid summers and cold, snowy winters with moderate and variable spring and autumn seasons. The record high temperature is , set on July 7, 1988, with the record low of recorded January 17, 1982. During the spring and summer months, thunderstorms are fairly common and the area is susceptible to tornadoes, though the last recorded tornado in Kent occurred in 1973.Darrow, p. 17. Effects from tropical systems can also be felt, usually taking the form of increased humidity, rain, and wind, such as with the remnants of Hurricane Ike in September 2008. During the winter months, snowfall is common and can occur in large quantities with considerable cloud cover. Kent is not considered part of the Lake Erie snowbelt, though lake-effect snow does occur at times. The city is in what is referred to as the \\"secondary snowbelt\\", meaning it will receive heavier snowfall totals from lake-effect snow when certain wind directions are more prevalent, but typically sees far less snowfall than areas to the north closer to Lake Erie. While temperatures below the freezing point are typical in the winter months, thaw periods where temperatures exceed and even are not uncommon in January and February. Demographics As a college town, Kent's demographic and population statistics are greatly affected by the presence and growth of Kent State University. As a result, several statistics are noticeably higher or lower than state and national averages including median age and the percentage of residents in the 18–24 age bracket, individuals below the poverty line, and percentage of residents with a college degree. Initial population growth in Kent was influenced by the location on the Cuyahoga River which led to the development of industrial and manufacturing jobs.Grismer, pp. 11, 25. Early settlers mainly came from the northeastern United States and were largely of German descent.Brown, R. C., and Norris, J. E., pp. 658–716. After the arrival of the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad in 1863, growth was steady into the early 20th century with the village battling Ravenna for the position of Portage County's largest city.Grismer, p. 46.Hildebrand, p. 2. By the 1930 Census, Kent had passed Ravenna as the county's most populous city with even larger population growth in the 1950s and 1960s rising from 12,148 in 1950 to 28,183 by 1970. As of 2010, Kent remains the county's largest city. Most recent population measurements of the city have shown the effect of changes in the city's overall population coinciding with changes in the number of students living on campus as well as a reduction in the number of persons per housing unit.Locke, pp. 27–28. As of the 2010 Census, there were 28,904 people living in the city for a population density of 3,150.5 people per square mile (1,216.4/km2). There were 11,174 housing units at an average density of 1,218.0 per square mile (470.3/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 83.1% White, 9.6% African American, 3.7% Asian, 0.2% Native American, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 0.5% from other races, and 2.9% from two or more races. 2.2% of the population is Hispanic or Latino of any race. Though slightly below the national averages for diversity, Kent is very close to the averages for Ohio and above the averages for the surrounding area. Between the 2000 and 2010 censuses, the city saw slight increases in the number of minority residents. The 2015 estimate placed the population at 29,810. There were 10,288 households in 2010, out of which 20.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 27.5% were married couples living together, 12.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 56.3% were non-families. 33.4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 8.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size in Kent was 2.2 and the average family size was 2.86, which compares with the national average of 2.58 for a household and 3.14 for a family and the state average household size of 2.44 and average family size of 3.01. Includes date from United States, Ohio, and Kent. In the city the population was spread out, with 29.4% ages 19 years and under, 44.1% from 20 to 39, 15.9% from 40 to 59, 8.0% from 60 to 79, and 2.5% who were 80 years of age or older. The median age was 22.7 years, which was well below both the median age for Ohio (38.8) and the United States (35.3). The city's population was 46.3% male and 53.7% female. The rate differs slightly from the national average of 49.2% male and 50.8% female and the state average of 48.8% male and 51.2% female. It contrasts with neighboring Franklin Township, which has a population that is 51.3% male and 48.7% female.Compared statistics from the United States, Ohio, Portage County, Franklin Township, and Kent. The mean income for a household in the city was $46,848, well below the mean household incomes for Ohio ($61,397) and the United States ($70,116) in the 2010 Census. The median household income in Kent was $28,958, compared to $46,563 for Ohio and $51,222 for the U.S. For families, the mean income in Kent was $71,817 with a median income of $59,936, both of which were closer to the state ($73,084 mean, $58,566 median) and national ($81,568 mean, $62,112 median) averages. Males had a median income of $35,316 versus $35,255 for females. The per capita income for workers in the city was $18,339. 10.4% of families and 29.3% of the population were below the poverty line, including 21.1% of those under age 18 and 6.6% of those age 65 or over. While the number of individuals below the poverty line is significantly higher than both the state and national averages, with 14.8% of individuals in Ohio and 14.4% in the United States being below the poverty line, the percentage of families below the poverty line is slightly below the state (10.5%) and national (10.8%) averages. Measures of high poverty rates in similar college towns, however, is not uncommon across the U.S. Educationally, Kent is above the national, state, and local averages for residents who have attained a bachelor's, master's, or above a master's degree. At the 2010 Census, 41.9% of Kent's population above the age of 25 had obtained a college degree compared to 24.9% of the same population in Portage County, 24.1% statewide, and 27.9% nationally. Economy Corporate headquarters of the Davey Tree Expert Company, Kent's largest private employer Kent's location along the Cuyahoga River and later the Pennsylvania and Ohio Canal and multiple railroad lines made it attractive initially for the establishment of small gristmills for the production of flour and various factories. Progressively larger factories later developed due to increased power available from the river and eventually due to the ease and lower cost of transportation of goods to other markets. During the latter half of the 19th century and into the early 20th century, the city's largest employers were all industrially based, including the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad and its successors, which operated its main maintenance shops in the village; the Seneca Chain Company; and bus manufacturer Twin Coach among others.Grismer, pp. 168–185. A disastrous fire at the Seneca Chain Company in 1909 led to the creation of the Kent Board of Trade—an early Chamber of Commerce—which was successful in getting Kent selected in 1910 as the site of what would become Kent State University.Hildebrand, pp. 2–10. Changes in the structure of the railroad and declines in the manufacturing sector during the mid-20th century combined with the rapid growth of Kent State University following World War II led to the university becoming the city's largest employer and influenced the development of other areas of the city's economy. Beginning in the late first decade of the 21st century, the university, along with the city and private investors, began to play a more active role in the redevelopment of downtown Kent and has aided in the development of local high tech companies. Kent State operates Centennial Research Park, along Ohio State Route 59 in Kent's Joint Economic Development District with Franklin Township, which houses two high tech start-up companies in the liquid crystal industry. Kent has an additional Joint Economic Development District with Brimfield Township. Through the Kent Regional Business Alliance, the city also supports two business incubators. Kent State University, Kent's largest employer As of 2010, the educational, health, and social services fields were the city's largest sector, and employed over 33.5% of well as Robinson Memorial Hospital, which operates an outpatient surgery center and general medical facility.\\"City of Kent, Ohio Principal Employers\\". City of Kent, Ohio Department of Budget and Finance. 2009. 16.3% of the workforce is employed in arts, entertainment, and food service, with 12.2% employed in retail. Manufacturing accounts for 7.1% of the workforce with a Land O' Lakes plant being the largest employer in the sector. Smithers-Oasis, a floristry developer and manufacturer, was founded in Kent in 1954 and operates a plant in the city, with plans to return corporate offices to Kent by September 2013. Kent is also home to the corporate headquarters of the Davey Tree Expert Company, which serves as the city's largest private employer. In 2010 Davey Tree announced plans to relocate staff from its Davey Resource Group, who were previously in neighboring Stow, to Kent as part of a planned downtown development and has stated long-term goals include having all corporate offices in Kent. The office, which included some office staff already in Kent at the main corporate headquarters, opened in August 2012. 75.1% of those employed commuted alone to work by way of a car, truck, or van with another 7.1% carpooling. 10.6% of workers walked to work with 1.9% using public transportation. The average commute time was 22 minutes. 13.0% of the workforce was unemployed in 2010, above the 9.8% for the state and 9.0% nationally. the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated the unemployment rate in Kent at 7.9% in 2010 and 6.6% in October 2011. Culture 2010 Kent Heritage Festival along South Water Street Cultural elements in Kent include various arts, environmental, and entertainment events during the year, as well as the Kent State University Museum. The Kent Heritage Festival is held every July in the downtown area, coinciding with the U.S. Independence Day. The festival includes crafts, booths, entertainment, train rides, 5K and 10K races, and fireworks, drawing approximately 25,000 people each year. In October, Kent hosts the homecoming festivities for Kent State University, including a parade down East Main Street as well as other events and activities both on campus and around the city. Also in October, the downtown area hosts an annual, yet unofficial, Halloween celebration, which usually takes place the last Saturday of October. The event typically draws thousands, largely Kent State students, and includes many who dress in costume. In 2007 Main Street Kent, a local organization that promotes downtown Kent, created a family-oriented Halloween event downtown that precedes the unofficial celebration. Retrieved from Internet Archive January 25, 2014. Since 2007, Kent has hosted an annual environmental festival known as \\"Who's Your Mama?\\" which takes place in conjunction with Earth Day. The festival has events at various locations in the city, such as a vegan chef competition, concerts, a film festival, guest speakers, and booths on environment-based topics. Through Main Street Kent, additional events downtown include an ice cream social event in August, an outdoor concert series and \\"sidewalk cinema\\" between May and September, an art and wine festival in June, a cider festival in November, and the Festival of Lights Christmas celebration in early December. Kent Potterfest, a festival celebrating the book and movie series Harry Potter, debuted in late July 2016 and is held annually in the downtown area. It features Harry Potter-themed vendors and activities, a 5k run through the campus of Kent State University, a costume contest, and the transformation of Acorn Alley into Diagon Alley. From May to October, the Haymaker Farmers' Market operates every Saturday morning in the downtown area adjacent to and under the Greer Bridge of Haymaker Parkway. The location is marked by a commissioned mural completed in October 2012 on the two bridge supports that line each side of the market's area. The market was established in 1992 and includes over 40 vendors, making it one of the oldest and largest farmers' markets in Northeast Ohio. An indoor Winter Market, established in 2008, is held Saturday mornings from November through April. Arrival of Santa Claus by train as part of the annual Festival of Lights in December The Kent Stage, located downtown, is a performance venue for a variety of arts performances in music and theater. It hosts around 90 concerts, four theatrical performances, and four film festivals or movie premiers per year, including local, national, and international performers. Since opening in 2002, it has been visited by approximately 120,000 patrons from all over Ohio, 38 U.S. states, and 3 countries. In April, it hosts events related to the \\"Who's Your Mama?\\" Earth Day festival and in June, it is one of the host venues for the Kent Folk Festival, an annual event in folk music since the late 1960s. The festival includes multiple folk music acts at venues throughout the city over a period of several days. The Kent Stage also hosts the Kent Blues Festival and a local artist music festival known as the Up From The River Music Festival. Kent is also home to the Kent State University Museum, located in Rockwell Hall on the KSU campus. The museum focuses on the history of fashion design and decorative arts in the United States and around the world from the 18th century to the present. Each year in early May, the university hosts an annual commemoration of the Kent State shootings, which typically features several speakers, forums, artwork, and other related events. On campus, Kent State operates the May 4 Visitors' Center, which covers the shootings and the events surrounding them. It is housed in Taylor Hall on the site added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2010 and includes three galleries covering art and media from the era of the 1960s leading up to the shootings, images from the actual event, and the local and national impact after the shootings. The center opened to the public October 20, 2012, during the Kent State Homecoming weekend. The site was named a National Historic Landmark in December 2016. The John Davey House, a listing on the National Register of Historic Places In addition to the Kent State Shootings Site near the center of campus, there are also a number of additional sites and districts in Kent on the National Register of Historic Places, some of which are open to the public. The Kent Industrial District is a historical district along the Cuyahoga River adjacent to downtown that includes an area and structures that were important in Kent's early history. On the northwestern part of the Kent State University campus is the Ohio State Normal College At Kent district, which includes the school's five original classic revival buildings dating to 1913. There is also the West Main Street District just west of downtown that includes 20 private homes of architectural and historical significance from the post-Civil War and early 20th century periods. The district includes the Kent Masonic Center, which was originally built in the early 1880s as the home of Marvin Kent and his family, and the former residence of Martin L. Davey, who served as Governor of Ohio. Buildings in Kent listed on the register include three private homes noted for their architecture styles: the John Davey House for the Second Empire style, and both the Aaron Ferrey and Charles Kent Houses as examples of Gothic Revival. Other buildings include the 1869 Kent Jail, now used by the Parks and Recreation Department, and the 1837 Franklin Township Hall, the site of eventual U.S. President James A. Garfield's first nomination for public office in 1859. As part of its renovation and redevelopment, the former Franklin Hotel, first opened in 1920, was added to the NRHP in 2013 for its local historical significance and its connections to notable people. Sports KSU men's basketball game at the Memorial Athletic and Convocation Center As the home of Kent State University, Kent is also the home of the university's athletic teams, the Golden Flashes, who compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) at the Division I level as a member of the Mid- American Conference East Division. Several of Kent State's teams have enjoyed league and national success, the most notable being the men's basketball team's run to the Elite Eight in the 2002 NCAA Tournament and the baseball team's appearance in the 2012 College World Series. The 6,327-seat Memorial Athletic and Convocation Center, commonly referred to as the MAC Center, is the site of a number of athletic events in multiple sports, including wrestling, women's gymnastics, and women's volleyball in addition to men's and women's basketball. It is also a regular site for the Mid-American Conference's wrestling and women's gymnastics championships. In addition to hosting the KSU football team, Kent State's 25,319-seat Dix Stadium has been a venue for high school football games both in the regular-season and the state playoffs. The adjacent Murphy-Mellis Field is a location for Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) field hockey tournament games and the Diamond at Dix is a regular venue for OHSAA regional softball tournament games. From 1975 to 1981 the Cleveland Browns held their training camp in Kent at Kent State University. The Kent State University Ice Arena serves as host to several local ice hockey programs including youth leagues, high school and professional teams, and as a site for OHSAA high school tournament games and ice skating competitions in addition to being home of KSU's club team, which competes in the American Collegiate Hockey Association. The ice arena is also the home of the Kent Twisters, a member of the Pennsylvania-Ohio Women's Hockey Association, an adult amateur women's ice hockey league. Kent also plays host to the Portage County Open tennis tournament, held annually at the tennis courts of Theodore Roosevelt High School. Parks and recreation View from Heritage Park facing downtown The city operates nearly 20 parks and preserves, the largest of which is the Fred Fuller park along the Cuyahoga River, named after a former Kent Parks chairman. The park includes the Kramer Fields baseball and softball complex, which contains four fields, two of which are lighted. Several of the parks along the Cuyahoga River are on or near areas of historical significance. Franklin Mills Riveredge Park, which follows the Cuyahoga River through downtown Kent, passes through a large portion of the Kent Industrial District along with Heritage Park and includes sites related to the Pennsylvania and Ohio Canal. Adjacent on the south is the John Brown Tannery Park, on the site of the former tannery John Brown helped fund with Zenas Kent in the 1830s, while Brady's Leap park, adjacent to the north, is at the location of the famed leap over the Cuyahoga River by Captain Samuel Brady circa 1780. The parks and recreation department, in addition to operating and maintaining the city's parks and preserves, also operates a recreation center on the city's south side and offers several sports, arts, and education programs at various locations in Kent. The department also sponsors events throughout the year including Art in the Park, an ice-skating party, hayrides, and Santa's Arrival. The Kent City School District operates an indoor pool at Theodore Roosevelt High School that is available for public recreational and instructional use outside of its use by the school for athletics and physical education. The pool hosts swimming lessons and serves as a home venue for the Hudson-based Hudson Explorers Aquatic Team, a competitive swimming program for ages five and above. Within the city are segments of the Portage Hike and Bike Trail, which is jointly managed with Kent State University, the Portage Park District, and the city of Ravenna. The main portion of the trail follows the Cuyahoga River in Kent with most of the trail paved with asphalt. In August 2012, as part of several redevelopment projects in the downtown area, Kent State University began construction of the Esplanade Extension, which was completed in August 2013 and connects the university's portion of trail extending to Dix Stadium, known as the University Esplanade, to downtown Kent. The trail connects with the hike and bike trails in neighboring Summit County and links Kent with nearby communities in Portage County. See also map link. The city is also home to the Tom S. Cooperrider-Kent Bog State Nature Preserve, located in the southern edge of Kent. It is one of the most intact bogs in Ohio, with the southernmost and largest stand of tamarack trees in the continental United States. Through partnerships with Kent State University Recreational Services and other local agencies, additional recreational opportunities are available to city residents. A livery known as Crooked River Adventures is available at Tannery Park. The livery generally operates from May to October depending on weather and water levels. Canoe, kayak, tubing, and bicycle rentals are available to residents and students with kayak and canoe service as far as Brust Park in Munroe Falls and Water Works Park in Cuyahoga Falls. Kent also has a bicycle- sharing system known as Flashfleet in partnership with the university and PARTA. The program offers yearly memberships or hourly rentals with locations on campus and in the downtown area. Government wards of Kent Kent is governed by a charter form of government with a council–manager system of nine council members and a mayor. The city is divided into six wards and voters select a mayor, a council member representing their ward, and three at-large council members in staggered four-year terms. The city charter, adopted in 1963, is reviewed by a charter commission every 10 years who then make recommendations for changes, the last review being in 2015.Darrow, p. 27; initially the charter called for reviews every 5 years until a change to 10 years in 1985. The city council hires a city manager who oversees the day-to- day operations in the various city departments and enforces policies set by council. The mayor serves a largely ceremonial role as president of the council and votes only in the event of a tie. Kent voters approved the change from a mayor-council system to council-manager in 1975 and it went into effect in 1977. Jerry Fiala began his term as mayor January 1, 2010, and Dave Ruller began serving as city manager June 15, 2005. As part of the city government, Kent also has departments of community development, health, human services, law, parks and recreation, public safety, and public service. The Public Service Department oversees a variety of construction and maintenance works as well as the city's water treatment and water reclamation systems while the Public Safety Department includes both the police and fire departments. The Kent Police Department is housed in the city's Safety Administration Building and includes 911 dispatch for Kent and Franklin Township. Kent State University also operates its own police department, which mainly patrols the KSU campus and KSU property in and out of the Kent city limits. The two departments frequently communicate and for several years were headed by identical twin brothers: James Peach in the city and John Peach at the university. See also: \\"Lee taking helm at Kent PD\\" (January 9, 2011) The fire department operates two stations, the main station adjacent to the Safety Administration Building and the West Side Fire Station along North Mantua Street on the western side of the Cuyahoga River. Kent Fire also provides fire and emergency medical service coverage for Franklin Township and the village of Sugar Bush Knolls. The city's main sources of tax revenue come from income tax, set at 2.25%, and property tax. Voters approved an increase in the income tax rate from 2.0% in November 2013 to fund a new police station and the new rate took effect January 1, 2014. The rate increase includes a sunset provision that requires the tax rate to return to 2.0% once debt is paid off on the new facility. Note: subscription required to access link. In 2014, the city operated on a budget of approximately $40 million. The largest percentage of the budget, 31% or $11.9 million, was spent on public safety services followed by 22% or $8.5 million on basic utilities. Debt service accounted for $6.0 million or 17% of the budget while transportation projects accounted for 9% or $3.37 million of the budget, 8% or $3.33 million towards general government expenses, and $2.35 million allocated for construction of a new police station. At the state level, Kent is in the 68th district of the Ohio House of Representatives, represented since 2011 by Democrat Kathleen Clyde, a Kent resident. In the State Senate, Kent is part of the 18th district, represented since 2011 by Republican John Eklund of Geauga County. At the Federal level, Kent is included in Ohio's 13th congressional district, represented since 2003 by Democrat Tim Ryan of Niles. Education Stanton Middle School Preschool, elementary, and secondary education is mainly provided by the Kent City School District. A small portion of the city south of State Route 261 is part of the neighboring Field Local School District. See also :File:Portage County school districts overlay.png The Kent district was created around 1860 and later merged with the Franklin Township and Brady Lake school districts in 1959. It serves most of Kent and Franklin Township, the villages of Brady Lake and Sugar Bush Knolls and a small part of southern Streetsboro. Kent has four neighborhood elementary schools that serve students in grades K–5, Stanton Middle School for grades 6–8, and Theodore Roosevelt High School for grades 9–12. The district also operates a preschool program housed at Davey Elementary School, and is a member of the Six District Educational Compact with five surrounding districts to facilitate vocational education, with many of these programs housed at Roosevelt High School. See also Kent City Schools Preschool Program In 1985, Roosevelt High School was given the United States Department of Education Excellence in Education award and the school has consistently been rated \\"Excellent\\" by the Ohio Department of Education since 2004.Darrow, p. 175. For 2010 and 2015, it was named in US News & World Report as one of the best high schools in the United States, earning the publication's Bronze Medal designation. The Kent City School District has been consistently rated as \\"Excellent\\" or \\"Effective\\" by the Ohio Department of Education and in 2007 Walls Elementary School was named a \\"School of Promise\\" by the Ohio Department of Education, while Longcoy Elementary earned the U.S. Department of Education's prestigious Blue Ribbon School award. Kent also has one private school, St. Patrick School, which serves around 300 students in grades K–8 from Kent and several surrounding communities. It is part of Kent's St. Patrick parish and is affiliated with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Youngstown. To access the records, place \\"St Patrick\\" in the school box and \\"Kent\\" in the city and use the \\"search\\" button Newer portion of the Kent Free Library The Kent Free Library is the main public library. It was established in 1892 after Kent became the first village in Ohio to use an 1892 state law which allowed municipalities under a population of 5,000 to tax residents for the upkeep of a library. Andrew Carnegie donated $10,000 in 1901 for construction of a permanent home for the library, which opened in 1903. The 2006 expansion to the library brought available space to with a book collection of 147,390 items as of 2010. It is a school district library associated with the Kent City School District and is also part of the Portage Library Consortium, connecting it with Reed Memorial Library in Ravenna and the Portage County District Library, which maintains six branch libraries across the county and a bookmobile. The main campus of Kent State University is located in the southeastern part of the city. The campus itself occupies and the university owns thousands of additional acres adjacent to the campus. Additional facilities include a research park and golf course just east of the city limits in Franklin Township and the Kent State University Airport, just west of Kent in Stow. Founded in 1910 as a teacher training institution, the university has become a world leader in the development of liquid crystals through the Liquid Crystal Institute and was the site of the first patent for the modern liquid crystal in the 1970s. Kent State also has a nationally recognized fashion design program and nationally ranked programs in library science and business. As of 2010, the College of Nursing is the 5th-largest nursing school in the United States and largest in Ohio. In 2009 the university inaugurated the College of Public Health, the second public health program in Ohio and 33rd in the U.S. The Kent State library system, which includes the 12-story main library and houses over 2.6 million volumes, includes six additional department libraries on the main campus and a branch at each of the seven regional campuses. The library system is a member of the Association of Research Libraries, one of 3 in Ohio and 124 in North America. The other two Ohio members are Ohio University and Ohio State University. The university offers over 300 programs of study combined in the undergraduate and graduate levels and serves over 41,000 students in eight campuses across Northeast Ohio with over 30,000 at the campus in Kent. Media Kent is part of the Cleveland-Akron Television Market Area as defined by the Federal Communications Commission, which includes a 17-county region of Northeast Ohio. As of 2015 it ranks as the 18th-largest media market in the United States according to Nielsen Media Research. While most stations are located in Cleveland and Akron, Kent is home to the offices and main studio of Western Reserve Public Media, the PBS affiliate for Akron and Youngstown. The studios for W16DO-D, the local affiliate for the Retro Television Network, is located just east of the city limits in Franklin Township. TV-2, a Kent State University student-run production, is available on campus, on local cable, and online. Kent is also in range of the television stations that broadcast out of Youngstown. Studios of WKSU For radio, Kent is part of the Akron Radio Market, though it is within range of major stations in the Cleveland Radio Market as well as many in the Youngstown-Warren and Canton markets. Two radio stations, both on the FM dial, are licensed to Kent. WKSU, at 89.7 FM, broadcasts from the campus of Kent State University and is the main affiliate for National Public Radio in Northeast Ohio for the Akron, Canton, and Cleveland radio markets via repeaters around the region. WNIR, at 100.1 FM, is broadcast from studios shared with W16DO in Franklin Township. WNIR is centered on talk radio and news and is a local affiliate of ABC Radio and Westwood One. One AM station was also previously licensed to Kent but has since ceased operations: WNIR's former AM adjunct, WJMP, which broadcast at 1520 AM from 1965 until 2016 at the same Franklin Township studios housing WNIR, and operated only during the daytime hours. Kent State University also operates a student-run internet radio station: Black Squirrel Radio, both available online and on local cable. The Record-Courier, a daily newspaper which mainly covers Portage County, is the main source of printed news media for Kent. The Record-Courier was formed by the merger of the Ravenna Evening Record and the Kent Courier-Tribune and is published by the Record Publishing Company, a subsidiary of GateHouse Media. The Record-Courier maintained an office in Kent until 2008 before all offices were moved to Kent from Ravenna in 2012. In addition to the Record-Courier, the Kent offices house the various departments of Record Publishing and its other weekly newspapers that serve several Summit and Portage County communities.Darrow, pp. 153–154. Kent Patch, a local division of Patch Media, mainly serves as an online bulletin board for local events. It was established in 2010 and functioned as a news source specific to Kent before Patch Media downsized hundreds of local Patch sites across the United States in October 2013. The city is also served by Kent State University's Kent Stater, which is available in print at select locations on and off campus and online via KentWired.com, a collaborative site with TV-2 and Black Squirrel Radio. The Akron Beacon Journal and The Plain Dealer also serve Kent through regional coverage and delivery.Darrow, p. 155. Magazines published at Kent State include Fusion, an LGBTQ magazine; Kent State Magazine, an official publication of the university; and The Burr, a student-run magazine about events going on in and around Kent. Infrastructure The city operates its own water system, drawing groundwater from wells with an adjacent water treatment plant located just outside the city limits in Franklin Township as well as using a water reclamation facility along the Cuyahoga River in the southwestern part of the city. Waste collection for the entire city is handled through a local private contractor and Portage County handles the city's recycling collection. Kent's original recycling program was developed in 1970 by the Kent Environmental Council and was Ohio's first comprehensive and self-supporting program. Local phone utilities are provided through AT&T; Ohio through the 330 and 234 area codes, electricity is supplied and lines are maintained by FirstEnergy in the former coverage area of Ohio Edison, and natural gas is supplied and lines are maintained by Dominion Resources East Ohio Energy. While residents are free to choose their own natural gas and electric suppliers, the city is part of the Northeast Ohio Public Energy Council, or NOPEC, the largest government aggregation in the United States. Transportation Kent Central Gateway, downtown State Route 59 is the main east–west highway, following East and West Main Streets and Haymaker Parkway. Summit Street is another major east-west road mainly on Kent's eastern side, passing through and linking much of the Kent State campus. Fairchild Avenue is an important east-west road on the city's west side connecting with Stow and Cuyahoga Falls. State Route 43 is the main north–south highway, mainly following North Mantua and South Water Streets. SR 43 connects Kent with Interstate 76, approximately to the south via exit 33 in Brimfield and to the Ohio Turnpike/Interstate 80 and the eastern terminus of Interstate 480, approximately to the north via Turnpike exit 187 in Streetsboro. Both SR 43 and SR 59 are four to five-lane roads within the city limits. State Route 261 passes through the southern and eastern edges of the city and is a four-lane divided highway for a short distance with the remainder a two-lane highway. It serves as a bypass between SR 43, SR 59, and Summit Street on Kent's south and eastern sides and to Tallmadge on the southwest. Public transportation is provided by the Portage Area Regional Transportation Authority, known as PARTA, which is headquartered just outside the city limits in Franklin Township. PARTA serves Kent through a dial-a-ride service, the Suburban and Kent Circulator routes completely within the city limits, the seasonal Black Squirrel route along SR 59 during Kent State University's Fall and Spring semesters, and the Interurban connecting with Stow and Ravenna. There are also two express routes, one to Akron connecting with METRO Regional Transit Authority via Brimfield, and a Cleveland Express route connecting with the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority via Streetsboro, Twinsburg, and Maple Heights. PARTA also includes Campus Bus Service, which provides three fixed routes on the campus of Kent State University. An intermodal transit facility, known as the Kent Central Gateway, opened in 2013 in the downtown area to provide better integration of the existing bus system, hike-and-bike trails, and parking. The building was financed mainly from a $20 million Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant received in February 2010 and construction began in April 2011. Healthcare Hospital care is provided mainly through University Hospitals Portage Medical Center, affiliated with University Hospitals of Cleveland, which operates the UH Kent Health Center in the southern part of the city. The UH Kent Health Center includes an emergency services building with 24-hour emergency room and an urgent care center, adjacent to a medical arts building housing a medical imaging center and family medicine doctors. The 150-bed main hospital is located in Ravenna and the system operates additional facilities throughout Portage County. Free clinics include the AxessPointe Community Health Center, located just east of the city limits in the Joint Economic Development District with Franklin Township, and a clinic in the downtown area operated by social agency Townhall II. Religion St. Patrick Church, a Roman Catholic parish, is the city's largest religious body The earliest organized religious services in Kent were held in 1815 when a Methodist group was formed, followed by a Congregational church in 1819.Wardle, p. 16. The first religious meetinghouse in Kent, which also served as the first schoolhouse, was built in 1817 and was used by several different denominations. Later, the Methodists built another building in 1828 that was also used by multiple denominations.Grismer, pp. 191, 194. The oldest church building in Kent still used as a place of worship is the Unitarian Universalist Church on Gougler Avenue, which was dedicated in 1868. The former home of the Congregational Church was dedicated in 1858 and still stands along Gougler Avenue very near the Unitarian Universalist Church. It served as the home of the First Congregational Church—which became the Kent United Church of Christ in 1964—until 1955.Darrow, pp. 89–102. It was later purchased by a local business and is used as their corporate headquarters. As of 2010, within the city are two Roman Catholic parishes affiliated with the Diocese of Youngstown, one a family parish and one a Newman Center, as well as congregations of the United Methodist Church, African Methodist Episcopal Church, Free Methodist Church, United Church of Christ, Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod, Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, Church of the Brethren, the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), Presbyterian Church, Church of Christ, Episcopal Church, and Jehovah's Witnesses. There are also Unitarian Universalist, non-denominational Christian, and Bahá'í Faith congregations. Although there are no Jewish synagogues or temples, there is a Hillel Jewish student center on the campus of Kent State University which serves students at both Kent State and the University of Akron. Just outside the city limits in Franklin Township are the Kent congregations of the Church of the Nazarene, Assemblies of God, as well as Baptist and Free Will Baptist churches. The Islamic Society of Akron and Kent operates a masjid and school on its main campus in Cuyahoga Falls, west of Kent. It was founded in Kent in 1979 and maintains an additional masjid in the city. Kent is also part of a ward of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Rootstown that was first organized in Kent and includes most of southern Portage County. Notable people Lucius Fairchild Kent has produced and been home to a number of notable individuals in varying fields. Its natives and residents are referred to as \\"Kentites\\". John Davey, a pioneer in tree surgery and founder of the Davey Tree Expert Company moved to Kent in the 1880s. His son, Martin L. Davey, would later serve as Governor of Ohio and a U.S. Representative. Other political figures to come from Kent include Wisconsin governor Lucius Fairchild, former U.S. Representative Robert E. Cook, and noted abolitionist John Brown, who lived in what was then Franklin Mills from 1835–1839. Noted athletes to have come from Kent include former National Football League players Mike Adamle, Tom DeLeone, and Stan White and former Major League Baseball player, manager, and executive Gene Michael. Three members of the band Devo, which debuted in Kent in 1973 and was founded by Kent State University students, are natives of Kent: Gerald Casale, Peter Gregg, and Rod Reisman. See also: Photos of Devo's First Live Performance Other performing artists to come from Kent include singer Julianne Baird, playwright Vincent J. Cardinal, and voice actor Joshua Seth. Lucien Price, an author and writer for The Boston Evening Transcript and The Atlantic Monthly grew up in Kent and used the pseudonym \\"Woolwick\\" for Kent in some of his stories. Retrieved from Internet Archive January 26, 2014. Kent was also the home of inventor Lucien B. Smith, regarded as the inventor of barbed wire. Additionally, people who have lived in Kent while attending Kent State University include comedians Drew Carey and Arsenio Hall, actor Michael Keaton, musicians Joe Walsh and Chrissie Hynde, and additional members of the band Devo. Athletes include football players Antonio Gates, James Harrison, Julian Edelman, Joshua Cribbs, and Jack Lambert; Major League Baseball players Thurman Munson, Rich Rollins, and Andy Sonnanstine; college football coaches Nick Saban and Lou Holtz; and golfer Ben Curtis, who resides in Franklin Township just north of the Kent city limits and lists Kent as his residence. Twin town Kent has one twin town, Dudince, a small spa town of about 1,500 people in southern Slovakia. The relationship was established in 2003 through Sister Cities International and resulted in the formation of the Kent-Dudince Sister City Association to promote learning and understanding of the Slovakian culture. The group meets regularly and organizes cultural exchanges and programs that feature Slovakian dance and music. Cultural exchanges have included a performance of a choir from Kent's Theodore Roosevelt High School in Dudince in 2004 and tour groups from Kent visiting in 2006 and 2008.

Preliminary story board work was done in the U.S., but most of the film was done in Australia.Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper, Australian Film 1900–1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production, Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1998 p268 Over 70 artists were involved in the film. Sequence directors were Cam Ford and Peter Gardner, and animators were Paul McAdam, Yvonne Pearsall, Dick Dunne, Gairdon Cooke, Richard Jones, Gerry Grabner, Stan Walker, Cynthia Leech, Peter Luschwitz, Kevin Roper and children's illustrator Kilmeny Niland.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0130847/combined Background work was by Graham Liney and Yvonne Perrin, sister of Disney's Sleeping Beauty background stylist Eyvind Earle. Production took place from mid 1970 until May 1972. Only one voice, that of the Red Dragon, was provided by an Australian; actor and comedian Kevin Golsby. Release Shortly before the film's release in December 1972, an Australian/American cartoon special about the original Marco Polo screened on Australian television, prompting the film's distributors to make the title longer to avoid confusion. However, commercial results were poor, largely due to insufficient promotion by the U.S. distributors, although it did reasonably well in Australia and Europe. The low returns from the film persuaded Porter to undertake sub-contracted TV series work from America's Hanna-Barbera (The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan, Super Friends, plus several one-off animated TV specials), but a subsequent financial recession in 1975 finally saw Porter shutting down his animation studio. Three books were published using art work from the film. The film's title was changed to The Magic Medallion for its 1976 release on television. The movie had its widest American exposure over the Showtime Cable Network in 1983 and 1984, and later the film got an extremely hard-to-find VHS from Family Home Entertainment. The movie was later included on BCI Eclipse's Advantage Collection DVD set. In 2015, the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia released a restored print of the movie on DVD to celebrate the centenary of Australian animation. Marco Polo: Return to Xanadu Many years later, the story was re-edited and extended by scriptwriter (and original co-producer) Sheldon Moldoff, in collaboration with Ron Merk and, with additional footage, certain name changes like the Red Dragon to Foo-Ling, and added subplots, was released as Marco Polo: Return to Xanadu (2002) by Tooniversal Company. Lightyear Video and Warner Home Video handled the VHS/DVD release. The resulting version is generally considered to be vastly inferior to the original. Lionsgate Films has made this version of the movie available for video-on-demand.

It is a martensitic phase in nature, but is not the martensite that is responsible for the shape memory and superelastic effect. In connection with nitinol, \\"martensite\\" normally refers to the B19' monoclinic martensite phase, rather than the R-phase. The R-phase competes with martensite, is often completely absent, and often appears during cooling before martensite, then giving way to it upon further cooling. In the same way, it can be observed during heating prior to reversion to austenite, or may be completely absent. The R-phase to austenite transformation (A-R) is reversible, with a very small hysteresis (typically 2-5 degrees C). It also exhibits a very small shape memory effect, and within a very narrow temperature range, superelasticity. The R-phase transformation (from austenite) occurs between 20 and 40 degrees C in most binary nitinol alloys. History The R-phase was observed during the 1970s but generally was not correctly identified until Ling and Kaplow's landmark paper of 1981. The crystallography and thermodynamics of the R-phase are now well understood, but it still creates many complexities in device engineering. According to awell-worn phrase, \\"It must be the R-phase\\" whenever a device fails to perform as expected.  Crystallographic structure and transformation  The R-phase is essentially a rhombohedral distortion of the cubic austenite phase. Figure 1 shows the general structure, though there are shifts in atomic position that repeat after every three austenitic cells. Thus the actual unit cell of the actual R-phase structure is shown in Figure 2. The R-phase can be easily detected via x-ray diffraction or neutron diffraction, most clearly evidenced by a splitting of the (1 1 0) austenitic peak. While the R-phase transformation is a first order transformation and the R-phase is distinct and separate from martensite and austenite, it is followed by a second order transformation: a gradual shrinking of the rhombohedral angle and concomitant increased transformational strain. By suppressing martensite formation and allowing the second order transformation to continue, the transformational strain can be maximized. Such measures have shown memory and superelastic effects of nearly 1%.. In commercially available superelastic alloys, however, the R-phase transformational strain is only 0.25 to 0.50 percent. There are three ways Nitinol can transform between the austenite and martensite phases: * Direct transformation, with no evidence of R-phase during the forward or reverse transformation (cooling or heating), occurs in titanium-rich alloys and fully annealed conditions. * The \\"symmetric R-phase transformation\\" occurs when the R-phase intervenes between austenite and martensite on both heating and cooling (see Figure 3). Here, two peaks are observed on cooling, and two peaks upon heating, with the heating peaks much closer to one another due to the lower hysteresis of the A-R transformation. * The \\"asymmetric R-phase transformation\\" is by far the more common transformational route (Figure 4). Here the R-phase occurs during cooling, but not upon heating, due to the large hysteresis of the austenite-martensite transformation—by the time one reaches a sufficiently high temperature to revert martensite, the R-phase is no longer more stable than austenite, and thus the martensite reverts directly to austenite. The R-phase can be stress-induced as well as thermally-induced. The stress rate (Clausius–Clapeyron constant, \\\\frac{d\\\\sigma}{dT}) is very large compared to the austenite–martensite transformation (very large stresses are required to drive the transformation). Image:R-phase distortion.jpgFigure 1: The R-Phase distortion of the B2 austenitic structure Image:R-phase structure.pngFigure 2: The trigonal representation of the R-phase Image:R-phase symmetric transformation.jpgFigure 3: Free energy, strain, and calorimetry curves typical of the symmetric Austenite-R-Martensite transformation, in which R-phase is found during both cooling and heating. Image:R-phase asymmetric transformation.jpgFigure 4: Free energy, strain, and calorimetry curves typical of the asymmetric Austenite-R-Martensite transformation, in which R-phase is found only upon cooling.  Practical Implications  While an essentially hysteresis-free shape memory effect sounds exciting, the strains produced by the austenite-R transformation are too small for most applications. Because of the very small hysteresis, and the tremendous cyclic stability of the A-R transformation, some effort has been made to commercialize thermal actuators based on the effect.. Such applications have been of limited success at best. For most of Nitinol applications, the R-phase is an annoyance and engineers try to suppress its appearance. Some of the difficulties it induces are as follows: * When austenite transforms to the R-phase, its energy is reduced and its propensity to transform to martensite is lessened, leading to a larger austenite- martensite hysteresis. This, in turn reduces actuator efficiency and superelastic energy storage capacity. * Stress-strain curves of the austenite often show a slight inflection during loading, making elastic limits and yield stresses difficult to pinpoint * While a 0.25% strain is too small to take advantage of, it is more than enough to cause stress relaxation in many interference-fit applications such as pipe couplings. * A large amount of heat is given off when austenite transforms to the R-phase, and thus it gives rise to a well-defined differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) peak. This makes DSC curves difficult to interpret if one is not careful: the R-phase peak is often mistaken for a martensite peak, and errors are often made in determining transformation temperatures. * While the electrical resistivity of austenite and martensite are similar, the R-phase has a very high resistance. This makes using electrical resistance all but useless in determining the transformation temperatures of Nitinol.

It is the first novel in The Cadfael Chronicles, first published in 1977. It was adapted for television in 1996 by Central for ITV. The monks of Shrewsbury Abbey seek the relics of a saint for their chapel, in Wales. The locals object to this translation of the relics, and a local leader is found murdered. Brother Cadfael is challenged to bring right endings to all parties, in Wales and in the Abbey. This novel was listed on the 1990 list of The Top 100 Crime Novels of All Time by the Crime Writers Association in the UK, and also on the top 100 list compiled in 1995 by the Mystery Writers of America. In 2010, The Wall Street Journal named it one of their \\"Five Best Historical Mystery Novels\\". These later honours indicate that the novel rose in the view of critics compared to one lukewarm review by Kirkus Reviews in the year of publication. Plot In May 1137, Prior Robert of Shrewsbury Abbey is determined that the Abbey must have the relics of a saint. Finding no suitable local saint, Robert finds one in nearby Wales. Brother Cadfael has two novices assisting him in his herb and vegetable gardens: John (practical, down-to- earth, whose vocation Cadfael doubts) and the ambitious Columbanus (of whose illness Cadfael is sceptical, although he treats him with sedating poppy syrup). Columbanus and Brother Jerome, Robert's clerk, go to Saint Winifred's Well in North Wales for a cure. When they return Columbanus says Saint Winifred appeared to him, saying that her grave at Gwytherin was neglected; she wished to lie somewhere more accessible to pilgrims. Abbot Heribert approves the trip to Wales to retrieve Winifred's remains. Robert, Sub-Prior Richard, Jerome and Columbanus are joined by Cadfael (fluent in Welsh) and John (for menial work). The bishop of Bangor and Owain Gwynedd (prince of Gwynedd) consent. When the monks reach Gwytherin (on the Cledwen River) the local priest, Father Huw, objects to Winifred's remains being removed without approval by the free men of the parish. Rhisiart, the community's most influential landowner, opposes Winifred's removal. Robert tries to bribe him, and Rhisiart storms off. The assembly dissolves, agreeing with Rhisiart. Father Huw persuades Robert to ask Rhisiart for another meeting the next day, to which he agrees. While John helps the servants (and Jerome and Columbanus keep vigil at Winifred's chapel), Robert, Richard, Cadfael and Huw await Rhisiart; he does not appear. The landowner is found dead in the woods, with an arrow in his chest bearing the mark of Engelard (an Englishman in love with Rhisiart's daughter, Sioned). When Engelard appears, Robert insists he be taken into custody. Engelard flees, and Brother John impedes the only local man close enough to stop him. Robert orders John held for breaking the law of Gwynedd and his vow of obedience; this pleases John as he is held where his love, Annest, lives. Cadfael realises that Engelard's arrow did not kill Rhisiart: his back is damp, while his front is dry. Rhisiart was stabbed from behind by a dagger, falling face-down. After it rained, someone turned him over and pushed an arrow into the wound from the front. The locals see Rhisiart's death as an omen, and agree to Winifred's removal; Robert plans to exhume her remains after a three-night vigil. Cadfael hopes the superstition that a corpse will bleed if touched by the murderer will force a confession. At his suggestion Sioned asks that after each night's prayer, those keeping watch place their hands on Rhisiart's heart. Jerome does so, but Robert refuses. The third night, Cadfael and Columbanus keep watch. Columbanus has another seizure; he is removed unconscious in the morning, evading Sioned's request. He recovers after mass, saying that Winifred told him Rhisiart should be buried in her grave when she is removed. Winifred is exhumed, her linen- wrapped skeleton placed in the coffin brought from Shrewsbury and the coffin sealed with wax. As Rhisiart is prepared for burial, Sioned asks Peredur (another suitor) to place a jewelled cross on his body. Peredur refuses, confessing that he found Rhisiart dead and pushed Engelard's arrow into the wound so Engelard would disappear as rival for Sioned's hand. Cadfael finds the flask of poppy syrup (brought for Columbanus) nearly empty, recalling that when Rhisiart was murdered, only Jerome drank the wine provided for the vigil; if Jerome slept through the vigil, he would be ashamed to admit it. Before the monks depart, Columbanus offers to keep vigil and falls asleep; a vision of a young woman wakes him, asking why he murdered Rhisiart. Columbanus confesses, begging forgiveness. Touching her veil, Columbanus realises the saint is Sioned and slashes at her with a knife before fleeing. Cadfael and Engelard tackle him outside, and Engelard accidentally breaks Columbanus' neck. Cadfael acts quickly; he, Engelard and Sioned undress Columbanus, open Winifred's coffin, replace her above Rhisiart's body and place Columbanus's body in the coffin and ensure that the coffin appears undisturbed. Columbanus' sandals, shirt and habit are found on the chapel floor, with hawthorn petals around them. Robert proclaims that Columbanus's prayers have been answered. The villagers load the saint's coffin on a cart, and as they leave Cadfael sees John bidding them farewell. Two years later Bened calls at Shrewsbury, telling Cadfael that John and Annest are married and John will become smith after Bened. Sioned and Engelard, also married, have named their child Cadfael. Bened also notes that Winifred's former resting place is the scene of pilgrimages and cures; the Abbey reliquary is ignored by pilgrims. Cadfael muses that the saint will not mind sharing her grave with Rhisiart. Characters *Brother Cadfael: Herbalist monk at Shrewsbury Abbey. He is 57 years old, a man who came to his vocation in the monastery about 17 years earlier, after his life as man at arms in the First Crusade, sailor, and in service of a Norman lord. *Prior Robert Pennant: Prior at Shrewsbury Abbey. He is based on the historical prior who did bring the relics to the Abbey. He is characterised as a man of the aristocracy, of mixed Welsh and English blood; with ambition for more than his present position. Aged 50 in this story, with silvering hair, he is a man taller than average. He believes deeply in miracles and the power of the saints, as well as his own rightness. *Brother Jerome: Prior Robert's clerk. He is rather righteous on his own account, and reliable to the Prior for accurate reporting of Abbey events. *Brother Rhys: An older monk in the Abbey, of Welsh birth. He tells the story of Saint Winifred's miracles and her life at Prior Robert's prompting. Rhys is no longer active, too old and frail for much more than the occasional story. *Abbot Heribert: Head of Shrewsbury Abbey of Saint Peter and Saint Paul. He is a gentle soul, based on the real abbot of that year. *Richard: Sub-prior at Shrewsbury Abbey. He is one of the party who fetched Saint Winifred's bones from Gwytherin. He is low key and in many ways the opposite of the Prior. *Brother Columbanus: Young, ambitious monk. He is given to extremes of emotion in display of his spiritual feelings, and is in service under Brother Cadfael in the herbarium. He is the younger son of an aristocratic Norman family, fair haired and strong, age 25, and less than a year since \\"tonsured\\", that is, took his vows. While yet a monk, he is shown to be a man who puts his ambition over honesty and moral behaviour *Brother John: Young and strong monk in service under Brother Cadfael. He is of a practical and direct nature, and a good sense of humour. He has curly reddish brown hair. He took his vows less than a year earlier. Brother Cadfael suspects John does not have a true vocation and would do better out in the world. He had joined the monastery when rejected as a suitor by a girl in England – spoken to Annest in English when she could not yet understand English. John falls in love with Annest in Wales, showing Cadfael's perception to be true. *Owain Gwynedd: Prince of Gwynedd, as his father Gruffudd ap Cynan is in his last months of life. He is the eldest surviving son of Gruffydd, who proves to be a good leader. He was a real historical person. *Bishop David of Bangor: Built up the church at Bangor. He approved the moving of the saint's bones to rest at the Abbey in Shropshire. He was a real historical person. *Father Huw: Parish priest at Gwytherin, where Saint Winifred has been buried these hundreds of years. He is hospitable and direct. Rare for the Welsh priests, he is unmarried, celibate. *Rhisiart: Largest landholder in Gwytherin. He is widowed and living with his only child, a daughter. He is solidly against removal of Saint Winifred's remains to Shrewsbury, despite his Prince's approval. Murdered for his views. *Sioned: Daughter and only child of Rhisiart and heir to his properties. She is a beautiful, outspoken and quick-witted young woman; she speaks Welsh and English; she is sought by at least two suitors. *Engelard: Fair haired young Cheshire man from the borders of Maelor. He fled to Wales to avoid Earl Ranulf of Chester, who did not like this skilled archer poaching deer from his lands. His father owns a manor, which Engelard will inherit once it is safe to return home. He is skilled in calling ox and dealing with cattle, good skills for Gwytherin. An outlander or alltud in Wales, accepted for the previous two years by Rhisiart to let him make his way in Wales. He is a suitor for Sioned and good friends with her father. *Peredur: Son and only child of Cadwallon. He is a suitor for Sioned. He is handsome but spoiled in always getting what he wants, until he fell in love with Sioned. Rhisiart tried to persuade his daughter to marry her lifelong friend, to no avail. Peredur seeks any means to push the favoured suitor out of Wales, stooping to false evidence to implicate Engelard in a murder he did not commit. *Cadwallon: Overlord who owns lands neighbouring those of Rhisiart. He is married to the querulous Dame Branwen, and father of the young man Peredur. He sends for the bailiff when Rhisiart is murdered. *Cai: Ploughman for Rhisiart. He is the gaoler for John when he is held for aiding Engelard's escape. *Bened: Blacksmith of Gwytherin. He is widowed, and a man of good repute in the area. *Annest: Niece of Bened, lady's maid to Sioned. She is of marriageable age. She falls in love with Brother John at first sight, though neither speaks the language of the other. *Griffith ap Rhys: Bailiff for Prince Owain in Rhos. Themes The main theme of A Morbid Taste for Bones is the clash between the divine and the earthly worlds. The bones of Saint Winifred, physical relics which symbolise a connection to a spiritual realm, are quarrelled over in the most materialistic way. Brother Columbanus's spiritual visions are invented to further his worldly ambition \\"to be the youngest head under a bishop's mitre\\" and his unexpected disappearance is explained as a blessed translation into grace by the Prior. Links with other works This is the first of a series of twenty books featuring Brother Cadfael, collectively known as the Cadfael Chronicles. The author did not have a series in mind while writing this first book; the strength of the central character became evident as she wrote the second book. All of the characters in the monastery itself (abbot, prior, monks with specific jobs like the precentor or infirmarer) are introduced by name, if not by personality, in this first book of the series. St. Winifred and her shrine are mentioned in most of the subsequent books, and Cadfael often prays to her or talks to her in Welsh. For much of the series, Cadfael is only partly sure that he acted correctly when dealing with the saint's relics. He admits his actions in 1141 to his friend, Sheriff Hugh Beringar, in The Pilgrim of Hate, the tenth book in the series. In that book he concludes that his actions are vindicated when he witnesses a miraculous healing at Winifred's shrine in Shrewsbury Abbey. In The Holy Thief, St. Winifred's coffin is stolen from the Abbey, and Cadfael lives in fear that the coffin will be opened and the deception discovered; he is much relieved when the coffin is eventually returned intact. Setting in history The book mixes fictional with real people and events. Abbot Heribert and Prior Robert Pennant were indeed officers of Shrewsbury Abbey in 1137, and Prior Robert wrote a history of the translation of Saint Winifred to the Abbey. He eventually became Abbot of Shrewsbury in 1148. In Cordially Yours, Brother Cadfael, Judith J. Kollmann's article \\"Brother Cadfael's Vocation\\" describes the fictional version of Robert Pennant as \\"proud\\" and \\"ambitious\\". The history of the Shrewsbury Abbey includes the acquisition of the relics of Saint Winifred in 1138. The attraction of Saint Winifred's well, even after her bones were moved to the Shrewsbury Abbey, continued for centuries. It is thought that some small relic of St Winifred did remain in at her shrine in Gwytherin. There is a recent English translation of Prior Robert Pennant's 12th century article on the life of Saint Winifred, by Ronald Pepin, published in a volume with two other articles on Saint Winifred. On the strength of Winifred's relics, Shrewsbury Abbey became second as a place of pilgrimage only to the shrine of Saint Thomas Becket in Canterbury Cathedral. The saint's relics remained at the Abbey until its dissolution in 1540 during the reign of Henry VIII. A finger bone found its way to Rome, and was returned to England in 1852. A portion of the Abbey buildings, specifically the church, survived the dissolution of the monasteries and is in use today. Cadfael's \\"syrup of poppies\\" is perhaps an early reintroduction of the medicinal use of poppies to England. He presumably learned its use and effects in the Holy Land, quite possibly from the Saracens. It is useful to Cadfael throughout the series of books, for dulling pain and calming those in distress, and to other characters for stupefying guards, witnesses and rivals. Welsh village society (as in Gwytherin) and the terms of customary service are described. Foreigners (alltudau, or exiles) such as Engelard, with no place in the community guaranteed by family ties, may enter a form of indentured servitude. Unlike villeinage as in England, this may be terminated by the servant dividing his chattels with the master who gave him the opportunity of owning them. In that century, Wales included several principalities. Gwynedd covered most of the north part of Wales, ruled by Owain Gwynedd, a wise ruler with an eye to keeping the peace with England while enlarging and securing his principality. Bangor is a city on the mainland of Wales along the Menai Strait, dividing the Isle of Anglesey from the mainland, and a bishopric, then under Bishop David, including the places sacred to Saint Winifred. In the first part of the novel, the two monks visited Holywell, where Saint Winifed was said to be beheaded, the well springing up from her blood on the soil. Her own miracle was that her head was placed on her body. She then lived in Gwytherin as a nun. The monks travelled a long way to achieve their goal of the relics of a saint for Shrewsbury Abbey. From Shrewsbury to Holywell, using modern roads, the distance is about 60 miles. The second journey, from Shrewsbury to Bangor and then Aber, using modern roads, is about 80 to 90 miles depending on the route. To Gwytherin is about 30 miles, in the general direction of the return trip Shrewsbury. From Gwytherin stopping at Penmachno back to Shrewsbury, on modern roads, is about 75 miles. All the places mentioned in the book are real places in that area of England and Wales, then and now. \\"In the third week of May they came to Bangor\\" and then \\"They ran the prince to earth at Aber\\" who provided them a guide to Gwytherin, travelling \\"from the Conway valley at Llanrwst, climbing away from the river into forested hill country. Beyond the watershed they crossed the Elwy\\" to reach Gwytherin. Bened the smith from Gwytherin stopped in Shrewsbury on his pilgrimage to Walsingham, a long journey to the east side of Britain, about 250 miles one way on modern roads. Reviews and awards This and one other novel by Ellis Peters were tied for No. 42 in the 1990 list of The Top 100 Crime Novels of All Time by the Crime Writers Association. (The other novel is The Leper of Saint Giles, the fifth novel in The Cadfael Chronicles (1981).) In the UK this was published as Hatchard's Crime Companion, edited by Susan Moody. This novel is also on the top 100 list compiled in 1995 by the Mystery Writers of America. Kirkus Reviews, only moderately impressed with the story, observed: \\"Brother C. traps and dispatches the loony killer (disposing of the body with great wit), matches the daughter up with the right swain, and encourages a restless monk to drop out and enjoy the flesh. Considering the materials, this polished Ellis Peters pleasantry could have been much duller, cuter, and talkier than it is.\\" The Wall Street Journal named it one of their \\"Five Best Historical Mystery Novels\\" in 2010.

Adaptations=Television A Morbid Taste for Bones was the seventh Cadfael book to be adapted for television, very much out of sequence, by Carlton Media for distribution worldwide. It was first shown in the UK on 26 July 1996. The episode starred Derek Jacobi as Brother Cadfael, Michael Culver as Prior Robert, and Anna Friel as Sioned. The television episode makes some changes, including secondary characters and proper names. Brother John and Annest are not included, leaving only one set of young lovers for the viewer to follow. The tension between the Welsh villagers and the English monastics is played up considerably, and the acquisition of St. Winifred is made more dangerous thereby. To that end, the naive and charming Father Huw is recharacterised as the suspicious and rather grubby Father Ianto, who opposes the saint's removal and castigates the monks for haggling over her bones as if she were a bone at a butcher's stall. Bened the smith, while retaining his name, also loses much of his openhearted good nature, being both a suspicious rival of Rhisiart's and a vehement accuser of the monks themselves. In the climax of the adaptation, Brother Columbanus' confession is drawn out by less supernatural means than in the novel. Instead of being hoodwinked by Sioned in the dark, Columbanus confesses to a fevered figure of his own imagination. He is egged on to this by Cadfael, who pretends to see a figure of light bearing down upon them as they keep their vigil in St. Winifred's church. Sioned's part is to stay hidden as a witness, but when Columbanus relates with what joy he struck down her father in the saint's name, Sioned loses control and flies at him, with disastrous consequences as Columbanus realises that he has been tricked. Sioned's lover, renamed from Engelard to Godwin, appears to defend Sioned, and Colombanus's accidental death occurs as in the novel. However, Columbanus' own motives are a good deal more ambiguous in the television adaptation. He innocently denies any ambition on his own part to be \\"the youngest head under a mitre,\\" and his actions appear to stem from religious fervor and criminal insanity, rather than from a cold, calculated pass at fame. Otherwise, the episode remains primarily faithful to the text, with the necessary exception of being well into Abbot Radulfus' tenure at the abbey, instead of introducing the series. The \\"Cadfael\\" series eventually extended to thirteen episodes, all of which starred Sir Derek Jacobi as the sleuthing monk. The series was filmed mostly in Hungary. Radio A Morbid Taste For Bones was the first of Cadfael stories to be adapted for radio. It was adapted by BBC Radio 4 and has been repeated on BBC Radio 7. Glyn Houston starred as Brother Cadfael.

A poor Polish family rescues Jacob and his brothers from the tyranny of the Nazis where they face the reality of life under the harshest conditions. They are in the current day and his daughter ask about the holocaust, Jacob had a flashback of this time. Two people that helped Jacob during the hardest times were here too. Michael Halperin discovered the story when he was told about two brothers who endured the hardships of the Holocaust. They were rescued by a Catholic Polish family who kept them safe under Nazi eyes and from Polish collaborators for over 4 years. At the end of World War II, Jacob and David were reunited with their father who had fled to what was then known as Palestine. Jacob received his doctorate from the Weitzman Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel. David received his doctorate in mathematics at the University of California Berkeley and returned to Israel. Halperin received a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to develop a screenplay based on the story that became the basis for \\"Jacob's Rescue\\". Alex and Mela Roslan who rescued Jacob and his brother David were honored by the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles and have a garden planted in their honor on the Avenue of the Righteous at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in Jerusalem. Shortly after the screenplay was completed, Halperin arranged for the Roslans to fly to Israel in order to celebrate Passover with Jacob and David. It was the first time all four were together since they said goodbye at a rail station in Berlin. Plot synopsis Jacob Gutgeld struggles against hope until one a Polish family, the Roslans, rescue him from the Warsaw Ghetto. He ends up facing hardship during his quest to survive. During his stay with the Roslans, he's reunited with his uncle who is able to pass as non-Jewish and at his request, the Roslans take in Jacob's younger brother Sholom who has been mistreated and is in an emaciated and fragile state. Not long after Sholom's arrival, the family faces scarlet fever. Jacob's, as well as the Roslan daughter's, isn't that serious, but the son, Yurek's is and he has to go to the hospital. Sholom's is also more serious due to his weakened state, but he can't go to the hospital or risk being found out so the uncle, a doctor, does his best to treat him. The Roslan children and Jacob recover, but Sholom's condition continually deteriorates with his kidneys starting to shut down until one night he wakes up with a high fever and after being taken to the bathroom for some water, dies in Alex's arms. Not long after, Jacob ends up facing a serious ear infection, a side-effect from his scarlet fever and the Roslans are forced to sell their apartment so they can get the money they need for a bribe so Jacob can get life-saving surgery. After the rest of the family dies in the ghetto, the uncle brings Jacob's other brother, David to live with the family, believing its only a matter of time until he's found out and wants to make sure David is in good hands. After word of a Russian counterattack against the Germans reaches the Roslan household, Yurek rushes out to celebrate and is killed by a German sniper. Eventually, the family decides to abandon Warsaw when it gets too dangerous and go to live with Mela's brother in the countryside in a place where there are no Germans. They spend the rest of the war there until Poland is liberated. At one point near the end of the story, Russian soldiers march through the town and one enters the house where the family is staying and he and Jacob embrace each other and reveal that they are both Jewish. After the war, the family travels to Berlin to see if they can locate any surviving family for Jacob and David and their father is located, having fled Poland for Palestine before the war. Jacob and David are sent to live with him even though they prefer the Roslans at this point, the family who took care of them during such dangerous times and were there for them while their own father was not.

Accessed 10 November 2006. The Greenland craton is made up of some of the oldest rocks on Earth. The Isua greenstone belt in southwestern Greenland contains the oldest known rocks on Earth dated at 3.7–3.8 billion years old. The Precambrian basement of Greenland formed an integral part of the Laurentian Shield that is at the core of the North American continent. Greenland was formed in two rifting stages from the main body of North America. The first, during the Cretaceous period, formed Baffin Bay. Baffin Bay is the northwestern extension and terminus of the North Atlantic-Labrador Sea rift system that started forming 140 million years ago in the Early Cretaceous epoch. The Labrador Sea started opening 69 million years ago during the Maastrichtian age but seafloor spreading appears to have ceased by the Oligocene epoch, 30–35 million years ago. Correlations between tectonic units in Canada and Greenland have been proposed;Hoffman, P.F. 1989: Precambrian geology and tectonic history of North America. In: Bally, A.W. & Palmer, A.R. (eds): The geology of North America, 447–512. Boulder,Colorado: Geological Society of America. however, the pre-spreading fit of Greenland to Canada is still not accurately known. Since the closure of the North Atlantic–Labrador Sea rift, Greenland has moved roughly in conjunction with North America; thus, there are questions as to whether the Greenland Plate should still be considered a separate plate at all.Chadwick, B. & Garde, A.A. 1996: Palaeoproterozoic oblique plate convergence in South Greenland: a reappraisal of the Ketilidian Orogen.

The area between Greenland and Baffin Island is, however, seismically very active, being the location of the epicenter of many earthquakes including a 7.3-magnitude earthquake in 1933. , scientists have been unable to correlate the seismicity with particular geological structures or geophysical anomalies. It has been suggested that seismicity in the region is related to the stresses associated with post-glacial rebound.

It forms an important part of graphonomics, which became established after the \\"International Workshop on Handwriting Movement Analysis\\" in 1982 in Nijmegen, The Netherlands. It would become the first of a continuing series of International Graphonomics Conferences. The first graphonomics milestone was Thomassen, Keuss, Van Galen, Grootveld (1983). Handwriting is historically considered the widest taught motor skill. It is also one of the first, and often the only motor skill that children will learn at elementary school. It takes years of practice and maturing before a person has mastered the adult handwriting skill. Handwriting is not considered only as a movement that leaves a visible trace of ink on paper (product) but it can also be considered as a movement (process). Understanding of the handwriting product will not be complete until the handwriting process is understood. Therefore, handwriting movement has been researched since measurement techniques became available. However, before recording and processing handwriting movements were within reach for those interested in studying handwriting movements, three components were required: Devices to capture handwriting movements, laboratory computers to store and process the movement data, and computer software which enables the researcher to do this under specific experimental paradigms without the need to program untested custom software. Handwriting movement analysis software is also used for studying drawing, eye–hand coordination, or any other situation where the researcher wishes to record movements using a pen. Earliest devices to capture handwriting movements Elisha Gray's \\"Telautograph\\", US Patent 386,815 (1888), followed by four more similar patents (1891–93). See the \\"Annotated Bibliography in Pen Computing and Handwriting Recognition\\" by Jean Renard Ward (http://users.erols.com/rwservices/biblio.html). Handwriting could only be transmitted by wire and reproduced elsewhere in real-time. Scripture (1895) developed a writing apparatus that enabled storage of pen positions on paper at 100 Hz. This apparatus permitted measurement of durations of individual handwriting strokes (McAllister, 1900). Earliest laboratory computers Handwriting movements are fast, non-repetitive with a primary frequency around 5 Hz and a bandwidth of about 10 Hz. While sampling rates of 20 Hz would theoretically suffice, up-sampling will be needed to properly visualize the Lissajous-like handwriting and drawing strokes. Higher-than- necessary sampling rates such as 100 Hz are preferred as this would also allow low-pass filtering or smoothed data with reduced equipment and quantization noise by factor = . A laboratory computer will be needed to store, process, and visualize massive numbers of samples. It took more than 50 years for computers to be available in laboratories. Electronic analog computers were used until digital computers came within reach for research: Wang Laboratories, Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), Apple Inc., IBM PC (Personal Computer), Norsk Data, Atari, Osborne Computer Corporation, and Data General. Most of these innovative mini and microcomputer companies have discontinued their operation. Pen movement recording devices The first devices to accurately record handwriting that could be connected to computers were graphics tablet, or digitizer, x-y-tablet, graphics pad, with electronic pens as we know them today. Among the earliest tablets are the Styalator electronic tablet with pen for computer input and handwriting recognition in 1957 and the commercial products by Vector General. The Vector General products reported the position of the stylus at 100 Hz and claimed an accuracy of 0.1 cm. Typical tablets sense the position of the pen electromagnetically. Touch-sensitive tablets cannot be used when the hand is resting on the tablet unless they implement some form of hand rejection. Tablets can have a display built in (e.g., as in a tablet PC). Still today, handwriting tablets are the gold standard to record handwriting. Sampling rates used to be 100 Hz until it was decided that the minimum rate for Human Input Devices HID should be at least 133 Hz, bumping the sampling rates up to 133 – 200 Hz. The advantage is a 15%–40% reduction of device noise and quantization noise. The digitizer technology belongs to the most accurate and cost-effective pointing devices. Dynamic accuracy of 0.01 cm at constant frequency is achievable. Opaque tablets are produced by Wacom who also produces display digitizers, Euronovate SA, Hanvon, VisTablet, Adesso, Genius. Pen-based handwriting capturing devices have been developed but never achieved the accuracy of tablets. Currently many novel systems appear on the market that \\"record\\" handwriting, such as those by Anoto, and also EMG-based systems. Many pen movement recording systems capture, not only the x and y coordinates of the pen top, but also axial pen pressure, an x an y tilt or altitude and azimuth of the pen barrel. Handwriting movement measurement systems can capture: * x = Horizontal coordinates; parallel to the baseline in Western script * y = Vertical coordinates; perpendicular to the horizontal base line and in the writing surface. * z = Axial pen pressure; as pressure data are often non-linearly related to actual pressure, pen orientation will be needed to estimate normal pressure. Optionally, digitizers can deliver the orientation of the pen barrel relative to the tablet: * Altitude = How steep the pen is held; this angle can be used to estimate pen pressure perpendicular to the paper from the axial pen pressure. * Azimuth = Direction of the pen barrel projected on the x-y plane. Ideally, each set of coordinates should be sampled simultaneously and at a fixed frequency, and include times stamps per coordinate to correct non- isochronous sampling. Additional features that can be measured by the digitizers (mostly in past models) include pen height, pen barrel rotation, and grip forces (e.g., at the 3 finger grip areas). Handwriting movement analysis software Handwriting movements are being studied from many disciplines including kinesiology, human movement science, biomechanics of the hand, fine motor control, handedness, human-computer interaction, visuomotor control, visual feedback, goal-directed movements, drawing, experimental psychology, psychiatry, extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) or movement side effects due to medication, neurology, movement disorders, Parkinson's disease, dystonia, writer's cramp, physiotherapy, remedial handwriting instruction, occupational therapy, child development, developmental disorders, education, elementary education, home schooling, reeducation, linguistics, language, communication, stuttering, forensic document examination, document analysis, forensic document examination or questioned document examination, signature verification and identification, handwriting image analysis, computer science, artificial intelligence, handwriting recognition, etc. The next wave consisted of packaged software that could be made available to record handwriting at many locations. Most initial software systems were developed by university researchers who, often, were the only ones capable of using it. Even today, it is a major accomplishment to make software available as a package that can be installed on an unknown computer and can be used after a brief familiarization time by other users who have not been involved. Over the last several years, software packages have appeared on the market that can be used by many other researchers interested in the field of handwriting movement analysis. CSWin The first handwriting movement analysis offered for sale (around 1980) was CSWin by Science And Motion and developed by Christian Marquardt and Norbert May in Munich, Germany. CSWin was marketed in Germany and is being used in many German hospitals. It was used for treating 500 writer’s cramp patients. The present company focuses on golf training and was established in 2003 and is run by the owner, Christian Marquardt. Their oldest publication is by Marquardt and Mai (1994). Oasis Another early system was Oasis by KikoSoft, The Netherlands, which was established in 1995 by Peter De Jong. Oasis can be customized by its flexible macro language. In 1998, this system was used to develop an automated test-battery for psychopharmacological research: Orgabat. One of the oldest references to Oasis is De Jong, Hulstijn, Kosterman, and Smits-Engelsman (1996). Pullman spiral acquisition and analysis At Columbia university, Prof. Dr. Seth Pullman developed Pullman Spiral Acquisition and Analysis. It is used to test tremor in Parkinson patients. In 2002, Pullman received US Patent 6,454,706: \\"System and method for clinically assessing motor function\\". Patients with motor disorders such as Parkinson's disease draw spirals. The software calculates first-order smoothness, second-order smoothness, tightness of the spiral, zero-crossing rate, second-order zero-crossing rate, and derives from these score a degree of severity score. Their system enables objectively assessing motor function by physicians who are not skilled or experienced in evaluating motor disorders, for example general practitioners or pediatricians who are not certified in the practice of neurology. An early publication about his spiral analysis is by Pullman (1998). Neuroskill Another Handwriting Analysis system is Neuroskill by Verifax, Boulder, Colorado, USA, which was founded in 1990 by Dr. Ruth Shrairman and Alex Landau. Neuroskill was designed for biometric measurement, security purposes, and Parkinson medication effects and has many applications in movement disorders. Verifax began operations with the aim of developing a biometric tool for the verification of signatures from a distance (VeriFax Autograph Technology). Verifax developed two more applications using application-specific modifications of their customized Neuroskill software: Applications for substance abuse screening and detection, monitoring for toxic inhalants and environmental distress, and accurate signature identification for security/privacy protection and forgery detection. Target markets could include neuromuscular disease centers, drug and alcohol abuse clinics, occupational health centers and the security industry. In the process, they applied their technology to biometric measurements as a clinical monitoring tool for physicians investigating neuromuscular diseases. In 2003, NeuroSkill received a US patent 6,546,134: \\"System for assessment of fine motor control in humans\\". Their method estimates stability, smoothness and synchronization of the writer's motion as quantifying measures of the neurological function using their Correlation Function Analysis (CFA) of behavioral signals. CFA returns numerical scores and charts expressing stability of the handwriting strokes and the characteristics of the phase distortions in reproducing cursive samples. Another application was to evaluate persons with critical skills (e.g., airline pilots, bus drivers) for physical and mental performance impairments caused by stress, physiological disorders, and alcohol and drug abuse using their proprietary VeriFax Impairoscope writing instrument. This last application raised the possibility of using a space-qualified Impairoscope variant to evaluate astronaut performance with respect to the impacts of stress, fatigue, excessive workload, build-up of toxic chemicals within the space habitat, etc. In 2009, the iNeuroskill web portal was established under a new business entity: iNeuroskill. The website enables Parkinson patients to upload their signatures that were recorded using a digitizing tablet. They receive immediate feedback regarding their fine motor function in the form of a chart analysis. Their oldest article is by Morgenthaler, Shrairman, and Landau (1998). MovAlyzeR MovAlyzeR was developed by NeuroScript, Tempe, AZ, USA. NeuroScript was founded in 1997 by Prof. Dr. George Stelmach, who has since retired, and Dr. Hans-Leo Teulings. In 1999 Gregory M. Baker joined as MovAlyzeR’s designer and implementer. This handwriting movement analysis software is the first to demonstrate that it can discern movement side-effects due to schizophrenia medication better than with any conventional evaluation method used in psychiatry today (international patent pending) (Caligiuri et al., 2009a, b). MovAlyzeR is currently the only handwriting movement analysis software that is certified for Microsoft Windows XP and Vista. It can be integrated with MATLAB and perform image processing on scanned handwriting exemplars. It is used in fields ranging from research in human movement sciences, kinesiology, psychology, education, aging research, psychiatry, neurology, occupational therapy, forensic document examination, computer science (handwriting recognition, signature verification), to educational demonstrations or student projects in these fields. The oldest references to MovAlyzeR are Teulings and Romero (2003), Teulings and Van Gemmert, (2003), Romero and Teulings (2003). ComPET At the University of Haifa, Dr. Sara Rosenblum and Patricia L (Tamar) Weiss and colleagues developed a computerized handwriting evaluation system called POET: Penmanship Objective Evaluation Tool using MATLAB. It was used to administer visual stimuli and to record and analyze handwriting movements. They researched the Air Phenomenon: Pen movements above the paper (air strokes). The oldest mention of POET is in Rosenblum, Parush, Epstain, and Weiss (2003). Soon afterward, POET was developed further and renamed to ComPET: Computerized Penmanship Evaluation Tool. It is used to study children with dysgraphia, Developmental Coordination Disorders (DCD) and adults with several pathologies as Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Depression, Alzheimer, Parkinson as well as aging effects.http://research.haifa.ac.il/~rosens/ResearchDescriptionBlurb.pdf It is also used with verbal-based lie detection technology such as the polygraph. Eye and Pen Eye and Pen is a software developed at the University of Poitiers (France) to synchronously record handwriting and eye mouvements. Its first version aims at studying periods of pause and writing in text production (G-Studio; 1994). After a complete rewriting to support MS-Windows, eye mouvement recording was added to get insight into reading during writing and information retrievial. Its evolution is the fruit of collaborations with handwriting researchers, mostly of the psychology lab of the University of Poitiers (Denis Alamargot, Eric lambert, Cyril Perret, Thierry Olive). Now it integrates audio recording, synchronization signals (from/to other computers, software or devices), data tagging tools as well as various data filtering and extraction modules, opening ways to multimodal researches. After a commercial distribution (2004-2018), it is now freely distributed. The oldest references to Eye and Pen are Chesnet and Alamargot (2005), Alamargot, Chesnet, Dansac, Ros, C. (2006). MedDraw MedDraw is a computer-based drawing-task diagnosis and rehabilitation system project between the University of Kent, UK and the University of Rouen, France, coordinated by Dr. Richard Guest and started in 2003. The project aims to develop a robust, state-of-the art, yet easy to use clinical system producing objective diagnostic recommendations across a range of clinical conditions. Their focus is to detect spatial neglect in the visual field and organization of movement disorder. They will remain focused on drawing-based diagnosis of these disorders. The first research publications that mention MedDraw are by Kaplani, Guest, and Fairhurst (2005), and by Glenat, Heutte, Paquet, and Mellier (2005). The programm goes offline since 2006. Extended Drawing Test (EDT) The Extended Drawing Test is a computerized graphonomic assessment for arm and hand function. The EDT measures the ability of the subject to draw vertical lines, with both the left and right hands. To compare performance between gross arm movements and fine finger control, the subjects draw lines holding either the tablet's pen (held by the fingers) or a mouse (held by the whole hand). The latter movements do not include finger movements. Norms have been established for 3- to 70-year-old healthy persons. Deviations from the healthy norms will reflect different pathologies for different patient groups, e.g., hemiplegic stroke patients. The first paper mentioning EDT is Vuillermot, Pescatore, Holper, Kiper, and Eng (2009).

As a journalist he made his name as an editor for il Resto del Carlino (1928-1930) and Il Gazzettino (1936) before graduating to the editorship of Il Popolo d'Italia in December 1936. He retained this post until 1943, although in the Italian Social Republic Pini, who was a noted moderate, returned to the local Resto.Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right, p. 297 He did however serve as an undersecretary in the Ministry of the Interior in 1944. Pini was most noted in Fascist Italy for his biography of Benito Mussolini, a hagiography from which Il Duce profited financially.P.

His continuing justifications for fascism led him to far right politics in the post-war era and he was a founding member of the Italian Social Movement (MSI).P. Davies & D. Lynch, Routledge Companion to Fascism and the Far Right, 2002, p. 207 Within the MSI he was part of the 'left-wing' tendency that sought to add socialist economics to their rhetoric and when his position was not adopted he left in January 1952 to help launch the Raggruppamento Sociale Repubblicano with Concetto Pettinato. Pini continued his career on the socialist fringes of the far right and frequently attacked the MSI in later years for forging links to regimes in Greece, South Africa and Portugal that he dismissed as reactionary.

A skilled artisan, architect, and innovator in the use of concrete Earley is best known for the invention of the Earley Process, a technique also known as polychrome, architectural or mosaic concrete. Life Meridian Hill Park At age seventeen, he began work as an apprentice at his father’s studio in Rosslyn, Virginia to learn sculpture, modelmaking, and stonecarving. James Earley moved his family to Washington, DC in 1900 and leased property on G Street to build a new home for his business. Basil Taylor, another apprentice, impressed James with his ability and when James became seriously ill, he asked Taylor to stay on and help his son run the studio. In 1907, he built the John J. Earley Office and Studio at 2131 G Street, Northwest, Washington, D.C. After his father’s death, John Earley and Basil Taylor changed the focus of the work from stone and sculpture to plaster and stucco and over the next several years built the Earley Studio to become a significant business. The Earley Studio received contracts for both government and private work, including the remodeling of the interior of the White House during President Roosevelt’s first term, and the elaborate main lobby of the new building for the Willard Hotel, constructed in 1902 at Pennsylvania Avenue and 14th Street NW in Washington, DC. In 1906, Earley began investigating exposed aggregate concrete. Attracted to the use of color in Byzantine architecture, he was interested in trying to duplicate this effect in concrete. In 1914, Earley modeled a stylized Indian Head bust for the Q Street Bridge, now known as the Dumbarton Bridge, being constructed over Rock Creek Park in Washington, DC, using as a basis the life mask of Sioux Chief Kicking Bear (from Earley's model, 56 sandstone busts were then carved for the bridge). In 1915, John Earley worked closely with the Commission of Fine Arts and produced a full- size mock up of a wall section for Meridian Hill Park. While Cass Gilbert, Chairman of the Commission, suggested that an acceptable finish for the walls might be produced by imitating Italian pebble mosaics, it was Earley that developed the technique of mixing the aggregate in the concrete and scrubbing the surface to produce a natural-looking pebble finish. Earley called the result “architectural concrete”, and it was used with great success for the walls, balustrades, benches, urns, and obelisks of Meridian Hill Park. From 1934 to November 1945, the Earley Studio worked on several notable architectural concrete structures including the Bahá'í House of Worship (Wilmette, Illinois), Shrine of the Sacred Heart, the Thomas Alva Edison Memorial and the experimental “Polychrome Houses” built in Silver Spring, Maryland. While working on the Edison Memorial project, Earley suffered a stroke and died two weeks later on November 25, 1945. On his deathbed he sold the Earley Studio to Basil Taylor for a single dollar. His papers are held at the Archives of American Art.http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/john-joseph- and-james-f-earley-photographs-and-reproductions-8856 List of Projects Earley Contributed To * Bahá'í House of Worship (Wilmette, Illinois) * Dumbarton Bridge (Washington, D.C.) * Peace Cross (Washington.

Focusing on Jewish and Israeli issues, the festival has shown hundreds of films ranging both in genre and theme and held in the Aaron & Cecile Goldman Theater in the Washington DC Jewish Community Center and other cinemas in Washington and suburban Maryland and Virginia. The festival was founded by Aviva Kempner in 1989 and has successfully run for over twenty years and is presented by the Washington DCJCC's Morris Cafritz Center for the Arts. Mission Promote the preservation of Jewish culture and a diversity of narratives. The Festival provides a forum for films with Jewish themes that most often do not otherwise find a place for public exhibition in the Washington, D.C. area. Many of the films we screen only have a life on the Festival circuit and in specialty DVD- release meaning that attendees have the opportunity to experience rarely seen films. Encourage Innovation and vitality within Jewish culture. The festival highlights films that place Jewish themes in new contexts or challenge long- held assumptions. The WJFF is at the forefront of presenting films that provide a constructive critique of Jewish identity and reconsider major cultural guideposts such as Zionism, the Holocaust and assimilation as well as the place of women, homosexuals and other people of diverse backgrounds and lifestyles in Jewish life and tradition. Expose the widest possible audience to a low-cost, low barrier entry to the Jewish culture. Because the Jewish Diaspora has interacted with numerous host cultures over the course of its long history, the Festival seeks out films that examine some aspect of the Jewish experience, which often act as a prism through which to view multiple cultures. The festival is also dedicated to presenting films which will engage a wide audience at the lowest possible cost. Provide a forum for audiences to interact with filmmakers and for filmmakers to receive feedback. Filmmakers attending the Festival engage in open and energetic dialogue with the Festival's audience. Through the works-in-progress program for uncompleted projects, the Festival provides new and veteran filmmakers opportunities to screen works-in-progress portions of their films for an audience at a critical point in their creative process.

Career  Moth moved to the United States and worked for KHOU in Houston, Texas, for about seven years before moving to CNN in 1990. Moth covered the Persian Gulf War, the rioting that followed Indira Gandhi's assassination, the civil war in Tbilisi, Georgia, and the Bosnian War. She had been described by colleagues as quirky, tough, fearless and funny. In July 1992, Moth was shot and severely wounded while filming in Sniper Alley in Sarajevo. Because of this injury, considerable damage was done to her body, and her speech became slurred.

This was the first film in the series not to feature Dirk Bogarde, although he did return for the next film in the series Doctor in Distress. Plot Dr Richard Hare is a recently graduated medical intern at St Swithins Hospital. When his new romantic interest, nurse Sally Nightingale, suddenly leaves the hospital, he is devastated. He also leaves after being offered a job in private practice. But when his senior partner, Dr Cardew, has to visit California for a few months, Hare is left in charge. Dr Nicola Barrington joins the practice and Hare is suddenly in love again. The romance doesn't go well, especially when Sally re-appears and takes the job of practice secretary. Nicola is hurt and stalks off. She is replaced by Dr Tony Burke who proceeds to airily order expensive equipment that the practice cannot afford. Hare struggles through various comedic and other complications, mainly stemming from Burke's amorous attentions to female patients. After enlisting Sir Lancelot Spratt's assistance to save a young dying boy, he diagnoses Spratt with appendicitis and decides to operate, despite Spratt's loud objections.

Before entering politics, Dougherty spent many years in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, working as a stockman, buying and selling cattle. In the late 1950s, he befriended the Kennedy family, enabling his rise in politics.http://www.southdakotamagazine.com/editors_notebook.php?p=2850 Political career In 1960, he worked on Massachusetts Senator John F. Kennedy's presidential campaign, meeting Kennedy's brother, future Senator Ted Kennedy, during that campaign.http://www.ksfy.com/news/local/55233352.html Although John F. Kennedy won the presidency that year, the Republican nominee, Richard Nixon, won South Dakota's four electoral votes. In 1968, Dougherty managed New York Senator Robert F. Kennedy's South Dakota campaign for the Democratic nomination for the presidency; with Dougherty at the helm, Kennedy won the South Dakota primary on the same day he won the California primary. However, Kennedy was assassinated in Los Angeles, California that night; Dougherty had spoken to him on the telephone twice shortly before the assassination. One of those calls, in which Kennedy congratulated his South Dakotan supporters over a speaker phone, was taped by Dougherty and eventually preserved on a compact disc. Also in 1968, Dougherty managed freshman Democratic Senator George McGovern's successful re-election campaign. Four years later, Dougherty held a major post in McGovern's unsuccessful campaign for the presidency. After receiving the Democratic nomination, McGovern replaced his running mate, Missouri Senator Thomas Eagleton, with former Ambassador to France Sargent Shriver of Maryland, after being urged to do so by Dougherty, among others. In a 1973 book, Neil R. Peirce described his 1969 interview of Dougherty: > ...With his lean figure, Western blue jeans, cowboy hat, and boots, he looks > as if he would be more at home in a Marlboro cigarette ad than working > closely with the sophisticated Kennedy clan of the old East. ... When I > first interviewed Dougherty in 1969, I was amazed by his confidence that the > South Dakota Democratic party of the 1970s could become consistently > competitive with the GOP, building a coalition of farmers, college people, > intellectual suburbanites, and labor and cutting down the Republican edge in > the cities. The breakdown of South Dakota's insularity through television > and travel was leading in that direction, Dougherty argued; he said his own > attitudes on race were greatly altered by travel with Bobby Kennedy to the > ghettos of the great cities and subsequently by the nine-hour ride on > Bobby's funeral train from New York to Washington, watching impoverished > blacks and others who lined the train platforms in 100-degree to honor their > fallen hero. Dougherty also served as a member of the Democratic National Committee; when he first joined the committee, he was, at the age of 36, its youngest member. Lieutenant governor Dougherty was elected Lieutenant Governor of South Dakota in 1970, running on a ticket with State Senator Richard F. Kneip. Kneip and Dougherty were re-elected in 1972. In 1974, Dougherty unsuccessfully challenged Kneip for the Democratic nomination for governor, and then retired from public office. He was succeeded as lieutenant governor by Harvey L. Wollman in 1975. Lobbyist After leaving public office, Dougherty launched a lengthy lobbying career in Pierre, the state capital. He became one of the state's best-known lobbyists; veteran state legislator Bernie Hunhoff has described Dougherty's lobbying career as \\"colorful.\\" Dougherty spent a good deal of his career representing liquor and tobacco interests. More recently, Dougherty represented the South Dakota Petroleum Marketers on a task force on open government put together by South Dakota Attorney General Larry Long. The task force reviewed statutory limits on public access to state and local government records.http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/analysis.aspx?id=6506 He retired from his lobbying career in 2009.

The name aina hou means \\"new land\\". An older ranch called Keauhou (not to be confused with the community of Keauhou, on the western side of the island) had been established here in 1921, so a primitive trail existed, and the Chain of Craters Road had recently been built within a few miles. Herbert C. Shipman built a house on the remote ranch in 1941 for the family as a refuge for the anticipated Japanese invasion of Hawaii. It was used as a working cattle ranch, raising beef for the military during World War II. After a tsunami in 1946 devastated the Puna Shipman property, killing half the endangered nēnē he was raising there, he built pens at Ainahou to continue raising them. After the war, it was estimated only about 30 birds existed in the wild. Herbert Shipman reintroduced two pairs to the Pohakuloa Training Area, and worked with British ornithologist Peter Scott to expand the breeding program to England, possibly saving the species from extinction. The Shipman family also kept many exotic plants at the ranch, including some of the first orchids raised on the island. Herbert (president of the Hawaii Orchid Society) was awarded a gold medal in 1957 by the American Orchid Society for contributions to the industry. After being threatened by a lava flow in 1969, the house was evacuated.

In 1904 he began to use the pseudonym by which he was later known: Biófilo, lover of life, and Panclasta, enemy of all.\\"Seven Years Buried Alive\\". Seattle: Ritmomaquia, 2013. p60 He traveled to more than fifty countries, agitating for anarchist ideas and taking part in worker and union demonstrations, in the course of which he befriended such people as Kropotkin, Maxim Gorky, and Lenin. Biography=Early life The son of Bernardo Rojas and Simona Lizcano, a working-class woman, Biófilo began his studies in Pamplona, a city close to Chinácota. From 1897 to 1898 he was in the Escuela Normal of Bucaramanga, from which he was expelled for publishing a small periodical in which he denounced the re- election of president Miguel Antonio Caro.VILLANUEVA, Orlando; VEGA, Renán; GAMBOA, Juan, CLAVIJO, Amadeo; FAJARDO, Luis (1992). Ediciones Alas de Xue. Here is a popular quote of his: \\"Being ruled over is just as repulsive a thought to me as being ruler. Each man must be his own road, I don´t follow and I´ll never ask to be followed\\" Participation in the Venezuelan Revolution In 1899 he left school and traveled to Venezuela, where, with Eleazar López Contreras, he founded the first Public School in the town of Capacho Nuevo, the capital of the Independencia municipality (State of Táchira). That same year he signs up for the army of the Venezuelan Cipriano Castro, which had as its goal the downfall of president Ignacio Andrade. He soon left this group behind and wandered around Venezuela with other revolutionary groups that prowled through Trujillo, Portuguesa, Cojedes and Carabobo.PANCLASTA, Biófilo (1932): Siete años enterrado vivo en una de las mazmorras de Gomezuela. Tipografía la Libertad, Bogotá. He arrived at the city of Valencia in January 1900. In November 1904 he traveled to the Colombian city of Baranquilla, now as a coronel in the army of Cipriano Castro; he offered his support as a fighter to the Colombian forces against the Panamanian separatists supported by the United States.\\"Seven Years Buried Alive\\". Seattle: Ritmomaquia, 2013. First contacts with Anarchism In 1906 he traveled to Buenos Aires, Argentina. There his contact with anarchist and socialist thought began as he attended meetings and wrote for partisan newspapers. That same year, he left for Europe as a delegate of the Federación Obrera Regional Argentina to the Workers' Congress in Amsterdam. In the Netherlands he was invited by the Social Studies group to give the opposing opinion to a talk by Bestraud called \\"Anarchy Against Life.\\" Revolutionary Activity in Colombia In 1908 he was exiled from Spain at the request of the Colombian president, Rafael Reyes. He arrived in Puerto Colombia with the plan of continuing to Bogotá; however, he chose to travel again and take refugue in Panama, from which he was once again exiled by order of Rafael Reyes. He was imprisoned and turned over to Colombian authorities. From then on Biófilo Panclasta would only leave one prison to enter another: he was jailed in Cartagena (1909), Barranquilla (1910) and Bogotá (1911). Certain national newspapers such as Maquetas demanded the death sentence for him, stating that he was a danger to public order. Return to Venezuela: Valencia Prison \\"The prisoners who had seen me enter into the cell were careful, in their entrance, not to trip over my cold, weak body. One of them felt with his hand my flesh, which did not shudder because I had already suffered all pain, and observing that I neither moved nor spoke, exclaimed sadly and softly, 'They hung this one in the Police Station and brought him to die here.'\\" \\"Seven Years Buried Alive\\". Seattle: Ritmomaquia, 2013. p95 Biófilo returned to the Venezuelan city of Valencia in 1914. There he was imprisoned giving a speech in praise of the French nation in a public square, days after the beginning of the First World War. The real reason he was imprisoned was the orders given by the underlings of president Juan Vicente Gómez, who had succeeded Cipriano Castro, Panclasta's friend, in a coup d'état. During the seven years he remained in prison, Biófilo was subjected to forced labor, deprivation, and hunger, according to each successive warden's wishes. He spent his prison years with various Venezuelan political prisoners, many of whom died in that jail. In 1921, thanks to a warden assigned by the recently named governor of the state of Carabobo, José Antonio Baldó, Biófilo was transferred to Castillo Libertador, where he was treated more humanely and set free in a few months. Revolutionary activity around the world In 1923, two years after leaving the Valencia prison, Biófilo was selected as delegate of the Mexican Anarchist Association to a congress in Barcelona. There he proposed a project named Operation Europe, which had as its goal: The following year he traveled to São Paulo to help organize a coffee-growers' strike, but was once more jailed and transferred to the city of Cayena, from which he escaped. The League of the Rights of Man sent him to Martinique; having secretly visited fifty-two countries, he returned to Colombia. There he was imprisoned together with the syndicalist Raúl Mahecha, in the city of San Gil. The following year, in Bogotá, he founded the Centro de Unión y Acción Revolucionaria [Center for Revolutionary Unity and Action], whose lemma was: \\"Revolutionaries of all ideals, unite!\\" Last years In 1934, Biófilo Panclasta began cohabiting with Julia Ruiz, a well-known fortune teller who worked in Bogotá. He dedicated his time to writing for newspapers and granting interviews, also sending letters to some Latin American presidents. His companion died in January 1939. One year later, Biófilo attempted suicide in Barranquilla, electrocuting himself and cutting his throat with a straight razor. In December of that year, the Bucaramanga police banned him from the city for being a derelict and an alcoholic. He died on March 1, 1943, in the old folk's home of Pamplona, from a tremendous heart attack. Anarchist Thought Biófilo Panclasta's ideas on anarchism were quite idiosyncratic. He oscillated between individualist anarchism and social anarchism, which can be seen in a series of letters he wrote from Barranquilla prison in 1910. At first, Biófilo presented himself as an extreme and radical individualist, echoing the ideas of his favorite philosopher, Nietzsche. Biófilo hated the herd: For Panclasta, the social struggle he carried out was not for others, but for himself, to feel alive. Fighting for others allowed him, he said, to unfold all his capacities for action, for love or hate. But Biófilo was just as capable of identifying with social anarchism. Biófilo's opinions on both currents of anarchism are of a piece with his overall way of thinking, that of someone who hated absolutes and extremes, who thought that people are neither completely social nor entirely individual. He tried to distance himself from any form of political militancy, even anarchist organizations. He wrote of a conversation with Kropotkin where he told him: Biófilo Panclasta's way of thinking shows that, more than a man of ideas, he was a man of action. Biófilo used the need that people have to free themselves from oppression to act from; for him, organizations are effective only in practice, not in a programmatic sense. They work based on human interests, which he called situational interests. Works Books in English translation * Seven Years Buried Alive. Seattle: Ritmomaquia, 2013.

The airport was a pre-World War II French Air Force (Armée de l'Air) airfield. After the Battle of France, it was seized by Nazi Germany in November 1942. It was later used by the Luftwaffe, and after the Allied Invasion of southern France in August 1944, by the United States Army Air Forces Twelfth Air Force. Used by the French Air Force base after the war, it was closed and today the airport is used for general aviation, with no commercial airline service. It is still occasionally used by military aircraft. The French army aviation (Aviation légère de l'Armée de terre) have maintained a small enclave here for many years operating a small number of diverse helicopter types as part of the test unit GALSTA/STAT. Closure of this facility (with the unit moving to Le Luc) was announced some years ago, but it would appear this has been rescinded. History The airport's origin dates from the 1930s when the French Air Force (Armée de l'Air) established Valence- Chabeuil Air Base. It was the headquarters for the Zone d'Opérations Aériennes des Alpes - Z.O.A.A.(Alps Air Operations Area).Armée de l'Air Order of Battle, 10 May 1940 Known operational units assigned were: * G.R.

With the outbreak of war in May 1940, the unit did not see action against the Germans in the Battle of France. However, operations were flown against the Italian Army (Regio Esercito) after the Italian invasion of France on 10 June.

It is her second published book, following Ceremony. The work is a combination of stories and poetry inspired by traditional Laguna Pueblo storytelling. Silko's writings in Storyteller are influenced by her upbringing in Laguna, New Mexico, where she was surrounded by traditional Laguna Pueblo values but was also educated in a Euro-American system. Her education began with kindergarten at a Bureau of Indian Affairs school called the Laguna Day School \\"where the speaking of the Laguna language was punished.\\" Silko primarily focuses on the Laguna Pueblo in Storyteller; however, she also draws influence from Inuit culture, which she experienced when she resided in Alaska's Rosewater Foundation-on-Ketchikan Creek while writing Ceremony. Many of the poems and short stories collected in Storyteller have been reprinted, and several were published previously. The book itself has been published three times between 1981 and 2012.  Background = Editions and versions  Storyteller was initially published by Seaver Books in 1981. In 1989 Richard Seaver republished Storyteller under his publishing house Arcade Publishing. Seaver was also Silko's editor for Ceremony, her preceding novel published in 1977 under Viking Press. Although Seaver was known for working with authors outside of the literary establishment and challenging censorship, when working on Ceremony, he attempted to edits parts that were integral to Silko's story. In one attempt he tried to edit the scene in which a character, Betonie, explains \\"it was Indian witchery that made white people in the first place,\\" a story which is also told and elaborated upon in Storyteller. Seaver also initially deleted the poem that concluded Ceremony, wanting a more conventional end to the novel. However, Silko did not approve those changes, and Seaver ultimately conceded. In 1989 Seaver then went on to republish the even less conventional Storyteller under Arcade Publishing, which he founded with his wife in 1988. The first version of Storyteller was oriented horizontally because Silko wanted to experiment with space, especially with her poetry. Silko notes in her \\"Introduction\\" to the Penguin version of Storyteller that she carefully considered the sizing, orientation, and space on the pages of Storyteller in order to “convey time and distance and feeling of the story as it was told aloud.” Penguin Books published Storyteller’s second edition in 2012 because they consider it a classic in Native American Literature. Both editions are nine by seven inches, but the second edition is oriented vertically rather than horizontally. Despite the reduction in space, Silko notes that the “wide poems” still have enough room in the most recent edition. Because of this change in orientation, Silko had to remove and replace several photos. However, she added more photos of her family to the second edition.  Genre  The Penguin Random House website categorizes Storyteller as \\"Poetry\\" and \\"Fiction.\\" However, as a collection, it is usually described through explaining its various mediums. In N. Scott Momoday's review of Storyteller in 1981, he calls it \\"a rich, many- faceted book [consisting] of short stories, anecdotes, folktales, poems, historical and autobiographical notes, and photographs.\\"  Contents = Photography  In the \\"Introduction\\" to the second version of Storyteller, Silko writes that she wanted readers to have a sense about the landscape and family she came from, so she included photographs as a way to help give readers this context. Silko's father, Lee Marmon, took the majority of the photos featured in Storyteller. She writes of his contribution in her \\"Acknowledgements.\\" All the photos in Storyteller are in black and white. The majority of the photos feature Silko and her family as well as the mesas and landscape surrounding her Laguna village. Within the \\"Acknowledgements,\\" Silko also includes a link to the New Mexico Digital Collections, which showcases the Lee Marmon collection of photos. In \\"The Telling Which Continues\\": Oral Tradition and the Written Word in Leslie Marmon Silko's Storyteller,\\" Bernard Hirsch notes how the photographs \\"are arranged to suggest the circular design of Storyteller, a design characteristic of oral tradition.\\" According to Hirsh, the photographs and their arrangements help merge the \\"personal, historical, and cultural levels of being and experience.\\"  Poetry  The poems in Storyteller make up the bulk of the collection, greatly outnumbering the amount of short stories and photographs they accompany. Silko has commented on her poetic structure, saying, “I gave examples of what I heard as best as I could remember, and how I developed these elements into prose, into fiction, and into poetry, moving from what was basically an oral tradition into a written tradition.” Silko gives readers further insight into her writing process in the untitled poem that begins “This is the way Aunt Susie told the story.” She says, “I write when I still hear / her voice as she tells the story.” In a review of Storyteller, Jim Ruppert points out that Silko uses characters and voices in poems and \\"creates a reality the merges with\\" extra- textual reality.Laguna Pueblo, New Mexico as photographed by John K. Hillers in 1879.  Short stories  Since publishing Storyteller in the 1980s, Silko has primarily published novels and long works, rather than short stories or collections. \\"Yellow Woman\\" and \\"Lullaby,\\" short stories published within Storyteller, have been widely anthologized. In The Old Lady Trill, the Victory Yell: The Power of Women in Native American Literature, Patrice Hollrah noted, \\"Silko prefers promoting a political agenda through her stories rather than any other format....\\" In Storyteller Silko addresses social issues resulting from colonialism and colliding cultures, which can be seen in some of the works in the collection such as \\"Tony’s Story,\\" which in part deals with racial discrimination against American Indian men. Silko's short stories have been compared to work by Toni Morrison and Maxine Hong Kingston.  Major themes = Storytelling  In the \\"Introduction\\" to Storyteller, Silko writes about the history and importance of language and storytelling as culture and as a way to survive. She details the importance of storytelling both for all people and specifically for the Laguna people. She writes, “The entire culture, all the knowledge, experience, and beliefs, were kept in the human memory of the Pueblo in the form of narratives that were told and retold from generation to generation.\\" Silko notes that the Laguna people were all responsible for telling stories, which were “narrative accounts of incidents that the teller has experienced or heard about.” She writes that she was lucky to have been born at a time when the older members of her community still would tell stories for the children. Leslie Marmon Silko in 2011 reading from her memoir The Turquoise Ledge: A Memoir.  Oral tradition  Critics have noted the influence of the oral tradition in Storyteller. Paul Lorenz explains in The Other Side of Leslie Marmon Silko's \\"Storyteller,\\" \\"For the story, the location of events in time is essentially meaningless.\\" Additionally, Bernard Hirsh notes that “The experience in living the reality revealed in her grandfather’s stories has shown her the oneness of past and present, of historical and mythic time, and of the stories, and the people.” Even though Silko is inspired by the oral tradition and storytelling, she does not consider herself a traditional storyteller. She noted in an interview with Kim Barnes, \\"I write them down because I like seeing how I can translate this sort of feeling or flavor or sense of a story that's told and heard on to the page.\\"  Reception  When Silko first published Storyteller, she did not anticipate the book having a wide audience. It has generally been well received and is often placed on college reading lists. In an interview with Kim Barnes, Silko explained that “The book is written for people who are interested in that relationship between the spoken and the written.” Storyteller was reviewed by writer N. Scott Momoday in the New York Times after the books initial release in 1981. In his review he calls the book “a melange.\\" He notes there are “moments of considerable beauty and intensity, moments in which, according to the central tenet of storytelling, the language is celebrated.” He also praises Silko for her sense of humor and keen eye for where “the profound and the mundane often run together in our daily lives.” He closes noting the importance of the distinction of a storyteller and writes, “If [Silko] is not yet a storyteller, she promises to become one.” When Storyteller was republished in 2012 under Penguin, the New York Times placed Storyteller on its Sunday Book Review Paperback Row. When first published in 1981, it made the Los Angeles Times “Notable\\" books list. It was also made a \\"Noteworthy\\" paperback book by Alex Raksin in the Los Angeles Times in 1987. When it was reissued in 1989 through Arcade Publishing, Storyteller made the \\"Fiction Best Sellers\\" list for Southern California in the LA Times.  Previously published  Some of Silko's poems and short stories in Storyteller were also published in other contexts and anthologies.

It was produced by Yorkshire Television and broadcast from 1986 to 1987. Its second, and final, series was simply called Farrington.  Plot  Harriet Farrington arrives to take charge at a small, unimportant British Consulate. She is horrified to find out how indolent and scheming her staff are, and - with more than a hint of Margaret Thatcher about her mannerisms - sets out turn the Consulate around.  Characters  The major protagonists were: *Harriet Farrington (Angela Thorne), the strict, no-nonsense new Consul- General. *Annie Begley (Joan Sims), Harriet's only friend at the consulate, and the least incompetent of her staff. *Major Percival Willoughby-Gore (John Quayle), a devious, lecherous, upper-class twit - and Harriet's would-be nemesis. Sadly, he's not quite as clever as Harriet and finds his schemes are frequently found out and squashed by her. *Fidel Sanchez (Tony Haygarth), the consulate's resident chauffeur. He always has his eye out to find ways to make a bit more cash – but grows strangely fond of Harriet as time goes on. *Miguel (Freddie Earlle), a jovial, but incompetent relative of Fidel. Miguel appears in two episodes of series two, although Earlle also appeared as a different character in series one. *Sarah Lawrence (Judy Cornwell) is Harriet's recently divorced houseguest. She horrifies her hostess by falling for the bumbling charms of Major Percy. Sarah appears in two episodes of series two. Notable guest stars throughout the run of the two series included (in no particular order) Tim Barrett, Francesca Gonshaw, Jan Ravens, Ralph Bates, Annette Crosbie, Russell Hunter, Roger Hammond, Veronica Doran, Kevin Lloyd, Elizabeth Sellars, Edward de Souza, Robin Parkinson, Patsy Smart, and John Moreno. Sharples earlier comedy shows included In Loving Memory and Hallelujah!.  Series  * Farrington of the F.O. — (1986) — Yorkshire Television ** First series (7 episodes) broadcast from 13 February to 27 March 1986 * Farrington — (1987) — Yorkshire Television ** Second series (7 episodes) broadcast from 3 June to 15 July 1987 Press Pack, Series Two The following information is taken from the Press Pack released by Yorkshire TV to help publicise the series. *Carmen Gómez, who played Juanita in series 2, episode 1, and Delores Alvarez in series 2, episode 3, was born in North Africa and grew up in Gibraltar. She started her career presenting children's TV programme Romper Room. Her first book (Happy Musician) was due to be published at the same time she appeared in Farrington. Her brother is William Gomez, the classical guitarist and composer. *Tony Haygarth did not appear in series 2, episode 4 (We're Having a Heatwave) because he became snow-bound in Kent and was unable to reach Yorkshire TV's Leeds studios. Writer Dick Sharples performed a hasty re-write on the episode's script, and created the character of Miguel (played by Freddie Earlle) to cover for the absent Sanchez. As a 'thank-you' to Earlle, Miguel was also written into the following episode Who Wants to be a Billionaire?. Earlle had previously appeared in the final episode of series 1 as a particularly inept bandito chef. *At the time of filming series 2, John Quayle and his wife Petronell were using their farmhouse home as an animal sanctuary. They began in 1976 when they adopted two donkeys from Sidmouth Sanctuary. In 1984 they adopted their third donkey, Jacob. Other animals included a pony, a horse, three pugs and a Russian Blue cat. *The final scene in the final episode featured Harriet Farrington on board a British Airways jet. However, the actors never left the ground as they were filmed in a replica of a first-class cabin owned by the airline company. The company kept the set to help with stills, publicity and filming.

He had long served as an officer at Wuning Circuit (武寧, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu) before seizing control of the circuit from the imperially-commissioned military governor (Jiedushi) Cui Qun, but subsequently often contributed to imperial campaigns against other generals.  Background and early career  Wang Zhixing was born in 758, during the reign of Emperor Suzong. His family was from Huai Prefecture (懷州, in modern Jiaozuo, Henan). His great-grandfather Wang Jing () and Wang Gui () had both served as imperial guard generals, while his father Wang Jin () served as a staff member for a crown prince.Old Book of Tang, vol. 156. It was said that Wang Zhixing was a ferocious warrior while young, and he served as a soldier under Li Wei () the prefect of Xu Prefecture (徐州, in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu). (Li Wei was the cousin of Li Zhengji, a warlord that then ruled Pinglu Circuit (平盧, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong) de facto independently from the imperial government, and Xu Prefecture was a part of Pinglu.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 227. Li Zhengji died in 781, and his son Li Na, without approval from then-reigning Emperor Dezong (Emperor Suzong's grandson), took over Pinglu. In response, Li Na aligned himself with several other warlords in similar situations — Tian Yue, who controlled Weibo Circuit (魏博, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei), Wang Wujun, who controlled Chengde Circuit (成德, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), and Zhu Tao, who controlled Lulong Circuit (盧龍, headquartered in modern Beijing). Li Wei's subordinate, Bai Jigeng (), then persuaded Li Wei to submit to the imperial government instead, and Li Wei did so. Li Na then went his officer Wang Wen (), along with the Weibo officer Xindu Chongqing (), to attack Xu Prefecture. Li Wei sent Wang Zhixing to seek aid from the imperial government, and Wang Zhixing was said to be so fast in his ability to walk that he got to the imperial capital Chang'an within five days. Imperial forces were launched, and they defeated the combined Pinglu and Weibo forces, saving Xu Prefecture. After this battle, Wang Zhixing was often given commands to resist Li Na, and he served at Xu Prefecture over 20 years. In 815, during the middle of the campaign by Emperor Dezong's grandson Emperor Xianzong against the warlord Wu Yuanji, who then controlled Zhangyi Circuit (彰義, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan), Li Na's son Li Shidao, then ruling Pinglu and aligned with Wu, tried to distract the imperial troops to try to save Wu. He decided to attack Xu Prefecture, which had by then been made the capital of Wuning Circuit ().Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 239. Wuning's military governor Li Yuan () put Wang in command of an army to resist the Pinglu attack, and Wang repeatedly prevailed against Pinglu troops. (During one of the battles, he captured a Pinglu general's beautiful concubine. Fearing that his own officers would fight over her, he stated, \\"Having a woman in the army will surely lead to defeat. Although she is innocent, her presence violates military law.\\" He then beheaded her.) In 818, during the subsequent imperial campaign against Li Shidao, Wang commanded Wuning troops, and they, in conjunction with troops from Zhongwu Circuit (忠武, headquartered in modern Xuchang, Henan), defeated Pinglu troops at Jinxiang (金鄉, in modern Jining, Shandong). After Li Shidao was eventually killed by his own general Liu Wu, and Pinglu surrendered, Wang was made the prefect of Yi Prefecture (沂州, in modern Linyi, Shandong).  Seizure of Wuning Circuit  In 821, by which time Emperor Xianzong's son Emperor Muzong was emperor, Chengde and Lulong Circuits, which had briefly submitted to the imperial government, had again rebelled under the leadership of Wang Tingcou and Zhu Kerong, respectively. While preparing for the campaign against Chengde and Lulong rebels, Emperor Muzong, who had heard of Wang Zhixing's prowess on the battlefield, made him the deputy military governor of Wuning, serving under the military governor Cui Qun (a former chancellor).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 242. Subsequently, Wang Zhixing was commissioned to command 3,000 elite Wuning soldiers against the Chengde and Lulong rebels. Cui was apprehensive of the soldiers' support of Wang, and made a request to the imperial government that Wang be made military governor, or otherwise be given a post at Chang'an. Before the imperial government could respond, Wang became aware of Cui's suspicions toward him. When, in spring 822, Emperor Muzong ended the campaign by pardoning Wang Tingcou and Zhu and the troops from the circuits were sent back to their homes, Wang Zhixing, ahead of the scheduled return time, led the troops back to Wuning. Cui became fearful and, while sending messengers to welcome the troops, ordered them to drop their arms and armor and enter Xu Prefecture unarmed. Wang Zhixing refused and approached the prefectural capital. His supporters opened the city gates to welcome him. He executed a number of people who opposed him and entered the headquarters. He bowed to Cui and the eunuch monitor of the army, and stated, \\"This is what the troops want. I have no control over them.\\" He then prepared a sendoff for Cui, his secretary, and attendants, and escorted them to Yongqiao. He then seized the money, silk, and textiles stored at Wuning by the directorate of salt and iron monopolies, as well as the tributes that the circuits were submitting to the emperor that were passing through Wuning. He also seized two thirds of the assets of businessmen in or passing through the circuit. He also sent 2,000 soldiers to attack Hao Prefecture (濠州, in modern Chuzhou, Anhui); its prefect Hou Hongdu () abandoned it and fled. The imperial government felt that it had no ability to attack Wang, and Emperor Muzong thus made him the military governor of Wuning.  Later career  After Wang Zhixing took over Wuning Circuit, however, he participated in the imperial government's campaigns against other rebellious generals. For example, later in 822, when soldiers of neighboring Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) expelled Li Yuan (who was then Xuanwu's military governor) under the leadership of Li Jie (李㝏), Wang Zhixing aided Gao Chengjian () the prefect of Song Prefecture (宋州, in modern Shangqiu, Henan), who was resisting Li Jie's attacks. With Wang's help, Gao was able to repel Li Jie's attacks, and subsequently, with other imperial troops converging on Xuanwu, Li Jie was killed by his own subordinates. While at Wuning, Wang used the wealth that he gathered to bribe powerful imperial officials, to rehabilitate his reputation. As a result, he received a number of honorific titles. In 824, by which time Emperor Muzong's son Emperor Jingzong were emperor, Wang requested permission for him to let people take tonsure (i.e., to become Buddhist monks) at Si Prefecture (泗州, in modern Huai'an, Jiangsu), to seek divine favors for Emperor Jingzong. Emperor Jingzong initially agreed. As a result, people were rushing to Si Prefecture to take tonsure, to avoid taxes; the fees they paid caused Wang to become even more wealthy. When Li Deyu the governor of Zhexi Circuit (浙西, headquartered in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu) submitted an objection and pointed out that if this continued, Zhexi and its neighboring circuits would lose some 600,000 battle- capable young men, Emperor Jingzong ordered a stop to the practice.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 243. In 826, after the death of Li Quanlüe () the military governor of Henghai Circuit (橫海, headquartered in modern Cangzhou, Hebei), Li's son Li Tongjie seized control of the circuit and sought to succeed his father. In 827, Emperor Jingzong's brother and successor Emperor Wenzong offered to make Li Tongjie the military governor of Yanhai Circuit (兗海, headquartered in modern Jining) and a former military governor of Henghai, Wu Chongyin, the military governor of Henghai, Li Tongjie refused. As the imperial government subsequently prepared for war against Henghai, Wang offered to attack Henghai without imperial expenditure. (Typically, when circuits send troops on imperial campaigns, the imperial government paid for the soldiers' expenses.) Emperor Wenzong agreed, and subsequently commissioned Wang and several other nearby military governors to converge on Henghai. Subsequently, when Wu died while still on the campaign, Emperor Wenzong made Li Huan () the military governor of Baoyi Circuit (保義, headquartered in modern Linfen, Shanxi) the military governor of Shanxi, at Wang's request, and further bestowed the honorific chancellor title of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi () on Wang. (When Li Huan subsequently was slow in reporting to the battlefront, Emperor Wenzong was forced to replace him with Fu Liangbi () Meanwhile, Wang was able to capture Di Prefecture (棣州, in modern Binzhou, Shandong) and was given the honorific title of acting Situ (司徒, one of the Three Excellencies). Meanwhile, by this point, Wang was cruel to his soldiers. Meanwhile, his officer Shi Xiong was considered a fierce soldier and treated soldiers well. The soldiers were therefore considering expelling Wang and replacing him with Shi. When Wang became aware of this, Wang requested that Shi be promoted for his battlefield achievements. Emperor Wenzong agreed, and made Shi the prefect of Bi Prefecture (壁州, in modern Bazhong, Sichuan). As soon as Shi left Wuning, Wang slaughtered some 100 officials who were friendly to Shi, and accused Shi of treason, requesting Shi's execution. Emperor Wenzong, while aware that this was a false accusation, could not resist Wang. He declared Shi guilty, but did not execute Shi, instead exiling Shi to Bai Prefecture (白州, in modern Yulin, Guangxi).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 244. In winter 829, Wang went to Chang'an to pay homage to Emperor Wenzong. He was subsequently made the military governor of Zhongwu Circuit as well as the prefect of its capital prefecture Xu Prefecture (). In 833, he was made the military governor of Hezhong Circuit (河中, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), as well as the mayor of its capital Hezhong Municipality. In 835, he was made the military governor of Xuanwu and the prefect of its capital Bian Prefecture (). He died in 836 and was given posthumous honors. He was buried near the eastern capital Luoyang, and it was said that some 1,000 officers from the four circuits he served attended the funeral. His son Wang Zai later became a well-known general as well.New Book of Tang, vol. 172.

The story tells of Saúl Zuratas, a university student who leaves civilization and becomes a \\"storyteller\\" for the Machiguenga Native Americans. The novel thematizes the Westernization of indigenous peoples through missions and through anthropological studies, and questions the perceived notion that indigenous cultures are set in stone. Plot The plot develops an extended argument of two sides of what to do with Peru's native Amazonian populations. One side argues that tribes should be left alone to live as they have for millennia, leaving them full access and use of their ancient lands. The other side posits that such ancient ways cannot survive the exploitation of economic interests. In order to save them, natives must be protected by modern intervention of missionaries and government agencies. Through the book, each character seeks ways to protect these groups. Odd chapters are narrated by Mario Vargas Llosa, both a character and the author of the text. These chapters are set in San Marcos University, the radio station where Mario is employed, and several pubs around the city. Even number chapters are narrated by Saúl Zaratas as the Storyteller for the Machiguenga and are devoted entirely to telling the history of the tribe and its methods of survival. Those chapters are set throughout the Amazon as the Storyteller travels from one group to another. The two characters meet only in the odd chapters from time to time, debating politics, university life, and occasionally the rights of the native tribes to either exist as they have or be saved by modernization. The narrator creates a commentary for public television to shed light on the plight of the Machiguenga, with the hope of convincing himself that the tribe is in better shape for the interventions of modern civilization imposed upon them. Saúl, for his part, fully integrates into the tribe, doffing his western ways and incorporating himself fully as a historian and communication link for the disparate members across the Amazon. Main characters=Narrator Middle-aged, Peruvian writer who is telling the story of the native Amazonian Indians through his experience and that of his friend Saúl, both of whom are obsessed, in different ways, with a particular tribe of Indians, the Machiguengas. At the time of the narrative he is living in Florence Italy and has lost all contact with Saúl. Based on hints, chance encounters and indirect evidence, the narrator comes to the conclusion that Saúl has not only disappeared into the Peruvian jungle but has, somehow, become a tribal storyteller of the Machiguengas. Saúl Zuratas Fellow student at San Marcos and friend of the overall narrator. To an increasing degree, he becomes a second narrator, though it is not clear to the reader whether it is the actual Saúl or the first narrator's idea of Saúl that is doing the second narration. Saúl is also called \\"Mascarita\\" because of the large birthmark \\"mask\\" that covers half of his face. Saúl develops a deep connection to and appreciation for the Machiguenga Indians during his time at college and apparently trades in his life in modern civilization in order to travel amongst the tribes as a storyteller or \\"hablador.\\" Machiguenga Indians The native tribe of the Amazonian Indians whose stories and fate are the basis of the book. Tasurinchi Is a name used in the storytelling chapters throughout Vargas Llosa's book, one that can cause considerable confusion. Because the Machiguengas do not use personal names, \\"Tasurinchi\\" is not a consistent individual, but the name used for the person or god about whom someone is talking. It is used, roughly, to mean \\"revered male about whom we are speaking\\". Early in the book Saul defines Tasurinchi as \\"the god of good\\", but this is just one use of the name. During his storytelling, Mascarita uses \\"Tasurinchi\\" as a pronoun used to stand for oneself, other males, and even the sun.http://jclementwrite.blogspot.com/2006/03/tasurinchi.html Later, as Mascarita goes more \\"native,\\" he adopts the name as a person pronoun, referring to himself as \\"Tasurinchi.\\" Don Salomon Zuratas Saúl Zuratas's father. Converted to Judaism upon moving to the capital of Peru. After Don Salomon dies, Saul leaves the city to become the storyteller. Major Themes, symbols, and motifs To analyze the themes in a broader concept, Vargas asks the reader to think about the positive and negative effects of globalization, specifically through the roles of the Viracochas (White men, most typically used in negatively describing the ruthless rubber merchant of the rubber boom) and the missionaries. The Viracochas used the native Indians to harvest rubber, promising them food, shelter and goods to come work for them. The Viracochas treated the Indians horribly once they got to the camps and began pitting the tribes against each other once manpower became scarce. They would send Mashcos to capture three Machiguengas or vice versa to buy their \\"freedom.\\" \\"They wanted to Bleed us like they bled the trees.\\"Vargas Llosa 50 The Viracochas shed a negative light on globalization by exploiting the land and people for profit. Regarding the missionaries and linguists at the Summer Institute, the line between negative and positive impacts are blurred. By studying the Machiguengas, learning their language, and teaching them English and religion, some may argue that the native Indians are being saved from extinction in modern civilization. Others argue that the linguists and missionaries are a \\"tentacle of American imperialism which, under the cover of doing scientific research, has been engaged in gathering intelligence and has taken the first steps toward a neocolonist penetration of the cultures of the Amazonian Indian.\\"Vargas Llosa 71 Through these examples of progress versus preservation, Vargas Llosa asks the reader, \\"which is more important?\\" Cultural nomadism The Machiguenga are described as \\"walkers\\". A vital aspect of their character is the nomadic nature of social tradition. This transient lifestyle informs their ability to learn from new experiences and encourages curiosity for other cultures. The narrator, Mario, begins to tell the story of Saul (who he suspects is the subject in a mysterious photograph displayed in a gallery in Florence). Through Saul's stories of his ethnological research, Mario illustrates the Amerindian general thirst for the unknown. This custom manifests as acceptance of the other. Despite his physical imperfections (and cultural differences), the Machiguenga accept Mascarita. The issue of cultural tradition and abomination are discussed and highlights this very idea of multi-cultural acceptance. Mascarita astutely remarks on the traditional killings of newborns that are born with imperfections. This tradition truly exemplifies Machiguenga respect for the foreigner. If Mascarita was native to the tribe, his birthmark would have led to his immediate demise. By allowing Mascarita to live and learn from their culture the Machiguenga implicitly accept him by sparing his life. This acceptance is guided by a tenet that is so essential to the fabric of their society: cultural nomadism.  Birthmark  Saúl's birthmark is more of a symbol, but it still touches upon the theme of cultural hybridism. While Saúl finds himself to be infatuated with the Machiguenga culture, his birthmark is essentially a constant reminder of the society from which he truly came. When interacting with Westerners, Saúl gladly accepts any insults he is given that relate to the birthmark and even accepts the nickname \\"Mascarita,\\" translating to \\"mask-face.\\" When a drunk man calls him a monster and tells him to keep his face off the streets, Saúl simply smiles and replies, \\"but if this is the only one I've got, what do you suggest I do?\\" (14). Saúl finally gets flustered when discussing the fact that the Machiguengas kill any newborns who are imperfect. Since Saúl's face is \\"deformed,\\" he would not have lived had he been born into the Machiguenga society. The narrator notes that this was \\"the only time he ever alluded, not jokingly but seriously, even dramatically, to what was undoubtedly a tragedy in his life\\" (26). Since so many of his relationships in the past have been killed off by his imperfection, Saúl seems afraid that his relationship with the Machiguengas will be marred by this permanent reminder of Western culture. The mark also helps accentuate the Machiguenga's practice of unity and collectivism. In the end, they accept him as a person more than any Western culture did.  Storytelling  As indicated by the novel's title, storytelling is a very prominent theme in The Storyteller. After hearing about the special role of Hablador or Storyteller in Machiguenga culture, he is immediately intrigued by it. \\"They're a tangible proof that storytelling can be something more than mere entertainment... Something primordial, something that the very existence of a people may depend on. Maybe that's what impressed me so.\\" (94). The author even goes on to say that stories are the essence of a culture and that Saúl's position as the Storyteller is a feat that requires penetrating the heart of the Machiguenga culture. In this way, The Storyteller can be seen as a work of metafiction on a self-aware level in the author's chapters and on an unconscious level in the Storyteller's chapters. Throughout the novel, both the author and the Storyteller question what it means to tell stories and why they are important. This is done through the questioning of the many different stories told in the novel. The stories Saúl tells the author, the stories the Storyteller tells the audience, and even the memories narrated by the author are questioned by the author as being inaccurate and heavily dependent on who is telling it. In the storytelling chapters this is done by the constant qualification of statements with the words \\"perhaps\\", \\"maybe\\", \\"it seems\\", and \\"That, anyway, is what I have learned.\\"  Native myths  The parts of the novel narrated by the storyteller are mostly the accounts of the mythological figures in the Machiguenga culture. These native myths often do not have explicit lessons, but instead narrate the complicated Machiguenga mythology. The early parts of the novel begin with creation myths which explain the nomadic, non possessive nature of the Machiguenga people. As the novel progresses, however, the myths begin to relate to Jewish and Christian figures such as Jesus. Ultimately, it is revealed that the storyteller has begun to hybridize the native myths with Western stories and traditions.  Religion  Religion is one of the forefront motifs in The Storyteller. While the author's own religion is not explored deeply, he is shown to see religion as a system of rituals and this view is demonstrated early in the novel. \\"The Catholic religion was a breeze, a measly half-hour Mass every Sunday and Communion every first Friday of the month that was over in no time.\\" (p. 9) This passage shows the author's view of religion as a ritual that requires effort rather than a strong belief system by which to live life. Much more is written about Saúl's religion. As a Peruvian Jew, Saúl participates in holidays such as Sabbath and knows much about Judaism. However, he and his mother (who was a Jewish convert) would play games together to pass the time in the synagogue. Also, any other efforts put forth by Saúl to study Judaism are also efforts to please Don Salomón. Later in the story, the author hears that Saúl has left the University to study in Israel with his father. The author is skeptical of this news since Saúl was so invested in the Machinguenga culture. It is later revealed that Saúl has instead gone into the Amazonian jungle to live with the Machinguengas as their storyteller. At this role, Saúl hybridizes religious stories from the Bible with the native mythology, demonstrating his views of relativism.  Gregor Samsa  Gregor Samsa, the protagonist of Franz Kafka's The Metamorphosis, is mentioned many times in the story as a motif. In The Metamorphosis, the protagonist Gregor Samsa wakes up transformed into a monstrous verminous bug. Saúl has read The Metamorphosis to a point where he \\"knew [it] by heart\\" (17). He even names his pet parrot Gregor Samsa, indicating an intimate association with the story. Saúl also makes several more references to Gregor Samsa throughout the novel whenever he speaks of something or someone out of the ordinary. For example, Saúl would refer to the Machiguenga disfigured babies (who would be killed by their mothers) as \\"Gregor Samsas\\" (25). He even uses that term as a way to bring attention to his own disfigurement, his birthmark. In the stories he tells, he eventually fuses the idea of the thunder god Tasurinchi with Gregor Samsa in the later chapters -- \\"Gregor-Tasurinchi\\"—as an example of his eventual cultural hybridism.  Academia  The academic world, represented in the novel by the University of San Marcos and the Summer Institute of Linguistics, is actively engaged by the author. He not only completes his studies at the University of San Marcos in Literature, but he also participates in expeditions done by the Summer Institute of Linguistics. In fact, it is revealed in the beginning that the author is in Italy \\"to read Dante and Machiavelli and look at Renaissance paintings for a couple of months in solitude.\\" (4). The academic world is heavily criticized by Saúl Zuratas, however. In Saúl's view, academia is a means of aggressive Western proselytization. \\"Those apostolic linguists of yours are the worst of all. They work their way into the tribes to destroy them from within, just like chiggers.\\" (p. 95) While Saúl himself is a student for the early part of the novel, he says that he is a student only to please Don Salomón. Ultimately, he leaves the University of San Marcos presumably for Israel. It is later revealed, however, that Saúl left to join the Machiguengas. Development history Mario Vargas Llosa made a journey into the Amazon Jungle in 1958. He felt that \\"The absence of law and institutions exposed the jungle natives to the worst humiliations and acts of injustice by colonists, missionaries and adventurers, who had come to impose their will through the use of terror and force.\\". Instead of finding the landscape exotic, he was faced with violence and cruelty of the native tribes. This trip into the jungle would be Vargas Llosa's inspiration for several of his novels, including The Storyteller.\\"Mario Vargas Llosa - Biographical\\".

The narrator, himself a writer, is fascinated by this type of person in various cultures around the world, such as the Celtic seanchaí, which he refers to for comparison; he is even more intrigued to find that in the twenty years since his first encounter with habladores, they seem to have disappeared—none of the Machiguenga will even acknowledge the storyteller exists. The \\"storyteller\\" has a secondary reference to the narrator himself, a writer who briefly runs a television show that tries to copy the work of the hablador by presenting assorted stories of cultural significance. Controversy The storyteller is full of many provocative ideals and opinions. Vargas Llosa commonly writes about violence, corruption, and struggling against authoritarian regimes. 'The Storyteller' chronicles continuing devastation in the rain forest. Over the last few decades, missionaries have occidentalised the Amazon Indians. There are few tribes that are still isolated from the rest of the world. A clear question brought into mind by the novel is: Is it better to back off and leave native tribes such as the Machiguenga alone, or will their lives be worse off without outside influence? This, amongst other questions, put the novel at the center of a large debate. Formal criticism and reception The Storyteller was regarded highly among most literary critics. Ursula K. Le Guin, NY Times correspondent for the book review supplement, briefly summarized her reactions to the novel, describing the Storyteller as a science fiction novel; it portrays a fictitious tribe that has been immune to acculturation and Western influence and its influence on a Jewish ethnologist seeking to learn more about their culture. She gives the book an impressive review, praising Vargas Llosa's ability to discuss the role of Western influence on the native and the overpowering impact of primitive culture on the white man. She writes, \\"To me this is Mr. Vargas Llosa's most engaging and accessible book, for the urgency of its subject purifies and illuminates the writing. I was spellbound, as if by the voice of that storyteller in the circle of listeners(Le Guin 1989).\\" The Kirkus review comments on Vargas Llosa's fruitless efforts to emphasize the role of storytelling. This formal review criticizes this essential component to the novel, accusing Vargas Llosa of writing a novel that is \\"unsatisfying and cobbled-up\\" (Kirkus Review 1989). The Publisher Weekly gave the Storyteller a rave review. \\"Written in the direct, precise, often vernacular prose that Vargas Llosa embues with elegance and sophistication, this is a powerful call to the author's compatriots--and to other nations--to cease despoiling the environment\\" (Publisher Weekly 1989). The New York Times Book Review praised The Storyteller as \\"Intellectual, ethical, and artistic, all at once and brilliantly so.\\" Raymond Sokolov, of The Wall Street Journal, credited the novel as being \\"Brilliant . . . A whole culture is contained within these dreamy narratives\\". Time magazine comments on The Storyteller: \\"A fascinating tale . . . with enormous skill and formal grace, Vargas Llosa weaves through the mystery surrounding the fate of Saul Zuratas.\\" Awards and nominations Though The Storyteller itself has won no awards, the author, Mario Vargas Llosa, won the Prince Asturias Award for Literature, the Miguel de Cervantes Prize, and the Nobel Prize in Literature. Upon his acceptance of the Nobel Prize, Peter Englund of the Swedish Academy referred to Llosa as a \\"divinely gifted storyteller.\\" While he had no intentions of singling out this particular novel itself, novels such as the Storyteller undoubtedly contributed towards his ultimate earning of this prize through its story's ability to express themes and motifs while continuing to be entertaining.

Refusing from the day of his election to support Bartolomeo Prignano (Pope Urban VI, the former head of the rival Apostolic Chancellery) after the Papal Conclave of 1378, de Cros played a critical role in delivering a considerable portion of the Roman Curia to the rival claimant Robert of Geneva, who took the name Clement VII. Historian Daniel Williman calls Murat de Cros's actions a \\"counter-coup\\".Daniel Williman. 2008. \\"Schism within the Curia: The Twin Papal Elections of 1378\\". The Journal of Ecclesiastical History, 59(1): 29. Early life De Cros was the cousin of Pope Gregory XI (shown here blessing St. Catherine of Siena, who repeatedly importuned him to move the seat of the papacy back to Rome), and was the brother of cardinal-nephew Jean de Murat de Cros. Both are possibly depicted here. Pierre was born in La ChaulLa Chaul, parish of Saint-Exupéry, Corrèze, in the Diocese of Limoges. in the ancient Province of Limousin. He was the son of Aymar de Murat de Cros, a nobleman of Auvergnat extraction,Charles Emmanuel Joseph Poplimont, La Belgique héraldique: recueil historique, chronologique, généalogique et biographique complet, vol. vii (Paris 1866), s.v. \\"Murat\\", pp 399ff. and of Marie de Montclar. He entered the Order of Saint Benedict in his youth, and after living in several French monasteries became Bishop of Saint-Papoul in July 1362.Salvador Miranda, \\"The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church\\": Pierre de Cros; retrieved on 5 October 2009. Eubel, p. 390. On 9 June 1370 he was transferred to the Metropolitan See of Bourges.Eubel, p. 139 Pierre was the brother of Jean de Murat de Cros, who became the Bishop of Limoges, and both were cousins of Pope Gregory XI and thus favored by him in the administration of the Curia, after his election in 1370. Jean was named a cardinal-nephew and one of the first cardinals of Gregory XI upon his ascension to the papacy. Pierre, already the Bishop of Bourges and a staff member of the Camera, was named Papal Chamberlain that same year, succeeding the deceased Arnaud Aubert (d. 1371). In 1374, he was given the wealthy Archbishopric of Arles. Chamberlain of the Camera=Under Gregory XI Pierre de Cros was the \\"most important and powerful courtier\\" of the pope, and their bedchambers were joined by a secret staircase. According to Williman, \\"it is no exaggeration to say that his powers and functions combined those of a minister of finance, a chief justice and a secretary of state, as well as major-domo of the papal household\\". He accompanied Gregory XI in the last year of his reign to Anagni from May 16 to November 7, 1377, where the pope relied on him for his \\"most important correspondence\\" rather than the Chancellery. De Cros grew suspicious of the intrigues of Bartolommeo Prignano, the acting-head of the Chancellery, hearing that he was attending the meetings of the bandaresi.\\"Before the mid-fifteenth century, a variety of officials, including Marescalchi, Bandaresi, Turrieri, Pacieri, and Balestieri, carried out police functions in Rome, apparently without the opprobrium later attached to the Sbirri.\\" (Steven Hughes, \\"Fear and Loathing in Bologna and Rome the Papal Police in Perspective\\" Journal of Social History, 21.1 (Autumn 1987:97–116) p. 106. Senator Gui de Prohins, named as military governor of Rome by Gregory XI, was not a party to their intrigues, being loyal to the Pope. Pierre de Cros also controlled the Apostolic Camera (established 1361), the judicial wing of the Camera, which had \\"absolute and final\\" jurisdiction over any case affecting the interests of the Camera, even if already pending in front of other ecclesiastical courts, and even if they involved issues of theology. This court was not burdened by the ordo iudiciarius, the slow and formalistic rules of the papal courts, but rather gave expedited and summary rulings. It was in no small part due to the unwillingness of Murat to coerce the extreme taxation ordered by Gregory XI, that the pontiff found himself bankrupt by his wars against the Visconti and ultimately by the War of the Eight Saints, fought against a coalition of Italy city states led by the Republic of Florence, which instigated rebellion in the Papal States. While Gregory XI was forced to borrow from the Duke of Anjou, Murat excelled at diplomacy, convincing Bologna to relent in exchange for a lifting of the interdict. De Cros drafted and persuaded his cousin Gregory XI to adopt Futuris peculis on March 19, modifying the laws of the papal conclave. He also persuaded Gregory XI to make Pierre Rostaing, the castellan of Castel Sant'Angelo to swear not to turn over the fortress to any papal claimant without the assent of the six cardinals remaining in the Comtat Venaissin. Fearing for his own life, he moved into the fortress and prepared it for a long siege. Rather than guarding the conclave personally (as he would later do at Fondi), Murat de Cros deputized the Bishop of Valence and Die to perform the task. During the Western Schism Murat de Cros remained in the fortified Castel Sant'Angelo during the Papal Conclave of 1378. De Cros did not accept the election of Prignano as Urban VI, and sheltered in Castel Sant'Angelo a group of like-minded cardinals, which included his brother. He met the bardaresi, carrying a battleaxe and followed by a heavily armed entourage, refusing to allow him to escort the cardinals back for a papal coronation (\\"That fool thinks he’s pope? I surely don’t consider him pope\\"). Later in the day Murat de Cros and the other cardinals went to pay homage to Urban VI although he feigned illness to avoid the coronation. He carried on his duties as chamberlain as if Gregory XI were still in power and Urban VI did not exist, refusing to date his letters according to the latter's election. As Chamberlain of the Camera (Camerlengo), de Cros held a curial office which was one of the few that did not expire during a sede vacante, as established by the bull Ubi periculum (1274). He persuaded the entire College of Cardinals to convene in Anagni, himself leaving Castel Sant'Angelo between June 25 and July 1. He issued a formal summons to Prignano to appear before a cameral tribunal in Anagni, and sometime before July 20 declared him excommunicated and deprived of his Archbishopric of Bari. Also under the judicial power of the Apostolic Camera, Murat de Cros received the cardinals on August 2, and after hearing accounts of the conclave, declared it null and void and the church to continue in sede vacante. This meeting was neither a consistory or a conclave but a tribunal with Murat de Cros presiding as an ordinary judge. De Cros worked to arrange a meeting of the College of Cardinals at Fondi on September 20, 1378 which elected Robert of Geneva as Clement VII. According to Williman, \\"de Cros used his huge discretionary powers to make himself virtually a regent or protector, a keeper of the papal power sede vacante\\". It was at this point that Murat de Cros appointed a new procurator and registrar for the Camera, and assisted Clement VII in turning out copious amounts of official-looking documents. Cardinal On 23 December 1383 Clement VII of the Avignon Obedience named him cardinal-priest of the Basilica of Santi Nereo e Achilleo. On the following day he resigned as Camerlengo, but retained the Archbishopric of Arles until January 1388.His successor in both posts was François de Conzié.

Albanes in his Gallia christiana novissima (1669). Legacy According to Williman, de Cros was instrumental in beginning the Western Schism, and creating a true split in the Western Church without precedent among the antipopes of preceding centuries, who had wielded little popular or international support: > \\"The Western Schism had its roots within the papal Curia. Even before there > were two international obediences, or two popes, even before two legal > opinions began to be argued about the validity of the April election, and > before the ultramontane cardinals and Urban VI had gone to their separate > summer refuges of Anagni and Tivoli, the nucleus of the Curia was split in > interest and policy between two ministers, the heads of the Chancery and of > the Camera, Bartolomeo Prignano and Pierre de Cros.\\" ReferencesBibliography *Konrad Eubel, Hierarchia Catholica Medii Aevi, I, Münster 1913 Category:1320s births Category:1388 deaths Category:People from Corrèze Category:Papal family members Category:Economic history of the Holy See Category:Western Schism Category:14th-century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:French Benedictines Category:Benedictine bishops Category:Benedictine cardinals Category:Archbishops of Arles Category:Archbishops of Bourges Category:French cardinals Category:Apostolic Camera Category:14th-century cardinals ","title":"Pierre de Murat de Cros"},{"id":"24579219","text":"Joseph Simonelli is an American playwright.

Over 40 projects have been attributed to them or to one of their constituent organisations.

The main block, converted into two vertically divided residences is in 2012 again a single residence. old Shute House was retained by Sir John Carew-Pole until 1955 when he gave it to the National Trust on the proviso that members of his wider family would remain tenants, which they did until 2008. Marriage He married Anne Templer (1758–1832) the daughter of James I Templer (1722–1782) of Stover House, Teigngrace, Devon, a self-made magnate who had made his fortune building dockyards under government contracts. Her mother was Mary Parlby (d.1784), the sister of Thomas Parlby (1727–1802) of Stone Hall, Stonehouse, in Plymouth, business partner of James Templer. The famous and immensely valuable portrait of Anne Templer painted by George Romney is now at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.

The canting motto of Pole is shown below: Pollet Virtus, from the Latin verb Polleo, to be strong, mighty,Cassell's Latin Dictionary thus: \\"Virtue is powerful\\",Debrett's Peerage, 1968 but which may also be read as Poll et Virtus, \\"Pole and Virtue\\" James I Templer (1722–1782), father of Anne, was a self-made magnate. He was born in Exeter of a humble family, the son of Thomas Templer a brazier. He was orphaned young, whereupon his elder brother apprenticed him to John Bickley, a carpenter or architect of Exeter. He broke his indenture and set off for India where he made a fortune, either from government building contracts or possibly from dealing in silver bullion,Extract from www.templerfamily.co.uk: \\"The log of one of the East India Company ships which was carrying silver bullion suggests that on arrival in Madras the bullion was handed over to a small group consisting of, amongst others, Line and Templer. Another snippet derived from a remote family source is that James Templer and his partners were actually trading in Mexican silver dollars, but why and how they came by the dollars is not explained. However, there are two other possibly completely irrelevant facts worth noting. The first is that adulterated silver became a problem in India, and secondly that James's father and elder brother were both 'braziers', i.e. brass craftsmen, so James would have had some knowledge of foundries and metallurgy. In a printed book of the Madras Record Office Extracts to be found in the Society of Genealogists Library, there is evidence that he was engaged in transactions, legalised by the Madras Mint, in connection with exchanging old and new Mexican silver. In view of James' young age, it seems likely that this was the main basis of his later fortune rather than the building of docks\\" before returning to England aged 23. He settled at Rotherhithe, Kent, where he obtained a government contract to re-build the dockyard with his partners John Line and Thomas Parlby. He married Mary Parlby (d.1784), the sister of his business partner and daughter of John Parlby of Chatham, Kent. He obtained with his partners in about 1760 the contract to rebuild Plymouth docks, for which he used granite from Haytor, and moved to Devon. In 1763 he obtained a grant of arms from the College of Arms, and in 1765 purchased the manor of Teignrace and Stover Lodge, which in 1780 he re-built in grander form on a nearby site. He died in 1782 and is commemorated by a monument in Teignrace Church, rebuilt in 1786 by his sons. Pevsner thought highly of this family stating: \\"The Templers were people of taste, as is clear from the building and their monuments\\".Pevsner, N., The Buildings of England: Devon, London, 2004 ed., p.793 His son James Templer (1748–1813) built the Stover Canal in 1792 to help ship clay along the Teign Estuary from the Bovey Basin to the port of Teignmouth. Coal, manure and agricultural produce was also freighted along the canal. Granite from Hay Tor was used to build Stover House which was completed by 1792. By 1820 a granite tramway, which had rails cut from granite, was opened connecting the granite quarries of Haytor to the canal. This enabled large quantities of granite to be transported for major works like the new London Bridge which opened in 1825. George Templer (1755–1819), son of James Templer (Senior) and brother of Rev. John Templer, rector of Teigngrace, was the father of Sophia-Anne Templer, wife of her first cousin Sir William Templer-Pole, 7th Baronet (1782–1847). George Templer however overspent his resources and was forced to sell Stover House, Stover Canal, the Haytor Granite Tramway and most of the rest of the family's considerable estates to Edward St Maur, 11th Duke of Somerset, in 1829, in whose family it remained until 1921. In 1932 it became the Stover Girls' School, which occupies it still in 2012.http://www.templerfamily.co.uk/Templer%20Trees/GEDmill_Output/indiI0728.html Monument to wife 1832 mural monument to Lady Anne Pole (née Templer) (1758–1832), wife of Sir John de la Pole, 6th Baronet (1757–1799) signed: \\"P.

Colonel of the Royal East Devon Cavalry, who departed this life on the 30th November 1799 in the 42nd year of his age. He was endowed with brilliant and vigorous talents which were cultivated with great care and improvement in the colleges of Winton and Corpus Christi in Oxon. Impressed with a deep sense of loyalty for his sovereign and an ardent attachment to the constitution of his country he strictly maintained justice and peace and good order within the sphere of his influence and authority, in emulation of his great ancestor who in reward of his military services obtained an hereditary title for his family from the hands of King Charles the First. He excited his neighbours to the national defence against the dangers of a threatened invasion. He rebuilt the dilapidated mansion of his forefathers and delighted to reside in the place of his nativity where with manners frank and courteous and sincere he received his friends with liberal hospitality, and relieved the indigent with unbounded charity. In the relations of private and domestic life he discharged the duties and exemplified the character of a faithful and tender husband the affectionate parent, the zealous friend and benevolent neighbour, the useful citizen and the pious Christian.

He has been heavily involved in policing both terrorist- and corruption-based matters and has a mixed reputation, being seen by some people as a firm upholder of the law and by others as a violator of human rights.  Career  Sumedh Saini joined the Indian Police Service (IPS) in 1982 and progressed to serve six districts as Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) before succeeding Anil Kaushik as the Director-General of Police (DGP) for the Indian State of Punjab on 15 March 2012. He is heading the State Police out of the seven Directors General in the State. The appointment made him the youngest DGP in India. Appointed very soon after a new government had been formed, involving the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Saini was tasked with reducing crime and inhibiting the activities of people involved in the drug trade. Although supported by the Chief Minister, Parkash Singh Badal, the BJP claimed that the decision to appoint was a unilateral one and that they were not consulted. The Times of India noted at the time of his promotion that Saini \\"... has been in and out of controversies — within the service he has his detractors as well as ardent followers in equal number besides a dedicated fan following among policemen who fought during terrorism.\\" Saini has been a prominent figure in the efforts to maintain law and order in Punjab, in particular during a period in the 1980s and 1990s when terrorist activity was prevalent. In 1987, Saini won the highest award of Punjab for gallantry, in recognition of his leadership in operations against Khalistani insurgents, and in 1991 he had been injured in an assassination attempt made in Chandigarh by the same insurgents. In 2005 he was described as a Dirty Harry figure who inspires fear in those whom he seeks to bring to justice. His methods have attracted complaints and caused him to be reported for alleged breaches of human rights, and he has also faced trial as a consequence of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) linking him as the prime suspect in the alleged disappearance and murder of three men. The CBI investigation was deemed to be unlawful by the Supreme Court in December 2011 but court proceedings were still ongoing in 2014. His activities in corruption investigations have won praise, in particular a 2002 case that involved the Punjab Public Service Commission and various High Court judges. Saini was transferred from his post as DGP in October 2015, allegedly after pressure was put on the state government by the Government of India. He became chairman of the Police Housing Corporation and his successor as DGP was announced as being Suresh Arora. Concern had been expressed about the police reaction to anti- desecration protests at the village of Behbal Kalan, in Faridkot district, which had led to the deaths of two protestors and left several others injured.

Besides providing help to the starving of the Volga, the two Jesuits had a special task, given to them by Pope Pius XI as one of the first things he did as the Pope: to \\"seek and find\\" the Holy Relics of their 17th-century colleague, Blessed Andrew Bobola, which had apparently disappeared from Polotsk during, or soon after, the Russian Civil War or the Soviet-Polish War. Eventually, in September 1923 the Bolsheviks told the American Jesuits that Bobola's relics had been taken to a medical museum (\\"Hygiene Exhibition\\" of the People's Commissariat for Health in Moscow, and agreed to allow them to be taken to the Vatican.Religion: Saints Time magazine, Monday, Apr. 25, 1938. (The Time article says that Walsh personally transported the Holy Relics from Moscow to Rome; but this is apparently a mistake, since both Gallagher (1953) describes Gallagher's role as a diplomatic courier with the relics, and McNamara (2005), p. 45, mentions that Walsh stayed behind in Moscow after Gallagher's departure, and only left Moscow on November 16, 1923, and arrived in Rome on December 3. The author of the book explicitly says in his blog say that Gallagher was entrusted with that task.) Accordingly, on October 3 Walsh and Gallagher securely packed the body (later described by an American journalist as a \\"remarkably well- preserved mummy\\") at the museum, and took it to one of Moscow's train stations. Traveling as a diplomatic courier, Gallagher delivered the Holy Relics to the Vatican right in time for All Saints' Day (November 1) of 1923, by the way of Odessa, Istanbul and Brindisi. This book uses as one of its sources L.J. Gallagher's article, \\"How we rescued the Relics of Blessed Andrew Bobola\\" (1924), which unfortunately was not available to this contributor. Back in the USA, Gallagher served as the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Georgetown University (1924–26), Assistant to Provincial of the New England Province of the Society of Jesus (1926–32), and President of Boston College (1932–37). In April 1938, the same Pius XI who had started his pontificate charging the two Jesuits in Moscow with the task of searching for Bobola's relics, had Bobola canonized, less than a year before his own death.

The seventh named storm of the slightly below average 2009 Atlantic hurricane season, Grace formed from an extratropical cyclone over the Azores on October 4\\\\. It strengthened to attain peak sustained winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) and developed an eye-like feature, although cold sea surface temperatures inhibited the development of thunderstorm activity near the center. The storm lost its tropical characteristics on October 6, and the storm's remnants merged with a separate system near the British Isles on October 7. Grace had only minor effects on land, although while it was passing through the Azores, islands close to the storm's center recorded winds of up to 44 mph (71 km/h) and moderate rainfall. Although not solely related to the cyclone, heavy rainfall in Portugal led to some street flooding. The remnants also impacted parts of Ireland and the United Kingdom, where rainfall approaching 2 in (51 mm) and tropical storm- force winds were recorded. However, no damage occurred. Meteorological history Tropical Storm Grace originated from a large extratropical cyclone that formed along a cold front on September 27, roughly 470 mi (755 km) east of Cape Race, Newfoundland. Initially attached to an occluded front, the low detached from the system and gradually acquired tropical characteristics. By October 1, shower and thunderstorm activity began to develop near the center of the system as it tracked through the central Azores. However, the following day, convection began to decrease with the system, and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) ceased monitoring it. Over the following two days, the system executed a counter-clockwise loop near the Azores. During the afternoon of October 4, convection redeveloped around the center of the low and was classified as a tropical storm near São Miguel Island. Although the storm was tropical at this time, the NHC did not issue advisories for several hours. The first advisory from the NHC was issued at 11:00 AST on October 4; at this time, the system was officially named Grace, the seventh named storm of the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm featured relatively deep convection around an eye-like feature. Although Grace was over waters normally not warm enough for tropical cyclone development, low wind shear allowed the convection to persist. A steady northeastward track was taken by the storm in response to a southerly flow over the northwestern Atlantic. The storm intensified slightly as it moved over decreasing sea surface temperatures, with winds estimated at 65 mph (100 km/h) early on October 5; operationally it was held at 70 mph (110 km/h), but was downgraded due to uncertainties in the storm's intensity as it was progressing over cold waters. A large extratropical cyclone near Grace caused the storm to deteriorate in organization, with convection weakening and becoming asymmetric. By this time, the storm was over waters, likely inhibiting convective development. Shower and thunderstorm activity continued to diminish throughout the day on October 5; however, Grace maintained tropical characteristics, namely a deep, warm core. Early on October 6, the NHC issued their final advisory on Grace as it merged with a frontal system over the northeastern Atlantic. Just prior to merging, the lowest pressure in relation to the storm was recorded at 986 mbar (hPa; 29.12 inHg). The extratropical remnants of Grace persisted for roughly 18 hours before dissipating over the Celtic Sea early on October 7. However, the United States Naval Research Laboratory continued to monitor the system for several more hours until it moved over the North Sea. Although officially designated a tropical cyclone by the NHC, Météo-France, the French meteorological service, stated in their annual report to the World Meteorological Organization that Grace should not have been classified a tropical system. In their report, they argued that although the storm presented deep convection, an eye-like feature, and winds above 60 mph (95 km/h), the overall development of Grace was more similar to that of a mid-latitude non-tropical cyclone. However, operationally, Météo-France considered Grace to be a subtropical cyclone. They also criticized the NHC for warning on this system based on recent trends of the link between global warming and increased hurricane activity. Impact and records Overcast skies from the outskirts of Grace in alt=Dark and stormy clouds with sunlight breaking through in the background Upon being classified a tropical cyclone within the Azores, a few islands received minor rainfall and high winds. Gusts up to were recorded on Ponta Delgada. While merging with the frontal system on October 6, the storm's outer bands produced heavy rains and strong winds over parts of Portugal, resulting in some street flooding. In higher elevations, wind gusts were estimated to have exceeded . Due to the storm's relatively rapid forward movement by the time it reached the United Kingdom, rainfall was limited. In Ireland, of precipitation fell in the city of Cork. Sustained winds in the city were recorded up to . Rainfall in the country peaked at in Wexford. Near the coastline of Wales, a buoy recorded sustained winds up to , equivalent to a minimal tropical storm. Late on October 6, the remnants of Grace moved inland over Wales, bringing heavy rains and high winds to the region. Maximum rainfall in the United Kingdom reached in Capel Curig. One ship, the Cap Castillo (call sign A8PI5), recorded sustained winds of on October 5, while located about south of the storm's center. Moisture from the storm's remnants fueled another, more powerful cyclone that caused flooding in parts of Belgium after producing upwards of of rain. Operationally, Grace was not classified a tropical storm until it reached latitude 41.2°N. This marked the second northernmost formation of a tropical storm in the Atlantic on record; only Tropical Storm Alberto of 1988 had formed farther north. However, a post-storm analysis concluded that Grace had actually become a tropical storm 12 hours earlier than initially estimated, placing its location of development further south, at 38.5°N. The storm still marked the farthest northeast a tropical cyclone formed in the Atlantic basin, breaking the record set by Hurricane Vince in 2005. In its Tropical Cyclone Report on Grace, the National Hurricane Center reported that the formation of Grace was poorly forecast. The first mention of the precursor low on October 1 predicted that it would not develop into a tropical or subtropical cyclone. Over the following three days, the system was not mentioned in the NHC's tropical weather outlooks until just prior to Grace's classification. The lack of preceding outlooks was attributed to the storm's unusual location and the sparsity of data for storms in the region.

Board of County Commissioners Minutes and Agenda Packets. Minnesota Historical Society., is the second oldest known stone arch bridge in the state of Minnesota after Sibley's Ferry Bridge in Mendota, which was built in 1864 . It was constructed in Stillwater Township to carry the Point Douglas to Superior Military Road over Brown's Creek. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 for having local significance in the themes of engineering and transportation. It was nominated as an example of stone engineering and as a remnant of Minnesota's early government roads. History The road that was carried by the bridge was built as one of Minnesota's earliest road construction projects. When Minnesota became a territory in 1849, there were few land transportation routes other than the Red River Trails, although water transportation was possible along the rivers. Henry Hastings Sibley, who later became Minnesota's first governor, appealed to the United States Congress in 1850 for funds to build a network of military roads in Minnesota Territory. The Minnesota Road Act was passed in July 1850. The Point Douglas to Superior Military Road was authorized from Point Douglas (north of present-day Hastings), through Cottage Grove, Stillwater, Marine Mills (now Marine on St. Croix), Falls of St. Croix (now Taylors Falls), and to the \\"Falls or Rapids of the Saint Louis River of Lake Superior\\". The presumed purpose of these military roads was to provide a way for army troops to move quickly to an area where they were needed, but in practice these roads were more often used by civilians traveling between existing settlements or settling new areas. James H. Simpson, an officer in the U.S. Army and a member of the United States Corps of Topographical Engineers, was placed in charge of road construction. As specified in his construction bid, the original bridge built during the construction of the military road was wooden. Federal involvement in the road projects ended after Minnesota became a state, and the last personal left st. Paul in 1861. By 1863, it was clear a new, sturdier bridge was needed. On September 2, 1863, a contract was made with Michael Hanley and Fredrick Curtis for the construction of a stone bridge across Brown's Creek by the Washington County Commissioners. But, when Curtis and Hanley appeared before the County Commissioners to receive payment, on November 20, 1863, the commissioners stated that their contract was not fulfilled and their work was not accepted for unknown reasons. On August 3, 1865, a motion was made to have Commissioner William Willim lead and oversee the construction of a replacement bridge. Commissioner Willim's bridge was completed and accepted by the County on October 17, 1865 at a cost of $1197.38. Brown's Creek had been diverted south to power one of the first sawmills in Stillwater, and the remaining trickle was easy to ford. The Point Douglas to St. Louis River Road was never fully completed as a military road because Congress only allocated $10,000, $15,000, or $20,000 at a time, so Sibley and other representatives had to keep appealing to Congress for more funds to complete the roads. By 1858, the year Minnesota became a state, two-thirds of the Point Douglas to St. Louis River Road was substantially complete. The bridge is built of locally quarried limestone by Washington County Commissioner William Willim, who also was a stone and plaster contractor. The stone bridge was used until about 1891, when a wider wood bridge was built about east of the stone bridge, and the road was shifted onto a new alignment. In 1905 a local miller incorporated the bridge into a three-story mill on the site. The mill did not succeed, and it was torn down in 1927, leaving only the bridge.

He became the first editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association. Biography Davis was born near Greene, Chenango County, New York. He lived and worked on the farm until 16 years of age, attending district school in the winter, and studying for six months in Cazenovia Seminary. At the age of 17 he began mastering medicine under Dr. Daniel Clark, attended three courses of lectures at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of the Western District of New York, Fairfield, and was graduated from that institution, on January 31, 1837, with a thesis on \\"Animal Temperature\\". He first practiced in Vienna, New York, but after a few months moved to Binghamton, New York and soon after settled in New York City. In 1841, he was awarded the prize from the Medical Society of the State of New York for the best \\"Analysis of the Discoveries Concerning the Physiology of the Nervous System.\\" About seven years later the State Agricultural Society of New York awarded him a prize for a \\"Text-Book on Agricultural Chemistry.\\" He became a member of the Broome County Medical Society, and was one of its censors in 1838. In 1841, 1842 and 1843 he was secretary and librarian of the society, and in 1843 delegate from Broome County to the Medical Society of the State of New York. In 1845 his report as chairman of the Committee on Correspondence relative to Medical Education and Examination led to the organization of the American Medical Association. Nathan Smith Davis Almost from the beginning of his career, Davis was identified with medical education. While in Binghamton, he obtained a cadaver and demonstrated anatomy to medical students. His first work as a teacher was lecturer and demonstrator of anatomy in the College of Physicians and Surgeons in the city of New York in 1848. A year later he moved to Chicago and accepted the chair of physiology and pathology in Rush Medical College. A year later, in addition, he assumed the duties of the chair of practice of medicine, and remained connected with the institution for ten years. Soon after he became connected with this college, he appreciated the necessity of a better system of medical education, as at that time there was no classification of students and no adjustable curriculum. He began to agitate for reform, but was opposed. He withdrew, and with a few colleagues founded the Chicago Medical College, of which he was for more than forty years the dean and professor of principles and practice of medicine. When Davis arrived in Chicago, there was no organization of physicians, and he was one of the prime movers in the Chicago Medical Society and the Illinois State Medical Society. For twelve years he was secretary of the Chicago Medical Society, and in 1855 served as its president. Soon after his arrival in Chicago, there was an epidemic of malaria, and he found on analyzing the drinking water that it was polluted by sewage. He straightway began agitation for a system of drainage, and to this end delivered a number of lectures resulting in sewerage reconstruction and foundation of Mercy Hospital. A school later named after him in Chicago. His editorial work began while he was residing in New York City, where he was editor of the Annalist. In 1855 became editor of the Chicago Medical Journal, and five years later the Chicago Medical Examiner, remaining with these journals for twenty years. It was chiefly through his efforts that the Journal of the American Medical Association was established in 1883, and he was its first editor, continuing in that position for six years. He was a member of the International Medical Congress in 1876, and at that time read a notable paper on \\"American Medical Institutions.\\" In 1887 he was secretary-general and later president of the Ninth International Medical Congress in Washington. While organizing this congress, he was stricken with cerebral hemorrhage, but recovered within three weeks. He was one of the founders and trustees of Northwestern University of the Chicago Academy of Sciences, the Chicago Historical Society, Illinois State Microscopical Society and Union College of Law, of which he was professor of medical jurisprudence. He was also an honorary member of the British Medical Association, and many other scientific societies in the US and abroad, a charter member of the American Medical Association, American Medical Temperance Association, Illinois State Medical Society, and the Chicago Medical Society. He was vice-president of the American Medical Association in 1854, president, in 1864 and 1865, trustee from 1882 to 1884 and editor from 1883 to 1888. Davis was a voluminous writer. Among his chief contributions to the medical literature are his \\"Principles and Practice of Medicine\\", \\"Medical Education and Reform\\", \\"Verdict of Science Concerning the Effects of Alcohol on Man\\", and \\"Clinical Lectures\\". In 1876 he was first attacked by a prostatic disease, from which he suffered until his death. On June 5, 1904, he was taken ill, showing signs of uremic poisoning. Up to within one hour of his death he talked clearly and well. He died on June 16, quietly and without pain. Davis's son and grandson of the same name themselves became physicians.

Confusion about the name EU-sponsored information plaque with building description headed by wrong name at 13th Century Tsiranavor Church Some confusion about the name of the churches of Spitakavor and Tsiranavor has seemed to have occurred due to the misplacement of the Russian markers located inside the two structures. New EU- sponsored information plaques with building descriptions adopted the wrong designations of the older plates thus amplifying the confusion. Anyone that lives in the city around the area will tell you that Spitakavor (\\"Whitish\\") is the white church from the 5th Century, and Tsiranavor (\\"Apricotish\\") is the apricot colored church from the 13th Century.Aragatsotn Province, stoneland- travel.com The name plaques at the churches however will tell you the opposite. Nearby is also the church of Karmravor (\\"Reddish\\"), formally known as the Church of Holy Mother of God (Surb Astvatsatsin). It is a 7th Century Armenian Apostolic church. Furthermore, there are the churches of S. Mariane and S. Sarkis. In the gorge is a unique bridge built in 1664. Location It may be seen across the gorge from the church of Surp Sarkis, but is easiest reached via the streets of the neighborhood that it sits within. Very close (down the street 3 houses) and also sitting along the gorge is the church of Spitakavor (literally meaning whitish because of its color), built between the 5th-6th centuries. Architecture Spitakavor is a small cruciform type church constructed during the 13th century. It is apricot-orange in color, because of the tufa stone used for the construction of the building. Presently, only the walls remain since the roof, drum, and dome have collapsed. There is a main portal to the structure at the front façade, and another at the side of the church. Interior walls are flat except for the semi-circular apse located directly across from the main portal. Very little decoration adorns the church other than some cruciform relief found on the exterior walls. Legend According to a legend, three sisters lived in Ashtarak, all of whom fell in love with the same man, prince Sargis. The elder two sisters decided to commit suicide in favor of the youngest one. One wearing an apricot-orange dress and the other wearing a red dress, they threw themselves into the gorge. When the youngest sister found out, she put on a white dress and also threw herself into the gorge. Sargis then became a hermit and three small churches appeared at the edge of the gorge, named after the sisters' dress colors.

Confusion about the name EU-sponsored information plaque with building description headed by wrong name at the 5th Century Church \\"Spitakavor\\" (Whitish) Information plaque in Armenian and Russian language with wrong designation (Церковь Циранавор) at the 5th Century Church \\"Spitakavor\\" (Whitish) Some confusion about the name of the churches of Tsiranavor and Spitakavor has seemed to have occurred due to the misplacement of the Russian markers located inside the two structures. New EU-sponsored information plaques with building descriptions adopted the wrong designations of the older plates thus amplifying the confusion. Anyone that lives in the city around the area will tell you that Spitakavor (\\"Whitish\\") is the white church from the 5th Century, and Tsiranavor (\\"Apricotish\\") is the apricot colored church from the 13th Century.Aragatsotn Province, stoneland- travel.com The name plaques at the churches however will tell you the opposite. Nearby is also the church of Karmravor (\\"Reddish\\"), formally known as the Church of Holy Mother of God (Surb Astvatsatsin). It is a 7th Century Armenian Apostolic church. Furthermore, there are the churches of S. Mariane and S. Sarkis. In the gorge is a unique bridge built in 1664. Location It may be seen across the gorge from the church of Surp Sarkis, but is easiest reached via the streets of the neighborhood that it sits within. Very close (just down the street 3 houses) and also sitting along the gorge is the church of Tsiranavor (literally meaning apricotish because of its color), built between the 13th-14th centuries. Architecture Tsiranavor Church is a triple-aisled basilica built in the 5th century, and most-likely renovated the years between 540 and 557. There is not a foundation inscription, but evidence indicating a date for the construction of the church include the archaic T-shaped piers, the arches of the nave, and the two pilasters that survive at the north wall that do not correspond to those at the south wall. Traces of an earlier 5th century structure in the construction details have also been found. The front façade had at one time been painted white, and is covered in inscriptions. One portal leads into the building from the south wall, and another (now blocked off) was at the western wall. All of the walls, the horseshoe apse flanked by two rectangular chambers, two massive piers, and the southern aisle’s columns remain standing. At the west end a small portion of the vaulted ceiling remains, but much of it has since collapsed. During the 17th century the church was fortified by doubling the north and west walls in order to defend the structure, and above the southern wall a gun slot was erected. In 1815, the church was partially ruined. The south façade was supposedly rebuilt at one point. During 1963-64, restorations were done to the church which revealed walls, piers, arches, fragments of vaults, and a khachkar. Legend According to a legend, three sisters lived in Ashtarak, all of whom fell in love with the same man, Prince Sargis. The elder two sisters decided to commit suicide in favor of the youngest one. One wearing an apricot-orange dress and the other wearing a red dress, they threw themselves into the gorge. When the youngest sister found out, she put on a white dress and also threw herself into the gorge. Sargis then became a hermit and three small churches appeared at the edge of the gorge, named after the sisters' dress colors.

Langloh Parker Catherine Eliza Somerville Stow (1 May 1856 – 27 March 1940), who wrote as K. Langloh Parker, was a South Australian born writer who lived in northern New South Wales in the late nineteenth century. She is best known for recording the stories of the Ualarai around her. Her testimony is one of the best accounts of the beliefs and stories of an Aboriginal people in north-west New South Wales at that time. However, her accounts reflect European attitudes of the time. Early life Parker was born Catherine Eliza Somerville Field at Encounter Bay, in South Australia, daughter of Henry Field, pastoralist, and his wife Sophia, daughter of Rev. Ridgway Newland. Henry Field established Marra station near Wilcannia on the Darling River in New South Wales, and 'Katie' was raised there. The relocation brought the family both prosperity and sorrows. In an incident that took place in January 1862, her sisters Jane and Henrietta drowned while Katie was rescued by her Ualarai nurse, Miola. In recognition, Miola was taken in to be schooled together with the Fields' other children. The family moved back to Adelaide in 1872. Marriage In 1875, on reaching her maturity at 18, she married her first husband, Langloh Parker, 16 years her senior. In 1879 they moved to his property, Bangate Station, near Angledool, on Ualarai lands by the Narran River. Langloh Parker's holdings consisted of running some 100,000 sheep and cattle. He found time also to work as magistrate at Walgett. Over the following two decades she collected many of the Ualarai stories and legends which were to fill her books and make her famous. After drought struck the region, the station eventually failed and the Parkers moved to Sydney in 1901, where Langloh was diagnosed with cancer, dying two years later. Katie travelled to England and married a lawyer, Percival Randolph Stow (son of Randolph Isham Stow), in 1905. The couple eventually returned to Australia, taking up residence in the suburb of Glenelg in Adelaide until her death in 1940. Ethnographical work Katie Parker had a fair degree of fluency in Ualarai. But her scruples over accurate reportage led her to inquire among, and converse with, her informants by adopting a technique to control against errors. She would elicit material on a legend from an elder, then get the English version retranslated back by a native more fluent in English than the elders, in order to enable the latter to correct any errors that might have arisen. The interpreter would then translate the revised version, which she would write down, and then have the written account read back to the elderly informant for final confirmation of its accuracy. Her first foray in ethnography, Australian Legendary Tales: folklore of the Noongahburrahs as told to the Piccaninnies, appeared in 1896 as one of a series dealing with 'Fairy Tales of the British Empire'. Sahe followed this on two years later with More Australian Legendary Tales. The Scottish writer and anthropologist Andrew Lang had provided prefaces to both works, and it was perhaps on his advice and encouragement that she eventually wrote the classic for which she is best known,The Euahlayi Tribe: A study of Aboriginal life in Australia, which came out in 1905. This, as generally her earlier books, were well received by the relevant scholarly community at the time: reviews commended her direct transmission of what elders had told her, unadorned by imaginative additions. Reflecting on the use to which her ethnography had been put, she expressed a lively wariness about how aboriginal material can be reworked to fit some modern theory, under the misapprehension that the scholar thereby evinces a 'detachment' from the immediate world of his study's distant subjects, as when she remarked perceptively, as Evans notes, observed that: > I dare say little with an air of finality about black people; I have lived > too much with them for that. To be positive, you should never spend more > than six months in their neighbourhood; in fact, if you want to keep your > anthropological ideas quite firm, it is safer to let the blacks remain in > inland Australia while you stay a few thousand miles away. Otherwise, your > preconceived notions are almost sure to totter to their foundations; and > nothing is more annoying than to have elaborately built-up, delightfully > logical theories, played ninepins with by an old greybeard of a black, who > apparently objects to his beliefs being classified, docketed, and pigeon- > holed, until he has had his say. She concludes by expressing her sympathy with Montaigne's criticism of European man's sense of being more enlightened than savages, when we ourselves boast of laws that putatively reflect nature rather than being themselves the outcome of custom. Missionaries among the Aborigines failed to realize that the natives whom they tried to convert from their 'customs' hewed far more closely to their laws than Christians do, and missionaries were as much victims of their own customs as the native flock among whom they proselytized were of theirs. Her books nonetheless went out of print, and only in recent decades has her work been retrieved and examined, either critically as embodying the flaws of colonial ethnography, or as an early example of feminist approaches in anthropology. Other works Parker wrote several other minor works, including a cookery book (Kookaburra Cookery Book,1911) which proved very popular; Walkabouts of Wur-run-nah(1918) and Woggheeguy:Australian Aboriginal Legends(1930). Her reminiscences of life at Bangate, My Bush Book, was only published posthumously, edited by her biographer, Marcie Muir.

Novak left his position there in 1924 to go to the University of Belgrade. Viktor Novak dedicated many years to the extensive research of clericalism and extreme nationalism among Roman Catholic Croats in Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia.Magnum Crimen [1948], pages IX-XI He did extensive research on the cultural and political foundations of the Yugoslav movement in the nineteenth century (with works on key persons such as Josip Juraj Strossmayer, Franjo Rački, and Natko Nodilo), as well as on the relations between the reformer of the Serbian alphabet Vuk Stefanović Karadžić and members of the Croatian Illyrian movement. In Belgrade Novak's writings represented a strict Yugoslav unitary concept. During the January 6 Dictatorship, Novak wrote his Antologija jugoslovenske misli i narodnog jedinstva (Anthology of Yugoslav Consciousness and National Unity). According to historian Ivan Mužić, the work was an attempt \\"to justify a newly conceived myth of a three-tribed nation and its ostensible united national consciousness which dates to the sixth century\\". Novak would write: The future generations, freed of atavistic woes, with the aid of conscious national education, can bear in their hearts one great and holy idea, which will safeguard the people from external and internal enemies. That idea is the Yugoslav idea alone. In Belgrade Novak was a member of the Yugoslav Cultural Club and wrote in its unofficial journal Vidici. Novak would write in Serbian ekavian while working in Belgrade. Novak authored Magnum Tempus,published as Magnum tempus: ilirizam i katoličko sveštenstvo : ideje i ličnosti, 1830-1849 by Novak, Viktor; Nova knjiga, Belgrade, 1987 Magnum Sacerdospublished as Josip Juraj Strossmayer: apostol Jugoslovenske misli by Novak, Viktor; Savez sokola kraljevine Jugoslavije, Belgrade, 1941 and Magnum Crimen (The Great Crime - a half-century of clericalism in Croatia), a trilogy about the Roman Catholic Church in Yugoslavia and its relation to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the Roman Curia, and the Croatian clerical nationalism including Ustashe supporters and World War II.Magnum Crimen [1948], pages I-XV From 1929 to 1959, he was a professor of Yugoslav history at the University of Belgrade. The Vatican Curia placed Magnum Crimen on their list of banned books Index librorum prohibitorum and named Viktor Novak \\"an enemy of Catholic Church\\". As an ardent Yugoslav patriot and anti-fascist activist, Viktor Novak was during the Second World War arrested and spent some time in the Nazi detention camp at Banjica, near Belgrade.Richard West:Tito and the Rise and Fall of Yugoslavia, Faber & Faber, Nov 15, 2012 The Gestapo in Belgrade arrested and imprisoned many prominent writers, artists and academics, including Viktor Novak, the author of two volumes on the history of the Croatian Catholic Church and its attitude to Yugoslavia. While in a concentration camp north of Belgrade, Novak met some of the refugees from the NDH, and heard of the crimes committed by the Ustasha and their clerical supporters. On leaving prison in autumn 1941, Novak started to write Magnum Crimen, his massive work on the Croatian Catholic Church in the twentieth century. After the Second World War, Novak continued teaching Yugoslav history and methodology of history at the Belgrade University. He was later elected to membership of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU; corresponding member in 1948 and full member in 1961) and was made head of the Department for Social Sciences of the Academy (1966–69). Novak was among founders and first director of the History Institute of SANU (Istorijski institut SANU) from 1947 to 1954. He was also praised for his books on Latin paleography, which are considered to be seminal works on the subject in Serbian historiography. Magnum Crimen, which is considered the main source of first-hand accounts of close relations between Croatian clericalism and pro- Nazi Croatian Ustashas, that led to the genocide against the Serbs, Jews and Roma in the 1941–45 Independent State of Croatia, was first published in 1948, and again in an abridged version in 1960 in Sarajevo. The 1948 edition, reprinted several times in Belgrade after 1986, was highly acclaimed as a masterpiece left in oblivion.МИЛОРАД ЕКМЕЧИЋ: НАПАДИ НА MAGNUM CRIMEN (Milorad Ekmečić: Attacks on Magnum Crimen) 'The English edition of his magnum opus - Magnum Crimen was completed eventually in 2011 and published in two volumes on more than 1,300 pages, with two chapters that were omitted from the first edition in 1948, due to the communist censorship.

Although there is no evidence his remains are actually there, it is commonly assumed to be the resting place of Minamoto no Yoritomo, founder and first shōgun of the Kamakura shogunate. The cenotaph consists of a 186 cm gorintō (a Buddhist stone stupa) surrounded by a stone tamagaki (a fence usually delimiting the sacred soil of a Shinto shrine), and was built during the Edo period (1603–1868), far after the shōguns death in 1199. In the course of history, the site's prestige has attracted other structures, so that now it is occupied by the Site of the Hokke-dō, (the spot where Yoritomo's Hokke-dō, or funeral temple, used to stand during the Edo period), (not to be confused with the homonymous shrine part of Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gū), and the black stone stele commemorating the Hokke-dō and the mass suicide of the Miura clan. A couple of hundred meters further to the east lie the yagura (an artificial cave used during the Kamakura period as a grave or as a cenotaph) of the Miura clan, the twin tombs of Oe no Hiromoto and of his son Mōri Suemitsu, and the grave of Yoritomo's illegitimate son Shimazu Tadahisa. The grave of Yoritomo and the ruins of the Hokke-dō are national Historic Sites.Nihon Rekishi Chimei Taikei History Yoritomo's grave todayWhen Yoritomo suddenly died falling from his horse on February 8, 1199 (Shōji era, 13th day of the first month) he was buried in a Buddhist temple on the side of a hill just north of his government's seat, the Ōkura Bakufu. The temple stood where the tomb of Yoritomo now is, and was moved elsewhere in the Edo period. The temple hadn't yet assumed the name it is now known under, but was simply Yoritomo's , the temple which enshrined his tutelary goddess Shō-Kannon. The name under which this area in now known, Nishi Mikado or \\"Western Gate\\", is itself a relic of the time in which it was just west of the shōguns palace. Remains of the Hokke-dō The Hokke-dō was Yoritomo's personal temple, which was destroyed, moved and rebuilt several times in the course of its history and which is no longer extant. On the site where it used to stand before it was demolished in 1872 there are now a shrine called Shirahata Shrine and a stone stele which reads:Original Japanese text available here > The Hokke-dō originally enshrined Yoritomo's tutelary goddess [Shō-Kannon] > but, after his death, was turned into his grave. When in June 1217 (Kempō 5, > 5th month) Wada Yoshimori rebelled and set the Ōkura Bakufu on fire, this is > where shōgun Sanetomo found refuge. Also, on August 7, 1247 (Hōji 1, 5th day > of the 6th month), Miura Yasumura barricaded in here to resist the onslaught > of Hōjō forces, but was defeated. He therefore gathered 500 members of his > clan and committed with them mass suicide, dyeing the ground in red and > black with their blood. The stele on the spot where the Hokke-dō used to stand.A is today a Tendai hall whose layout allows walking around a statue for meditation. The purpose of walking is to concentrate on the Lotus Sūtra and seek the ultimate truth. In Yoritomo's time however the term simply meant someone's funerary hall.Kamiya Vol. 1 (2008:29-32) That use of the word had its origin in the fact that the Lotus Sūtra (Hokkekyō) was usually read during funeral ceremonies. Built in 1189 as Yoritomo's personal temple, at his death in 1199 it became his grave and there were performed his funerary rites. The Hokke-dō however assumed its present name only the following year, in occasion of Yoritomo's yearly funeral rites for that year. Likely a building of a certain size, it had as its dōshi (officiating monk) the famous holy man Eisai and, according to the Azuma Kagami, it was visited by Hōjō Tokimasa and the powerful of the shogunate. The main object of worship chosen by Yoritomo was a 6 cm silver statue of Shō-Kannon, which seems to attest that the temple wasn't built simply as a grave for the shōgun. =The Wada Kassen= In 1213 Wada Yoshimori rebelled against the Hōjō regents in the so-called and his famous son Asahina Yoshihide stormed into the Ōkura Bakufu, burning it into the ground. Second shōgun Minamoto no Sanetomo consequently had to run for his life, and found refuge in the Hokke-dō. Shikken Hōjō Yoshitoki and Ōe no Hiromoto followed him there. It seems likely that this was done not simply because the temple was close, but also because it was in an elevated position, was sufficiently large to house an army and therefore easily defensible, and was probably fortified. =The Hōji Kassen (a.k.a. Miura no Ran) and the death of the Miura clan= In 1247, 500 members of the Miura clan, at the closing of the (also known as the ) barricaded inside the Hokke-dō under the orders of Miura Yasumura and committed seppuku (mass suicide). It is said that the whole floor was red with their blood. The episode was the culmination of events that saw the tension between the Hōjō and the Adachi clans, on one side, and the Miura on the other, grow to the point where Adachi Yasumori with his troops attacked Yasumura's mansion in Nishi Mikado. The mansion was burned down and the clan took refuge inside the Hokke-dō. There, realizing their position was hopeless, the decision was taken to proceed with the seppuku. Their deaths are commemorated in a yagura carved in the rock a few hundred meters to the east of this site. (See below) =The Edo period and Shirahata Shrine= Shirahata ShrineWe know that during the Edo period (1600–1878) the Hokke-dō had already moved to the spot where Shirahata Jinja is today. The area around the tomb of Yoritomo is clearly shown in an Edo period drawing (below), and in it the Hokke-dō has already moved from its original site on the side of the hill to the plain under the original location. Clearly visible in the upper left corner are also the tombs of Ōe no Hiromoto, Shimazu Tadahisa and Mōri Suemitsu. The Buddhist temple was also used as a Shinto shrine (as was normal at the time), and in fact it enshrined the spirit of Yoritomo. When however during the Meiji period the separation of Buddhism and Shinto was made mandatory with the (see the articles Shinbutsu Bunri and Haibutsu kishaku), Yoritomo's kami had by law to be enshrined with the name in today's Shirahata Shrine, a Shinto shrine under the administration of Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gū. The name Shirahata, meaning \\"white flag\\", is a reference to the white Minamoto flag. The area where the demolished Hokke- dōThe sign in Japanese on the spot delicately says the Buddhist temple was \\"rebuilt\\" as Shirahata Jinja. used to stand was then declared a national Historic Site. According to the sign in front of Shirahata Shrine, the present building was built in 1970 with charity donations. The tomb of Yoritomo The area around the tomb of Yoritomo in an Edo period drawing The gorintō that today constitutes the grave was brought there by 's chief priest from the ruins of a temple called at the time the Meiji period's forcible separation of Shinto and Buddhism. According to a 1795 document called , at the time just to the north of the Ōkura Bakufu there was . The author mentions that locals were pleased by the fact that repairs to it were planned. The first mention of a gorintō is of 1814. Shimazu Shigehide in 1779 had his ancestor's tomb repaired, a temizubachi installed and the whole place refurbished. Every year on April 13, as part of the Kamakura Matsuri week of celebrations, in front of the tomb is held the .Kamakura Shōkō Kaigijo (2008:18) From Kyūshū comes also a representative of the Shimazu clan, whose founder Shimazu Tadashisa is buried in the vicinity.

See the map above. Ōe no Hiromoto was a kuge and the Kamakura shogunate's chief vassal, and he greatly contributed to the development and consolidation of its administrative structure.Shirai (2004:41) Shimazu Tadahisa (d. 1227) was the illegitimate son of shōgun Yoritomo and a sister of Hiki Yoshikazu, and the founder of the Shimazu clan.Shirai (2004:146) He was nominated shugo, or governor, of Satsuma province in Kyūshū. His family would then retain control of the province until the Meiji restoration in the 19th century. His tomb was built here by his descendant Shigehide in 1779. (1211–1247) was Ōe no Hiromoto's fourth son and the founder of the Mōri clan.Shirai (2004:300) He died together with the Miura at the Hokke-dō in 1247. Their graves, carved from the side of the hill, stand side to side and are still regularly tended to. The yagura of the Miura clan The yagura of the Miura clan. Visible food offerings and some sotoba (small wooden stupa)During the Kamakura period in and around Kamakura, for reasons that are unclear, warriors, priests and sometimes even commoners were buried in caves called Yagura carved out of the soft limestone that makes up the hills around the city. Yagura containing a gorintō were sometimes used also as cenotaphs (memorial monuments). The souls of those of the Miura clan who perished during the siege of the neighboring Hokke-dō are enshrined in a small yagura whose opening is barely visible to the left of the base of the twin stairways leading to the tombs of Shimazu Tadahisa and Mōri Suemitsu (see map above). The cenotaph is still tended and visited.

Hungarian New Zealanders constitute a small minority of New Zealand's population. In the 2001 census in New Zealand, when asked to indicate their ethnic identity, 894 New Zealanders described themselves as \\"Hungarian\\", altogether 1,191 spoke Hungarian and 987 stated they were born in Hungary. In 2006 1476 people spoke Hungarian. History=19th century Hungarians began to emigrate to New Zealand in the middle of the 19th century, but this was not a permanent settling. After the Hungarian Revolution in 1848 small groups arrived from Hungary, but also they travelled forward. In the 1860s there was a gold rush in Otago, again small groups arrived in New Zealand. One of them, Zsigmond Vékey, a lawyer became the journalist of Otago Daily Times. Later he went back to Hungary. The first permanent settlers came between 1872 and 1876, and some people later in the 19th century. 20th century In 1909 a certain man, named István Rácz arrived in Tuatapere, Southland. He wrote letters to his home in Csongrád, Hungary. Because of this, in 1911 three other families (the Szivák, Kollát and Kókay families) joined him from the city. During the next two decades still some families followed them, altogether approximately 100 families. Some of their descendants became famous: in 1970 István Kókay's son, Stephen Kokay was chosen as the representative of the Waiau district on the Wallace County Council. One of his daughters is a biologist, named Dr. Ilona Kokay, who teaches at the Otago University. His son Les Kokay is internationally recognised in music circles for his writings on Bob Dylan in ISIS magazine and other writings on Bob Dylan.Bob Dylan#cite ref-Kokay 137-0 He invented the ‘LesK’ cube (a 3x3x3 cube puzzle) and was the first to solve a ‘fairly hard’ tetra-cube puzzle. Mike Racz became a Guinness recorder as the fastest oyster opener. In the beginning of the Second World War 55 Hungarians arrived, right after the war still 62. In the beginning of the 1950s another 136 Hungarians arrived in New Zealand. The largest group of refugees from Hungary, 1099 people, arrived after the 1956 Revolution. Most of them was settled in the main centres of Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch. One of them was Anna Porter (born Anna Szigethy), the novelist, who later moved to Canada. The fathers of Marton Csokas and Nándor Tánczos both were 1956-refugees. Tom Paulay, also a 1956-refugee, taught at the University of Canterbury. Until 1970 still 290 Hungarians settled down in New Zealand. Hungarian culture in New Zealand In the 1980s there was movement to create cultural associations. In 2006 such societies exist in four cities: Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin. On 20 August 2006, Magyar Millennium Park was opened in Wellington, featuring an original Székely gate.

Formed in 1973 as a more camp-oriented response to San Francisco's Imperial Court System by H.L. Perry, who reigned as the Court's Grand Duchess I, the Grand Ducal Council raises money for a wide array of charity organizations through large annual costume balls and various other, smaller fund raisers throughout the year. Both the Imperial Court System and the Grand Ducal Council of San Francisco are built using roughly the same power structure. \\"Monarchs\\" are elected and the nonprofit, 501(c)(3) portion is run by a Board of Directors or Trustees. The Grand Ducal Council of San Francisco, in turn, inspired similar such organizations to be founded around the country. In 1998, the Grand Ducal Council of San Francisco was joined by a sister Court located in Alameda County, on the opposite side of the San Francisco Bay. A third such sovereign Ducal Court exists in London, Ontario, Canada.

Titles  Each court holds an annual \\"coronation,\\" which is usually the chapter's largest fundraiser and is attended by both local members and members of other Ducal chapters as well Imperial Courts from across North America. The evening culminates in the ceremony in which the new monarch or monarchs—the Grand Duke and Grand Duchess—are crowned. In San Francisco, the new monarchs are determined by popular elections held in the community. Within a set number of weeks, the newly elected monarchs must hold an \\"investiture,\\" at which time they name the members of their Court. The titles given to members vary from one chapter to another and are primarily left to the discretion of the reigning monarchs. Each Court consists of a Royal Crown Prince and Royal Crown Princess, Prince/Princess Royale, Baron/Baroness, etc. Additionally, each year the Court holds fund raising competitions to crown such titles as Royal Baby Girl & Baby Boy, King & Queen of Hearts, Mr. & Miss Royal Bunny, Royal Daddy & Royal Daddy's Boy and White Knight and Debutante. In 2009, the Court added an annual fund raising pageant to crown Miss San Francisco Gold Rush.  Fundraising  Each court conducts numerous fundraisers throughout the year. Drag shows, ranging in size from performances at local bars to events in hotel ballrooms and other large venues, are the main way in which revenue is raised for charity. Especially in recent years, court chapters have diversified their fundraising strategies so as to include yard sales, gift raffles, etc. Court members also solicit donations at LGBT events, gay pride parades and other public events at which they appear. The Grand Ducal Council of San Francisco donates the funds raised to a variety of causes including those related to AIDS, breast cancer, domestic abuse, and homelessness.  Membership  While composed primarily of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people, each court is open to all. Gay, bisexual, transgender and straight people have all served as monarchs and court members in the system's history. Introduction to the Imperial Court System Drag queens collectively comprise about half of the membership.

Utilising targeted, integrated and sustained social marketing approaches and developing practical education initiatives and resources allows DrinkWise to inform and support the community about responsible alcohol use. DrinkWise's philosophy is founded on industry leadership and community partnerships. It is currently funded by voluntary contributions from alcohol industry participants, and has in the past received both Coalition and Labour Government funding to support its work. The organisation is governed by a board of eminent Australians with backgrounds including policing, public health, education, community service, academia, research and marketing. DrinkWise's alcohol industry contributors are also represented on its board.  History  DrinkWise Australia was established in 2005 and then received $5 million in funding from the Federal Government as announced by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing in the then Australian Government, the Hon Christopher Pyne MP.  Board Members  Under the DrinkWise constitution, the board must comprise seven (7) community members and six (6) industry representatives with the Chair being a community member. Current board members as at December 2016 are: Community directors: * Mr Neil Comrie AO, APM – Chair * Professor Niki Ellis * Hon. Rob Knowles AO * Paul Sheahan AM * Terry Slater * Professor Richard Smallwood AO * Amanda Vanstone Industry directors: * James Brindley * Peter Hurley * David Smith * Jan Craps * Giuseppe Minissale * Angus McPherson None of the DrinkWise community members receive funding from the alcohol industry, although payment for their role as Board Members is provided, as it is for the Chair.  Activities =Campaigns To date, DrinkWise Australia has launched a range of social marketing campaigns and initiatives including: Kids Absorb Your Drinking, Kids and Alcohol Don’t Mix, Drinking – Do it Properly and \\"You won't Miss a Moment...if you DrinkWise\\". =Kids Absorb Your Drinking= Launched in June 2008, the Kids Absorb Your Drinking campaign marked DrinkWise Australia’s initial step towards engaging generational change in attitudes to alcohol. The campaign was created to raise awareness of the importance of role-modelling behaviour of parents in relation to their consumption of alcohol. In a 2008 media release, DrinkWise cites research that supports the view that there is a strong positive correlation between the way parents drink and how their children grow up to drink. According to DrinkWise, children form their attitudes towards alcohol a long time before they’ve had their first drink by observing how their parents and other adults around them drink. =Kids and Alcohol Don’t Mix= In 2010 the Kids and Alcohol Don’t Mix campaign alerted parents to emerging clinical research undertaken by Professor Ian Hickie at the Sydney University mind and brain institute that indicated that alcohol can cause damage to the developing adolescent brain. The campaign challenged parents to put aside any existing beliefs about introducing alcohol to their underage adolescents and to encourage them to delay their children’s introduction to alcohol for as long as possible. The campaign empowers parents with facts and tactics via the DrinkWise website. =Drinking – Do it Properly (18–24 year old Campaign)= In 2014, DrinkWise Australia launched an Australian first campaign designed to influence young adults (18–24 years) to drink responsibly – by moderating the intensity and frequency of binge drinking occasions. The Drinking – Do it Properly campaign aims to make the ongoing trend of drinking to get drunk less socially acceptable among young drinkers, and to encourage those already drinking in safe and moderate ways. The campaign was developed in response to the prevalence of poor drinking choices by young Australians aged 18–24 years. DrinkWise commissioned extensive quantitative and qualitative formative research as well as multiple rounds of concept testing research to ensure the campaign cut through with young adults. To date the campaign has been in receipt of numerous international and Australian awards. Commissioned research Where a knowledge gap has existed DrinkWise Australia has commissioned independent academic research to ensure that its activities are underpinned by a sound evidence base: * From Ideal to Reality: Cultural contradictions and young people’s drinking:Borlagdan, J., Freeman, T., Duvnjak, A., Lunnay, B., Bywood, P.T., Roche, A.M.

The first stage of this project resulted in a literature review that collected a range of data that addressed the topic and was published in 2008. This Report is the result of qualitative research undertaken by NCETA that examined the socio-cultural influences on 14 to 24 year old Australians' drinking and the analysis provides useful insights to better understand these influences. * Drinking patterns in Australia, 2001-2007:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2010.

This project was undertaken to develop a comprehensive prevention model that was capable of reducing alcohol- related violence and aggression, and a scientifically defensible research design to test the model in a variety of licensed environments in Australia and New Zealand.  Criticism  Some health and academic commentators have noted that DrinkWise is the Australian version of the global alcohol industry- supported public relations organisations,Miller, P.G., Kypri, K. (2009) Why we will not accept funding from DrinkWise. Drug and Alcohol Review; 28, 324–326Miller, P.G., Kypri, K., Chikritzhs, T.N., Skov, S.J., Rubin, G.

Access to Confidential Alcohol Industry Documents: From ‘Big Tobacco’ to ‘Big Booze’. AMJ 1(3), 1-26. In 2009 fifty-eight scientists and health professionals expressed their opposition to DrinkWise by signing a letter stating that they will not seek or accept funding from them, and called on other researchers and community agencies to consider their own positions. These researchers strongly oppose the perceived conflict of interest between a body that is linked to an industry that profits from the consumption of alcohol, and that also purports to funds research aimed at reducing alcohol- related harm. In 2018 thousands of posters warning pregnant women about the dangers of alcohol have had to be removed from the walls of hospitals and GP clinics around Australia because they contained misleading and inaccurate information about the risks of drinking alcohol while pregnant. The posters were distributed by Tonic Health Media and were later replaced with updated posters.

He landed in New York on April 2, 1892, and the next day he traveled to Gardner. Later, other Polish immigrants, including Jan Kijek, Peter Piascik, Paul Cychol, Francis Wiski, and Roman Kulczyk, joined him. In 1903, members of the Polish settlement in Gardner began to organize associations and interest groups. The first such organization was the Polish National Alliance which was founded in 1903. A few years later the organization entertained the idea of creating a community of fraternal aid. After many meetings and deliberations, the St. Joseph SocietyNew Advent Encyclopedia was founded on March 2, 1906. Since September 11, 1906, the Society began paying its members five U.S. dollars a week to help the sick or handicapped. On May 5, 1907, a committee made up of Eugene Pliskowski, Stanley Hryniewicz, Roman Kulczyk, and Matthew Kodys bought a parcel of land at 358 Pleasant St. After obtaining permission from Thomas D. Beaven, bishop of Springfield, to establish the St. Joseph Parish, the Polish settlers in Gardner welcomed Fr. Julius Rodziewicz as the first pastor.

Founded in 1887, it was the first parish designated for Polish immigrants in New England. In 1998, its parish church was raised to the dignity of a minor basilica by Pope John Paul II.  History  Polish immigrants came to this part of the United States after the country failed to win its independence in the January Uprising of 1863. New immigrants initially attended the Mass at St. Louis Church in Webster, assisted by the Polish clergy of New York. As the number of immigrants continued to increase, with the consent of the Bishop of Springfield, Massachusetts, the new Parish of St. Joseph Parish was established in 1887. The first pastor was a graduate of SS. Cyril and Methodius Seminary in Orchard Lake, Fr. Franciszek Chalupka. Thanks to the generosity and hard work of these first immigrants, Fr. Chalupka was able not only to repay the debt of the parish, but also to acquire land for the construction of a parochial school, which opened in September 1892, administered by the Felician Sisters. Recognizing the need to have a final resting place of the earth, land was purchased in 1903 at Worcester Road for the parish cemetery.  Pastors  * Fr. Franciszek Chałupka (1887-1908) * Fr.

Grzegorz Chodkowski (2019-)  School  St. Joseph School was founded in 1892. The Congregation of the Felician Sisters, whose charism was education, were invited as Polish school personnel. It was their first missionary establishment in New England, where it continues to this day. In the first year, 90 children attended St. Joseph School and their number increased in 1906 to 500, indicating the rapid growth of the parish within a decade. In 1924, fire destroyed a school building, leaving 1100 children without classrooms. Under the leadership of the parish priest, Fr. Anthony Cyran, a new, 20-classroom school was built and opened in 1925. The number of students in the St. Joseph School grew steadily over the decade, reaching its peak of 1105 students and 18 teachers in 1928. But in 1992, at 100th anniversary of the parish, there were only 197 registered children.

Cerium is a soft, ductile and silvery-white metal that tarnishes when exposed to air, and it is soft enough to be cut with a knife. Cerium is the second element in the lanthanide series, and while it often shows the +3 oxidation state characteristic of the series, it also has a stable +4 state that does not oxidize water. It is also considered one of the rare-earth elements. Cerium has no biological role in humans and is not very toxic. Despite always occurring in combination with the other rare-earth elements in minerals such as those of the monazite and bastnäsite groups, cerium is easy to extract from its ores, as it can be distinguished among the lanthanides by its unique ability to be oxidized to the +4 state. It is the most common of the lanthanides, followed by neodymium, lanthanum, and praseodymium. It is the 26th-most abundant element, making up 66 ppm of the Earth's crust, half as much as chlorine and five times as much as lead. Cerium was the first of the lanthanides to be discovered, in Bastnäs, Sweden, by Jöns Jakob Berzelius and Wilhelm Hisinger in 1803, and independently by Martin Heinrich Klaproth in Germany in the same year. In 1839 Carl Gustaf Mosander became the first to isolate the metal. Today, cerium and its compounds have a variety of uses: for example, cerium(IV) oxide is used to polish glass and is an important part of catalytic converters. Cerium metal is used in ferrocerium lighters for its pyrophoric properties. Cerium-doped YAG phosphor is used in conjunction with blue light-emitting diodes to produce white light in most commercial white LED light sources.  Characteristics = Physical  Cerium is the second element of the lanthanide series. In the periodic table, it appears between the lanthanides lanthanum to its left and praseodymium to its right, and above the actinide thorium. It is a ductile metal with a hardness similar to that of silver. Its 58 electrons are arranged in the configuration [Xe]4f15d16s2, of which the four outer electrons are valence electrons. Immediately after lanthanum, the 4f orbitals suddenly contract and are lowered in energy to the point that they participate readily in chemical reactions; however, this effect is not yet strong enough at cerium and thus the 5d subshell is still occupied.Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 1232–5 Most lanthanides can use only three electrons as valence electrons, as afterwards the remaining 4f electrons are too strongly bound: cerium is an exception because of the stability of the empty f-shell in Ce4+ and the fact that it comes very early in the lanthanide series, where the nuclear charge is still low enough until neodymium to allow the removal of the fourth valence electron by chemical means. thumb Four allotropic forms of cerium are known to exist at standard pressure, and are given the common labels of α to δ: * The high-temperature form, δ-cerium, has a bcc (body-centred cubic) crystal structure and exists above 726 °C. * The stable form below 726 °C to approximately room temperature is γ-cerium, with an fcc (face-centred cubic) crystal structure. * The dhcp (double hexagonal close-packed) form β-cerium is the equilibrium structure approximately from room temperature to −150 °C. * The fcc form α-cerium is stable below about −150 °C; it has a density of 8.16 g/cm3. * Other solid phases occurring only at high pressures are shown on the phase diagram. * Both γ and β forms are quite stable at room temperature, although the equilibrium transformation temperature is estimated at around 75 °C. Cerium has a variable electronic structure. The energy of the 4f electron is nearly the same as that of the outer 5d and 6s electrons that are delocalized in the metallic state, and only a small amount of energy is required to change the relative occupancy of these electronic levels. This gives rise to dual valence states. For example, a volume change of about 10% occurs when cerium is subjected to high pressures or low temperatures. It appears that the valence changes from about 3 to 4 when it is cooled or compressed. At lower temperatures the behavior of cerium is complicated by the slow rates of transformation. Transformation temperatures are subject to substantial hysteresis and values quoted here are approximate. Upon cooling below −15 °C, γ-cerium starts to change to β-cerium, but the transformation involves a volume increase and, as more β forms, the internal stresses build up and suppress further transformation. Cooling below approximately −160 °C will start formation of α-cerium but this is only from remaining γ-cerium. β-cerium does not significantly transform to α-cerium except in the presence of stress or deformation. At atmospheric pressure, liquid cerium is more dense than its solid form at the melting point.  Isotopes  Naturally occurring cerium is made up of four isotopes: 136Ce (0.19%), 138Ce (0.25%), 140Ce (88.4%), and 142Ce (11.1%). All four are observationally stable, though the light isotopes 136Ce and 138Ce are theoretically expected to undergo inverse double beta decay to isotopes of barium, and the heaviest isotope 142Ce is expected to undergo double beta decay to 142Nd or alpha decay to 138Ba. Additionally, 140Ce would release energy upon spontaneous fission. None of these decay modes have yet been observed, though the double beta decay of 136Ce, 138Ce, and 142Ce have been experimentally searched for. The current experimental limits for their half- lives are: :136Ce: >3.8×1016 y :138Ce: >5.7×1016 y :142Ce: >5.0×1016 y All other cerium isotopes are synthetic and radioactive. The most stable of them are 144Ce with a half-life of 284.9 days, 139Ce with a half-life of 137.6 days, and 141Ce with a half-life of 32.5 days. All other radioactive cerium isotopes have half-lives under four days, and most of them have half-lives under ten minutes. The isotopes between 140Ce and 144Ce inclusive occur as fission products of uranium. The primary decay mode of the isotopes lighter than 140Ce is inverse beta decay or electron capture to isotopes of lanthanum, while that of the heavier isotopes is beta decay to isotopes of praseodymium. The rarity of the proton-rich 136Ce and 138Ce is explained by the fact that they cannot be made in the most common processes of stellar nucleosynthesis for elements beyond iron, the s-process (slow neutron capture) and the r-process (rapid neutron capture). This is so because they are bypassed by the reaction flow of the s-process, and the r-process nuclides are blocked from decaying to them by more neutron-rich stable nuclides. Such nuclei are called p-nuclei, and their origin is not yet well understood: some speculated mechanisms for their formation include proton capture as well as photodisintegration. 140Ce is the most common isotope of cerium, as it can be produced in both the s- and r-processes, while 142Ce can only be produced in the r-process. Another reason for the abundance of 140Ce is that it is a magic nucleus, having a closed neutron shell (it has 82 neutrons), and hence it has a very low cross section towards further neutron capture. Although its proton number of 58 is not magic, it is granted additional stability, as its eight additional protons past the magic number 50 enter and complete the 1g7/2 proton orbital. The abundances of the cerium isotopes may differ very slightly in natural sources, because 138Ce and 140Ce are the daughters of the long- lived primordial radionuclides 138La and 144Nd, respectively.  Chemistry  Cerium tarnishes in air, forming a spalling oxide layer like iron rust; a centimeter-sized sample of cerium metal corrodes completely in about a year. It burns readily at 150 °C to form the pale-yellow cerium(IV) oxide, also known as ceria: :Ce + O2 → CeO2 This may be reduced to cerium(III) oxide with hydrogen gas. Cerium metal is highly pyrophoric, meaning that when it is ground or scratched, the resulting shavings catch fire. This reactivity conforms to periodic trends, since cerium is one of the first and hence one of the largest (by atomic radius) lanthanides.Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 1235–8 Cerium(IV) oxide has the fluorite structure, similarly to the dioxides of praseodymium and terbium. Many nonstoichiometric chalcogenides are also known, along with the trivalent Ce2Z3 (Z = S, Se, Te). The monochalcogenides CeZ conduct electricity and would better be formulated as Ce3+Z2−e−. While CeZ2 are known, they are polychalcogenides with cerium(III): cerium(IV) chalcogenides remain unknown.Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 1238–9 Cerium(IV) oxide Cerium is a highly electropositive metal and reacts with water. The reaction is slow with cold water but speeds up with increasing temperature, producing cerium(III) hydroxide and hydrogen gas: :2 Ce (s) + 6 H2O (l) → 2 Ce(OH)3 (aq) + 3 H2 (g) Cerium metal reacts with all the halogens to give trihalides: :2 Ce (s) + 3 F2 (g) → 2 CeF3 (s) [white] :2 Ce (s) + 3 Cl2 (g) → 2 CeCl3 (s) [white] :2 Ce (s) + 3 Br2 (g) → 2 CeBr3 (s) [white] :2 Ce (s) + 3 I2 (g) → 2 CeI3 (s) [yellow] Reaction with excess fluorine produces the stable white tetrafluoride CeF4; the other tetrahalides are not known. Of the dihalides, only the bronze diiodide CeI2 is known; like the diiodides of lanthanum, praseodymium, and gadolinium, this is a cerium(III) electride compound.Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 1240–2 True cerium(II) compounds are restricted to a few unusual organocerium complexes. Cerium dissolves readily in dilute sulfuric acid to form solutions containing the colorless Ce3+ ions, which exist as complexes: :2 Ce (s) + 3 H2SO4 (aq) → 2 Ce3+ (aq) + 3 (aq) + 3 H2 (g) The solubility of cerium is much higher in methanesulfonic acid. Cerium(III) and terbium(III) have ultraviolet absorption bands of relatively high intensity compared with the other lanthanides, as their configurations (one electron more than an empty or half-filled f-subshell respectively) make it easier for the extra f electron to undergo f→d transitions instead of the forbidden f→f transitions of the other lanthanides.Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 1242–4 Cerium(III) sulfate is one of the few salts whose solubility in water decreases with rising temperature. Ceric ammonium nitrate Cerium(IV) aqueous solutions may be prepared by reacting cerium(III) solutions with the strong oxidising agents peroxodisulfate or bismuthate. The value of E⦵(Ce4+/Ce3+) varies widely depending on conditions due to the relative ease of complexation and hydrolysis with various anions, though +1.72 V is a usually representative value; that for E⦵(Ce3+/Ce) is −2.34 V. Cerium is the only lanthanide which has important aqueous and coordination chemistry in the +4 oxidation state.Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 1244–8 Due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer, aqueous cerium(IV) ions are orange-yellow. Aqueous cerium(IV) is metastable in water and is a strong oxidising agent that oxidizes hydrochloric acid to give chlorine gas. For example, ceric ammonium nitrate is a common oxidising agent in organic chemistry, releasing organic ligands from metal carbonyls. In the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, cerium oscillates between the +4 and +3 oxidation states to catalyse the reaction. Cerium(IV) salts, especially cerium(IV) sulfate, are often used as standard reagents for volumetric analysis in cerimetric titrations. The nitrate complex is the most common cerium complex encountered when using cerium(IV) is an oxidising agent: it and its cerium(III) analogue have 12-coordinate icosahedral molecular geometry, while has 10-coordinate bicapped dodecadeltahedral molecular geometry. Cerium nitrates also form 4:3 and 1:1 complexes with 18-crown-6 (the ratio referring to that between cerium and the crown ether). Halogen- containing complex ions such as , , and the orange are also known. Organocerium chemistry is similar to that of the other lanthanides, being primarily that of the cyclopentadienyl and cyclooctatetraenyl compounds. The cerium(III) cyclooctatetraenyl compound has the uranocene structure.Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 1248–9  Cerium(IV)  Despite the common name of cerium(IV) compounds, the Japanese spectroscopist Akio Kotani wrote \\"there is no genuine example of cerium(IV)\\". The reason for this can be seen in the structure of ceria itself, which always contains some octahedral vacancies where oxygen atoms would be expected to go and could be better considered a non-stoichiometric compound with chemical formula CeO2−x. Furthermore, each cerium atom in ceria does not lose all four of its valence electrons, but retains a partial hold on the last one, resulting in an oxidation state between +3 and +4. Even supposedly purely tetravalent compounds such as CeRh3, CeCo5, or ceria itself have X-ray photoemission and X-ray absorption spectra more characteristic of intermediate-valence compounds. The 4f electron in cerocene, , is poised ambiguously between being localized and delocalized and this compound is also considered intermediate-valent.  History  Ceres, after which cerium is named Cerium was discovered in Bastnäs in Sweden by Jöns Jakob Berzelius and Wilhelm Hisinger, and independently in Germany by Martin Heinrich Klaproth, both in 1803. Cerium was named by Berzelius after the dwarf planet Ceres, discovered two years earlier. The dwarf planet itself is named after the Roman goddess of agriculture, grain crops, fertility and motherly relationships, Ceres. Cerium was originally isolated in the form of its oxide, which was named ceria, a term that is still used. The metal itself was too electropositive to be isolated by then-current smelting technology, a characteristic of rare-earth metals in general. After the development of electrochemistry by Humphry Davy five years later, the earths soon yielded the metals they contained. Ceria, as isolated in 1803, contained all of the lanthanides present in the cerite ore from Bastnäs, Sweden, and thus only contained about 45% of what is now known to be pure ceria. It was not until Carl Gustaf Mosander succeeded in removing lanthana and \\"didymia\\" in the late 1830s that ceria was obtained pure. Wilhelm Hisinger was a wealthy mine-owner and amateur scientist, and sponsor of Berzelius. He owned and controlled the mine at Bastnäs, and had been trying for years to find out the composition of the abundant heavy gangue rock (the \\"Tungsten of Bastnäs\\", which despite its name contained no tungsten), now known as cerite, that he had in his mine. Mosander and his family lived for many years in the same house as Berzelius, and Mosander was undoubtedly persuaded by Berzelius to investigate ceria further.  Occurrence and production  Cerium is the most abundant of all the lanthanides, making up 66 ppm of the Earth's crust; this value is just behind that of copper (68 ppm), and cerium is even more abundant than common metals such as lead (13 ppm) and tin (2.1 ppm). Thus, despite its position as one of the so-called rare-earth metals, cerium is actually not rare at all.Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1294 Cerium content in the soil varies between 2 and 150 ppm, with an average of 50 ppm; seawater contains 1.5 parts per trillion of cerium. Cerium occurs in various minerals, but the most important commercial sources are the minerals of the monazite and bastnäsite groups, where it makes up about half of the lanthanide content. Monazite-(Ce) is the most common representative of the monazites, with \\"-Ce\\" being the Levinson suffix informing on the dominance of the particular REE element representative. Also the cerium-dominant bastnäsite-(Ce) is the most important of the bastnäsites. Cerium is the easiest lanthanide to extract from its minerals because it is the only one that can reach a stable +4 oxidation state in aqueous solution.Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 1229–1232 Because of the decreased solubility of cerium in the +4 oxidation state, cerium is sometimes depleted from rocks relative to the other rare-earth elements and is incorporated into zircon, since Ce4+ and Zr4+ have the same charge and similar ionic radii. In extreme cases, cerium(IV) can form its own minerals separated from the other rare-earth elements, such as cerianite (correctly named cerianite-(Ce)), .nrmima.nrm.se Crystal structure of bastnäsite-(Ce). Color code: carbon, C, blue-gray; fluorine, F, green; cerium, Ce, white; oxygen, O, red. Bastnäsite, LnIIICO3F, is usually lacking in thorium and the heavy lanthanides beyond samarium and europium, and hence the extraction of cerium from it is quite direct. First, the bastnäsite is purified, using dilute hydrochloric acid to remove calcium carbonate impurities. The ore is then roasted in the air to oxidize it to the lanthanide oxides: while most of the lanthanides will be oxidized to the sesquioxides Ln2O3, cerium will be oxidized to the dioxide CeO2. This is insoluble in water and can be leached out with 0.5 M hydrochloric acid, leaving the other lanthanides behind. The procedure for monazite, , which usually contains all the rare earths, as well as thorium, is more involved. Monazite, because of its magnetic properties, can be separated by repeated electromagnetic separation. After separation, it is treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water-soluble sulfates of rare earths. The acidic filtrates are partially neutralized with sodium hydroxide to pH 3–4. Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that, the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths to their insoluble oxalates. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid, but cerium oxide is insoluble in HNO3 and hence precipitates out. Care must be taken when handling some of the residues as they contain 228Ra, the daughter of 232Th, which is a strong gamma emitter.  Applications  Carl Auer von Welsbach, who discovered many applications of cerium The first use of cerium was in gas mantles, invented by the Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach. In 1885, he had previously experimented with mixtures of magnesium, lanthanum, and yttrium oxides, but these gave green-tinted light and were unsuccessful. Six years later, he discovered that pure thorium oxide produced a much better, though blue, light, and that mixing it with cerium dioxide resulted in a bright white light. Additionally, cerium dioxide also acts as a catalyst for the combustion of thorium oxide. This resulted in great commercial success for von Welsbach and his invention, and created great demand for thorium; its production resulted in a large amount of lanthanides being simultaneously extracted as by-products.Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1228 Applications were soon found for them, especially in the pyrophoric alloy known as \\"mischmetal\\" composed of 50% cerium, 25% lanthanum, and the remainder being the other lanthanides, that is used widely for lighter flints. Usually, iron is also added to form an alloy known as ferrocerium, also invented by von Welsbach.Klaus Reinhardt and Herwig Winkler in \\"Cerium Mischmetal, Cerium Alloys, and Cerium Compounds\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2000, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. Due to the chemical similarities of the lanthanides, chemical separation is not usually required for their applications, such as the mixing of mischmetal into steel to improve its strength and workability, or as catalysts for the cracking of petroleum. This property of cerium saved the life of writer Primo Levi at the Auschwitz concentration camp, when he found a supply of ferrocerium alloy and bartered it for food. Ceria is the most widely used compound of cerium. The main application of ceria is as a polishing compound, for example in chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP). In this application, ceria has replaced other metal oxides for the production of high-quality optical surfaces. Major automotive applications for the lower sesquioxide are as a catalytic converter for the oxidation of CO and NOx emissions in the exhaust gases from motor vehicles,Bleiwas, D.I. (2013). Potential for Recovery of Cerium Contained in Automotive Catalytic Converters. Reston, Va.: U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey. Ceria has also been used as a substitute for its radioactive congener thoria, for example in the manufacture of electrodes used in gas tungsten arc welding, where ceria as an alloying element improves arc stability and ease of starting while decreasing burn-off. Cerium(IV) sulfate is used as an oxidising agent in quantitative analysis. Cerium(IV) in methanesulfonic acid solutions is applied in industrial scale electrosynthesis as a recyclable oxidant. Ceric ammonium nitrate is used as an oxidant in organic chemistry and in etching electronic components, and as a primary standard for quantitative analysis. The photostability of pigments can be enhanced by the addition of cerium. It provides pigments with light fastness and prevents clear polymers from darkening in sunlight. Television glass plates are subject to electron bombardment, which tends to darken them by creation of F-center color centers. This effect is suppressed by addition of cerium oxide. Cerium is also an essential component of phosphors used in TV screens and fluorescent lamps.Cerium dioxide . nanopartikel.info (2011-02-02) Cerium sulfide forms a red pigment that stays stable up to 350 °C. The pigment is a nontoxic alternative to cadmium sulfide pigments. Cerium is used as alloying element in aluminum to create castable eutectic alloys, Al-Ce alloys with 6–16 wt.% Ce, to which Mg and/or Si can be further added; these alloys have excellent high temperature strength.  Biological role and precautions  Cerium has no known biological role in humans, but is not very toxic either; it does not accumulate in the food chain to any appreciable extent. Because it often occurs together with calcium in phosphate minerals, and bones are primarily calcium phosphate, cerium can accumulate in bones in small amounts that are not considered dangerous. Cerium, like the other lanthanides, is known to affect human metabolism, lowering cholesterol levels, blood pressure, appetite, and risk of blood coagulation. Cerium nitrate is an effective topical antimicrobial treatment for third-degree burns, although large doses can lead to cerium poisoning and methemoglobinemia. The early lanthanides act as essential cofactors for the methanol dehydrogenase of the methanotrophic bacterium Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV, for which lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, and neodymium alone are about equally effective. Like all rare- earth metals, cerium is of low to moderate toxicity. A strong reducing agent, it ignites spontaneously in air at 65 to 80 °C. Fumes from cerium fires are toxic. Water should not be used to stop cerium fires, as cerium reacts with water to produce hydrogen gas. Workers exposed to cerium have experienced itching, sensitivity to heat, and skin lesions. Cerium is not toxic when eaten, but animals injected with large doses of cerium have died due to cardiovascular collapse. Cerium is more dangerous to aquatic organisms, on account of being damaging to cell membranes, but this is not an important risk because it is not very soluble in water.

The first parish at the site was established in 1908 for Polish immigrants by Bishop George Albert Guertin. The current parish was founded in 2016 by Bishop Peter Anthony Libasci and dedicated to observing the Tridentine Mass and other liturgical rites in use prior to Vatican II. History=Polish-American parish St. Stanislaus Parish was founded in 1908 as a Catholic parish designated for Polish immigrants. It was one of the Polish-American \\"national parishes\\" in the Diocese of Manchester. Polish immigration to New Hampshire began in the years 1854-1870, and increased from 1870 to 1910. According to a parish history produced in 1958, early Polish immigrants in Nashua worshipped at Immaculate Conception Church, the first parish in the city, a predominantly Irish- American church on Temple Street; it was later renamed St. Casimir Church around 1910. An organization of lay people, named for Polish king Jan III Sobieski, was founded in March 1907, and petitioned Manchester bishop George Albert Guertin for a parish church of their own. Five petitioners created a civil corporation for the purpose of \\"building and maintaining a church of the Roman Catholic denomination\\" under the name \\"Polish Church of St. Stanislaw\\" on September 26, 1907. The request was approved by Bishop Guertin on April 19, 1908, giving the parish the title St. Stanislaus, Bishop and Martyr, in honor of the eleventh-century Stanislaus of Szczepanów. The parish's first pastor, Rev. John Mard, was only able to serve three months due to poor health. His successor, Rev. Francis Taborski, succeeded in raising $5,000 to buy a property on Franklin Street. Construction of the church started in early 1909 and finished before the end of the year. Pews for the church were purchased from a former Free Will Baptist church a few blocks away. During the pastorate of Rev. Louis Wojtys from 1910 to 1915, the church was dedicated, a hall was built to house a parish school and community events, and eight acres of land were bought in 1914 for a cemetery. In 1927, Bishop Guertin entrusted the parish to the Missionaries of La Salette. The new pastor, Fr. Joseph Piszczalka, M.S., who served at St. Stanislaus from 1926 to 1948, set to work renovating the church and rectory: the parish installed electricity in the church and the hall, finished paying its mortgage (1927), and began work on its parish cemetery. A school was begun in 1929. In the parish's 25th anniversary year, 1933, it numbered over 1000 individuals and 190 families. Starting in 1938, a group of Felician Sisters was assigned to the parish to provide religious instruction to the children, and also taught the Polish language. During World War II, almost 200 young people from the parish served in the United States armed forces. Eight died in service, and the parish honored them in 1945 by erecting a chapel and monument in the St. Stanislaus Cemetery. Merger The parish was unified with St. Aloysius of Gonzaga Parish in 2002, and the sacramental records of the Polish-American parish were transferred to St. Aloysius of Gonzaga Parish. After the merger, St. Stanislaus Church remained open as a eucharistic adoration chapel staffed by Missionary Sisters Servants of the Word. A food bank also was established in the church basement. Personal parish for traditional liturgy On May 20, 2016, Most Reverend Peter A. Libasci, the Bishop of Manchester, announced that a new St. Stanislaus Parish would be established at the church, entrusted to the care of the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter and dedicated to the celebration of the Tridentine Mass. Services of the new parish community began in August 2016.

Mobberly Hotel: 1910-1948 During Samuel E. Mobberly's proprietorship the hotel was renovated with a new addition added on the south end referred to as the \\"annex\\". The original dining room that was located on the Mobberly Street side of the hotel was divided up and converted to guest rooms and the banquet room was enlarged and converted to the Mobberly Cafe.Longview News-Journal, Longview, TX, Mobberly Hotel Here Scene Of Many Fashionable Balls, January 1, 1955, Page 150, Annual Edition According to a news report, on April 10, 1910, the hotel was fully booked.The Marshall News Messenger, Marshall, TX, History of the Injunction Suite, April 12, 1910, Page 5 W. K. Eckman of Kelly Plow Company had worked at the Mobberly Hotel 27 years prior as a Hotel Operator. He had a pocket folding ruler that had his name stamped on it which he lost during his employment at the Mobberly. He had assumed it was stolen. Through the years the ruler made its way to an artist in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 1923 the artist mailed a letter to Mr. Eckman, which he replied describing the ruler. The artist made a request that he would return the ruler to its original owner with one request, that Mr. Eckman would will it to him when he died. He agreed and he got his ruler back after almost three decades. The design of the ruler was made of bone, four- folder, with German silver borders.The Longview Daily News, Longview, TX, W. K.

When he was informed the particular room was rented to another guest the gentleman proceeded upstairs to ask the guest to move to a different room. The railroad gentleman had spent his nights in Longview at the Mobberly Hotel in that one certain room.

A resident of the hotel who worked at Good Shepherd Hospital, by the name of Roy Black, discovered someone had entered his room while he was at work. Items that were missing were dress shirts, khaki pants, a can of pennies, a grey bag with a zipper, a couple pairs of slacks, shoes, and a couple of razors. Early the same day, a customer at the Cafe reported his motor boat was stolen off of his truck. This was among a string of robberies that occurred on Mobberly Avenue.Longview Daily News, Longview, TX, Police Hunting Suspects, October 3, 1960, Pg. 6-A In 1964, then owner Patrick Ferchill began a renovation of the Mobberly to restore it to its former grandeur with plans to showcase his antique cars by rotating them out on a weekly basis in the hotel lobby. During the renovation process, on Tuesday, January 12, 1965, brick masons were working in the boiler room which was located in a one-story section of the hotel separate but connected to the three-story section. Some bricks had fell in front of the doorway blocking the entrance so a worker busted out a window using a shovel so they could continue to transport mortar into the boiler room. When the window was shattered, glass was not the only thing that came down. An entire section of about 20' by 40' of the three-story brick facade of the hotel collapsed exposing rooms and furnishings. The roof was sagging significantly over the exposed floors causing fear in workers of possible further collapse.Longview Daily News, Longview, TX, Mobberly Hotel Wall Collapses, Tuesday, January 12, 1965, Page 1-A An eyewitness saw the incident happen firsthand who not only was the hotel manager but also was a resident in the hotel. She woke up about 9 a.m. that morning and happened to look out of her window when the events occurred. According to the news article a maid had just left one of the rooms exposed just prior to the wall collapsing.Longview Daily News, Longview, TX, Mobberly Hotel Wall Collapses, Tuesday, January 12, 1965, Page 1-A The cause of the collapse was determined to be rotten wood headers used over the windows which were common in buildings constructed in the late 1800s and early 1900s. In addition, tie rods were not used to support the brick wall and the bricks used were made of the sandstone type which were extremely soft compared to modern bricks. Water and electrical utilities were cut off shortly after which resulted in the hotel being vacated. Some individuals who lived in the hotel had to move out.Longview Daily News, Longview, TX, Mobberly Hotel Wall Collapses, Tuesday, January 12, 1965, Page 1-A Three days later, on Friday, January 15, 1965, about 7:15 a.m., another large section of the three-story east wall of the Mobberly Hotel's south wing collapsed which left the entire eastern rooms exposed. The debris fell on the roof of the one-story boiler room damaging the roof and causing the boiler room walls to collapse themselves. Unknowingly the two events involving collapsing walls sealed the Mobberly Hotel's fate.Longview Daily News, Longview, TX, Another Large Wall Section of Hotel Falls, Friday, January 15, 1965, Page 1-A During the early morning hours, before sunrise, on Sunday, June 13, 1965, a passerby noticed flames through the hotel windows and contacted the fire department. The fire department arrived, blocking off Mobberly Ave. between Cotton St. and Methvin St. An elderly bystander watching the blaze before sunrise made the comment that every window in the hotel was lit up, which reminded him of the old days when the hotel was in business. Sunday afternoon the fire was out however the remains were still smoldering. All that remained was the first floor dining room section on the northeast end facing Pacific Ave. and half of the two- story addition on the south end of the original hotel building. The rest of the three-story structure was gutted leaving just walls and openings where glass windows use to be, allowing you to see the sky. It was determined the fire was set by a vagrant who had entered the building the night before. It took a crane with a flat steel plate used as a wrecking ball to knock the brick walls down.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The church stands in isolation within Harewood Park, as the surrounding village was relocated by the owner of Harewood House, in about 1760, to a location further from the house. Inside the church is the family vault of the Earls of Harewood and a set of six alabaster monuments, which are \\"the largest collection of alabaster monuments in a parish church within the dates 1419–1510\\". History The present church was built in about 1410 by Elizabeth and Sybil, the daughters of William de Aldburgh of the nearby Harewood Castle, and was originally dedicated to the Holy Cross. It was not the first church on the site. There is a record of a priest here in the 10th century, and some carving from this period has survived.West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service has noted that \\"The church may have Pre-Conquest origins, as a pre-Norman burial and Anglo Saxon cross and stone work have been found here\\". An area to the south of the church where a toilet block was to be developed \\"may be the site of a Medieval Collegiate House. R.V. Taylor in 1875 states that ‘..several old persons who have died in the present century (19th) remembered seeing the old ruins about 50 yards south of the church, where tradition said that officiating priests resided who were masters of the school…’\\", Consultation Response to Planning Application 11/00484/FU, Detached toilet block adjacent to All Saint’s Church, Harewood, accessible at Leeds City Council, Public Access for Planning, accessed 10 May 2020 In 1739 the estate was acquired by the Lascelles family, who in later generations became the Earls of Harewood, and in 1759 they began the building of Harewood House. In the early 1780s the family added battlements and pinnacles to the church. It was restored in 1862–63 by Sir George Gilbert Scott. The restoration included replacement of the ceiling, the pews and the stained glass, and adding a new altar, lectern, pulpit and font. By 1978 the effigies on the alabaster monuments were deteriorating and when the church was taken into the care of the Churches Conservation Trust they were restored and repairs were carried out to the fabric of the church. All Saints was declared redundant on 1 November 1977, and was vested in the Trust on 24 October 1978. Architecture=Structure The church is constructed in millstone grit, quarried locally, and its roofs are in Westmorland slate. Its plan consists of a four-bay nave with north and south aisles and a south porch, a chancel with a north vestry, and a west tower. At the eastern ends of the aisles are chantry chapels, the Gascoigne chapel on the south and the Redman chapel on the north. Its architectural style is Perpendicular. Around the church are diagonal buttresses. The tower is squat, in two stages, and is embraced by the aisles. The west doorway is arched and over it is a five-light window. The upper stage of the tower contains two-light bell openings in each side with a clock on the south face, and the top is embattled. Over the doorway in the porch is a sundial, and the date 1775 is engraved in the apex of its gable. In the aisles are three-light windows, and the east window has five lights. The buttresses at the east end are surmounted by crocketted pinnacles. Fittings and furniture The set of alabaster monuments are described as being \\"the glory of the church\\"; they consist of the effigies of six recumbent couples lying on tomb chests, and all depict members of families connected with the Harewood estate. All the monuments were originally brightly coloured, but the colour has been lost, leaving the white alabaster. On the sides of the tombs are depictions of angels, saints and mourners. The oldest tomb, in the south chapel, is that of Sir William Gascoigne, Lord Chief Justice and his wife Elizabeth; it dates from about 1419. Sir William is dressed in his robes and he carries a purse and a dagger. The later tombs display a greater sophistication in their carving, and they reflect the fashions of the day. The latest effigies are of Edward Redman and his wife, dating from about 1510; the depiction of Edward Redman is said to be a true- to-life portrait, a rarity at the time it was carved. In the chancel is a wall memorial to Sir Thomas Denison who died in 1765. The church contains two fonts; one is Norman and the other dates from the Victorian era. The octagonal pulpit dates from the 19th century and contains marble columns and carved stone panels. The altar rails and gates are a memorial to George V and include the insignia of the Order of the British Empire, Order of the Garter, Order of the Thistle and Order of St Patrick. The latest memorial in the church is on the north wall; it is to the memory of the 6th Earl of Harewood and his wife, Mary, Princess Royal. The stained glass in the west window is from the studio of Charles Eamer Kempe.

Stearns commanded various vessels, on which he set up organized committees for the crew to give suggestions to the officers. He hoped to alleviate tensions between the enlisted men and officers. However, upon his appointment to the battleship , he was removed from command of these activities. Stearns relieved Nathan Woodworth Post as Governor of American Samoa on July 14, 1913, and helped the Samoans achieve more involvement in government. He received a medal from the Japanese Red Cross, as well as the Navy Distinguished Service Medal during his career. He retired at the rank of Captain.Military Times (2009). Life and career Stearns was born in Big Rapids, MeCosta County, Michigan.Genealogy and Memoirs of Isaac Stearns and His Descendants, Avis Stearns van Wagenen, Courier Printing Co., Syracuse, 1901. He graduated from the United States Naval Academy in June 1893.New York Times, June 2, 1893. He died on May 25, 1944 aboard a submarine chaser off Miami, Florida of a coronary thrombosis.Sorensen and Theroux (2007), 126. Naval career In 1918, Stearns was posted to , a civilian ship converted into a minelayer, where he eventually took command. While in command, Stearns allowed the crew to form two organized committees, one for the petty officers, and another composed of one man from each enlisted division.Guttridge (2006), 178. These committees investigated questionable rulings regarding minor disciplinary actions, and to make complaints and suggestions about the \\"health, happiness and comfort of the ship's company.\\" He believed that these committees would lead to less unrest on the ship, as there would be less tension between officers and enlisted sailors, and Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels supported the effort. During his command of Roanoke, Stearns received the Navy Distinguished Service Medal. After leaving command of Roanoke, Stearns examined the Naval Penal System, ruled it \\"archaic\\", and recommended the creation of an Office of Discipline. Stearns commanded the battleship USS Michigan next, but was relieved of his command in 1921 after only 107 days, after allowing his sailors to form the same organized committees as he had on Roanoke. At the advent of the Warren Harding administration, admirals who had opposed Naval Secretary Josephus Daniels' and Assistant Naval Secretary Franklin D. Roosevelt's attempts under the Woodrow administration to \\"democratize\\" the Navy, saw Stearns' actions as a move which could subvert naval authority by implementing organizations similar to labor unions, claiming it resembled a \\"Soviet spirit [which] had crept into the Navy.\\"Guttridge (2006), 179. After petitions from various Admirals of the United States Atlantic Fleet, Secretary of the Navy Edwin Denby stripped Stearns of command, and transferred him to the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility, claiming that allowing sailors to advise officers was against naval tradition and broke down disciplinary authority.The Evening Independent (1921), 18. After the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, Stearns led the emergency relief efforts, and received a medal from the Japanese Red Cross; he sent this medal back to Japan following the Attack on Pearl Harbor.

Lerner, based on effective demand principles and chartalism. It states that government should finance itself to meet explicit goals, such as taming the business cycle, achieving full employment, ensuring growth, and low inflation.  Principles  The principal ideas behind functional finance can be summarized as:Edward J. Nell, Mathew Forstater, Reinventing functional finance: transformational growth and full employment, , Edward Elgar Publishing 2003 *Governments have to intervene in the national and global economy; these economies are not self- regulating. *The principal economic objective of the state should be to ensure a prosperous economy. *Money is a creature of the state; it has to be managed. *Fiscal policy should be directed in light of its impact on the economy, and the budget should be managed accordingly, that is, 'balancing revenue and spending' is not important; prosperity is important. *The amount and pace of government spending should be set in light of the desired level of activity, and taxes should be levied for their economic impact, rather than to raise revenue. *Principles of 'sound finance' apply to individuals. They make sense for individuals, households, businesses, and non-sovereign governments (such as cities and individual US states) but do not apply to the governments of sovereign states, capable of issuing money.  Rules for fiscal policy  Lerner postulated that government's fiscal policy should be governed by three rules: # The government shall maintain a reasonable level of demand at all times. If there is too little spending and, thus, excessive unemployment, the government shall reduce taxes or increase its own spending. If there is too much spending, the government shall prevent inflation by reducing its own expenditures or by increasing taxes. # By borrowing money when it wishes to raise the rate of interest and by lending money or repaying debt when it wishes to lower the rate of interest, the government shall maintain that rate of interest that induces the optimum amount of investment. # If either of the first two rules conflicts with principles of 'sound finance' or of balancing the budget, or of limiting the national debt, so much the worse for these principles. The government press shall print any money that may be needed to carry out rules 1 and 2.  History of use  Lerner's ideas were most heavily in use during the Post-World War II economic expansion, when they became basis for most textbook presentations of Keynesian economics and the basis for policy. Thus when Keynesian policy become under fire in the late 60's and early 70's it was Lerner's idea of functional finance most people were attacking. During the post-war period, U.S. unemployment reached a low of 2.9% in 1953, during the Korean war,http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNU04000000?years_option=all_years&periods;_option=specific_periods&periods;=Annual+Data when the inflation rate averaged at 1.1%.

The Argentine National Symphony Orchestra () is the state symphony orchestra of Argentina, based in Buenos Aires. Overview Established as the State Symphony Orchestra, on November 20, 1948, via a bill (Law 35879) signed by President Juan Perón, the orchestra was created that it could \\"constitute the pitch of universal resonance that our music needs, while providing the most effective means of popular education in the arts.\\" Cultura Sinfónica: Decreto de fundación Philharmonic associations had, by then, a long tradition in Argentina, and could be traced in Buenos Aires to the 1822 formation of the Academy of Music and of the Philharmonic Association, the following year. These orchestras struggled under the instability prevailing during the years of the Argentine Confederation, however, and their performances were only sporadic. The German Argentine community helped advance the medium with the founding a number of choral societies between 1852 and 1863, notably Concordia, Germania and the Deutsche Sing-Akademie, and these were complemented by the Buenos Aires Orchestral Society (1876) and the Musical Mutual Society (1894). The latter ultimately formed the first orchestral guild in Argentina, the Orchestra Professionals' Association (APO), in 1919.Historia Sinfónica The APO Orchestra was constituted as such in 1922, and prospered with its collaboration with the local Wagner Association, reaching its zenith under the baton of Swiss conductor Ernest Ansermet. The great depression later limited its activity sharply, and the orchestra was nearly closed in 1935, highlighting the need for state support. Accordingly, the Buenos Aires Symphony (today the Buenos Aires Philharmonic) was founded in 1947, and in 1948, the State Symphony Orchestra. The symphony was created under the aegis of the Secretariat of Culture, and with 92 musicians. Directed initially by Roberto Kinsky, its first concert took place at the renowned Colón Opera House on November 30, 1949; on that evening's program was Ludwig van Beethoven's Consecration of the House Overture, Johannes Brahms's Symphony No.2, and Igor Stravinsky's Scherzo Fantastico. Its repertoire was soon expanded to include works by classical Argentine composers, as well, notably Carlos Guastavino, Carlos López Buchardo and Alberto Williams. Apart from its performances at the Colón Opera House, the symphony would appear often in the Cervantes and Gran Rex theatres, and it increasingly featured 20th-century classical music, notably Ottorino Respighi's Sinfonia Drammatica and Sergei Prokofiev's Alexander Nevsky; among the well-known guest musicians during the symphony's early years was violinist Henryk Szeryng. A playbill from 1966 The 1955 overthrow of President Juan Perón led to the State Symphony's reorganization as the Argentine National Symphony. Its first post-Perón conductor, former Colón Opera House Director Juan José Castro, had returned from exile and took the baton to acclaim on November 11, leading the symphony in their performance of La Mer, by Claude Debussy. He worked to widen its appeal by incorporating works by contemporary composers such as Olivier Messiaen, Paul Hindemith, Igor Stravinsky and Béla Bartók, and by securing guest conductors such as Willem van Otterloo and Igor Stravinsky, who conducted performances of his own works in 1960. Frustrated by bureaucratic tedium, however, Castro resigned in October. The symphony followed a more traditional line after Víctor Tevah's appointment as chief conductor in 1961, and the contemporary music programs were cancelled. Its itinerary was steeped up, and would include a successful tour of theatres in the Argentine hinterland as well as in Asunción, Paraguay, in 1962. Highlights from this period included guest conductor Paul Klecki's Beethoven concert series and the rise to prominence of pianist Martha Argerich. Ongoing administrative disputes, however, took their toll, and the appointment of Teodoro Fuchs in March 1966 as its first full director since Castro met one the body's chief demands, though budget scarcities led to his resignation later that year. The installation of a dictatorship under General Juan Carlos Onganía led to a marked influence of the Catholic Church over the repertoire, and its new director, Juan Carlos Zorzi, offered up mostly requiems, masses and te deums, as well as frequent collaborations with the Argentine Catholic University's choir. The symphony performed at the reinauguration of the Cervantes Theatre, which had been nearly lost to a 1961 fire, in 1968, though the Onganía regime's continuing hostility to the symphony led to its being stripped of a formal home, and the body performed as a radio orchestra. Losing numerous musicians, Zorzi resigned, and though the 1970 appointment of Spanish conductor Jacques Bodmer as director was followed by a sponsorship from the Italian Embassy, lack of federal support kept the symphony on the brink of closure throughout 1971 and 1972.Cultura Sinfónica: Juan José Castro Clarín: La Sinfónica, en la encrucijada The election of Peronist candidate Héctor Cámpora in 1973 brought with it restored support for the institution, including disbursement for a year's worth of unpaid salaries. A successful Beethoven series at the Luna Park Arena was followed by the 25th anniversary concert, November 29, 1974, memorable for its being held atop the Buenos Aires Sheraton with a televised reprise of Roberto Kinsky's inaugural program. A renewed funding crisis led director Bodmer to return to Barcelona in July 1975, however, and his assistant, Jorge Fontenla, was appointed in his stead. Fontenla's replacement with Bruno D'Astoli in 1978 coincided with the symphony's eclipse by the Buenos Aires Philharmonic, which enjoyed the advantage of a permanent home at the Colón Opera House (while the symphony was relegated to Monday nights at the Cervantes). Its struggles helped result in the 1980 establishment of the Friends of the National Symphony, and though the end of the last dictatorship in 1983 brought with it high hopes, a conflict with the newly appointed general director, Iván Cosentino, resulted in a stoppage during the first half of 1985. Ongoing budgetary problems prompted the new director, Jorge Rotter, to schedule free concerts to the public every other Wednesday as a form of protest during 1987. A renewed crisis in 1990 led to his resignation and the suspension of activities. Lacking a director, the symphony was supervised by the head of SADAIC, José María Castiñeira de Dios, who organized the symphony's first European performance (in Spain), and secured appointment of Simón Blech as director in late 1991. Another figure credited with shepherding the symphony through this difficult era was its former director, Juan Carlos Zorzi, who had served as interim director during the early 1980s and continued to influence the repertoire, including more works by Latin American composers such as Mexican composer Eduardo Diazmuñoz, who led the symphony as guest conductor; Zorzi also took the baton for a tour of Chile in 1992. The appointment of Pedro Ignacio Calderón as chief conductor in 1996 was followed by a number of critics' awards and by the symphony's 50th anniversary celebrations in 1998, for which the body was invited to perform in Los Angeles and Tokyo.Secretariat of Culture Maestro Pedro Ignacio Calderón and the symphony Obtaining their first salary increase in thirteen years in 2006, the National Symphony Orchestra has persisted over often overwhelming odds, not the least of which has been its lack of a permanent home (unofficially located in the Cervantes Theatre). Maintaining a loyal esprit de corps among its musicians, who have on numerous past occasions performed without pay, the symphony has also attracted figures of international stature on the classical music stage, including guest conductors Erich Kleiber, Sir Georg Solti, Ernest Ansermet, Igor Markevitch, Hermann Scherchen, Sergiu Celibidache, Rudolf Kempe, Antal Dorati, Sir Malcolm Sargent, Hans Rosbaud, Jean Fournet, Igor Stravinsky, Heitor Villa-Lobos, Aram Katchaturian, Frank Martin and Pablo Casals, as well as renowned guest soloists such as Arthur Rubinstein, Ruggiero Ricci, Nicanor Zabaleta, Gyorgy Sandor, Martha Argerich, Uto Ughi, and Barry Douglas. Its need for an official home was addressed in 2006 with plans to create a concert hall for the symphony in the Bicentennial Cultural Center. The center's inaugural in the former Buenos Aires Central Post Office, scheduled for the Bicentennial in 2010, Centro Cultural del Bicentenario.

Life He was born in Peterborough and was sometimes called Burgh or Borowe. He became a monk in the abbey there, and was elected its abbot in 1528. He was studied both at Oxford and Cambridge; he took a Cambridge M.A. in 1505, and was B.D. in 1539. In 1530 Chambers as Abbot received Thomas Wolsey, then on his last progress to the Province of York. The cardinal kept Easter at Peterborough with great state, After Wolsey's fall Chambers maintained his position, with only some external modifications, to the end of his life. When Richard Layton, the agent of Henry VIII in the dissolution of the monasteries, accompanied by Richard, the nephew of Thomas Cromwell, was at Ramsey Abbey, and had marked down Peterborough as his next target, Chambers contacted Sir William Parr, hoping by bribery to save his abbey. Chambers discreetly made no further resistance. The abbey was surrendered to the king in 1539, Chambers being appointed guardian of the temporalities, with an annual pension. He became one of the royal chaplains and proceeded to his degree of B.D. at Cambridge the same year (1539). Chambers had support from Lord Russell in the direction of Cromwell. On 4 September 1541 letters patent were issued converting the abbey church of Peterborough into a cathedral church, with a dean and chapter and ecclesiastical staff. King Henry also erected a monument to Catherine of Aragon, who had been buried in the abbey church in January 1536. Chambers now became the first bishop of the new see, with a residence on the site, and the prior of St Andrew's at Northampton became the dean. The new bishop was consecrated in his former abbey church 23 October 1541, by Bishop Thomas Goodrich of Ely, assisted by his suffragan, Robert Blyth, bishop of Dover, and the suffragan of the bishop of Lincoln, Thomas Hallam, titular bishop of Philadelphia. According to Thomas Fuller, Chambers was appointed by the convocation of 1542, in conjunction with John Wakeman of Gloucester, to revise the translation of the Apocalypse for the proposed new edition of the great Bible. He died on 7 February 1556 and was buried in the choir of his cathedral on 6 March. There were formerly two monuments to him, both destroyed during the English Civil War. Chambers has been erroneously identified with John Chambre, a doctor of physic, of Merton College, Oxford, who became dean of St Stephen's, Westminster, and died in 1549.

The images show very good spatial correlation. Conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) or current sensing atomic force microscopy (CS-AFM) is a mode in atomic force microscopy (AFM) that simultaneously measures the topography of a material and the electric current flow at the contact point of the tip with the surface of the sample. The topography is measured by detecting the deflection of the cantilever using an optical system (laser + photodiode), while the current is detected using a current-to-voltage preamplifier. The fact that the CAFM uses two different detection systems (optical for the topography and preamplifier for the current) is a strong advantage compared to scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Basically, in STM the topography picture is constructed based on the current flowing between the tip and the sample (the distance can be calculated depending on the current). Therefore, when a portion of a sample is scanned with an STM, it is not possible to discern if the current fluctuations are related to a change in the topography (due to surface roughness) or to a change in the sample conductivity (due to intrinsic inhomogeneities). The CAFM is usually operated in contact mode; the tip can be kept at one location while the voltage and current signals are applied/read, or it can be moved to scan a specific region of the sample under a constant voltage (and the current is collected). Recently, some manufacturers provide the option of measuring the current in semi-contact mode. The CAFM was first developed by John O'Shea and co-workers at the University of Cambridge in 1993, and it is referred to in the literature by several names, including C-AFM, local-conductivity AFM (LC- AFM), conductive probe AFM (CP-AFM), conductive scanning probe microscopy (C-SPM) or conductive scanning force microscopy (C-SFM), although CAFM is the most widespread.  Working principle  In order to transform an AFM into a CAFM, three elements are required: i) the probe tip must be conductive, ii) a voltage source is needed to apply a potential difference between the tip and the sample holder, and iii) a preamplifier is used to convert the (analogical) current signal into (digital) voltages that can be read by the computer. In CAFM experiments, the sample is usually fixed on the sample holder using a conductive tape or paste, being silver paints the most widespread. A Faraday cage is also convenient to isolate the sample from any external electrical interference. Using this setup, when a potential difference is imposed between tip and sample an electrical field is generated, which results in a net current flowing from tip-to-sample or vice versa. The currents collected by the CAFM obey the relationship: I = J \\\\cdot A_{eff} where I is the total current flowing through the tip/sample nanojunction, J is the current density and Aeff is the effective emission area through which electrons can flow (from now on we will refer to it just as effective area). The most common mistake in CAFM research is to assume that the effective emission area (Aeff) equals the physical contact area (Ac). Strictly, this assumption is erroneous because in many different tip/sample systems the electrical field applied may propagate laterally. For example, when the CAFM tip is placed on a metal the lateral conductivity of the sample is very high, making (in principle) the whole sample surface area electrically connected (Aeff equals the area covered by the metallic film/electrode). Aeff has been defined as:\\"the sum of all those infinitesimal spatial locations on the surface of the sample that are electrically connected to the CAFM tip (the potential difference is negligible). As such, Aeff is a virtual entity that summarizes all electrically relevant effects within the tip/sample contact system into a single value, over which the current density is assumed to be constant.\\" Therefore, when the CAFM tip is placed in contact with a metal (a metallic sample or just a metallic pad on an insulator), the lateral conductivity of the metal is very high, and the CAFM tip can be understood as a current collector (nanosized probestation); on the contrary, if the CAFM tip is placed directly on an insulator, it acts as a nanosized electrode and provides a very high lateral resolution. The value of Aeff when a Pt-Ir coated tip (with a typical radius of 20 nm) is placed on a SiO2 insulating film has been calculated to be typically 50 nm2. The value of Aeff can fluctuate depending on the environmental conditions, and it can range from 1 nm2 in ultra high vacuum (UHV) to 300 nm2 in very humid environments. On well-defined single crystal surfaces under UHV conditions it has even been demonstrated that measurements of the local conductivity with atomic resolution are possible.  Applications  323x323pxCAFM was initially used in the field of nanoelectronics to monitor the electrical properties of thin dielectrics with very high lateral resolution. The first CAFM development in 1993 had the goal of studying the local tunneling currents through 12 nm thick SiO2 films. In 1995 and 1996, O'Shea and Ruskell further improved the lateral resolution of the CAFM technique, achieving values of 10 nm and 8 nm, respectively. This enhanced resolution allowed to observe the first topographic-current correlations, and the inhomogeneity observed in the current maps was associated to the presence of local native defects in the oxide. Following works by Olbrich and Ebersberger reported that, in SiO2 films thinner than 5 nm, the tunneling current increases exponentially with thickness reductions. Consequently, thickness fluctuations of tenths of nanometer in the SiO2 film could create electrically weak spots that reduce the reliability of the whole dielectric film, as the dielectric breakdown (BD) is a stochastic process. The capability of the CAFM for determining the thickness of thin oxides was further demonstrated by Frammelsberger and co-workers who statistically analyzed more than 7200 I-V curves, and reported SiO2 thicknesses with a sensitivity of ±0.3 nm. Other local phenomena like charge trapping, trap assisted tunneling and stress induced leakage current (SILC) can be also easily monitored with CAFM. In general, the CAFM can monitor the effect of any process that introduces local changes in the structure of the dielectric, including thermal annealing, dopping and irradiation, among others. 323x323px Apart from monitoring the electrical properties of a dielectric, the CAFM can be also used to alter its properties by applying an electrical field locally. In particular, the CAFM is especially useful to determine which locations of the samples lead to premature BD, which can provide essential information about the reliability of the samples. The CAFM also helped to confirm the percolation theory of the BD by experimentally proving that this is a very local phenomenon that occurs in small areas typically below 100 nm2. Lateral propagations of the BD event can also be detected by CAFM. The severity of the BD event can also be studied from the dielectric breakdown induced epitaxy, which can be observed from subsequent topographic images collected with the CAFM after the voltage ramp. Similarly, the analysis of the BD recovery (resistive switching, RS) can also be monitored by CAFM. All the capabilities of the CAFM for studying resistive switching in dielectrics have been summarized in the review article of reference. Unlike a normal AFM, the CAFM can be also used to perform local photolithography via bias-assisted local anodic oxidation (LAO). Nowadays the CAFM technique has expanded to many other fields of science, including physics, materials science, chemistry and engineering (among many others), and it has been used to study different materials and/or structures, including nanoparticles, molecules, nanowires, carbon nanotubes, two dimensional (2D) materials, coatings, photoelectricity and piezoelectricity (among others). As of June 14 of 2016, the CAFM had been used in 1325 journal research articles, and it has become a popular tool in nanosciences.  CAFM probes  500x500pxThe main problem of the CAFM is that the probes are more expensive and wear out faster than those used in topographic AFM maps, mainly due to the high current densities flowing through the tip/sample nanojunction, but also due to lateral friction. The premature degradation of a CAFM tip not only increases the cost of the experiments, but also reduces the reliability of the data collected. For this reason, when using CAFM, tip conductivity characterization (using a reference sample) before and after the experiments is highly recommended; only if the CAFM tip holds the same conductivity before and after is the data collected considered reliable. The first types of conductive nanoprobes used in CAFM experiments, which are still widely used nowadays, consist on standard silicon nanoprobes (as those used in topographic AFM measurements) varnished with thin metallic films, including Pt, Au, Ru, Ti and Cr, among others. The varnish should be thick enough to withstand the large current densities and frictions, and at the same time thin enough to not increase significantly the radius of the tip apex, maintaining its sharpness and ensuring a high lateral resolution of the CAFM technique. As mentioned, the lifetime of the metal-varnished tips for CAFM experiments is much shorter than in any other AFM mode, mainly due to metallic varnish melting and loss of tip mass during the scans. To solve this problem, CAFM silicon tips varnished with hard materials like phosphorus-doped diamond have appeared. The main problems of diamond-coapted CAFM tips are: i) they are much more expensive, and ii) they are very stiff and can damage (scratch) the surface of the samples under tests. Another option is to use sharpened metallic wires as the tip, but also the use of hone techniques increases their price (compared to metal-coated Si tips). Furthermore, these tips can also degrade (lose their conductivity) by particle adhesion. A cheap and effective methodology to protect CAFM tips from degrading is to coat them with graphene, which can withstand well the high current densities and mechanical friction. Moreover, graphene is inert and slows down particle adhesion to the tip apex.  The preamplifier  323x323pxThe analogical current signals flowing through the tip/sample nanojunction are sent to the preamplifier, which transforms them into digital voltages that can be read by the data acquisition (DAQ) card of the computer. Many manufacturers integrate the preamplifier in the so-called \\"CAFM application module\\", which is a removable component that can be fixed to the AFM (usually very near to the tip to minimize the electrical noise) to perform conductivity measurements. Similarly, many other modules allow AFMs to perform other operations, like scanning capacitance microscopy (SCM) or scanning spreading resistance microscopy (SSRM). In most CAFM experiments the currents measured typically can range between a few picoamperes and hundreds of microamperes, while the voltages readable by the DAQ card usually range between -3 V to +3V. Therefore, the preamplifier needs to provide a very low noise and a high transimpedance (gain). Figure 2 shows the simplified schematic of a typical low noise preamplifier for CAFM measurements, in which some elements can be distinguished: i) an operational amplifier with high input impedance; ii) a feedback resistor (Rf) and its parasite capacitor (Cs) and Johnson noise (et) associated effects; iii) a noise voltage source associated to the operational amplifier (en); and iv) a capacitance associated to the input interconnections (Ci). A correct selection of the electrical components is essential to achieve good and reliable CAFM data acquisition. For example, the value of Rf is not trivial: a very high value of Rf improves the noise-signal ratio, while reduces the bandwidth of the preamplifier. Therefore, the value of Rf should be chosen to provide enough bandwidth and a noise level below the current values that we want to measure. The parameter en can be easily reduced by using a commercial low noise operational amplifier. The capacitance associated to the connections (Ci) can be easily minimized by placing the preamplifier as near as possible to the conductive tip. The company FEMTO, one of the world leading manufacturers of preamplifiers compatible with CAFMs, can provide devices with electrical noise as low as 3 fA and a gain up to 1013 V/A. Nevertheless, the main limitation of CAFM preamplifiers is their narrow current dynamic range, which usually allows collecting electrical signals only within three or four orders of magnitude (or even less). To solve this problem preamplifiers with an adjustable gain can be used to focus on specific ranges. A more sophisticated solution for this problem is to combine the CAFM with a sourcemeter, semiconductor parameter analyzer or with a logarithmic preamplifier, which can capture the currents flowing through the tip/sample system at any range and with a high resolution.

In 2011 a number of former parish members, known as the Friends of Mater Dolorosa, organized a sit-in, and were taken to court by the diocese in an attempt to order them removed. Reviewing an engineering report provided by the protesters and those by the diocese, a Hampden Superior Court judge ruled \\"based on the evidence before me, I cannot conclude that condition of the steeple presents an emergency such that immediate court intervention is necessary\\". An appeal was subsequently made to the Vatican to re-open the Parish. There was also on-going discussion of designating the area a historical district (Polish American), which would require that the building be maintained. Briefly the diocese struck a deal with the city's Mayor Alex Morse, to purchase the building for $50,000 to be used for a transition program for school children with special needs. The diocese however would maintain ownership of parking as well as the stained glass, paintings, and any regalia in the former sanctuary, stating it was against church law to sell sacred objects, and only allowed use of the church's parking, not being sold, on a case-by-case basis pending approval of the building's use. Citing the month deadline given and an absence of negotiations allowed by the diocese, the city council unanimously rejected the purchase on June 28, 2018. On December 11, 2018, immediately with the issuance of a demolition permit to the Diocese, the parish building was razed; although its stained glass was removed and sold at that time, the ornate painted panelling adorning its halls was not salvaged. Despite previous statements by a diocesan spokesman that it was against \\"universal church law\\" to sell sacred objects to non-church entities when negotiating with the city, on December 21, 2018 the Mater Dolorosa Preservation group reported finding the church's former stained glass for sale in a salvage shop in Minnesota.

Biography Menshutkin was born in a merchant family as the sixth son of Alexander Nikolaevitch Menshutkin. He graduated with honors from gymnasium in December 1857, but only by autumn 1858 managed to enroll to the Saint Petersburg State University, as he was still under the prescribed age of 16. He studied at the faculty of physics and mathematics and was nearly expelled in the autumn of 1861 due to some political disturbances. Nevertheless, by the spring of 1862 he attained the master's degree. During the last years he became interested in chemistry, which he studied under Dmitri Mendeleev. While he acquired a sufficient knowledge of theory he was lacking practice, as at that time the entire laboratory of the university consisted of only two small rooms. Therefore, he went abroad, and in the following three years spent two semesters with Adolph Strecker at the University of Tübingen, a year (1864–5) with Charles-Adolphe Wurtz at the University of Paris, and a semester with Adolph Wilhelm Hermann Kolbe at the University of Marburg. In the meantime, many changes were introduced into the constitution of the Russian universities. In 1863 the universities obtained academic freedom, they chose for themselves the professors, deans, and rectors, at the same time the means of teaching improved, and, owing to Mendeleev’s efforts, the laboratory at St. Petersburg University was enlarged. In 1865 Menshutkin returned to St. Petersburg, just after his PhD thesis was published in the Comptes Rendus of the French Academy under the title “Action du chlorure d’acetyle sur l’acide phosphoreux”. He defended it in March 1866 against Aleksandr Butlerov and Dmitri Mendeleev and in autumn began teaching a course on organic nitrogen compounds. On 6 April 1869, he defended his habilitation on “The Synthesis and Properties of the Ureides” and shortly was appointed as professor of analytical chemistry. In connection with his teaching he proceeded to rearrange the course of instructions and in 1871 brought out his well-known textbook, which survived 16 editions up to 1931 and had been translated into German and English. In 1871, Menshutkin became secretary of the faculty of physics and mathematics and in 1879 was appointed as dean, an office which he held until 1887. The assassination of the Emperor Alexander II in 1881 was followed by the adoption of severe measures, from the effects of which the universities suffered in many ways. The autonomy granted in 1863 was revoked and all officials could only be appointed by the Minister of Public Instruction; the admission of students was hindered by accepting them only from certain schools, the fees were raised and the number of professorships reduced. The discontent by professors and students resulted in disturbances in 1887-8, which were followed by the resignation of the rector and several key officials. As a result, Menshutkin had to add teaching of organic chemistry to his duties. About this time he prepared his large handbook of organic chemistry, which appeared in three successive editions, and in 1888 he published a history of the development of chemical theory. Both books were written in Russian and not translated. One of Menshutkin’s most serious undertakings of the time was the building of the new chemical laboratories of the University. Only by 1890 money could be found for this purpose and in this year Mendeleev resigned his chair, leaving Menshutkin in the position of senior professor of the university. Menshutkin managed to build the laboratories by October 1894 and worked there for eight years. In 1902 Menshutkin was transferred to the new Polytechnic Institute, about 6 km north of St. Petersburg, while retaining the professorship in the university. There he acted as professor of analytical and organic chemistry and dean of the mining division. From the establishment of the Russian Chemical Society in 1868, and until 1891, Menshutkin served as its secretary and became its president in 1906. As deputy of a province he was able to improve popular education and help establishing several new schools. At the end of 1905 he took an active part in the elections for the first Duma, and was one of the founders of the Party of Democratic Reform. Menshutkin had suffered for many years from disorder of the kidneys. He survived an attack at the end of 1906, but then suddenly died in February 1907. Research For his PhD thesis, Menshutkin studied the reactions of phosphonic acid and was able to prove that not all three hydrogen atoms in the molecule are equivalent and therefore the formula HP(O)(OH)2 is more likely than P(OH)3. In 1890 Menshutkin discovered that a tertiary amine can be converted into a quaternary ammonium salt by reaction with an alkyl halide. Menshutkin-reaction Menshutkin further studied the influence of isomerism among alcohols and acids on esterification and showed that, both in respect of rate and limit, the primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols differ from one another, and that unsaturated differ from saturated alcohols. The molecular weight of the alcohol concerned has also a considerable influence on the result, the limit rising generally with molecular weight, although the rate is diminished. The first series of experiments were made with acetic acid and alcohols and were extended to a variety of acids. Subsequently, the rate of chemical change was studied in the case of the formation of amides and anilides by the action of ammonia and aniline on acids by means of the same method as was employed in the esterification experiments. Here again the influence of isomeric differences was equally manifest. These researches led on to others, such as the study of the mutual displacement of bases in homogeneous systems, and the influence of temperature on the rate of several reactions. Menshutkin further studied the effect of different solvents on the reaction rates. Although the solvent is unaltered after the reaction, its influence on the reaction rate was significant. The stabilization of the reactants, products and intermediate phases or transition states depended strongly on the polarity of the solvent, and therefore this polarity had a large influence on the reaction rate. Because of the formation of ionic products, the effect was especially strong in the Menshutkin reaction making it an ideal tool to study the effect of solvent on the reaction rate. The Menshutkin reaction is still used for this purpose. Between 1889 and 1895 Menshutkin focused on amines, on the kinetics of their interaction with alkyl halogen compounds and its dependence on the isomerism. Continuing these investigations down to the end of his life, he succeeded in establishing a large number of other relations between the structure or constitution and chemical activity, as well as physical properties, such as boiling point, melting point and specific gravity. He is regarded as a pioneer in chemical kinetics, not for the priority, but for systematic development of this field.

It is one of the Polish- American Roman Catholic parishes in New England in the Diocese of Springfield in Massachusetts. The parish closed in 2008.  History  In 1912 the Polish people of Pittsfield sent a special three man delegation to Bishop of Springfield, Thomas Bevan. The delegation (Joseph Ziemak, Joseph Zaorski and Stanley Pisiewski) requested for a Polish priest to be sent as a founder of a new Polish parish in Pittsfield. Since the matter was resolved immediately and positively, a few months later Fr. Francis Wheeler, pastor of the Adams, Massachusetts, wrote a letter to the Bishop of Springfield on behalf of the delegation, stressing the need to establish a Polish parish in Pittsfield. In response to the petition and delegates, Bishop Fr. Kolodziej appointed Reverend Boleslaw Bojanowski, a Polish priest, to be pastor of the Polish community in Pittsfield. On January 18, 1913, Rev. Boleslaw Bojanowski arrived in Pittsfield, as the minister of all Poles in the city and its surroundings. Upon him was placed the obligation to organize the life of the Church, in its territory and create a new parish. In a short time arose a new Polish parish under the name of the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary. Since then Poles have had their own devotion led by a Polish priest. Not having its own church, however, able to hear Mass at the St. Charles Church, courtesy of the local priest. Father Bojanowski performed the duties of pastor for three months, in his newly created parish of the Immaculate Conception in the chapel of St. Linden. In 1921, the bishop sent Fr. Joseph Stanczyk as the new pastor. The new pastor inherited a particularly difficult situation. However, after some time, thanks to his goodness and simplicity, Fr. Stanczyk received the full support of his parishioners, who were very willing to work together for the benefit and development of the parish. The present chapel of St. Linden. was insufficient to meet the needs of growing populations and plans to build a new church began. Nearby a disused power generation station for the Pittsfield Electric Street Railway system was for sale. It had been closed on August 11, 1912 after only slightly more than 5-1/2 years of service. The new generation station on East Street made the Seymour Street plant surplus. After consulting with parishioners, Fr. Stanczyk purchased the building on Seymour Street for $8500. Parishioners willingly undertook the soliciting of funds to pay for acquiring the building and the costs of re-construction and renovation into a church edifice. The cost of rebuilding, repair and equipment amounted to approximately $60,000. In 1924, Pittsfield witnessed the consecration of new church, which acquired a new name of the Holy Family Parish. The lower part of the building was converted into a school. Classes began in 1922 and were held three times a week.  Pastors  * Rev. Bolesław Bojanowski (1912-1912) * Rev.

History  According to the record, the first Polish immigrant arrived in the town of Palmer in the year 1886. Through the efforts of Fr. Franciszek Chalupka, the small group of Polish settlers in Three Rivers, Thorndike and Bondsville were organized as the St. Joseph Men's Society of Thorndike in April 1895. In 1899, the St. Joseph's Society chose representatives and the committee visited Bishop Daniel T. Beaven. With the assistance of a lawyer, David Dillon, they finally were granted permission to organize and to establish the Sts. Peter and Paul Parish at Four CornersNamed of four villages: Palmer, Three Rivers, Thorndike and Bondsville in Three Rivers. In July 1902, Beaven appointed Wacław Lenz as the first pastor for Polish descent residing in the towns at Four Corners.

Kappos, 561 U.S. 593 (2010), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States holding that the machine-or-transformation test is not the sole test for determining the patent eligibility of a process, but rather \\"a useful and important clue, an investigative tool, for determining whether some claimed inventions are processes under § 101.\\". In so doing, the Supreme Court affirmed the rejection of an application for a patent on a method of hedging losses in one segment of the energy industry by making investments in other segments of that industry, on the basis that the abstract investment strategy set forth in the application was not patentable subject matter. Majority opinion The Court affirmed the judgment of the Federal Circuit in In re Bilski, the case below. However, it rejected the machine-or- transformation test as a sole test of patentability based on an interpretation of the language of § 101.Bilski, slip op. at 8. The Court rejected the Federal Circuit's statutory interpretation regarding the word \\"process,\\" finding the definition in § 100(b) to be sufficient without turning to the canon of noscitur a sociis.Bilski, slip op. at 7. Section 100(b) defines process as a \\"process, art or method, and includes a new use of a known process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter, or material.\\" The Court looked to Gottschalk v. Benson and Parker v. Flook, and noted that both had explicitly refused to rely on the machine-or-transformation test as the sole test for patent eligibility... The Court also rejected a categorical exclusion of business method patents from eligibility, reasoning that the definition of \\"process\\" in § 100(b) includes the word \\"method,\\" which appears to comprehend some forms of business method patents.Bilski, slip op. at 10. 35 U.S.C. § 273(b)(1) also provides as a defense to patent infringement prior use of a \\"method of conducting or doing business.\\" By acknowledging the defense, the statute also acknowledged the possibility of business method patents.Bilski, slip op. at 11. Regarding Bilski's claimed subject matter, the Court found that his method of optimizing a fixed bill system for energy markets was an unpatentable abstract idea.Bilski, slip op. at 15-16. Despite taking a broader reading of patent eligibility for processes, according to the majority opinion \\"this Court by no means desires to preclude the Federal Circuit’s development of other limiting criteria that further the Patent Act’s purposes and are not inconsistent with its text.\\"Bilski, slip op. at 16. In the plurality sections of Kennedy's opinion, an overall Court minority opinion as not joined by Scalia, he notes that strict adherence to only \\"the machine-or-transformation test would create uncertainty as to the patentability of software, advanced diagnostic medicine techniques, and inventions based on linear programming, data compression, and the manipulation of digital signals\\" but \\"the Court today is not commenting on the patentability of any particular invention, let alone holding that any of the above-mentioned technologies from the Information Age should or should not receive patent protection.\\"Bilski, slip op. at 9-10. Kennedy also suggests that a categorical exclusion of some types of business methods from patent eligibility might be legitimate if that rule was based on the idea that purely abstract ideas are not patentable.Bilski, slip op. at 12. Concurrences The holding of the Court was unanimous, but there were two concurring opinions, and no single opinion commanded a majority of the Court as to all parts. Stevens' concurrence Justice Stevens' concurrence, joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor, argues that the majority interpret the term \\"process\\" too broadly.Bilski, slip op. at 2 (Stevens, J., concurring) Stevens rejected the majority's reliance on the mention of the word \\"method\\" in 35 U.S.C. § 273(b), saying that the statute, originally known as the First Inventors Defense Act of 1999, was only passed by Congress in response to the confusion created by State Street Bank v. Signature Financial Group. 149 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1998). He would categorically exclude business methods from patentability, as they have not traditionally been patentable in the U.S., despite significant innovations in business methods.Bilski, slip op. at 33 (Stevens, J., concurring) It was the final opinion in Stevens' 35-year career on the Supreme Court. His retirement became effective the next day. Breyer's concurrence Justice Breyer's concurrence began by agreeing with Justice Stevens \\"that a 'general method of engaging in business transactions' is not a patentable 'process'...\\" In a second part, joined by Justice Scalia, Breyer highlighted four points which he felt were consistent with both the opinion of the Court and Justice Stevens' concurring opinion:Bilski, slip op. at 1 (Breyer, J., concurring). #that although the law's description of what is patentable in §101 \\"is broad, it is not without limit.\\" #the Court has repeatedly stated that \\"transformation and reduction of an article to a different state or thing is the clue to the patentability of a process claim that does not include particular machines.\\" #\\"while the machine-or-transformation test has always been a 'useful and important clue,' it has never been the 'sole test' for determining patentability.\\" #\\"although the machine-or-transformation test is not the only test for patentability, this by no means indicates that anything which produces a 'useful, concrete, and tangible result,' [as held in State Street Bank v. Signature Financial Group] is patentable.\\" Part II sums up by stating \\"it is my view that, in reemphasizing that the 'machine-or-transformation' test is not necessarily the sole test of patentability, the Court intends neither to de-emphasize the test’s usefulness nor to suggest that many patentable processes lie beyond its reach.\\" Impact The Court's opinion in this case is seen as moderating the machine-or-transformation test requirement instated by the Federal Circuit in In re Bilski, while also leaving little guidance as to what should be considered patentable under § 101. \\"[T]he outcome from the decision might be best stated as 'business as usual.' \\" In light of the decision in Bilski v. Kappos, the Supreme Court granted judicial review, vacated the decisions of the Federal Circuit, and remanded to the Federal Circuit for reconsideration the cases of Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc.. and Classen Immunotherapies, Inc. v. Biogen Idec.Supreme Court Orders. Tuesday June 29, 2010. The two claims related to medical diagnostics, and the claims in Prometheus were found patentable under the machine-or-transformation test while the claims in Classen were not. In December 2010, the Federal Circuit applied the broad eligibility of Bilski in Research Corp. Technologies v. Microsoft Corp., which upheld the patent eligibility of a process for digital image halftoning. Patent Examiners and Practitioners were given interim instructions on the interpretation of Bilski v. Kappos both during the appeal process (on August 29, 2009) and shortly after the decision (on July 27, 2010) in documents issued by the USPTO.Interim Guidance for Determining Subject Matter Eligibility for Process Claims in View of Bilski v. Kappos Inventors' comments In response to the decision, the inventors, Bernard Bilski and Rand Warsaw made the following comments: * Bernard Bilski – \\"We are personally disappointed that the Supreme Court ruled against our claims. However, we are very pleased that the Court maintained the patentability of business methods and other new areas of development.\\" * Rand Warsaw – \\"We are happy that the Court agreed with our arguments that the machine-or-transformation test is too narrow, but it would also have been nice to receive a patent after more than 10 years.\\" See also * In re Bilski * Stanford v.

The forces under Goiti were victorious and as a result, Manila became the capital of the Spanish East Indies.  Events  A modern- day satellite image of Manila Bay, showing the locations of Cavite and the Pasig River delta, including Intramuros, the site of what used to be the Rajahnate of Maynila. By the late 1560s, Miguel López de Legazpi who had left Mexico with a retinue of Spanish and Mexican soldiers, was already searching for a more suitable place to establish the Spanish colonial capital, having found first Cebu and then Iloilo undesirable because of insufficient food supplies and attacks by Portuguese pirates. He was in Cebu when he first heard about a well-supplied, fortified settlement to the north, and sent messages of friendship to its ruler, Rajah Matanda, whom he addressed as \\"King of Luzon.\\" In 1570, Legazpi put Martin de Goiti in command of an expedition north to Manila and tasked him with negotiating the establishment of a Spanish fort there. De Goiti arrived in May 1570, anchored at Cavite on the mouth of Manila Bay. He was initially well received by Maynila's ruler Rajah Matanda, who, as former commander of the naval forces of the Sultanate of Brunei, had already had dealings with the Magellan expedition in late 1521. Negotiations broke down, however, when another ruler, Rajah Sulayman, arrived and began treating the Spanish belligerently, saying that the Tagalog people would not surrender their freedoms as easily as the \\"painted\\" Visayans did.Filipiniana: Act of Taking Possession of Luzon by Martin de Goiti. Accessed September 06, 2008. The accounts of the De Goiti mission report that Tondo's ruler, Lakandula, sought to participate in these negotiations early on, but De Goiti intentionally ignored Lakandula because he wanted to focus on Maynila, which Legaspi wanted to use as a headquarters because it was already fortified, whereas Tondo was not. By May 24, negotiations had broken down, and according to the Spanish accounts, their ships fired their cannon as a signal for the expedition boats to return. Whether or not this claim was true, the rulers of Maynila perceived this to be an attack and as a result, Sulayman ordered an attack on the Spanish forces still within the city. The battle was very brief because it concluded with the settlement of Maynila being set ablaze. The Spanish accounts claim that De Goiti ordered his men to set the fire, historians today still debate whether this was true. Some historians believe it is more likely that the Maynila forces themselves set fire to their settlement, because scorched earth retreats were a common military tactic among the peoples of the Philippine archipelago at the time. De Goiti proclaimed victory, symbolically claimed Maynila on behalf of Spain, then quickly returned to Legaspi because he knew that his naval forces were outnumbered. Contemporary writers believe the survivors of Maynila's forces would have fled across the river to Tondo and other neighboring towns. Aftermath In 1571, the Spaniards returned with their entire force consisting of 280 Spaniards and Mexicans and 600 native allies from Panay, this time led by Legazpi himself. They successfully occupied Maynila by crushing the resistance posed by tens of thousands of native Muslim militia, and established a settlement there. On May 19, 1571, Legaspi gave the title city to the colony of Manila. A Kapampangan leader of the Macabebe tribe, later identified as Tarik Sulayman (from Arabic طارق سليمان Tāriq Sulaiman), refused to submit to the Spaniards and, after failing to gain the support of the kings of Manila (Lakandula, Matanda) and Hagonoy, Bulacan, gathered a formidable force composed of Kapampangan warriors. He subsequent fought and lost the Battle of Bangkusay Channel. The Spanish solidified their control over Manila and Legazpi was able to establish a municipal government for Manila on June 24, 1571, which eventually became the capital of the entire Spanish East Indies colony and subsequently the capital of the Philippines. The initial population of the city was around 250. ReferencesSources *Relation of the Voyage in Luzon sa Blair & Robertson.

It is the third arm of the police force alongside the state police and the riot police (Bereitschaftspolizei) It existed from 1946 (independently from 1952) to 1998 and was responsible for the federal borders in Bavaria. It was re-established as an independent arm in 2018.  History  In 1945 the Bavarian Border Police - then known as the Bavarian State Border Police (Bayerische Landesgrenzpolizei) - was reformed. The latter had existed from 1919 to 1934 in the shape of a Bavarian Border Police Commissariat on the borders between Lindau on Lake Constance and Eger. Its reformation was authorised by VA No. 72 on 15 November 1945 which established a Bavarian State Border Police force, the order taking effect from 1 March 1946. The first units were deployed by the American occupation powers as \\"Border Police\\". On 15 March 1947 the overall responsibility for border control and implementation of Military Government Law No. 161 was transferred to the Bavarian Border Police. However the border police continued to receive their orders from the Military Government. The responsibility for checking members of the allied military forces and their dependents was exclusively carried out by American military personnel. On 28 October 1952 the Bavarian Police Organisation law was passed. Articles 34 to 41 of this law governed the border police and their mission which was \\"The supervision and policing of the state borders, especially supervision of border traffic and carrying out the dispatch and reception of people, including the supervision of passengers at airports\\". Their departments were given descriptions that corresponded to those of the state police. The last agreement over responsibilities vis-à-vis the Bundesgrenzschutz was spelt out by an administrative agreement dated 16 July 1975 between the Interior Ministry and the Bavarian State Government which dealt with the exercise of tasks by the border police arm of the police service in Bavaria. The only other German state that had its own border police in the post-war era was Hesse, whose border force was operational on the Russian, British and French zones from 1945 until 1 October 1950, when it was officially absorbed into the state police. Events in the late 1980s signalled the end of the Bavarian Border Police. Austria's entry into the EU on 1 January 1995 and on 28 April 1995 to the Schengen Treaty fundamentally changed the situation on the Bavarian-Austrian border. From 1 January 1997 border controls on traffic from Austria were lifted in stages.  1998 Disbandment  With the incorporation of the Bavarian Border Police into the Bavarian State Police their history came to an end on 31 March 1998. They were replaced by police departments that almost exclusively deal with cross-border traffic. These include: the Missing Persons Police Department (Polizeiinspektion Fahndung or PIF) with border police stations (GPS) and the Search and Inspection Force (Fahndungs- und Kontrolltrupp or FKT). FKT officials are civilian and also work outside Bavaria in areas near the border. The border officers (Grenzbeauftragter) are the only vestige of the old border police that remains.  Re-establishment in 2018 Due to the European migrant crisis in 2015 and the establishment of border controls on the Austrian border, the state border police was re-established in 2018.http://www.bayern.de/bericht- aus-der-kabinettssitzung- vom-23-maerz-2018/https://www.pnp.de/lokales/stadt_und_landkreis_passau/passau_stadt/2994832_Festakt- Bayerische-Grenzpolizei-nimmt-heute-ihre-Arbeit-auf.html The police force's headquarters are in Passau.

Founded on April 8, 1927, it is in the Archdiocese of Hartford and is one of dozens of Polish-American Roman Catholic parishes in New England.  History  Membership in New Britain's original Polish national parish, Sacred Heart, had risen to about 9000 when a movement for a second parish was sponsored by the Holy Trinity Society, founded on April 8, 1927. On November 3, 1927, Bishop John Joseph Nilan authorized Fr. Stephen Bartowski to organize what became Holy Cross Parish. The first Mass was offered on November 13 at a local hall. Fr. Bartkowski broke ground for a new church on Farmington Ave. on December 29, 1927. A year later, Fr. Bartkowski offered the first Mass in the new wooden church, which was dedicated on July 11, 1927 by Auxiliary Bishop Maurice F. McAuliffe. So many Poles soon crossed over from Sacred Heart that Bishop John Joseph Nilan recognized Holy Cross Parish as a national instead of a territorial parish, as originally planned. The 1936 neo-Gothic church was designed by architect Anthony J. DePace of New York. Pipe organ The church includes a Casavant Frères Pipe Organ (Opus 3650, 1988), situated at the back of the gallery under a large west-end rose window. The placement on the central axis allows an organ of modest proportions to fill a large building. Considerable tonal variety is available on the three manual divisions and pedal and includes appropriate divisional choruses that are balanced individually and are structured to work together in the ensemble of the instrument as a whole. The Trompette-en-Chamade is effective not only as the crowning glory for the ensemble but also in solo and dialogue roles. While this instrument speaks with a decidedly French accent, it has proven extremely effective in presenting the music of Bach and his contemporaries and in accompanying the singing of the congregation and choirs of the parish. Saint John Paul II School In the year 1928, a new Polish parish was established on Farmington Avenue in the City of New Britain, Connecticut under the leadership of Rev. Stefan Bartkowski. The Most Rev. Maurice F. McAuliffe, Bishop of Hartford, dedicated Holy Cross Church on July 1, 1928. That same year, eight Sisters of St. Joseph, Third Order of St. Francis were asked to teach the Polish language and religion to the children of the newly founded parish after school hours. In the first two years 600 pupils enrolled. The efforts of the Sisters and the support of the Pastor laid the foundation for the present day parish school. The school was closed in 2015.

It is one of the Polish-American Roman Catholic parishes in New England in the Archdiocese of Hartford.  History  The parish had its beginnings in 1896 when the Polish immigrants from the city of New Haven came together to form the St. Stanislaus Society. This society became the nucleus for the future St. Stanislaus Parish. Initially the group gathered for Mass at a German Catholic Church in New Haven but in 1900, they began to make plans for a location of their own. A delegation from the St. Stanislaus Society petitioned Most Reverend Michael Tierney of the Hartford Diocese for permission to organize a parish. Bishop Tierney agreed and appointed Reverent Stanislaus Musiel to be pastor of the rising parish. Father Musiel celebrated the first Mass for the newly founded parish in a German hall on Wooster Street. A year later, in 1901, the pastor purchased a home and grocery store on Dwight Street and had it converted to a chapel. In 1903, the Bishop entrusted the new parish to the Polish Vincentian Fathers and Reverend George Glogowski, CM, became the pastor. The Vincentians began their stewardship of the parish by offering a popular mission. The mission was a great spiritual experience for those who attended. The mission also revealed that the number of Polish immigrants in New Haven was far greater than expected. Their original chapel on Dwight Street would not be adequate to accommodate the numbers. The pastor, Father Glogowski, bought an old Swedish church with two houses on St. John Street. The church was large enough to accommodate the growing numbers of parishioners but it also supplied a rectory for the priests. The church was renovated and a steeple was added. Most Reverend Michael Tierney, Bishop of Hartford, dedicated the church on Decoration Day in 1905 and placed it under the patronage of St. Stanislaus. In 1907 Reverend Anthony Mazurkiewicz, CM, became pastor. During his years as pastor, Father Mazurkiewicz eliminated the parish debt and opened a parochial school for the parish children in the basement of the Church. The parish continued to grow rapidly and by 1910 it was evident that they had outgrown both the church and the parish school. Father Mazurkiewicz began to look for a property that would be more centrally located in the city of New Haven. He found an abandoned church on the corner of State and Eld Streets, the present location of St. Stanislaus Parish. By 1911, the property was cleared and the foundation for the present church was laid. On Decoration Day in 1912, Most Reverent John Joseph Nilan, Bishop of Hartford, blessed the cornerstone of the new church, designed in the Polish Cathedral style. Just a year later, on April 27, 1913, the first Mass was said in the new church. A solemn Mass of dedication was celebrated by Bishop Nilan on May 30, 1913. The parochial school was moved to the basement of the church where it remained for the next nine years. The parish also quickly acquired the adjacent lots and properties. In 1921, the parish demolished three houses on State Street in order to build a new school. It was completed in 1929. The interior of the church has changed over the years. In 1925, the pastor, Reverend Joseph Janowski, CM, commissioned artist P. Mazur to paint the many frescoes on the interior of the church. Stained glass windows from Aachen, Germany were installed in 1926. In 1942 the pastor, Reverend Karol Pacherski, CM, commissioned Vincent Murdo of New Haven to beautify the interior of the church. “The Christianization of Poland in the 10th Century,” was chosen as the theme. The renovations were completed in 1943. A blessing for the redecorated church was held on October 11, 1943. In 1972, the original organ was rebuilt. After the Second Vatican Council, a new altar was installed. The rendition of the Last Supper was moved from the high altar to the front of the new altar. The last major renovation in the church took place in anticipation of the 100 year anniversary of the parish by then pastor, Reverend Waclaw Hlond, CM. On April 25, 1979, the New Haven Preservation Trust proclaimed the church building noteworthy for its distinguished interior. In September 2009, a regularly scheduled traditional Latin mass hosted by the St. Gregory Society of New Haven was commenced. The Mass is celebrated every Sunday at 2:00 pm.

Biography Funtikov was a locomotive engineer and a member of the Socialist Revolutionary Party since 1905. On July 11-12, 1918 he became one of the leaders of the anti-Bolshevik uprising of workers in Ashgabat. On July 12, he was elected the head of the Transcaspian Government by the Ashgabat strike committee, composed mainly of workers, Socialist- Revolutionaries and Mensheviks. According to historians Michel Heller and Alexander Nekrich, this was the only truly working class government in Russia. Isaak Brodsky's The Execution of the 26 Baku Commissars, depicting the Soviet view of the execution. After the defeat of the rebels near Chardzhou on July 28, 1918, Funtikov turned for help to the head of the British military mission in Mashhad (northeastern Iran), General Wilfred Malleson, with whom a formal agreement was signed on August 19, 1918. Malleson sent 2,000 Indian sepoys led by Colonel Nollis, who took command of the combined forces. As a result, the Funtikov government fell into a certain dependence on the British, which subsequently gave Soviet historiography reason to consider it as a \\"puppet\\". On September 19, 1918, Funtikov participated in a meeting in Krasnovodsk, where it was decided to shoot the so-called Baku Commissars. On January 2, 1919, after the unrest of workers in Ashgabat, the Provisional Government was ousted and replaced by a “Committee of Public Salvation” of five persons who Funtikov was arrested on January 15, 1919 on charges of corruption. On March 2, 1919, Funtikov testified to the former member of the SR Central Committee, Vadim Chaikin, who, on behalf of the Central Committee, conducted an investigation into the participation of party members in the murder of commissars. He said of his role in the execution: \\"I was aware of this upcoming case, but did not consider it possible to prevent it ... the execution was previously decided at the insistence of the English mission.\\" Soon after, Funtikov was released and left for Russia as a private individual. Funtikov hid on his farm near Tsaritsyn until he was betrayed to the Cheka by his daughter. He was then put on trial in Baku on 26 April 1926. The trial was well publicised. Funtikov was described by N. Smirnov as \\"a man of medium height, dressed in a worn chuiku and boots, with a thick beard on a slightly elongated face.\\" Mir Bashir Gasimov attended the trial. He was charged with rebellion against the Soviet regime, relations with foreign states and the organization of terrorist acts Light. 1926. No. 20 (164).. The court hearings were held in the hall, which accommodated one and a half thousand people, and, in addition, powerful loudspeakers were installed on one of the squares in Baku. He pleaded guilty to counter-revolutionary activity and organising an uprising to seize power in the Transcaspian region. He admitted linking up with the British command and in the shooting of 9 Ashgabat commissars. However he denied any involvement in the execution of the Baku commissars. The central newspapers “Pravda” and “Izvestia”, as well as “Dawn of the East” and “Baku Worker” regularly and fully covered the process . On April 27, 1926 he was found guilty and sentenced to death.

It is one of the Polish-American Roman Catholic parishes in New England in the Archdiocese of Hartford. In 2017, the parishes of Immaculate Conception, Saint Casimir, and Saint Thomas were merged by decree into the Parish of Saint Maximilian Kolbe. Since that time, these three churches have worked together to build a strong parish of believers in Jesus Christ while respecting the unique identity, rituals, traditions, and roots of each parish.  History  The journey of Saint Casimir Church began in the early 1890s when the number of Polish immigrants in Terryville sharply increased. At first, they worshipped at Immaculate Conception. However, like other nationalities, these early Polish Catholics yearned for a church with a priest to administer to their needs in their native language. In December 1900, a Polish fraternal organization, the St. Casimir Society, was formed and became the major force in pursuit of a Polish parish in Terryville. After the establishment of by-laws and a resolution to form their own parish, the St. Casimir Society immediately organized a monthly, door-to-door fund drive to raise money to build a church. Within a year, enough money was collected to purchase land. Despite the ongoing fund drives and the purchase of land, local and diocesan opposition seemed insurmountable, but this did not deter these early parishioners from pursuing their dream for a Polish parish. In January 1905, a meeting was held with the Apostolic Delegate in Washington, D.C. and, as a result, in March 1906, Father Joseph Raniszewski was appointed pastor of Saint Casimir Parish. During his first months in Terryville, Father Raniszewski held Sunday Mass at the Immaculate Conception Church and, then, at rented halls, including the original Lyceum Building. However, since the construction of the church and rectory was started simultaneously upon the new pastor's arrival, the rectory was completed first and was used for daily masses. As of May 1906, the cornerstone of the church was laid in place and, on Labor Day of that same year, Bishop Tierney consecrated St. Casimir Church.  Pastors  * Rev.

YourBittorrent uses automated software to search the Internet for host file information and does not actively oversee what is indexed in its database. With a lack of oversight, the site hosts some torrents which allow users to access software, movies, music and other items under which are under copyright and thus illegal to distribute publicly, though the files themselves remain on other servers. Illegal trackers are removed by the site when a request is made by a legitimate party. Kidnap myBittorrent (Currently known as YourBittorrent) was the first BitTorrent site that has ever been \\"kidnapped\\" by its registrar. The website went down on 10 January 2006 for alleged violation of the registrar's abuse policy. myBittorrent was given two options in an email sent by GoDaddy, neither of which included an appeal process. The myBittorrent administration sent several emails trying to resolve the issue, but GoDaddy refused to respond until the myBittorrent administration told GoDaddy that they were going to take legal measures.

Transition to yourBittorrent On 22 March 2009, the owners of myBittorrent had a disagreement over the website's future. The ongoing juridical procedures against other torrent sites, like The Pirate Bay made one of the owners want to downsize the website and over time stop running it. On the other side, the other co-owner wanted it to become bigger and possibly merge with other torrent sites. They decided that they would each go their own way. One owner would keep myBittorrent.com and after a transition period close it down, while the other owner would move all the torrents to yourBittorrent.com. Between March 2009 and July 2009 the owners of myBittorrent held a transition period.

Previously known as the Kill Rock Stars recording artist The Robot Ate Me, has been labeled by Daytrotter as \\"One of the most creative and potentially scary minds of our generation\\" and by Spin Magazine as \\"purely artistic, baffling, and almost completely uncommercial\\". Biography Bouchard was born on October 16, 1979, in Los Angeles, California.http://www.rylandbouchard.com/ The Robot Ate Me In 2002 he released They Ate Themselves, his first record as The Robot Ate Me and played his first shows in San Diego opening for notable touring acts such as Daniel Johnston, Tegan and Sara, Metric, Stars and The Blackheart Procession. Skyscraper magazine described his first release as \\"Quite possibly the year's most arresting experimental pop record, They Ate Themselves is a dizzyingly vibrant trip through death and multi-layered dissonance\\". The controversial and highly experimental On Vacation was released in 2004 in which Adam Gnade declared \\"It's not even music outside the margins. Here the margins were never there, and if they were to encroach, The Robot Ate Me would probably up and croak.\\" Punk Planet followed suit describing the album as \\"A hypnotic two-disc record that will score your twisted nightmares and fanciful dreams.\\" Splendid summarized \\"It is impossible to understand a Robot Ate Me album from a written description.\\" After the release of On Vacation in 2004 he signed with Kill Rock Stars and toured the US heavily the next few years playing close to 600 shows in the following three years. His shows relied heavily on audience participation and were known for being fairly unpredictable. As part of his shows he would sometimes be dragged across the floor by attendees, wear masks, scream loudly, have the audience play the supporting instruments for his songs without rehearsal, or abruptly leave after playing one song. The 2005 release of Carousel Waltz brought a set of minimal American folk songs. The album was lauded by Babysue as a \\"strangely compelling and uplifting vision of how love affects a person. Soft and focused, these unusual tunes are simultaneously accessible and peculiar. The Robot Ate Me remains one of the most unique acts on the planet. Brimming with credible substance, Carousel Waltz is yet another killer album from an artist who just keeps getting better and better with time...\\" 2006 brought the avant-garde Good World, which consisted mostly of sparse clarinet lines mixed with minimal percussion and falsetto vocals by Bouchard. Pitchforkmedia asked \\"Has someone bludgeoned frontman Ryland Bouchard?\\". And Tinymixtapes declared: \\"Not since the glory days of punk has an album come and gone so fast and left one with more questions than answers.\\" Solo work In 2008 Bouchard released Seeds a hand-crafted limited edition box set with close to two hours of music (divided between an A-Sides CD/vinyl and a B-Sides CD), a DVD of super 8 videos, four 7\\" vinyl records, letter- pressed lyrics, a hand silk-screened shirt, bag, poster, and a set of illustrations by his longtime collaborator Daniel Gibson. Only 500 copies of the set were made. In early 2009, Bouchard completed a Take-Away Show video session for La Blogothèque where he performed songs from Seeds. The 2009 double vinyl release Cowbirds and Cuckoos was released on November 15, 2009, by Swim Slowly Records. The release consists of two hand screen-printed records and photography by Ryland Bouchard. In February 2010 Swim Slowly Records released a digital EP \\"Better This Than Nothing\\", a collection of B-Sides from \\"Cowbirds and Cuckoos\\". Super 8 Super 8 still from 'Tongues'. Released in 2008 as part of the \\"SEEDS\\" box set on Swim Slowly Records.With the release of \\"Seeds\\" in 2008 Bouchard also included a DVD worth of videos shot exclusively on Super 8 film. In 2009 he also released a series of Super 8 videos for the \\"Cowbirds and Cuckoos\\" release on YouTube. Using mostly a Braun Nizo S580 and Kodak Ektachrome 64T film the videos include footage from various locations throughout Europe, Mexico and the United States. Completed without digital effects the films rely heavily on time lapse, slow motion and other experimental filmmaking techniques.

E is the value the citizen gets from exiting, L is the value the Government gets from the Citizen's loyalty, and c is the cost the Citizen using their voice. In this model, the benefit up for grabs between the Citizen and the Government is worth 1.The Exit, Voice, Loyalty (EVL) Model or Exit, Voice, Loyalty, Neglect (EVLN) is used in the fields of comparative politics and organizational behavior. It is an extensive form game used to model interactions typically involving negative changes to one player's environment by another player. These concepts first appeared in Albert Hirschman's more broadly focused 1970 book, Exit, Voice, and Loyalty: Responses to Decline in Firms, Organizations, and States. A common use in political science is between citizens and their government. Usually in this use the Citizen player is any group within a society ranging from a single individual to the citizenry as a whole.  Model  The EVL Model involves two agents and their responses to a change initiated before the game began. The first agent is commonly referred to as the Citizen and the second is commonly referred to as the Government. EVL assumes that the change implemented before the game began was performed by the Government and negatively harms the Citizen.  Formal Definition  The formal definition of EVL is the following: \\\\mathrm{Players: } N = {Citizen, Government} \\\\mathrm{Player\\\\ Function:}\\\\ P(0) = Citizen,\\\\ P(Voice) = Government,\\\\ P(Voice,Ignore) = Citizen \\\\mathrm{Terminal\\\\ Histories: }\\\\ (Exit),\\\\ (Loyalty), \\\\ (Voice, Respond), \\\\ (Voice, Ignore, Loyalty), \\\\ (Voice, Ignore, Exit) \\\\mathrm{Preferences \\\\ and \\\\ Payoff \\\\ Functions:} \\\\ u_{Citizen}(Exit) = E, \\\\ u_{Citizen}(Loyalty)=0, \\\\ u_{Citizen}(Voice,Respond)=1-c, \\\\ u_{Citizen}(Voice,Ignore,Exit)=E-c, \\\\ u_{Citizen}(Voice,Ignore,Loyalty)=0-c \\\\ u_{Government}(Exit) = 1, \\\\ u_{Government}(Loyalty)=1+L, \\\\ u_{Government}(Voice,Respond)=L, \\\\ u_{Government}(Voice,Ignore,Exit)=1, \\\\ u_{Government}(Voice,Ignore,Loyalty)=1+L  Theoretical Definition  The precursory policy that the Government has implemented has the effect of removing a benefit with the value of 1 from the Citizen and giving it to the Government. The value was chosen to be 1 so that all comparisons within the game can easily be converted to ratios and then adapted to other situations where the true value of the benefit is known. In EVL, all possible actions that can be taken by the Citizen are grouped into one of three options. Exit options are those in which the Citizen accepts the loss of the benefit and instead alters their behavior to get the best possible alternative. Examples could include relocating assets to avoid a new tax, reincorporating a business to avoid new regulations, buying goods from a different store when the quality of the original diminishes, voting out the incumbent, etc. The payoff of an Exit option for the Citizen is the variable E and the Government gets to keep the 1 it took initially. Loyalty options are ones where the Citizen chooses to put up with the new policy and not alter their behavior. The payoff for the Citizen is 0 as they decide to take the loss and the Government receives the 1 it took plus the value of the Citizen's Loyalty. The value of the Citizen's Loyalty is the variable L. Voice options are where the Citizen makes an active effort to show their dissatisfaction with the new policy and tries to get the Government to change its mind. Examples could be lobbying, protesting, petitioning, etc. Voice options do not have immediate payoffs but are intended to give the Government a chance to Respond to the Citizen and revert the policy. In the event the Government does Respond, the payoff for the Citizen is the 1 the Government initially took minus the cost of using Voice. This cost is the variable c. If the Government chooses to Ignore then the Citizen can still Exit or remain Loyal. No matter what the Citizen chooses, they still have to bear the cost of using their Voice and so the payoff for Exit would be E - c and 0 - c for remaining Loyal. The Government would receive the payoff of L (the value of the Citizen's Loyalty) if they chose to Respond and revert the policy, 1 if they chose to Ignore and the Citizen Exits, and 1 + L if they Ignore and the Citizen chooses to remain Loyal.  Dependent/Autonomous Governments and Credible Exit Threats  Nash Equilibria for a Dependent Government (L > 1) and a Citizen with a Credible Exit Threat (E > 1). This is the only case where the Government chooses to Respond. In EVL, if the Government is dependent on the Loyalty of the Citizen then L > 1 and if the Government is autonomous, i.e. not dependent on the loyalty and support of the Citizen, L < 1. Examples of Government dependence could be elected officials being dependent on the support of their voters, business owners being dependent on their workers, governments being dependent on institutions for economic well-being, etc. An important note is that the value the Government places on the Loyalty from the Citizen is in relation to the benefit it took. Different Citizen players also have different possible Exit options. If the Citizens have a viable Exit option, sometimes called a credible Exit threat, then E > 0, and if the Citizen does not have any good or credible Exit options then E < 0\\\\. Along with this, the cost of using the Voice option changes depending on the Citizen player as well.  Different Outcomes  Nash Equilibria for when the Citizen has no Credible Exit Threat (E < 0). Notice that it does not matter whether the Government is Dependent or Autonomous (L can take any value). The EVL game is solved differently whether the Government is dependent or autonomous from the Citizen, whether the Citizen has or does not have a credible Exit option, and the cost of using Voice. Nash Equilibria for an Autonomous Government (L < 1) and a Citizen with no Credible Exit Threat (E < 0) EVL shows that the only time a Government will Respond to the Citizen using their Voice is when the Government is dependent on the support of the Citizen (L > 1) and when the Citizen has a credible Exit option (E > 0). With all other combinations of E and L the Government will choose to Ignore the Citizen if they decide to use their Voice and so the Citizen will choose to Exit or remain Loyal instead rather than bear the cost of using Voice. Although, if the cost of using Voice (c) becomes high enough (E > 1 - c) then even a dependent Government can prevent a Citizen with a credible exit threat from using their Voice. Depending on the values of E, L, and c for different Government and Citizen players, the Government will either enact or not enact the instigating policy. The EVL game is largely never played out in reality but is used to model why institutions and individuals with relationships like those in EVL behave the way they do. In reality the players typically do not have complete information Typically, the game can be assumed as having a precursory step in which the Government decides whether or not to implement the policy.  Applications  Many of the applications of this theory involve the different ways in which the extensive form game resolves when the values of E, L, and c are adjusted.  Dependent Government  When the Citizen has a viable Exit option and the Government is dependent on the Loyalty of the Citizen (i.e. E > 0, L > 1) the Government would not try to take away the benefit to begin with as the game would end with as it knew it would have to Respond. A parallel can be drawn to the structural dependence of the state on capital within Structural Marxism where the state is seen as being dependent on capital for its existence and the capitalists have viable Exit options through their easily mobile assets while labor does not. In cases where the Citizen has no viable Exit option and the Government is dependent on the Loyalty of the Citizen (i.e. E < 0, L > 1) the Citizen exercises Loyalty in the face of the environmental change. Real world examples can be drawn to the Financial crisis of 2007–2008 in the United States regarding the financial bailout of the financial and automobile sectors. Within a week of Lehman Brothers declaring bankruptcy the United States Treasury drafted the Troubled Asset Relief Program which planned to spend $700 billion to buy assets from struggling banks and was passed two weeks later. The then Treasury Secretary Paulson said \\"you won't leave this room until you agree to take this money\\" to the heads of the largest banks during a meeting in Washington D.C. Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler sent their chief executives to Congress to ask for a bailout of $25 billion from the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Members of Congress initially refused the bailout and mocked the executives having flown private jets to the meeting. They later returned having carpooled and were granted $13.4 billion. The automotive industry had to go through many more hurdles to receive any funds than members of the financial sector. The government and economy were dependent on the survival of both sectors but the difference in response to each facing financial trouble can be interpreted as a difference in Exit option between the two. The automotive sector has much less mobile assets as factories take much longer to move outside the country compared to financial institutions and so can be thought of as having a much weaker Exit option. Other examples include political parties who require the support of certain groups to get elected but those groups have no viable alternative for whom to vote for. In this scenario the political party assumes the role of the Government and the group is the Citizen. The Government is dependent on the Citizen but the Citizen is without a viable Exit option (i.e. L > 1, E < 0).  Protests  One of the most obvious ways Citizens can use Voice is by protesting. The EVL Model predicts that the Citizen will only use their Voice if they have a viable Exit option and the Government is dependent (E > 0, L > 1). However, if the Government knows the Citizen will use Voice and force it to respond and revert the change it made, the Government would not enact the change in the first place. The EVL Model explains that the only time protests or other forms of Voice would be observed is when the Government does not know whether the Citizen has a credible Exit option (i.e. the Government does not know E > 0) but knows it's dependent, or when the Citizen does not know that the Government is autonomous (i.e.the Citizen does not know L < 1).  Exit, Voice, Loyalty, Neglect Model = Exit  This includes leaving the organization, transferring to another work unit, or at least trying to get away from the unsatisfactory situation. The general theory is that job dissatisfaction builds over time and is eventually strong enough to motivate employees to search for better work opportunities elsewhere. This is likely true to some extent, but the most recent opinion is that specific 'shock events' quickly energize employees to think about and engage in exit behavior. For example, the emotion reaction you experience to an unfair management decision or a conflict episode with a co-worker motivates you to look at job ads and speak to friends about job opportunities where they work. This begins the process of realigning your self-concept more with another company than with your current employer. Voice Voice refers to any attempt to change, rather than escape from, the dissatisfying situation. Voice can be constructive response, such as recommending ways for management to improve the situation, or it can be more confrontational, such as by filing formal grievances. In the extreme, some employees might engage in counterproductive behaviors to get attention and force changes in the organization. Loyalty According to A. O. Hirschman, the author of Exit, Voice, and Loyalty, the loyalty of a member to the organization he belongs to is higher when the entrance costs (physical, moral, material, or cognitive) are higher. Loyalty would be characterized as passively waiting for conditions to improve. Neglect Neglect includes reducing work efforts, paying less attention to quality, and increasing absenteeism and lateness. It is generally considered a passive activity that has negative consequences for the organization. The Neglect response is passively allowing for conditions to worsen.

What could the world look like when you feel more empowered and are empowering others to share their gifts?\\"  Personal life  Gaidry was married twice. She was first married to the Filmmakers Alliance co-creator and director Jacques Thelemaque. Her second husband was Thomas K. Walker. She had two stepdaughters, Bella and Tess Walker, and one stepson, Ian Walker, via her second marriage.  Illness and death  Gaidry was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer, known as HER2-positive, in January 2018. She was determined to be \\"cancer free\\" in August 2018 only to have the cancer return and spread to her brain and other parts of her body. She used both holistic and traditional approaches to treatment. She noted, \\"I’ve learned a lot and in many ways, I’m grateful to the cancer for serving as such a powerful teacher. I’ve learned that regardless of whether or not something has been said a million times before, it has not been said from my perspective and voice. I’ve learned that there are no guarantees that I will have a voice tomorrow or next week or next year, so if I have something to say, I might want to do that today\\". She also stated, \\"If I hadn’t had the tools and the perspective from being a coach, I wouldn’t have seen this cancer as an opportunity and a gift. It’s not the most fun gift, but it has deepened my awareness and perspective that there’s possibilities in dark times. This journey has changed me forever, and I appreciate my life, the blessings, the people, and every moment now in a way that I couldn’t have before. It’s beautiful.” She died on January 30, 2019 at home surrounded by family and friends.

It is one of the Polish-American Roman Catholic parishes in New England in the Diocese of Bridgeport.  History  In 1899 Bishop of Hartford Michael Tierney, assigned Rev. Joseph Sulkowski to the newly formed Polish parish, consisting of approximately 1,000 Polish immigrants in Bridgeport's multi-ethnic East Side. The parish was organized in December 1899 and soon after an old Roman Catholic church on Crescent Avenue was purchased. What was once known as St. Mary's became the new St. Michael's. In 1890, Bishop Tierney transferred Father Sulkowski and assigned Rev. Witold Becker as pastor. Parishioners were disturbed about the transfer of their well-liked Polish priest and some reportedly left the church when Father Becker assumed his pastoral duties. Over time, Father Becker managed to establish a Sunday school and church societies, and brought back some who had left the parish. Father Becker died in 1906 and the parish was placed under the Conventual Franciscans of the Polish-American Province of St. Anthony and the Franciscans became responsible for finding new priests appropriate for the Polish American parish. Rev. Leon Wierzynski ministered to the parish from August to December 1906, when Rev. Felix Baran arrived to take over the parish. The parish members upset at once again losing a well-liked Polish priest demonstrated and even physically blocked the transfer. Police were called in to disperse the protesters and the church was locked to keep them out. Some of the dissatisfied parishioners left St. Michael's permanently, forming St. Joseph's Polish Parish under the Polish National Catholic Church in early 1907. Buildings In 1907, the present St. Michael the Archangel Roman Catholic Church was built on what is now known today as Pulaski Street. The architect for the church was George P. B. Alderman of Holyoke, Massachusetts who also designed Sacred Heart Church, New Britain, CT. In 1989, the church was closed for a period of time when Bishop Edward M. Egan called on police to evict dissident parishioners who had occupied the church for a week. About 200 parishioners had been protesting the transfer of a popular priest, Rev. Roman Palaszewski, brought from Poland three years earlier.

Choice of location The location may be chosen to fit the coverage area European Broadcasting Union:Technical Monogram No.3104-1965 Site selection (Edited by RK.H.Kaltbeitzer),Chapter I, Brussels and for VHF-UHF- applications line of sight considerations. For lower frequencies a location with good ground conductivity is required. In case of microwave link chains, stations should be in observable ranges of each other. (see Earth bulge) Computer programmes for the terrain profile and abacs are used in addition to on site observations. Avoidance of industrial noise is also taken into consideration. Another parameter may be the government regulations concerning public health requiring a minimum distance to human habitation. The distance depends on the power and the frequency of the transmitting signal. Low power stations may be in cities; higher power stations are always in rural areas. Most of the stations (especially high frequency stations) are located at high altitudes. So, both the minimum distance regulations and the line of sight criteria are met. Buildings and antenna masts Stations may be housed in several buildings or a single building. In some cases the station is nothing but a small container. They all have masts or towers to install antenna systems. In most cases, the mast is a passive structure to support the antennas. But in low frequency stations (such as AM radio), the mast itself may be the active antenna element. In such cases, the mast is isolated from the ground.(See Monopole antenna). If the mast itself is an active antenna element, the ground can be covered by a mesh of wires or metal elements to create a reflecting ground. Most of the stations also have facility to receive microwave signals from a microwave link or a telecommunications satellite, (TVRO or RRO). Most stations use mains electricity, but they also have standby generators or solar energy panels in case of failure. European Broadcasting Union:Technical Monogram No.3108-1967 High Altitude VHF and UHF Broadcast Stations (Edited by R.Busi),Chapter III, Brussels If the voltage of the mains fluctuates, a high power voltage regulator may be used. Grounding Like all industrial sites, the buildings, the antenna masts, the generators, and the transmitting equipment of the stations should be grounded for personal safety against electrical shocks. On the masts and roofs, lightning rods should be used. For transmitter stations working on frequencies below 30 MHz a good grounding is required for good function and sometimes excessive grounding systems are used. In most cases, it is desirable to connect the rods to each other to form a simple Faraday cage. But in high altitude stations, the ground is usually rocky and finding an appropriate point for the grounding bus may be impossible. In such cases, very long grounding connectors may be used to find a good ground at lower altitudes. Operation Transmitters may be operated by government (civil or military) or private industry. Many stations are unattended and controlled by remote control equipment. Where operating personnel are required, personnel work on shifts and transportation may also be a parameter of station design. In such cases, accommodation, catering and health problems also play a part in station management. Especially in high altitude stations, snowmobiles must be used during winter. Transmitting equipment Most AM radio transmitters are high-power equipment. Because of the relatively low frequency they use, they don't need to be located in high places. They may broadcast in LW (long wave), MW (medium wave) or SW (short wave). Since SW stations are assigned for very long distance communication (via reflections from atmospheric layers) they are usually employed for multi- language international services and there may be many SW transmitters in the same station. TV and FM (frequency modulated ) radio transmitter stations as well as transposer stations are almost always built on top of hills. A single station may have many transmitters both for TV and FM. In rare cases, each transmitter has an antenna system. But in stations where many transmitters are used, this is not always possible, so the outputs of transmitters transmitting in the same frequency band are combined by a diplexer and applied to a single antenna system. (i.e. VHF 1, VHF 2, VHF 3, UHF). If two or more antenna systems have to be used, higher frequency antennas are mounted higher on the antenna mast. (The sequence of antenna systems on a typical TV-FM station may be from bottom to top; VHF-2, VHF-3 and UHF.) Microwave stations are also high altitude stations. Although high altitude is desirable also in GSM, the operators may use low power intracity stations for areas of high population density.

Sul-luHasan Celāl Güzel, Cem Oğuz, Osman Karatay (ed.), The Turks: Middle Ages, Yeni Türkiye, 2002, or Sulu (?-738) was a Turkic tribe leader and a warlord who defended Transoxiana against Umayyad (Arab) Islamic armies in the early 8th century.  Background  The Türgesh was a Turkic tribe (or a group of tribes) around Transoxiana. Although their territory was a part of the First Turkic Khaganate, defeat of the Western Turkic Khaganate by Tang China in 658 resulted in the creation of puppet khaganates under the Jimi system. The Türgesh chieftains Wuzhile and Suoge were able to declare independence after the rebellion of Ashina Tuizi. However, after Ilterish Khagan re-established the Turkic Khaganate in 681, competition to control the Silk Road caused tension between the Khaganate and Türgesh khans. At the beginning of the 8th Century, the Türgesh were subjugated by the Turkic Khaganate, but this was not long lasting.  Early Reign  Suluk was a chor serving under Suoge before the Battle of Bolchu. After Suoge's defeat, Türgesh migrated to south of Zhetysu valley. During Qapaghan Qaghan's death and Kul Tegin's coup, they used the opportunity to reassert independence and chose Suluk, a Black Türgesh chieftain to be their supreme leader in 715 or 716.Zizhi Tongjian, vol 211 However as in Suoge's case, he was not acknowledged as a khagan by Tang. Ashina Xian was appointed \\"Shixing Qaghan\\" and Suluk was assigned as his subordinate general with titles \\"Great General of the Left Wing of the Forestial Army\\" (左羽林軍大將軍) and \\"Grand Military Commissioner of Jinfang\\" (經略大使金方) by Xuanzong.Saito, T. 1991, Rise of the Türgish and Tang's Abandonment of Suiye. Shiteki 12: 40–43 (in Japanese) However, this ended up causing a rift between the two, as Suluk defeated Xian on June or July of 717, besieging Aksu and Uch Turfan along the way. He declared himself as khagan during August or September. Xuanzong had to accept Suluk's independence and titled him as the Duke of Shunguo (順国公) in 718 and Zhongshun Khagan () in 719.Cefu Yuangui, vol 964, p. 11343  Struggle against Umayyads  With his eastern flank secured, beginning by 721, Suluk fought against the Arab armies for ten years. Backed by other local powers (including the Sogdians) against the invading Umayyads, his operations were generally hit and run operations and his maneuvers were aimed at the depriving the invading army of water. Although his army was much smaller than that of the Arabs, Suluk found success through his familiarity with the local area. Throughout the conflicts, the Arab army had to withdraw to find fresh water, such as in the Day of Thirst in 724 and the Battle of the Defile in 731. He was known by Arabs as Abū Muzāhim (\\"Father of the Competition\\").  Later reign  Suluk had a conflict with Du Xian in 726. When Princess Jiaohe, one of Suluk's wives, sent messengers and 1,000 horses to Du's headquarters to sell horses, the messengers read of an order from her, which Du responded by angrily stating, \\"How dare an Ashina woman issue me an order?\\". Du had the messengers caned and the horses detained. In late 726, after Du left his office, Suluk attacked Tarim Basin, causing much damage. Suluk only withdrew from the attack when he heard that Du had been made chancellor. On 27 October 735, Suluk attacked Beshbaliq, however his forces was crushed by Tang's armies. He was then forced to send his envoy Ulu Tarkhan (胡禄达干) to make peace. Another defeat at Battle of Kharistan in 737 sealed Suluk's fate. He was killed in 737 or 738 by Baga Tarkhan, one of his relatives.S.G.Klyashtorny-T.I.Sultanov: Türkün üç bin yılı (trans:Ahsen Batur), Selenge yayınları,İstanbul,2003, p 109Melek Tekin: Türk Tarihi, Milliyet yayınları, 1991, İstanbul  Aftermath  The death of Suluk caused a civil war, which divided the Türgesh into two rival factions: the Yellow Türgesh, who supported Baga Tarkhan and the Black Türgesh, who supported Kut Chor. Bilge Khagan, the last of the able Turkic khagans, was already dead and with the death of Suluk, Transoxiana was opened to Arabic conquest. Around this time there was a power shift in the Caliphate, as the Umayyad dynasty was supplanted by the Abbasid dynasty. The policy of the Abbasid Caliphs was more peaceful than that of the Umayyads and Arab control of Transoxiana was limited to the occupation of a few forts.

History New Fancy colliery was opened by Edward Protheroe in 1827, as part of the Park End Coal Company in the Forest of Dean. By 1860 it was owned by Sully & Company and in 1885 was sold to the Parkend & New Fancy Collieries Company. It remained in operation until 1944. In 1880 the colliery produced 8,382 tons of coal. In 1900 the colliery site contained a wooden headframe, a Cornish-type engine house with an external egg-ended boiler built in the 1840s and a hand-operated windlass for raising and lowering items in the shaft. The winding gear was converted to electricity in 1916. Its site is a scheduled monument. Bird watching The top of the old coal mine spoil heap has been converted into a viewing site for birdwatchers, and gives panoramas over an extensive forested area. It is best known for viewing raptors, especially goshawks, best seen from late morning onwards in February and March.The Gloster Birder In February 1998, a female two-barred crossbill was present in a crossbill flock, drawing birdwatchers from across Britain. Sculpture The Roll of Honour sculpture was commissioned by the Forest of Dean Local History Society to honour those who worked and were killed or injured in the mines and quarries of the Forest of Dean. It was constructed by Graham Tyler and John Wakefield and was unveiled in 2005. It consists of three elements - stone, iron (represented by rusted steel), and coal (represented by carved and blackened local oak) - and stands around high. Stainless steel discs set into the sculpture represent the tokens carried by miners to determine who was below ground in the event of accidents. The Forest of Dean Geomap, a sculpture of the geology and mines of the area, was unveiled at the New Fancy picnic site in May 2008. It was commissioned by the local history society, who received a grant from DEFRA’s Aggregates Levy Sustainability Fund, and was constructed by sculptor David Yeates of Mitcheldean before being assembled on site. The rock strata depicted are built from samples of the rock they represent.

He served as President of the Central Bank between 2004 and 2010. Early life and career Born Hernán Martín Pérez Redrado in Buenos Aires in 1961, he enrolled at the University of Buenos Aires and received a degree in Economics. He joined U.S. economist Jeffrey Sachs as part of his advisory board, which had been invited by Bolivian President Víctor Paz Estenssoro in 1985 to implement a restructuring of the Bolivian economy, then in crisis.Econlink: Martín Redrado He earned a Master's Degree in Public Administration from Harvard University, and was brought on by the Wall Street investment firm Salomon Brothers, where he served as adviser on their handling of the privatizations of British Airways, British Gas plc and the French Compagnie Financière de Suez, during the late 1980s. He worked for Los Angeles-based Security Pacific Bank until 1991, in which capacity he oversaw the profit sharing plan for Enersis employees, and advised on the privatization of Telmex. Returning to Argentina in 1991, Redrado was appointed President of the National Securities Commission (CNV) by Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo, who had just implemented his Convertibility Plan and a far- reaching deregulation program. Coupled with the 1990 launch of an ambitious privatization policy by President Carlos Menem, these measures found Redrado overseeing a Buenos Aires Stock Exchange whose daily trading volume had risen around 20-fold within months.Argentina: From Insolvency to Growth. World Bank Press, 1993. His tenure earned him the designation as Emerging Markets Committee President of the International Organization of Securities Commissions, in 1992. Differences with Cavallo over the 1993 privatization of the state oil concern, YPF, whose handling by Merrill Lynch and First Boston Redrado termed a \\"rip-off,\\" led to his removal from the CNV in March 1994, however, and he established Fundación Capital, a think tank.El Cronista: El futuro presidente del BCRA (September 2004) Redrado was selected as one of the \\"100 Leaders for the Next Millennium\\" by Time Magazine's International Edition in 1995, and he returned to public service as Secretary of Technological Education (a sub-cabinet-level post), in 1996. He was asked to run for a seat in the newly created Buenos Aires City Legislature in 1997, but was unsuccessful,Clarín (8/21/1997) and he left the secretariat in 1998 to lead Trident Investment Group, a local venture capital firm specializing in health care. The advent of the dot-com boom led Redrado to launch of InvertirOnline.com (only the third electronic trading platform in Argentina) in June 2000; the fledgling firm prospered despite the ensuing local financial crisis, and handled over 20,000 accounts by 2003. Redrado was named Secretary of Commerce (sub-cabinet) by President Eduardo Duhalde in 2002, and he was retained in the post by Duhalde's successor, President Néstor Kirchner. Redrado has also had three books published on the subject of contemporary economics: Tiempos de desafíos (Challenging Times, 1995),Cómo sobrevivir a la globalización (How to Survive Globalization, 1999), and Exportar para crecer (Exporting for Growth, 2003). Central Bank presidency Kirchner appointed Redrado President of the Central Bank of Argentina on September 24, 2004. The new central banker implemented the administration's policy of keeping a relatively undervalued Argentine peso to help bolster export competitiveness, while foreign exchange reserves soared to nearly US$50 billion.Banco Central de la República Argentina Confirmed by President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner upon her December 10, 2007, inaugural, Redrado, by 2009, had become the third-longest serving Argentine Central Bank President since the institution's formal establishment in 1935. Fallout from the international, 2008 financial crisis later forced the Argentine government to seek domestic financing for growing public spending, as well as for foreign debt service obligations. The president ordered a US$6.7 billion account opened at the Central Bank for the latter purpose in December 2009, implying the use of foreign exchange reserves, and drawing direct opposition from Redrado. Following an impasse, he was dismissed by presidential decree on January 7, 2010, prior to which Economy Minister Amado Boudou had announced that Mario Blejer (who had expressed support for the measure) would be appointed in his stead.Clarín (1/7/2010) Removal and controversy Central Bank Vice President Miguel Ángel Pesce became the institution's interim head. Redrado's removal, however, triggered a vocal rebuke from opposition figures in Congress, who, citing the need to preserve the Central Bank's nominal independence, expressed doubts as to the decree's legality.La Nación (1/7/2010) Redrado refused to abide by the initial decree removing him from the presidency of the Central Bank, and petitioned for a judicial power to keep him in office, at least until the Congress decides on the issue. Accordingly, the president enacted another decree for his dismissal. The legitimacy of this new decree was questioned as well, however, on the grounds of the aforementioned independence of the Central Bank, and for the lack of a prerequisite impeachment trial. Congress was at a recess period at the time, but most of its members considered returning to override the decrees through an extraordinary session. The legitimacy of President Cristina Kirchner's policy decision to set aside a portion of the Central Bank's reserves through a Necessity and Urgency Decree was itself questioned by several opposition figures, who argued that the reserves can be only used to keep the value of currency and not for commercial purposes, that the Central Bank is independent, and that only Congress can bypass it through a law. The decree, moreover, may not meet a threshold of \\"necessity\\" and \\"urgency\\" required by the Constitution of Argentina for its enactment. Judge María José Sarmiento handed down a ruling preventing said use of reserves. The ruling did not decide on the constitutional legitimacy of the decree itself, but instead placed the measure on hold until Congress can legislate on the issue; the Government reacted by appealing the ruling.La Nación: La Casa Rosada confirma que apelará el fallo que frena el uso de reservas Judge Sarmiento then annulled the decree that removed Redrado and reinstated him as President of the Central Bank the following day, due to the lack of a Congressional bill mandating his removal (which is a step required by the laws that govern the Central Bank). The ruling also refuted claims of mis-conduct cited by President Cristina Kirchner to justify his removal.Redrado volvió al Banco Central Following an appeals court ruling on January 22, however, Redrado was suspended, and Central Bank Vice President Miguel Ángel Pesce named in his stead on a provisional basis; though the injunction against the proposed use of reserves was upheld, Redrado's suspension stood pending a resolution on the matter from a committee in Congress.Clarín: \\"Redrado no entra más al Banco Central\\" The impasse prompted Redrado to resign on January 30, and he was ultimately replaced by Mercedes Marcó del Pont, President of the National Bank, on February 3.Télam References Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:Argentine people of Spanish descent Category:People from Buenos Aires Category:Argentine economists Category:Argentine bankers Category:University of Buenos Aires alumni Category:John F.

The St. Mary of Czestochowa Church is a church building at 79 South Main Street in Middletown. The parish was founded in 1903. It is one of the Polish-American Roman Catholic parishes in New England in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Norwich.  History  With 300 Polish families resident in the city, Middletown’s Poles had determined to build a church of their own in 1902. A small group planned the organization of the St. Mary of Czestochowa parish, which gained formal approval from the bishop. The Saint Kazimierz order of Polish Lancers (an organization which took its name and traditions from the Polish Uhlans) was a local organization that was founded in 1902 and existed until 1940, when it merged into another organization. It \\"was instrumental\\" in the founding of the church. On February 28, 2010, the church held a memorial mass for victims of a local disaster, the Kleen Energy plant explosion.http://articles.courant.com/2010-02-28/community/hc-middletown- memorial-service.artfeb28_1_middletown-plant-explosion-ronald-crabb- middletown-common-council  Church buildings After the founding of the parish in 1903, a church was opened in a building on Hubbard St. in 1905. That building served as the church until 1907, after which it was used as a school. A more substantial and \\"beautiful\\" church building, with stained glass windows, was built next door and served the parish for many years, but was destroyed by fire in 1980. A convent building also existed but was demolished in 1979. The church is located at 79 South Main Street.  Calvary Cemetery The Parish owns and maintains Calvary Cemetery which is located at 305 Bow Lane in Middletown.  School  The Saint Mary of Czestochowa School, at 87 South Main Street, is a K-8 elementary school with pre- schoolhttp://www.stmarymiddletown.com/faqs/ founded in 1912. The current building was constructed in 1930http://www.stmarymiddletown.com/past-present- and-future/ It was listed in an inventory of buildings of Middletown by the Greater Middletown Preservation Trust in 1979.http://www.middletownplanning.com/Committees/DRPB/historicpropertieslist.html Architecturally, the school is a brick, two-story, Renaissance Revival building with some Art Deco details. In 2013, St. Mary of Czestochowa School merged with Saint John School, another local parochial elementary school, to become Saint Pope John Paul II Regional Diocesan Elementary School.

The term \\"narcissism\\" is derived from the Greek mythology of Narcissus, but was only coined at the close of the nineteenth century. Since then, narcissism has become a household word; in analytic literature, given the great preoccupation with the subject, the term is used more than almost any other'.Neville Symington, Narcissism: A New Theory (London 1990) p. 5 The meaning of narcissism has changed over time. Today narcissism \\"refers to an interest in or concern with the self along a broad continuum, from healthy to pathological ... including such concepts as self-esteem, self-system, and self-representation, and true or false self\\". Before Freud Narcissus was a handsome Greek youth who rejected the desperate advances of the nymph Echo. As punishment, he was doomed to fall in love with his own reflection in a pool of water. Unable to consummate his love, Narcissus 'lay gazing enraptured into the pool, hour after hour',Robert Graves, in Symington, p. 7 and finally pined away, changing into a flower that bears his name, the narcissus. The story was retold in Latin by Ovid in his Metamorphoses, in which form it would have great influence on medieval and Renaissance culture. 'Ovid's tale of Echo and Narcissus...weaves in and out of most of the English examples of the Ovidian narrative poem';Colin Burrow ed., William Shakespeare: The Complete Sonnets and Poems (Oxford 2002) p. 19 and 'allusions to the story of Narcissus...play a large part in the poetics of the Sonnets'Burrow ed., p. 127 of Shakespeare. Here the term used was 'self-love...Feed'st thy light's flame with self- substantial fuel'.Burrow ed., pp. 387 and 383 Francis Bacon used the same term: 'it is the nature of extreme self-lovers, as they will set a house on fire, and it were but to roast their eggs...those that (as Cicero says of Pompey) are sui amantes sine rivali...lovers of themselves without rivals'.Francis Bacon, The Essays (Penguin 1985) p. 131 Byron at the start of the nineteenth century used the same term, describing how, \\"Self-love for ever creeps out, like a snake, to sting anything which happens...to stumble on it.\\"Quoted in Simon Crompton, All about Me (London 2007) p. 87 while Baudelaire wrote of 'as vigorous a growth in the heart of natural man as self- love', as well as of those who 'like Narcissuses of fat-headedness...are contemplating the crowd, as though it were a river, offering them their own image'.Charles Baudelaire, The Painter of Modern Life (Penguin) p. 49 and p. 109 By mid-century, however, egotism was perhaps an equally common expression for self-absorption—'egotists...made acutely conscious of a self, by the torture in which it dwells'Malcolm Cowley ed., The Portable Hawthorne —though still with 'curious suggestions of the Narcissus legend'Cowley ed., \\"Editor's Introduction\\" p. 9 in the background. At the century's close, the term as we now know it finally emerged, with Havelock Ellis, the English sexologist, writing a short paper in 1927 on its coining, in which he 'argued that the priority should in fact be divided between himself and Paul Näcke, explaining that the term \\"narcissus-like\\" had been used by him in 1898 as a description of a psychological attitude, and that Näcke in 1899 had introduced the term Narcismus to describe a sexual perversion'.Editor Note, Sigmund Freud, On Metapsychology (PFL 11) p. 65n1 The twentieth century has largely defined the concept in psychological terms, with Otto Rank publishing in 1911 the first psychoanalytical paper specifically concerned with narcissism, linking it to vanity and self-admiration.Millon, Theodore, Personality Disorders in Modern Life, 2004 Sigmund Freud Sigmund Freud, by Max Halberstadt, 1914 Ernest Jones tells us that 'at a meeting of the Vienna Psycho-Analytical Society on 10 November 1909 Freud had declared that narcissism was a necessary intermediate stage between auto-erotism and object-love'.Angela Richards, \\"Editor's Note\\", Sigmund Freud, On Metapsychology (PFL 110 pp. 61-2 The following year in his \\"Leonardo\\" he described publicly for the first time how 'the growing youngster...finds his love objects on the path of narcissism, since Greek myths call a youth Narcissus, whom nothing pleased so much as his own mirror image'.Quoted in Peter Gay, Freud; A Life for Our Time (London 1989) p. 272 Although Freud only published a single paper exclusively devoted to narcissism called On Narcissism: An Introduction,Freud, Sigmund, On Narcissism: An Introduction, 1914 in 1914, 'Narcissism was soon to take a central place in his thinking'.Gay, p. 272  Primary narcissism  Freud suggested that exclusive self-love might not be as abnormal as previously thought and might even be a common component in the human psyche. He argued that narcissism \\"is the libidinal complement to the egoism of the instinct of self-preservation,\\" or, more simply, the desire and energy that drives one’s instinct to survive. He referred to this as primary narcissism. According to Freud, people are born without a sense of themselves as individuals, or ego. The ego develops during infancy and the early part of childhood, only when the outside world, usually in the form of parental controls and expectations, intrudes upon primary narcissism, teaching the individual about the nature and standards of his social environment from which he can form the ideal ego, an image of the perfect self towards which the ego should aspire. 'As it evolved, the ego distanced itself from primary narcissism, formed an ego-ideal, and proceeded to cathect objects'.Michel Vincent, \\"Narcissism, Primary\\" Freud regarded all libidinous drives as fundamentally sexual and suggested that ego libido (libido directed inwards to the self) cannot always be clearly distinguished from object-libido (libido directed to persons or objects outside oneself). An aspect frequently associated with primary narcissism appears in an earlier essay, 'Totem and Taboo,'Freud, Sigmund, Totem and Taboo, 1913 in which Freud describes his observations of children and primitive people. What he observed was called magical thinking, such as the belief that a person can impact reality by wishing or willpower. It demonstrates a belief in the self as powerful and able to change external realities, which Freud believed was part of normal human development.  Secondary narcissism  According to Freud, secondary narcissism occurs when the libido withdraws from objects outside the self, above all the mother, producing a relationship to social reality that includes the potential for megalomania. 'This megalomania has no doubt come into being at the expense of object-libido....This leads us to look upon the narcissism which arises through the drawing on of object-cathexes as a secondary one, superimposed upon a primary narcissism'.Freud, On Metapsychology p. 67 For Freud, while both primary and secondary narcissism emerge in normal human development, problems in the transition from one to the other can lead to pathological narcissistic disorders in adulthood. \\"This state of secondary narcissism constituted object relations of the narcissistic type\\", according to Freud, something he went on to explore further in Mourning and Melancholia—considered one of Freud's most profound contributions to object relations theory, and constituting the overall principles of object relations and narcissism as concepts.James S. Grotstein, \\"Foreword\\", Symington, pp. x-xi  Narcissism, relationships and self-worth  According to Freud, to care for someone is to convert ego-libido into object-libido by giving some self-love to another person, which leaves less ego-libido available for primary narcissism and protecting and nurturing the self. When that affection is returned so is the libido, thus restoring primary narcissism and self-worth. Any failure to achieve, or disruption of, this balance causes psychological disturbances. In such a case, primary narcissism can be restored only by withdrawing object- libido (also called object-love) to replenish ego-libido. According to Freud, as a child grows, and his ego develops, he is constantly giving of his self- love to people and objects, the first of which is usually his mother. This diminished self-love should be replenished by the affection and caring returned to him. Karen Horney Karen HorneyKaren Horney saw narcissism quite differently from Freud, Kohut and other mainstream psychoanalytic theorists in that she did not posit a primary narcissism but saw the narcissistic personality as the product of a certain kind of early environment acting on a certain kind of temperament. For her, narcissistic needs and tendencies are not inherent in human nature. Narcissism is different from Horney's other major defensive strategies or solutions in that it is not compensatory. Self-idealization is compensatory in her theory, but it differs from narcissism. All the defensive strategies involve self-idealization, but in the narcissistic solution it tends to be the product of indulgence rather than of deprivation. The narcissist's self-esteem is not strong, however, because it is not based on genuine accomplishments.Paris, Bernard J, Personality and Personal Growth, edited by Robert Frager and James Fadiman, 1998 Heinz Kohut Heinz Kohut explored further the implications of Freud's perception of narcissism. He maintained that a child will tend to fantasize about having a grandiose self and ideal parents. He claimed that deep down, all people retain a belief in their own perfection and the perfection of anything they are part of. As a person matures, grandiosity gives way to self- esteem, and the idealization of the parent becomes the framework for core values. It is when psychological trauma disrupts this process that the most primitive and narcissistic version of the self remains unchanged. Kohut called such conditions narcissistic personality disorder, 'in which the merging with and detaching from an archaic self-object play the central role...narcissistic union with the idealized self-object'.Heinz Kohut, The Analysis of the Self (Madison 1971) p. 282 and pp. 97-8 Kohut suggested narcissism as part of a stage in normal development, in which caregivers provide a strong and protective presence with which the child can identify that reinforces the child's growing sense of self by mirroring his good qualities. If the caregivers fail to provide adequately for their child, the child grows up with a brittle and flawed sense of self.Kohut, Heinz, The Analysis of the Self, 1971 'Kohut's innovative pronouncement...became a veritable manifesto in the United States....The age of \\"normal narcissism\\" had arrived'James L. Grotstein, \\"Foreword\\", in Symington, p. xiii Kohut also saw beyond the negative and pathological aspects of narcissism, believing it is a component in the development of resilience, ideals and ambition once it has been transformed by life experiences or analysisKohut, Heinz, Forms and Transformations of Narcissism, 1966—though critics objected that his theory of how 'we become attached to ideals and values, instead of to our own archaic selves...fits the individual who escapes from bad inner negativity into idealized objects outside'.Symington, pp. 108-9 Otto Kernberg Otto F. Kernberg. Otto Kernberg uses the term narcissism to refer to the role of self in the regulation of self-esteem. He believed normal, infantile narcissism depends on the affirmation of others and the acquisition of desirable and appealing objects, which should later develop into healthy, mature self- esteem. This healthy narcissism depends upon an integrated sense of self that incorporates images of the internalized affirmation of those close to the person and is regulated by the super ego and ego ideal, internal mental structures that assure the person of his worth and that he deserves his own respect. The failure of infantile narcissism to develop in this healthy adult form becomes a pathology.Siniscalco, Raffaele Narcissism. The American Contribution – A Conversation with Otto Kernberg Journal of European Psychoanalysis, Number 12–13, Winter–Fall 2001 Object relations theory 'Melanie Klein's...descriptions of infantile omnipotence and megalomania provided important insights for the clinical understanding of narcissistic states. In 1963, writing on the psychopathology of narcissism, Herbert Rosenfeld was especially concerned to arrive at a better definition of object- relationships and their attendant defense mechanisms in narcissism'.Michel Vincent, \\"Narcissism\\" D. W. Winnicott's 'brilliant observations of the mother- child couple [also] throw considerable light on primary narcissism, which in the young child can be viewed as the extension of the mother's narcissism. French connections Lacan—building on Freud's dictum that 'all narcissistic impulses operate from the ego and have their permanent seat in the ego'Sigmund Freud, Case Studies II (PFL 9) p. 353—used his own concept of the mirror stage to explore the narcissistic ego in terms of 'the essential structure it derives from its reference to the specular image...narcissism',Jacques Lacan, The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis (London 1994) p. 74 in his battle against ego psychology. 'Béla Grunberger drew attention to a double orientation of narcissism—as both a need for self-affirmation and a tendency to restore permanent dependency. The active presence of narcissism throughout life led Grunberger to suggest treating it as an autonomous factor (1971)'. 'Under the evocative title Life Narcissism, Death Narcissism (1983), André Green clarified the conflict surrounding the object of narcissism (whether a fantasy object or a real object) in its relationship to the ego. For Green, it was because narcissism affords the ego a certain degree of independence...that a lethal kind of narcissism must be considered, for the object is destroyed at the beginning of this process'; while in a further analysis, 'Green evokes physical narcissism, intellectual narcissism, and moral narcissism'—a set of divisions sometimes simplified into that between 'somatic narcissists who are obsessed with the body...[&] cerebral narcissists—people who build up their sense of magnificence out of an innate feeling of intellectual superiority'.Crompton, pp. 28-9 Modern diagnosis Narcissistic personality disorder is a condition defined in DSM-IV, but a proposal has been made to remove it from the next edition, DSM-5, instead submerging it as a facet of the antagonism personality type domain.Narcissistic Personality DisorderAntagonism Online usage The success of the term narcissism has led to something of an \\"inflation of meanings....Some in fact exploited it as a handy term of abuse for modern culture or as a loose synonym for bloated self- esteem.\\"Gay, p. 340 See alsoReferencesFurther reading * Bela Grunberger, Narcissism: Psychoanalytic Essays (New York 1971) * J.

Although it is a roofless ruin, it is remarkably complete, and is described by Historic Environment Scotland (HES) as second only to St Magnus Cathedral, Kirkwall, as a surviving Norse church in Scotland. The Orkneyinga saga records that around 1116, Magnus Erlendsson, Earl of Orkney, travelled to the island to resolve a dispute with his rival, Earl Haakon, but Magnus was murdered. In 1136 Bishop William of Orkney sanctified the murdered Earl, who became Saint Magnus, and it is thought that the church was constructed shortly afterwards on the supposed site of the murder. There may have been an earlier church at or near the site before the murder of Magnus. Looking across from the nearby island of Rousay, St Magnus Church strands prominently on the skyline of Egilsay. The bell-tower at the west end of the church forms a prominent landmark, and was originally over high. This five-storey round tower is similar to other church towers in Germany and around the North Sea, and still stands about tall. A door leads from the tower to the central nave of the church which has external doors to the north and south. The chancel at the east end of the church opens directly from the nave, and housed the altar. It has a barrel-vaulted ceiling under a large upper chamber which could have contained a treasury and sacristy. Both the nave and the chancel originally had steeply pitched roofs. It is maintained by Historic Scotland as a scheduled ancient monument.

Andrew was commissioned in December 2002 to write the history for MI5's 100th anniversary in 2009, and was given \\"virtually unrestricted access\\" to much of MI5's files, as well as \\"no restriction\\" on whatever conclusions he decided to draw from them. The book reported, amongst other things, that MI5 kept a file (under a pseudonym) on Prime Minister Harold Wilson (as revealed by Peter Wright decades before in Spycatcher), as well as noting how many of Wilson's MP's were spying for the Soviet bloc. The book's title was derived from MI5's Latin motto, Regnum Defende. Historian Keith Jeffery was commissioned to write a similar authorised history on the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) for release in 2010. Reception The book received generally positive reviews from major newspapers. The Daily Telegraph called it \\"magisterial, authoritative, balanced, readable ... full of wry humour and with an eye for the absurd\\", declaring that \\"MI5 could not have wanted a better historian than him. This book is unlikely to be surpassed for another 100 years\\". More tempered praise came from The Sunday Times, where Max Hastings found the account \\"weighty, measured and compelling\\", regretting only a bit of occasional overenthusiasm on the part of the author and a lack of reflection on \\"the relationship between the service, ministers and the public\\". Ben Macintyre reviewed Defend the Realm for The New York Times Book Review, calling it \\"not only a work of meticulous scholarship but also a series of riveting and true spy stories\\", though recognising that such an account on a secretive organisation will necessarily be incomplete in certain areas. The Los Angeles Times found it \\"as complete and thorough as such a history may be and as engrossing as any spy novel\\". The book was criticised in Quadrant magazine in an article by Paul Monk for almost non-existent use of meaningful citation, bias in favour of MI5's \\"official\\" line, and for glossing over the issue of whether Roger Hollis was a Soviet agent.Quadrant Online April 2010 Volume LIV Number 4 \\"Christopher Andrew and the Strange Case of Roger Hollis\\" Editions=United Kingdom * (hardcover) * (paperback) United States * (hardcover) * (paperback) ReferencesExternal links *Audio summary by John Crace Category:2009 non-fiction books Category:MI5 Category:Books about intelligence agencies Category:History books about the United Kingdom ","title":"The Defence of the Realm"},{"id":"24582012","text":"Avatha sumatrana Poole, R.

Founded in 1905, it is one of the Polish-American Roman Catholic parishes in New England in the Diocese of Providence.  History  In 1905, the Bishop of the Diocese of Providence Matthew Harkins sent Father Francis Kluger to organize the parish. On October 22, 1905, Fr. Francis Kluger began celebrating Mass in the basement of St. John's Church. The first pastor, Fr. John M. Nowicki arrived in Quidnick on November 2, 1906. The Gothic style edifice of the church with a seating capacity of 400 was completed in the spring of 1907. As an expression of their great love and devotion to the Mother of God, the Polish immigrants named the church Our Lady of Czestochowa, in honor of Mary's most famous shrine in Poland. The church was blessed and dedicated by Bishop Harkins on April 21, 1907. Fr. Franciszek Chalupka of Webster, Massachusetts, was also present at this solemn occasion.  Pastors  * Rev. John M. NowickiFr. John M. Nowicki publicly he was known as Fr. John Marianski. It is conjectured that he changed his name to conceal his identity lest he be traced down by the Russians. Fr. John M. Nowicki was on the Czars black list and was afraid to return to Poland after he completed his studies in Louvain, Belgium. Therefore, when offered an opportunity to come to the United States, Father John M. Nowicki gladly accepted Bishop Matthew Harkins' invitation. (1905-1907) * Rev. Michael DutkiewiczRev.
